<START> let me first state that i rarely review movies i only comment if i'm blown away or disappointed in something that i thought was going to be good killshot was a major disappointment on so many levels the script was horrible the acting was sub par coming from heavy weights like rourke and lane and the editing and effects were comical blowing up cars etc etc rosario dawson had a horrible role i can't believe would even accept it it was such a misuse of her talent i can't even put into words i should have know after i saw the trailer for this movie 3 years ago and it kept being put on the that their was a serious problem with this film b movie all the way don't bother unless your really bored
<START> recently i saw this movie again after 25 years in the original there is a scene in the bathroom of an airplane during the landing between jacqueline character and michael character the rented version did not have this scene in it did i imagine this br br or is this part of the clean up of movies where some are altered to exclude portions some people think are not appropriate br br i love this movie it is exactly like the friendship between a friend and i and we've been friends for 25 years and saw it together her husband thought it was us as well br br thank you joan
<START> this is possibility the worst and most disappointing film i have ever seen i've spent four years at two universities and know that there must be a good film to be made about the experience this isn't it the acting is god awful and the plot non existent br br here are a few incidents from my one year in halls of residence br br 1 a posh lad that unknowingly got off with a transvestite 2 the best friend pairing of two girls one with huge breasts and the other with the nickname the brick 3 a couple that shag too loudly 4 the lad who gets all the girls 5 the lad from northern ireland who is very difficult to understand 6 mcdonalds in bed 7 curry every night for a week 8 student bashing couple of my mates ended up in hospital 9 the discarded joint that started a fire 10 the flood 11 the lad who wakes up on his floor to find that every item of furniture has be taken from his room br br and if i can come up with that list in 5 minutes and from real life i'm sure a couple of script writers can do better a lot better br br and for a film named after a sleeper song where is the britpop soundtrack
<START> upon renting this i wasn't expecting to be blown away in fact i knew it was going to be horrible it was just seeing how horrible it really was that's what comes with low budget horror br br snakes on a train not to be confused with the serpentine summer blockbuster snakes on a plane with samuel l jackson is about a woman who is put under a mayan curse that causes snakes to hatch inside her and devour her from within her only hope of surviving lies in a shaman that lives across the border so she and her companion stowaway onto a train bound for los throw in a few passengers and hilarity ensues br br come to think of it though the story isn't half bad isn't half good either br br the acting in this film rivals that of a sci fi original if not worse trust me it's horrible the snakes were another problem they were supposed to be i guess but most of what you get instead are mostly harmless garden snakes that don't attack anything and there's this rattling sound effect that gets really annoying br br the gore effects on the other hand while not on the tom savini level were actually pretty good br br and another thing the ending alone makes up for the rest of the movie i'm not going to talk about it here so you'll have to rent this and see for yourself
<START> in a sport that prizes quirkiness and treasures it's characters one of the greatest of them from the 1930s was pitcher dizzy dean he was so colorful a personality he was probably elected to the baseball hall of fame on the strength of that as opposed to his pitching statistics after all part of the dean story is that early end to his career br br in the pride of st louis dan dailey successfully captures the character of dizzy dean at least the dean i remember i'm not old enough to remember him pitching but i do remember him broadcasting baseball game of the week during the 1960s for that's part of the dean story as well being a pioneer broadcaster on radio and later television now that announcers are in the hall of fame there's no question dizzy belongs there br br jerome herman dean was one of a tribe of kids who had very little schooling but an amazing talent for throwing a baseball at blinding speed in fact he had a younger brother paul dean who was a pretty good pitcher himself br br richard crenna plays paul in this film and it's one of his earliest film roles paul dean in real life was a quiet retiring sort who's career was also cut short by injuries because of that crenna isn't given much to work with during the dean heyday tried to pin the nickname of daffy on paul but it never took br br joanne dru taking a break from playing western gals in dresses and corsets is first rate as the wise patient and understanding patricia nash who met and married dizzy while he was playing for houston in the texas league br br in the 1937 all star game dizzy started for the national league facing cleveland's earl dean was hit on the foot by a line drive smack at him refusing to listen to medical advice dean came back to pitch too early he'd broken a big toe and put too much of a strain on his arm he was never the same pitcher and his refusal to accept that is part of the story br br had he had a career of say ten to fifteen years who knows what pitching statistics he might have rolled up dean was the next to last pitcher to win 30 games in 1934 and after denny who was something of a character himself did it 1968 it hasn't been done since br br dean went into broadcasting and while he was not the first former player to go into the broadcast booth his colorful game descriptions made him an instant hit he started broadcasting for the other st louis team the browns and the browns were a pretty miserable team with not much to cheer about dean became a star attraction there br br of course part of the dean story is the trouble he got into because of his lack of education and his colorful way of expressing himself on the air that's part of the story i won't go into but in the film it's handled with tact and humility and your eyes might if you tend to the sentimental br br a fine baseball film a real tribute to an american success story
<START> i liked this movie a lot but the feeling that i most came away with was the memory of how much iÂ´d enjoyed the novel the film features two of the best actresses working today jessica lange who is great here and the divine jennifer jason leigh who does the best she can with the thinly drawn character she is given as well as a surprisingly excellent michelle pfeiffer and a steady jason robards the adaptation is basically faithful to the book at least as faithful as it can be in an hour and forty minutes the film doesnÂ´t really dazzle except for certain scenes between lange and pfeiffer but it does a thoroughly competent job of visualizing this wonderfully tragic story as far as movies adapted from novels go this was definitely among the better ones if nothing else it has sent me back to my to rediscover favorite passages from jane excellent novel and back to king lear to brush up on the minor characters in order to see just how deep the parallels go worth your time as a film definitely and hopefully enough to make you remember that reading great literature is a joy as well
<START> what an absolute joke of a movie the case for this film would have you believe it is duel meets jeepers creepers meets texas chainsaw massacre three good films in their own right and you would think using their blueprint mm couldn't go far wrong well that's what i thought and i was very very mistaken br br we follow two college students as they travel miles across the desert to reach a wedding they pick up a girl no she doesn't get her clothes off then they get chased by a leatherface rip off in a monster truck whom they aptly name f aka monster man br br the monster truck i will admit is a very cool vehicle but the less than suspenseful chase scenes ruin it's potential br br so mm decides he's got a bit of a grudge against these guys and chases them for a bit they loose him for a while and stop at a bar full of amputees then they go to a motel where lead character adam sleeps with hitch hiker sarah though they both wear underwear then they are caught by mm taken to his home where they escape death and try to kill mm but fail hence the set up for the sequel apart from a minor 'twist' that's it br br if you can get past the first 2 minutes Â where adam's friend harley pops up from hiding in the back of adam's car to try to scare him with no explanation as to how harley even got there how long ago or how adam even failed to realise Â without thinking you hate it already then you may just enjoy this film br br monster man has very poor cinematography and direction which is immediately off putting this is the kind of movie that you'll be able to pick up as one of those films in a box set of 20 horror movies that you've never heard of br br what is so irritating is blockbuster stock so many of these poor quality films that are shot on digital by some amateur film students and that's exactly what mm is though imdb states this particular director was born in 1961 br br the acting throughout this film is atrocious the script which the writer obviously considered to be funny is irritating and childish you get the impression only one draft was written before they started shooting in fact the script is do dire a lot of the film seems improvised full of those boring un entertaining conversations that are only funny or important to the actual people involved imagine you filmed yourself and your buddies having a conversation sure points are funny Â to you but mostly it's trash that's what the script for mm is like br br don't watch it for the gore either Â it's fairly minimal and there are much better gory films out there bad taste evil dead et br br jeepers creepers 1 2 even with their cheesiness and plot holes are far superior to this film compare the intro of jeepers creepers to the intro of monster man and you'll see what i mean
<START> it is fantastic a sick and twisted tale of coincidence and deceit br br the story is meticulously and ingeniously constructed it is really a perfect mixture it has all from suspense to humor and the story is told with lots of originality the film is built up like a puzzle which is assembled piece by piece and resolves the story for the viewer there are plenty of surprises till the end i also had a little impression that the director has been inspired by some hitchcock work i've also seen films before where you see the same event happening from different points of view but this film goes beyond that in this movie everything is built upon what happens to a body that appears and disappears and appears again in a different location every actor in the story has his own secret and we come to realize it in a way that contributes to assembling the puzzle i loved especially the dark humor scenes which made laugh the whole theater this movie is a must see for everyone
<START> the combination of dan haggerty elves and linda blair exorcist is enough to make any horror fan excited about this movie and once you see the cover art to this film of a frozen zombie coming out of their chamber you'll think you were in b movie horror heaven at least that's the way i approached this film but boy was i in for a shock br br i love horror movies i love b movies as well nothing makes my day more than a cheesy little film about zombies monsters murderers that sort of thing but to say that this movie was lacking is an understatement this movie was pure trash you'd think the zombies would look somewhat like what the cover art of the box displays but instead you get actors with masks that are clearly sold at any halloween display counter furthermore the script is beyond pitiful our main character joseph suffers the loss of his wife and son and seeks solace in the warm hearted mary played by blair not once do you see any sign of sadness or discomfort on the part of joseph's character instead we see the head of the labs a man named dr miller eager to get the dead bodies and experiment with their organs there is no emotion or anything to make you believe you should give a damn about anyone in this film br br all and all very disappointing all the elements to make a great horror film were there you had your zombies your decent actors and your story but the lack of good writing and little if any sense of direction screwed this one up royally overall 4 out of 10
<START> kicked in the head is all about the corrigan character a twenty something man on a quest to find himself and his involvements with a handful of quirky characters this thin and ambiguous story which was written by corrigan has a make it up as you go feel and a screenplay which smells like an uninspired low budget indie in spite of that and some annoying hindenburg scene the film has an off beat quirky kind of charm which may appeal in some small way to people with a similar sense of humor not for everyone not for most but maybe fun for some d
<START> or maybe not whatever anyone thinks of broadcast news good or bad almost all the credit for that thinking belongs to writer producer director james l brooks as a screenwriter of which he has long been one of the best it is not easy to savage an entire business in this case the business being television news but to do it with a smile a wink a knowing nod and a laugh practically every step of the way to do all that takes real talent something mr j brooks has in abundance br br one user on this website in his summary asked the musical question did walter cronkite act like this no of course not and the reason for that is in walter's uh mr day the only thing that mattered was bringing the news to the people same goes for john chancellor and chet and david and douglas edwards and howard k smith sure they had to pay lip service attention to their ratings if only to please their bosses but all they really cared about was the news itself br br now of course all that has changed for the last 25 30 years in the network news business the only thing that has really mattered is ratings ratings ratings the bottom line how many bucks will our news division deliver for the network don't believe that br br let's consider the big three tom dan rather and peter jennings aka stanley stunning all three have now been on the job at their respective anchor desks for the last 15 20 years peter actually got his first shot at the national anchor desk way back in the 1960s but was totally unprepared for the job of the three dan is the one with the greatest in the field training as a reporter personally i think all three do terrific jobs as news anchors and are deserving of their positions all of which has nothing to do with why all three are actually in those jobs all three are now in their 60's dan is pushing the big 7 0 and all three are still very good looking and if you think they're still good looking now imagine how good looking they were in their 40's when all three were hired for let's say put in their current jobs but do you honestly believe that any one of these three would have been put in had he looked like let's say fred gwynne herman munster or like heaven forfend me not only that if dan were retiring tomorrow a younger than he is today walter cronkite would not be able to get his old job back why not pretty enough and it would matter not a whit that he is or once was the most trusted man in america br br and this is what broadcast news is all about tom william hurt the next pretty boy national news anchor to be who has trouble with a few minor things such as thinking for himself being able to write and knowing stuff jane craig holly hunter the brilliant news producer with news business standards and ethics all of which get thrown to the wind when even she falls for pretty boy tom and aaron altman albert brooks no relation to james l a top notch newswriter and field reporter who has no hope for a national job because he flop sweats behind the anchor desk and many other such flawed characters whom you know really do exist in the news divisions of the various networks br br network blazed the trail eleven years later broadcast news carried the torch as a worthy successor in the new millennium what will be the next movie to savage the business of network news you can use maybe or maybe not
<START> i would not compare it to le placard which imho had more comic moments but juliette while being a slow starter certainly kept your attention going throughout the film nicely paced and reaching a heart warming conclusion there were many marvellous comedic moments some brilliant pathos and realistic situation acting by all actors br br it was a typically french film in which while confronting prejudices and phobias which in turn the made the viewer confront his own shortcomings i am certainly pleased to have this in my library and will no doubt watch it time and time again which to me is a mark of a great film
<START> i saw this film much like did but when i could manage to see it again and with formal film training psychology and life has had the time to really take me by the hand and start beating me about i really click with the film i remember the pay for service cable channels played this thing almost to death much like poltergeist when it first came out and many other popular films i felt back then it wasn't worth the fuss and constant airtime i know cable isn't really on air given it but i was very young and adult situation drama wouldn't have and shouldn't have worked however recent viewing of the film has enlightened me on the film i think that susan and molly ringwald were likely studying the script together and i would be a bit surprised if had coached ringwald during this project ringwald's other projects while good do not have her exhibiting the potential depth as this role nailed hers as raul julia did also cassavettes and wife delivered acceptable performances but i will admit at times first class acting turns to mediocre a steady ebb and flow to the acting does take place during many scenes but overall i can see why the story might call for the dynamic to become more subtle br br all in all i don't find this film to be the take me out and drown me kind of boredom fest as would have you believe i think that perhaps with the right psychological training and a bit more hardship in one's domestic life strategically placed coupled with some film courses perhaps this film would appear different i would say if you are feeling a bit melancholy and yearn for a simpler life and you have had your share of marital discord amongst dysfunctional family units then perhaps this film might provide more insight and entertainment than you might think i do feel it is a classic and find it much more entertaining than mainstream films that are supposed to share many of the same elements such as terms of endearment which as far as i am concerned could be stripped of a few extraordinary performances by jack nicholson then burned until nothing is left how could a film like that get more attention than this one talk about boredom best thing don't take my word or anyone else's see the film and support our industry
<START> i am a big fan of the abc movies of the week genre i am only 27 meaning i wasn't even born until after the series ended but i am trying to collect as many of them on dvd as possible i have about a dozen or so i had read such wonderful things about this film both on here and elsewhere that i was really excited to see it i just received my dvd in the mail today and watched it anxiously i'll admit that the first one or two phone calls did give me the creeps that boy's voice would give anyone the creeps but it began to ware off fast and the entire divorce subplot was stupid i also figured out that michael douglas was the antagonist about a half an hour before the movie ended as soon as that story was told about how elizabeth ashley's character had locked up his mother i knew something was fishy plus didn't anyone ever think to ask him why he happened to suddenly appear that night when the fire occurred in the barn i'll admit that i thought he was coaching a boy at the school to make the phone calls i didn't guess the mute boy part or the pre recorded tapes did they ever say whose voice that actually was i doubt douglas could ever get his voice that high br br i am only giving this movie a four out of ten because i actually liked most of the acting in it ashley especially is great br br it's a shame because this movie has such a great premise but oh well thats what happens sometimes when one gets his or her hopes up for a movie too much
<START> i found code 46 very disappointing i thought the concept was good and therefore had great potential as a movie but found that it didn't deliver code 46 lacked thought and structure and the storyline didn't flow well i thought that tim robbins character wasn't well developed for eg i thought there should have been more info and thought put into his family life and not have it completely ignored as i felt it was when they were first in violation of a code 46 it was suggested that they were not to know that they may have been genetically linked but all the technology was available to them he took her fingerprint and therefore genetic details when he was investigating the fraud i constantly found myself waiting for something to happen and the story line to develop and yet it never did i felt that the film had great potential to be intellectually stimulating but turned out to be the opposite code 46 tried to be too clever and in the end just ended up lacking imagination i would not recommend this film to anybody the only good thing about the film was that it was relatively short
