<START> this should have been a moody gritty movie which lingered in the memory as an exposition of relationship where the dominant personality only survives because the personality being dominated sees no hope of change br br the acting was intense and skillful the dialogue worked but the movie was irritatingly ineffective too many distance shots that suggested lack of focus rather than a broader picture poor flow the first 5 minutes could have been missed out altogether br br i suspect that with a different edit this movie could have been compelling br br in its current form it is flat formless and tremendously disappointing
<START> affable aspiring cartoonist hoops mccann a wonderfully engaging performance by john cusack and his best buddy george the deliciously deadpan joel murray go to for the summer following graduation from high school hoops george and several newfound pals come to the aid of cassandra demi moore at her most charming a singer who's family house is being threatened with demolition by the greedy clan writer director savage steve holland offers an often hilariously wacky and zesty nonstop barrage of admittedly broad and dumb but still very funny jokes the constant madcap lunacy has a real giddy good natured and infectiously inane vitality to it that's impossible to either dislike or resist moreover the lively and enthusiastic acting from a fine game cast adds immensely to the zany merriment bobcat goldthwait as the spastic egg stork tom villard as his goofy brother clay curtis armstrong as the sweet ack ack raymond mark metcalf as evil rich jerk matt as the mean teddy kimberly foster as the fetching cookie joe flaherty as the gung ho general raymond william hickey as cranky old man jeremy piven as smug preppy bully ty and john as hulking biker stan slick cinematography the hip soundtrack cory cool rockin' score and the funky animation are all uniformly excellent single funniest scene egg in a godzilla suit terrorizing a posh dinner party an absolute hoot
<START> i don't usually comment on films or tv shows but had to post a comment about las vegas br br naturally here in the uk we are about 2 through the 3rd season and though i have managed to watch the last series of season 3 via other means i'm still glued every friday at 9pm br br from the very first episode of season 1 i have been a big big fan of this show and own all 3 seasons on dvd yes i cannot wait for season 4 to start in october br br so why do i love this show so much well i have to agree with the last poster james caan i know one person cannot make a team but big ed was made for caan or maybe it was the other way around i read that the producers were considering martin sheen for ed no way i also agree that caan's character is getting very soft i also preferred the tough take no sh t big bad eddy d that we saw in season 1 2 he seems to have mellowed out br br as i said no one person makes the team by and of course the other cast members josh danny james mike vanessa sam nikki cox mary molly sims all contribute well even outside cast members such as cheryl ladd as jillian harry groener as gunther dean caine as casey mitchell as mitch who may feature 6 or 7 times during a season can fit in just as well as if they've been in every single episode from day one br br this show has everything drama action suspense laughs romance glamour and big time celebrity's who often play br br many may disagree but this is one of the best shows on digital tv and i hope it may long continue after season 4
<START> rouge is part of a trilogy but very much stands on its own it isn't a sequel of any sort the very end which i won't divulge ties the three films together but not seeing the other two doesn't make it too confusing br br this film amazes me because it is so spare so subtle and simple but is as effective emotionally and intellectually as any big budget spectacle or all star melodrama kieslowski here investigates the phenomena of chance and destiny both themes are loosely woven together in the story the film is very much a puzzle but the message is pretty straightforward everything happens for a reason love is in all of our destinies as long as we open ourselves to it the title red refers to the french flag where red represents fraternity or brotherhood the color dominates the visuals of the movie i tend to think of it as representing love or passion or the blood of life it's great when a film allows the freedom to do that
<START> maybe if you've never read any english literature or only ever watched the hollywood version of any book you might find merit in this awful film it has the directorial and scripting skill of the bbc 1995 adaptation is both very enjoyable and close to the book and captures the atmosphere between elisabeth and darcy very well br br the characters in this production are badly miscast sutherland as bennet seems a total buffoon likewise acts the fool and it is that he my be a friend of darcy i can't imagine how judi dench could have accepted the role maybe she thought it was a surreal comedy version br br quotes from the book are thrown in out of context huge chunks are missing the important episode with is glossed over br br mr collins is however very good and towers above the other members of the cast br br the only good thing is we didn't pay to see it wait for the dvd and use to keep a table from wobbling
<START> i watched this movie for the first time around 1990 as a young kid and it scared the jesus out of me i loved it so much and i was dying to get my hands on it br br in 2002 i remembered that this movie existed but i had no idea what it was called so i went to the i need to know section on imdb and explained what the movie was about and tried to get the name of it anyway eventually someone on imdb told me so i researched and tried to buy the movie so eventually i got a hold of it on dvd and i now keep this movie as one of my most valuable horror movies i really love it and i think anyone who watches it will be very scared in the woods the next time they go 9 10
<START> if you go into the twins effect looking for a pure hong kong movie experience you will be disappointed this is not to say it is bad but it is not a traditional hong kong action movie running in a similar vein to shaolin soccer and kung fu hustle it's resolutely silly and juvenile so if you want a good bit of serious hong kong action look to a john woo or yuen woo ping movie this movie's got a lot of flak for it's silliness and i thought the first thing i should do would be to explain what you're getting into as it's disappointed a lot of purists br br for the non purists and those with more forgiving tastes though twins effect is a delightfully silly kung fu comedy i liked it a lot for a variety of reasons not least it's wonderful female leads who spark off each other in a thoroughly entertaining comedy double act i believe this is the first movie of it's type they've been in but they hop kick and fly about like seasoned pros br br the patently ridiculous plot is handled with a great deal of care and attention and the movie is quite knowingly written making a lot of the movie laugh out loud the comedy really is the most prominent thing here and it's a subtle gentle comedy as reliant on words as inanimate objects going flying a la stephen chow it has to be said the slapstick is immense fun too the sequence with the disco dancing vampires is a total classic br br the action is a blend of two genres really it falls between the drama' wire and sword fighting which comes in more toward the end and the comedy fighting style of jackie chan coming out with a blend that though a little derivative at times is always exciting to watch and occasionally throws up some genuinely innovative encounters br br all this is great and the movie is tremendous fun all the way through despite this it does have a few sticking points for instance twins effect is in many ways much more westernised than kung fu fans are perhaps used to the inevitable comparison to the blade series is definitely sound as an example though twins effect is honestly much better than blade ever managed especially for fighting action personally it was also a bit of a shame to see the excellent anthony wong the villain from john woo's classic hard boiled so underused but the younger audience this is aimed at are unlikely to notice this or indeed know about hard boiled or his other movies so this is only really a personal gripe br br if you watch this with an open mind you'll probably enjoy it greatly like i did but you must be firmly aware it is a comedy not a balls to the wall kung fu movie keep that in mind and you'll be fine
<START> well i've read the book first and thought wow would this be cool to see in a movie than i started searching and found there was already a movie made of it i bought the movie a week ago on dvd and watched it they did it awfully wrong at first this kid who isn't any character in the book then the mix between the two books 'the river god' and 'the seventh than nicolas needing funds while in the book he himself is actually the the whole thing about the is wrong also is supposed to have invented the lightweight chariot the whole thing about the tomb is also very wrong there is supposed to be a channel that has some kind of vacuum suction around it the tomb itself was made in a maze with only a possibility to pass if one knows the rules of the ancient boa game there was nothing in the movie about nicolas being english and was a coptic christian in the book not a muslim this list is endless there were only a few things good about the movie the actors which played boris mick and were well chosen the rest were just parodies of the characters in the book was the worst it didn't get even close to the character that was in my head while i wrote the book it is such a shame that such a great book is mutilated in such a bad reproduction i wonder why wilbur smith ever gave his permission for this
<START> i first saw this film when released in 1980 from other sources i've learnt that the only release of the minute cut was in new york city after which it was severely cut to 149 minutes so i guess i saw the shorter version first which at the time i thought was a very interesting anti western if a trifle confusing br br so it was with even more interest that i finally obtained a dvd of the full length version i'm glad i did because this second viewing has confirmed for me that the movie is a true classic and the critical vitriol poured on michael cimino was unwarranted to say the very least br br yes it's a long movie but so have been many others for example once upon a time in america 1984 at 227 minutes cleopatra 1963 at minutes the ten commandments 1956 at 220 minutes spartacus restored version 1960 at minutes gone with the wind 1939 at 222 minutes and others so it can't be the fact of running time that made so many froth at the mouth way back when heaven's gate came on the scene br br but note this all of those above movies have everything to do with reinforcing myths about history and heroes br br not so heaven's gate in this narrative the american west is shown in all its grim and unrelenting harshness injustice and poverty and that's probably the first reason why so many disliked this film it laid out the circumstances of the johnson county war of 1892 in wyoming showing how the wyoming stock growers association hired 50 assassins to hunt down and murder a large group of european immigrants accused of cattle rustling and all with the assistance and conniving of authorities right up to the president of the united states for an essay on that war with the background and what happened there is a link at wikipedia under johnson county war br br very few like to be reminded of the really dirty periods in their country's history and which fly in the face of what the country is supposed to be had it been a documentary it would have been barely palatable for most as entertainment it was almost bound to fail commercially and be torn to shreds by the shrill and infamous br br leaving aside the socio political diatribe for a moment that cimino launched herein what about the narrative Â the story of the three main characters well it probably wasn't unusual for men of that time to fall for a local prostitute just as it's probably not unusual now it's a fairly standard love triangle whereby ella must choose between the two men and ultimately decides upon the younger man nathan who although not above resorting to cold blooded murder when it suits him shows more spirit and commitment than the older james or jim as most people in the film say for some that part of the story threads too slowly perhaps in the context of the wider narrative about the war however it is i think entirely appropriate br br and that war is depicted graphically viciously and cruelly with scenes of carnage that are exquisitely staged and edited flawlessly Â although in the final massacre between the association and the immigrants i'm certain that some scenes of wagons blowing apart are repeated a minor point and perhaps brought about when the minute cut was restored any way you look at it though it hits you in the face with the noise dust chaos and confusion of war br br which brings me to another criticism by others the noise and dust is such that it's often difficult to hear the dialog and even see clearly what is happening i'll admit that i found that to be a trifle annoying at first even to replay parts to try to catch the image or the words Â until i realized that really wasn't necessary if you accept the director's intent life is chaotic it is difficult to hear and see in crowded situations and in war it's the sine qua non of this mise en scene in short it's as though you truly are present in and within the scenes br br and what of the title from shakespeare it refers to a figurative nearness to god and so if you equate god with the natural world the stunning scenery that pervades the movie Â and it is stunning hauntingly equal to that of david lean's doctor zhivago 1965 Â is a useful metaphor i tend to think however that cimino had something more to say namely the idea that the brave immigrants Â the god fearing salt of the earth Â were denied entry to heaven on earth and the freedom to build a life for themselves in the land that espouses to be freedom's champion br br was that cimino's intent Â to gut the myth of the american west to show how in america only the rich get rich while the poor are massacred one way or another throughout history is that anything new not really as we all know where it really hurt however is in showing how america was not and by implication is not the land of the free and the home of the brave instead after absorbing this narrative we are left with an impression that the underpinnings of america have more to do with a land of dispossessed slaves and a home for
<START> i never figured out what the attraction of karen black was she always had those beady eyes and kind of an odd look about her she seemed to often be eccentric or cast as the other woman in this one she is the psychic adviser and expert on the occult to a crummy producer of bad commercials as he learns astral projection he is a mean sucker even without the new baggage apparently this is the avenue to immortality because if you get good at it you can inhabit the bodies of future generations i believe star trek had a plot like this with jack the ripper hanging on for several centuries anyway this guy is really dangerous he has a nice family and makes them miserable he begins to murder friends just because they have an unkind comment for them or he doesn't like them you can see the ending coming from the back row in left field it's a very harsh humorless movie most of it must be taken as truth why are some called but few chosen i found it long and not very satisfying
<START> for a long time i did not know weather i liked this film or not this is surprising because i usually do know but because the film did not go anywhere i was a bit confused br br two people move into a somewhat communal household setting finding their spouses constantly working or away on business trips their attention out of sheer loneliness wanders to each other after a platonic love affair the male lead played by tony leung discloses that he has a mistress on the side su li played by maggie cheung is hurt even though their love affair has not been physically consummated leaves the country only to come back years later when everything has changed br br for the part the film is correct by never actively or actually touching the part of love but only approaching it the film admittedly says more than so many others have on the subject it is also true i think that nothing good could have come if they did go on to have the affair at least that's the feeling i get br br if we are to believe it however when marquez writes that love is a state of grace not the means to anything but the alpha and the omega an end in itself then this film falls miserably short of this as do all others or if you are inclined to entirely incomplete minimalism hits it right on the mark what films in history have achieved approached or sustained this phrase if for only a short while my honest feeling in memory is that about two when harry met sally suggests effectively this romantic perfection and the getting is all in just getting there it is interesting that in when harry met sally this is done in the course of wooing rather than in its attainment can't anyone say anything good about love after it has been achieved by two individuals nicholas spark's recent film the notebook comes closer to this perhaps than any other film are we to believe that once love is achieved it flies of the radar only to exist in perfection in some other dimension or more true perhaps becomes latent vehicle for other ends br br in the mood for love is an honest film with gorgeous and generous cinematography worthy in all respects of the best that almodovar has to offer yet all it manages to say in the end is that life is sometimes like this now this is by no means a diffident thing to say especially if said well but the problem really comes at the end of the last act when kar wai wong tries to round out the film by relating only for the second time a broader historical theme that plays in the background of the relationship which has just taken place this is a worthy effort and the variation on the musical motif played throughout the film is rather brilliant but the relatively spare indictment plays too little to have much more than a superficial effect on the inclined audience leaving the viewer to split the difference a mistake in any film a director should know where he is going and how to get there but in all honesty it is only one wrong turn however as anyone knows all it takes is one notable imperfection to spoil the perfect barrel of honey br br the effort though is definitely worth while trying to let a historical theme broaden and round out the film and raise it beyond the micro meaning of the couple but without any real foreshadowing it is the crucial mistake in a word and unfortunately it is too little too late it is also i think too much of a challenge for the non asian viewer not familiar enough with china's history to appreciate completely this sweeping stroke
<START> this is an incredible movie that begins slowly it leads you along in thinking of it as a typical maudlin family drama then in the second half there is a plot twist that utterly transforms this into a profound tale of global scope br br if you are unaccustomed to films from india with song and dance routines seemingly grafted on for no reason stick with this movie especially beginning with the second half you will find this movie an amazing experience br br minor spoiler here i have but one complaint with the movie the dialog at the end between and mds seemed very weak and missed the opportunity to bring in the war as a force that transforms people's lives it was implied all along but there should have been something about the importance of the struggle for mds
<START> first i loved the documentary it represents a new school history theory where a subject can reflect a wide range of social and historical issues br br i'll get the camera and dogs out of the way first i hate the blair witch quality of the camera but also understand the advantage of such a casual approach in fact i agree with the other reviewer that it gives us unprecedented access br br dogs warning i have a doctoral degree in literature which i do not use as a profession so some of my training may seep in the dogs are a beautiful metaphor for the complex relationship of human's great endeavors and our need to find the labor to achieve them the dogs might reflect their owners as one reviewer suggested but they also serve as a stand in for the workers we see in the film while this might hint at the marxist problem raised by one reviewer i think it also shows how difficult it is to labor issues no in italy may not translate as well elsewhere yikes i am a marxist at heart and hate to hear my cynical resignation hold sway it is a remarkable bait and switch the dogs are family the workers are family but in the end the dogs are the workers the last scene with the poor farmer while you may disagree with the politics the artistry of the analogy coupled with the more overt politics of the film are wonderful br br had only faulkner i am from alabama had the power of film beyond the hollywood market what interesting tales would have been told
<START> cheap gloriously bad cheese from the 80's the decade of cheese i watched this one first uncut and un and it was pretty much laugh out loud funny even without the comments br br the plot such as it is revolves around a post apocalyptic world in which the ai robots revolted sound familiar and destroyed pretty much everything leaving a world in ruins with air so bad no one can breathe it the few humans that are left act as slaves to an enigmatic being called the dark one which seems to be part computer and part organic being the work to produce energy for this being in return for breathable air every once in a while the dark one has the strongest of the air slaves fight to the death so that no one will rise as a leader in a revolt against the dark one br br okay that's the so called serious stuff on to the silly stuff such as the ridiculous quasi futuristic clothing that everyone sports including car seat cover garments loin cloths and stuff and feather worn mostly by the dark one's henchwoman a chick with an unrecognizable and almost non understandable accent or the wooden acting and stilted lines sported by all of the so called 'actors' who's dialog is high on pretension and low on sense or the dime store special fx including pink socks with teeth glued onto them for sewer snakes a bomb made of strung piano wire and a tin can and terrible with halloween rubber masks on br br a band of air slaves follow their leader a mysterious wanderer who has adapted to the air outside to go to the energy plant to destroy the dark one the guy's name is neo which explains where the wachowski brothers got the idea for the matrix they meet up with a group of amazons along the way with the obligatory fight scene in which the female is bested of course has anyone else ever noticed that in every amazon movie or t v show ever produced these so called amazing warriors always get their butts kicked by either men or women amazons are just pansies i guess br br this band of determined warriors makes their way through central park errr the ravaged lands beyond the last standing city good way to save money on the matte paintings of a destroyed new york city anyway and journey into the sewers leading to the power station where the dark one and his go go girl henchwoman valeria hang out here they vanquish such ferocious beasts as the sock puppet worms a giant spider no one sees and the goofy lobster robot who is one of the dark one's personal guard br br the final showdown is pretty sad one of the slaves a girl who's father was taken by the dark one because he'd produced a way for people to breathe the foul air sees that her father has been by the dark one's true form which involves him being eaten by a giant avocado until only his head is sticking out the three remaining adventurers destroy the dark one by turning off a few switches and the robot holocaust dies not with a bang but with a whimper the two humans exchange some amazingly wooden last lines and that's it the end
<START> maybe it was the fact that i saw spider man the day before i saw wild but i do not think that there can be any excuse for this movie being as bad as it was the cast was there to do it but it seemed as if once they found them selves with a decent cast they had to try and make them fit into the movie the only problem was that they did not fit i did not like any of the characters and the story was sketchy at best i left wondering why i spent my money on this movie
