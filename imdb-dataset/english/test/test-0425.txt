<START> this is a little film with a big heart excellent acting throughout and directed with love if you missed it in theatres and who didn't catch it with someone you love frankly i cried and i'm a guy for out loud
<START> this film is a masterpiece to put it simply especially the double exposure made by the cameraman julius it is skillfully made even with the standards we are used to today seventy eight years later viktor the director also plays the main character david holm on the night of new years eve he is killed in a fight and the legend says that the first one who dies on the new year will have to work as a soul collector in the form of a transparent ghost there is a new soul collector to be appointed every year br br the scene in which the alcoholic david holm rises up from his dead body like the soul is leaving his earthly body in the where the fight took place is a real award for a eye also when the present soul collector arrives with his horse and carriage is a beautiful but also a scary scene david holm recognizes this soul collector as a from earlier life it is now his turn to take over just like scrooge in dickens story a christmas tale david is shown what his life and doings has led to for the people around him br br the film is about the danger of abusing drugs in this case alcohol it is based upon a book by nobel prize winner selma viktor filmed a few more of her books but this is the one with the best outcome maybe because this book is the most filmic of them br br
<START> i love the other reviews of this movie they mirror my attitude i am a 70's sort of guy minus disco and star wars childishness there was nothing great about this movie except for a chase scene that is why it was good because it was tough basic and economical roy scheider carried the movie which was based on the crew the 7 ups that backed up gene hackman in the french connection the people in it were believable and average who burned themselves pouring coffee showed fear in chase scene and almost lost it after a close call crash br br maybe it would be easier to tell you what it lacked there was no fancy weapons just basic revolvers and crude sawed off shotguns there was no tough guy philosophizing ala tarantino there was no kung fu or samurai nonsense and no fancy trick shooting either there was no clever guy who carries out some complicated scheme based on hundreds of things going just the way he planned including everyone else's reactions the criminals were bad guys but they didn't shoot people for the hell of it as a matter of fact there was a body count of just three something that the average movie these days would pass in the opening credits it could be a g movie today no bus load of orphan school children were kidnapped nor were terrorists threatening to kill half of the city there were no high tech hijinks nor were the crimes themselves very moving or ingenious the highest tech thing i saw was a touch tone wall phone it had no subplots or amusing character developments also no sex or women except for one mobster's wife who did some screaming as the buddy our hero had her menaced br br it was some little undertaker who exploited his connections with the local mob and the police to kidnap local mobsters for some easy payoffs the undertakers vito was played by tony lo bianco who did a great job as good as roy schneider buddy the head of 7 ups cop whom he informed and exploited what ever happened to tony lo bianco he seemed like a pacino shoe in good looking and talented what it did have was a great nyc backdrop to a simple crime story locations that were bleak and dehumanizing without being a sociological study it had a simple plot that involved this kidnapping scheme where one of buddy's cop got accidentally involved literally accidentally dragged in then accidentally shot dead since buddy and his 7 ups are a hot dogs unit both the nypd brass and mobsters thought he was involved since the kidnappers masqueraded as plain clothes cops to lure the mobsters into compliance obviously the mobsters figured they had lawyers and rights to protect them from normal police even the mobsters were plain old and ugly no godfather royalty or soprano hipness here br br it is a good basic movie with a standout chase scene between two 70's d even the cars were plain and economical not even a gto or a trans am like the acting and the story in the days of batman uber hype or 24 levels of intensity doomsday scenarios this movie reminds us that less is better it should be shown to movie screen writers and directors as a caveat not to dazzle amuse then ultimately insult us with stunts gadgets and clown psychotic behavior galore
<START> a recent survey of children in the uk re enforced the notion put forth by this film 27 years ago that being more than anything else young people want to grow up to be somebody famous it used to be doctors and firemen that kids wanted to be now everyone wants to be famous fame is a story of a group of kids accepted into the high school for performing arts in new york city we seen them first audition then take classes and learn about life for the next four years the film has a lot of fine qualities but ultimately leaves you feeling a little unsatisfied br br alan parker's bold directorial style fits the story pretty well the film has been classified as a musical but more than anything it is a drama musical numbers and dance routines break out here and there and parker keeps them as close to realistic as they really could have been filmed the acting is for the most part top drawer with a few exceptions the pacing is a little off particularly toward the end of the film but by that point the story has already taken a few wrong turns anyway br br first off the auditions at the beginning of the film should have a couple of the principle characters out it seems unlikely that anyone would show up and audition for one department then stumble their way through to another some of these people just don't look that talented or interested to begin with once the first year of classes gets going the film settles into a nice groove the interaction between students and teachers is very well handled and it leaves you wanting more the film begins to lose itself later on as we see more and more of the students' lives out of school some of these people just aren't worth caring about br br the film's biggest mistake is making the ralph character so prominent this guy is a boorish self centered jerk a professional a hole as he proudly declares on stage during his comedy routines the audience is supposed to somehow feel for this guy and his tragic personal situation but i was just hoping they'd throw his butt out of school irene cara maureen paul and the late gene anthony ray are the people you'll care about by the time this film is over try as i might i still can't develop abs like gene anthony ray had in this film br br overall this film is good it is memorable interesting and full of daring scenes and performances it runs maybe a little too long and perhaps some of the wrong characters get fully developed while others kind of hover in the background the musical numbers are great and there is even a surprise or two waiting to be discovered by the time the film is over though not perfect fame will be a film that lives on in one way or another for many years to come br br 7 of 10 stars br br the hound
<START> this film is a disaster from beginning to end 75 percent of the movie is made from scenes taken from hercules the haunted world and hercules the captive women badly edited together with original scenes that do not add up to anything but a complete rip off i'm a big fan of those two movies and seeing scenes taken from them re edited and re dubbed with nonsensical dialogue made my head spin these kind of cheap producers tactics to make more money by duping unsuspecting audiences basically killed the sword sandal genre back in the 1960s br br there is one memorable scene in the new footage and it's the one when hercules fights with the bad hercules the fight is albeit cool and giovanni who plays definitely stands out he makes a memorable nemesis to but the rest is borderline embarrassing that was probably shot in a day br br avoid at all cost
<START> spoiler alert br br i don't go into 'high movies expecting them to be 100 accurate on all things computer related but somehow even the average 'i have a user is supposed to believe that br br 1 a computer professional with a top secret special data br br 2 is going to keep the primary copy of said data on a 1 44 floppy br br 3 and make absolutely no backup of this special secret data br br even high school students back up their homework for goodness sake br br also this is the worst of a computer nerd ever even though she is super cute we are supposed to believe that she has no friends neighbors extended family or coworkers who can identify her even the had a family that could turn him in br br end spoiler br br these aren't just minor mistakes that had no bearing on the movie these are the major plot points that fueled the storyline the characterization was awful the plot wholly and if you haven't seen this don't bother
<START> it was good to see john denver again though he passed several years ago i found this film to be very heartwarming and a great film to sit by the fire on a cold winters night recollecting what christmas is all about the scenes of georgetown colorado were magnificent and make one want to move there immediately as i sit here in my own mountain seen in so california i loved the story and the plot i hope all who see this somewhat older film enjoy it as much as my mother and i did merry christmas a great film for all the family too see enoy and tell others about it thanks for the memories we need to have more films like this come out of hollywood
<START> wow so my boyfriend and i went to the movie store to rent a film i like dumb horror movies so i browsed the variety of terrible films they had to offer while he went off in search of michael moore's so then i found the worst of all of them as i would soon find out it looked good on the cover and the description on the back seemed decent enough the fact that there was an imdb quote on it as a review was proof that it would be bad in a good way so the next night we put it in the dvd player and from the first five minutes we were so incredibly confused br br the movie is utterly incoherent with badly placed time jumps from past to future that leave you asking a major ' the plot has no sort of coherent story other than the vague allusion to a local myth about a murder but this only actually comes into play in the movie in the last twenty minutes of it so pretty much for the first hour you have this random confusing time jumps incoherent plot parents who don't age bad acting bad dialogue a boy who magically changes hair colour and a host of obnoxious characters for you to get bored with br br the movie moves so slow that it's a chore to actually sit there and watch i'd rather be scrubbing the toilets honestly don't bother with it
<START> this film is all about humans this film stayed as my all time favorite short cartoon for years br br isn't it the simplest things that make life so much more interesting we humans are so soft compassionate funny caring to each other one moment we invent the most beautiful and amazing machines to kill as many people as possible with the least effort the next in our short lives we destroy our world each other and often our own lives than spend the rest of our lives trying to fix what we've destroyed sometimes there is nothing left to fix br br this film can entertain educate and even help us realize what is wrong in our lives life is short and can be even shorter the ending is way too optimistic i am afraid br br i love richard mind and what he makes happen with it br br enjoy br br h k
<START> if you are home on a weekend very bored and lack the will to move with absolutely nothing better to do with your life for the next couple of hours you could enjoy making fun of this movie the acting and script and general movie making of this film isn't actually all that bad which is why it makes it possible to actually sit through this this is a movie they would show in high school health class to teach the dangers of pre marital sex or they could also show it to teach the dangers of very lame music that band brian austin green is in is really terrible i think thats a much greater threat to society than unwed parents
<START> why did i vote 10 10 for this movie that is just completely off guts quite simply because if you just let yourself find it funny you can just laugh until you choke some people might find that it goes too far it is certainly not for everyone but whenever i'm down and just need something really really stupid to laugh at chuck on bottom or and i can forget all of my troubles and be transported into a magical dark and weird world br br completely off guts is an australian expression it has no literal translation
<START> this is the fifth part of 'the animatrix' a collection of animated short movies that tell us a little more about the world of 'the matrix' this time they introduce trinity carrie anne moss in a story about a detective who is hired to find her with great black and white animation and an interesting story this is again a great animated short from 'the animatrix'
<START> meh sums it all up for me really boring story bland dialogue dull action scenes how do you make something like a fight or a shootout boring do you actually have to try to do that no real characters etc just dull snipes is a gifted actor and physical performer but none of this has come to the surface in any of his dtv work when the opportunity is there to give the audience a much more superior product than they are used to imagine a decent script with a few solid characters that you care about and some damn explosive action fights shootouts etc how can it be that hard to handle my personal opinion is that the primary players in the productions simply do not care there is no evidence of enthusiasm for what they are doing look at snipes in the first 2 blades passenger 57 rising sun new jack city demolition man etc awesome intense performances complemented by decent if not always outstanding scripts good supporting casts and wicked action br br none of that is evident in any of these releases so far which is a tremendous shame the distributors slap face on the cover knowing the audience will lap them up as they haven't realised yet that they haven't seen him in theatres for nearly 2 years br br i'd love to see snipes work with somebody like isaac florentine who really knows how to make the most out of a dtv production and work with alpha stunts who are simply some of the best action guys out there together they would all make an awesome team and a snipes action vehicle we would all be proud of seeing br br detonator sucks it's not as bad as the marksman which chews but it still really sucks
<START> i am shocked to see that this movie has been given more than two stars by some people they must either be kidding or be totally blind for the art of acting directing and other flaws of the movie br br i must admit that i just could not force myself to sit through the whole movie it was just too bad br br the three first characters not including the digger were just awful actors and i mean awful maybe the director didn't care or may be he is a worse director it was like watching a bad school play the movie was of course filmed with a video camera lowbudget not real film and the light settings were not very good either in addition the sound man if they had one must either have been a newbie or a drunk as the sound were amateurish even in one of the first scenes from the kitchen awful acting btw the sound from the dialog was pretty bad for example when the woman moved her head while speaking you could hear her voice disappear and come back it sounded like they had tried to correct that in post production by turning up the volume a bit when she turns her head in addition you had the ongoing irritating buzzing sound from either camera equipment or other sources in the kitchen br br all these in the first 5 minutes or so need i say more br br a good school project or fun project for friends to watch but should never have been released for a real audience especially not for a paying audience this was a rip off unless you have a very low standard regarding movies or just bad taste you are warned sb
<START> although dated this film is definitely worth a watch i saw it about eight times as a teenager when it opened and it changed my life i just had to live in new york it has great opening shots of the manhattan skyline with johnny mathis crooning romance is still the best of everything that rival those of west side story there is a rather stilted performance by the world's real first supermodel suzy parker sorry about that janice d but it's great eye candy it also offers a bit of insight into late 1950's american mores our obsession with and repression of sex in the workplace no less romance and marriage before women's lib it represents an era in which new york was at it's finest and a super bitchy performance by joan crawford is just the icing on the cake
