<START> plankton or creatures from the abyss as i'm positive it's more commonly known as filmed under as the title creatures from the abyss appears over a moving image in the same font type as the rest of the credits starts with five 20 something kids mike clay rogers his girlfriend margaret sharon sisters julie ann wolf dorothy loren an annoying idiot named bobby michael bon whom decide to all fit into a small rubber boat head out to sea don't ask why as i don't know oh the complete idiot bobby left the petrol behind never thought to tell anyone so it comes as no great surprise that they end up stranded out at sea without any petrol for the motor to make matters worse they become trapped in a thunder storm discover a dead body floating in the water shortly after their luck seems to change when they come across a yacht potential safety in a flash everyone boards the yacht begin to explore first of all they find a scientific lab with various fish specimens computer equipment then down below they find fully furnished luxurious cabins they find a chemist deran sarafian who appears mad can't talk they eat fish from the fridge which makes dorothy puke up green vomit beetles slugs they learn that these fish are living 1000's of years old have been contaminated by toxic waste dumped in the sea that they fly mutate bite are generally unpleasant to be around i really can't be bothered to go on with this plot outline so i won't here's what i think br br this italian production was produced directed by under the pseudonym al i'd hide under a different name if i made a film this bad too i think plankton is quite simply one of the worst films ever there are so many things wrong with this film it's difficult to know where to start first the script by richard is total crap it makes no sense whatsoever is so slow dull it was torture for me to sit through why would five people just simply set sail for the middle of the ocean on a rubber dinghy barely big enough to fit them all in what were they planning on doing exactly why do we often get point of view shots from these fish creatures but they seem to be totally invisible to the characters as they are never shown on screen even though they are right next to a character how do these fish get around the boat as there is no water for them to swim in people's actions reactions to things are all wrong they constantly split up they make bizarre decisions that simply don't make any sense in the situation they find themselves in some of the dialogue is as awful as anything i've heard i could go on all day about all the plot holes ridiculous goings on but i'll run out of space if i do the fish creatures themselves look awful a mixture of rubbish rubber puppets some really bad stop motion animation at the end the scenes where they interact with the human cast also look terrible with some bad super imposition i have heard a lot of comments saying that plankton is gory don't make me laugh forget it there is virtually no blood or gore in plankton whatsoever there are a couple of slimy scenes when bobby transforms into a fish monster while having sex with julie but it's pretty brief he doesn't kill her he just sort of drips slime on her grows a couple of tentacles a fish head comes out of his mouth later on julie's vagina starts to drip some dark slime but that's it we never get to actually see what happens to her or what the slime is dorothy has a fish creature come out of her back off screen control her but again we never get to see what happens to her while margaret commits suicide a very brief shot of a plastic harpoon stuck to her forehead easily the grossest scene is when dorothy pukes up that green stuff with what looks like beetles slugs in it that's it only one person actually dies on screen for the most part plankton is quite tame as exciting as watching paint dry i nearly fell asleep it's so boring i can't see how anybody can like this total crap i just can't the acting is awful the dubbing is awful the characters are awful i hated all of them plankton is predictably crap as well with an estimated budget of only 250 000 all i can say is where did the money go the sets are monotonous dull with one lab a few cabins the special are bottom of the barrel stuff including the most fake looking exploding boat ever the cinematography is bland the music sucks there is zero atmosphere or tension as a whole plankton like it's name sake is as low in the food chain as it could possibly be i hate plankton it's awful in every single aspect of it's overlong 86 minute duration do yourself a favour avoid this one at all costs unless your either a masochist or insomniac
<START> what's there not to like br br i caught this again tonight and marvelled as to hugh capturing of the essence of philip larkin without resorting to tics and caricature br br there are many layers to the depiction of the complexity of the main character and hugh brings them to life his prudish mother his unresolved issues with his father and his inability to commit to one woman br br his poetry is interlaced throughout and some scenes are caught in his recounting of them to the wife of a friend whom he later propositions but quite casually almost innocently it is not difficult to see where his attraction lay for the many women who fell in love with him and knew about each other to boot and continued to see him br br cerebral fun loving jazz aficionado loyal friend it is always more than looks women moved beyond his baldness deafness and short sightedness and a beautifully nuanced performance by eileen atkins as his mum is an added bonus br br 9 out of 10
<START> this is possibly the hands down worst movie every made that actually took itself seriously and not as a result of the acting because being an actor i have to say that rickman and stowe had to be at their best just to escape needing electro convulsive therapy after the principle photography wrapped being one of the 57 people that actually saw this movie in theatrical release i have to say i have never before or since experienced a movie where the movie ended credits rolled the house lights went on and no one moved from their seats about five minutes after the house lights went up people started coming out of their comas to look around and i think most of us thought okay we get it that was a joke right they are going to show the real movie now eventually after the handed out disguises and we swore an oath of secrecy to never admit we were there we felt that it was safe to leave praying that we would not be seen leaving the auditorium i have seen some pretty bad movies in my day i have cinemax for goodness sakes but i am still bitter that i will never ever be able to recover those two or so hours of my life that i lost watching closet land
<START> did you ever see the film marathon man the part with the dentist i would rather have that happen to me than to sit through random hearts again it wasn't simply uninteresting or uneventful it was horribly painfully and agonizingly boring at one point i momentarily lost conciousness to the average layman i may have appeared to be sleeping but the other movie patrons knowingly realized i actually blacked out from the i thought i was going to die when the film finally ended i think it was twelve hours long but i'm not sure i let out an thank you jesus it's over to which all other movie goers cheered if i had to listen to harrison ford drone on one more second in that monotoned whine i would have been forced to search for something sharp to jam in my eye to divert my attention this is 136 minutes of my life i will never get back
<START> hello all for what it's worth i'm in a doctoral program on indonesian politics and returned this semester after about a year's most of it in jakarta br br i'm a big movie fan generally so i went out as often as i could and bought tons of local while i was there this one i saw in the theater since it opened while i was there and thankfully closed soon after br br who was the intended audience for this film the spoiled wives and daughters of the indonesian super elite whose antics are weakly and ineffectively parodied the vast majority of indonesians who could never afford even a single dish let alone a full meal in the film's central restaurant location or gay indonesian males whose dilemma in the country's muslim dominated society is reduced to absurdly simplistic how to respect yourself preaching br br if all this wasn't bad enough the soundtrack was either recorded or mixed so ineptly that even native speaking indonesians couldn't hear many of the lines br br in brief if you're looking for a cutting edge gay themed film from a region of the world that seems among the least likely to produce such an animal forget it from the early '80s or my beautiful laundrette from the same era succeed far better in putting a happier face on dealing with homophobia and do so by showing not telling through incessant wordy scenes br br overall an unfortunate waste of money in a country that still can't educate all of its children nor keep them healthy
<START> this is really good original ideas in the film and a great terrorist action film only second to die hard and die hard with a vengeance this film has suspense and a good plot i would recommend it to anyone with a taste in films like mine action terrorism and gangster mafia
<START> i first saw this movie when i was very little i was born in 1985 so it was around the age when 80s cartoons were big my mother taped it one day thinking i might like it i had never even heard of the rainbow bright tv show before i was introduced to the movie when i saw it on one of those old beta tapes i loved it i became addicted to it there are people who say it's badly written and all that but it's a kid's movie and things like that don't matter much to children i loved the story and especially liked the songs and all the female characters of course i pretended to be them and in the scene where rainbow first met and they were repulsed they had to work with the opposite sex i could totally relate the story was the basic good vs evil that children enjoy and there were enough happy moments to balance out the scary ones the world is a fantastic place that would stimulate the imagination of any young child i am very glad i had an opportunity to see this movie when i was little it made a big impact and watching it now brings back happy memories of childhood i would recommend to any parent with young children to rent this movie it will trigger their imagination and provide plenty of entertainment you're only a child once so don't let them miss out on this one
<START> the cat in the hat is just a slap in the face film mike myers as the cat in the hat is downright not funny and mike myers could not have been any worse this is his worst film he has ever been in the acting and the story was just terrible i mean how could they make the most beloved stories by dr seuss be made into film and being one of the worst films of all time and such a disappointment i couldn't have seen a more worst film than this besides maybe baby geniuses but this film is just so bad i can't even describe how badly they made this film bo welch should be fired or the writer should br br hedeen's outlook 0 10 no stars f
<START> seeing other people is a daring romantic comedy about a couple named ed and alice jay mohr and julianne nicholson who are engaged and plan to be wed soon they live together but are both having doubts about their relationship alice realizes she's had so few sexual relationships in the past she might just be marrying ed because she's never felt anything else so they agree to begin fooling around with other people for a while to test their own relationship br br the movie balances a prescient question by focusing too much on the what if aspects of life can it in fact do the opposite and only make you feel more constrained when ed begins having sex with a college girl he begins to become addicted and almost forget about alice when he realizes this it scares him br br i hadn't heard anything about this film in advance but i enjoyed it it's not extremely well made and definitely has that purposefully low budget indie feel to it but it's a lot better than most romantic comedies out there in the mainstream today br br check it out if you get a chance
<START> i don't recall a film which so deftly shows the emotional destruction of war as mirrored in one single marital relationship the focus of the film is the union between ullman and von sydow the two are in every scene through the course of the film they experience a role reversal one has the strength of survival and the other is reduced to emotional escapism through dreams both will lose a measure of humanity but one to a greater degree than the other the characters and the viewer go through periods of fluctuation in regards to closeness the camera pulls out and away sound disappears words are lost only for the camera to return to painterly closeups of its facially expressive stars the confusion and fluctuation may make this film hard for some viewers but this is all purposeful under the master hand of bergman i think the use of a fake war makes the film timeless as relevant today as ever before and by focusing on the human relationship through war makes the film relevant to everyone the pair could be anyone the film is not grounded in place or time but rather in emotion a unique and effective war film unlike any other bergman's films are virtuosic in presenting human relationships that he would bring this to a war film is masterful
<START> supernanny jo frost in each episode gives a family the benefit of her hard earned experience but when she's gone will they succeed in sticking to her tough rules or do they face a life dominated by unruly children br br following in the vein of british documentaries wife swap and how clean is your house supernanny gives an in depth look into the private family lives of average people but with the added benefit of practical advice on ways to raise your children br br jo advocates a tough love style of child care and the now infamous 'naughty step' has come into the popular vernacular in many british homes br br in just three short weeks the families featured were turned from a disorganised house of sibling rivalry screaming kicking biting kids and fighting parents to a tranquil calm oasis of family love br br the series when aired gathered huge ratings and critical acclaim and is currently in talks to be for america
<START> son you must stop the experiments i have started too bad nobody said this too whoever green lighted this project i was almost literally dragged to this movie by a friend of mine for a midnight showing when we were in high school now a midnight movie in high school on a friday night you are not expecting much but c'mon and upon seeing it again years later i sill stand by my original opinion of it great special effects but so what quite possibly one of the worst movies ever made unless you enjoy blood and guts and seeing some hollywood vets steiger hunter make fools of themselves for a buck yuck
<START> one of the movies i just didn't want to see i got it in the sneak preview but damn the acting was very bad at the end of the movie i still am surprised i watched the whole movie i wondered why i watched the movie br br also here in the netherlands the writer of this movie it's filmed from a book of thought it was very bad and was disappointed that his movie came out like this next time he wants a role in choosing people for the cast
<START> i just wanted to inform anyone who may be interested that the the movie new jersey drive was my personal favorite off alltime i admire the work nick gomez and spike lee put into this masterpiece of a movie this movie made quite an impression on me because of its realness and its appreciation of detail of life in urban new jersey it struck a chord with me personally because i grew up with friends like those depicted in the movie it further made an impression with me because i used to spend time in several years ago so some of the characters were kept real at times this movie seemed like a documentary because you didn't know whether or not these were real events taking place although movies like boys in the hood and menace ii society grab more attention i personally feel these movies were somewhat enhanced to appeal to a broader audience new jersey drive was an uncompromising piece of in your face reality lee and gomez covered every detail in this urban drama from the music clothing slang and location unlike some of the movies i mentioned earlier the actors performed as if they weren't actors nothing was compromised in order to make good theater the only misfortune to come from this movie was the fact that many people slept on it i look forward to more works of art from nick and spike in the hopefully near future
<START> a huge cast gathered for this remake which sadly was a box office failure notwithstanding a great sound track i can't say it was riveting entertainment nor a cure for insomnia nevertheless i enjoyed the film it provided the escape i was after one afternoon a good look for those of us looking for the ideal life albeit a fantasy expect some corny moments few thrills and an occasional laugh
