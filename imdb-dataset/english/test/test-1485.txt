<START> angel a is a change of pace for monochrome mawkish and rather mediocre it is well photographed on location in paris although subtitle readers should note quick fire dialogue and good cinematography may make for frustrating viewing br br this film is no wings of desire or wonderful life despite its shared themes heavenly intervention suicide angel mortal relationships ensue does nothing to enlighten or inspire us even the well acted teary moments rapidly descend into toe curling sentimentality br br the film's flawed ideology irritates an angel whose message of love and respect for self is constantly undermined by her own violent and promiscuous behaviour a happy ending which negates the hero's supposed journey from helplessness to self esteem and independence br br verdict quite nice to look at but confused moral and philosophical messages tarnish the film precisely where it should shine 4 10
<START> fantastic movie one of the best film noir movies ever made bad guys bad girls a jewel heist a twisted morality a kidnapping everything is here jean has a face that would make bogart proud and the rest of the cast is is full of character actors who seem to to know they're onto something good get some popcorn and have a great time
<START> attending this film was an excuse to escape the work i had to do for my classes but it turned out to be one of my best experiences here in france the film makes quick work of building multidimensional characters and has an excellently smooth storyline the characters really did have the voices you would expect reading the graphic novels and the artistic talent exceeded my expectations the music was catchy and the comedy toying and lighthearted almost a inclusion of modern items in playful manners the film was attention grabbing cute and action packed at the same time a wonderful tale spun expertly i'll be showing it to my french students
<START> i saw this movie on the shelf at blockbuster and thought it looked cool the dvd case touted so many great actors and i wondered to myself why have i never heard of this movie then i turned over the case and saw the director lee and thus the answer began to explain itself br br first of all i want to defeat the idea that a great cast equals a great movie but more importantly i think i should explain why this movie is so terrible okay the script is awful and full of one dimensional characters this is the worst role i've ever seen chazz palminteri play and i'm surprised he would do something this ridiculous however under appreciated yet talented actors must earn their money palminteri plays a one dimensional police detective who comes off about as dumb as a c movie mob henchman him along with the lead detective the poorly directed nolte the great but simple michael madsen and the late chris penn whose role along with madsen's was completely thrown away make up an elite squad of la detectives tasked to rid the city of mobsters sometime in the late 30s or 40s the movie introduces this squad as cops who will break every law to make sure those who think they're above the law don't operate in their city at the beginning of the film the cops rough up a local restaurant grab an alleged mobster william peterson and take him to a place they call the mulholland falls they toss him off one of the cliffs on mullholland drive and this is supposed to demonstrate how serious these guys are about ridding the city of crime whatever this was nothing more than a cheap excuse to use a crappy title that's designed to make you think of la and its famous sites somewhere later on they find the dead body of jennifer connelly and the plot begins br br on to the direction which was nothing short of amateur and weak aside from the fact that the characters were b movie quality the overacting by those such as treat williams the guy who plays the chief of police and the awful daniel baldwin are just a few highlights that made this movie seem like it was lee first film there's not one good performance in the movie aside from maybe melanie griffith who some might argue was the worst in the movie she won a razzie for this film in the end it was her character that was not that great and she really didn't have much to work with br br as with any bad movie it all begins with the writing and this script was no gem plot is formulated simply on the basis of setting up the next scene and never takes into consideration characters' motivations the way the characters behaved was unbelievable cops taking the law into their own hands is believable within the right circumstances see la confidential but in this case it looked like these guys could get away with anything including murder and never bat an eye about cleaning anything up i guess we as an audience are just supposed to assume that no one saw anything and that people won't ask questions everything about the story is predictable and is spoon fed so well that we understand everything that's going to happen a good while before the characters do however it doesn't make us feel smart but rather makes us angry at how stupid the hero is despite the fact that there aren't any heroes in this movie br br in the end the best component of the movie was the great score by david from the beginning it invoked a since of chinatown which quickly faded when i realized how unbelievable just about everything in the film was it didn't surprise me to learn that it made a whopping eleven million in the box office what i will say is that this film is worth watching for a few laughs nick nolte's acting is like an unsuccessfully domesticated junkyard dog and i laughed every time he tried to be serious i also nearly fell on the floor at each of the slow motion shots used in the film i think there are three with one during a key fight scene when you have to use slow motion in the heat of a dramatic moment you clearly have some problems so even with my negative criticism i will recommend this movie solely for the purpose of enticing laughter that is if you appreciate the good movies like la confidential
<START> wow i think they made this movie to torture people there are no words for how much i hated this film i could have been cleaning my room instead i love bad melodrama as much as the next person but come on
<START> i have a old daughter and before this movie she was all about the disney princesses now she watched this movie and all she can talk about is princess genevieve and all her sisters i definitely recommend this movie for all young girls this movie is one of the best from the barbie collection it shows all the good values that any mother would love to encourage on there little girls with the great songs and dance moves it gets my daughter up and trying to mimic the moves the extras are also good one even works on how good your memory is i would definitely have say it is a must see for kids and grown ups alike
<START> the film tous directed by claude sautet was not a film to be honest i had ever really heard of until the film forum in nyc said that they would have a 2 week screening of the film with new english subtitles when i also read that it was in the vein of the classic french crime films ala jean pierre melville i jumped at the chance to check it out at best it would rank up with his great works and at worst i would get some good popcorn in a great theater it was well worth the admission as tous is one of those kinds of french films that is just waiting to be re discovered or discovered for the first time with terrific tense diligence sautet keeps the suspense at a tight pitch for the first forty minutes of the film keeping a good if not great middle section and then ending it up with what is always expected with these films but with fascinating motivations by way of the characters with a film in the vein of this sort you know how it will end but it's the cool observant journey that counts br br the film features a performance with some real truth and honesty amid the old school criminal's code by lino ventura as aldo who at the start of the film one of the best beginnings to a film in this genre and country steals a hefty amount of money with his partner in crime when there is a sudden ugly twist of fate on a beach late one night aldo is again on the run with two little kids he gets the aid of eric stark jean paul belmondo a role in tune with le only with a smidgen more humanity and charisma who is also a thief and drives him into paris but there are some problems with some of old business partner's and one old score may be just the right ticket a couple of times the plot may seem to be leisurely but it isn't like melville sautet doesn't allow any fat to his story and it's a very tightly structured film with some good doses of humor here and there i was sometimes grinning at the audacity of the criminals in the beginning chase sequence and also with a particular woman who had a finicky thing with her cat and a fish br br along with a fine score by the great george delerue exceptional cinematography and a mood that is seldom met let alone matched now tous is a reminder of that bridge between the real old school film noir and the latter day crime films gangsters in these new sort of thug life movies have a of the class and honor of the thieves in this film and is a second banana to the works of melville and jules dassin a compliment i assure you that it has a good realistic moral edge helps as well
<START> well for this abomination of a film i wasn't expecting anything good i find steve carell annoying and bruce almighty was pretty good but there is absolutely no reason for it to have a sequel somehow this film was even lower than my expectations even when i didn't have any br br does anyone remember the disney movie noah with tony danza well let's just say that evan almighty completely ripped it off in way too many ways for the movie to remain justifiable actually evan almighty was had the exact same plot outline as noah with the exception of a few technicalities it was nothing but a carbon copy of a far superior movie that was actually funny br br another thing did anyone get sick of wanda sykes' stupid unfunny redundant one liners that were literally in every single scene it was completely ridiculous and just dragged the movie down more and more br br despite the fact that i basically had already seen the film ten years earlier noah evan almighty has to be the most predictable movie i've ever seen i figured out the entire movie from beginning to end within the first five minutes and eventually realized that it was ripping off noah left and right br br in conclusion if you're a little bit unsure of whether or not you want to see evan almighty and are already sick of jonah hill playing the same role in every single movie he's in liked bruce almighty and don't want to see a predictable dry unfunny movie with steve carell trying to act like jim carrey then please don't see this piece of garbage
<START> if u haven't seen vijay in or ghillie go watch it wow its devastatingly hilarious i don't know if the brilliant director was being serious or not there are tons of hot guys in this one look out for someone who calls the one with the brilliant braids devastatingly hot his teeth are brilliant as well vijay rocks cries every 5 seconds it is very deep watch it you won't regret it there are some great laughs in this one if you don't speak tamil learn it then you will get all the inside jokes it is one for the whole family except maybe the violent bits should be skipped i've seen this movie around eleven times and counting br br wow
<START> i remember watching this movie when it came out as a t v movie of the week in the early 1970's br br although i haven't seen this movie in over 30 years i remember how creepy it was the sister's dead body in the basement the storm raging outside the creepy house with no electricity and a killer still on the premises br br they just don't make t v movies like this one anymore elizabeth montgomery was a very underrated actress and i liked her in not only but several of her post bewitched roles such as this one and 1975's the legend of lizzie borden br br i really wish that someone would come out with a dvd that has several of the 1970's t v movie of the week on one dvd wouldn't it be awesome to watch when michael calls bad ronald don't be afraid of the dark crowhaven farm etc all on one dvd i know there is a market for a dvd like this for all of us baby boomers who grew up in the 1960's and 1970's maybe if we are lucky someday someone will offer us a dvd with a great selection of t v movies like this
<START> feisty jackson a winningly spunky performance by gorgeous former playboy playmate jeanne bell goes to hong kong to take out the evil heroin ring that murdered her brother assisted by friendly karate master joe amiable faces opposition from undercover narcotics agent elaine lovely buxom blonde babe pat anderson and romances cocky ruthlessly ambitious charlie essayed with supremely arrogant aplomb by stan shaw while plotting her revenge against nefarious drug kingpin sid an effectively slimy ken metcalfe director h santiago working from a blithely trashy script co written by none other than dick miller crams the lively and eventful 72 minute running time with a plethora of gratuitous distaff nudity and loads of badly staged martial arts fight scenes bell is clearly doubled by a squat guy wearing a giant afro wig the definite sleazy highlight occurs when a topless bell singlehandedly beats up a bunch of thugs in her hotel room raw grainy scratched up cinematography the clumsy use of strenuous slow motion the funky groovin' score the laughably inept fight choreography and the surprisingly gruesome conclusion add immensely to the overall scuzzy fun of this deliciously cheesy grindhouse exploitation hoot
<START> hideously bad movie purportedly about a who wants to be a writer and the incidents that make up casino life moves at a snail's pace dull dull dull virtually everything about this movie is amateurish and unconvincing with one very notable exception the performance of clive owen who is like a rolls royce purring through a slum advice for the casino sequences were allegedly provided by a professional but judging by the way in which they are handled they were completely ignored by the director while casino staff may very well be a different breed to the rest of the world they are nowhere near as witless and booooring as the characters presented in this script odds and ends are thrown into the script in an attempt to provide it with convincing background but would appear to have been jotted down in a list on a cocktail napkin for anyone who makes a living in the casino business as this writer has for the last forty years this is a poverty stricken depiction of their world which even in the farthest and most obscure reaches of england has never been this wanting an appalling insulting mess of a movie that plods and plods and plods along to an idiotic and unconvincing ending american critics loved it
<START> watch this movie it's truly a good ride through the difficulties of making a indie movie and what happens when it blows up in the film maker's face there's a lot of stuff about punk rock and the philosophy behind that movement and it's relationship to this project so if you're into old punk american punk you'll dig it but beware there's a ton of bad acting bits from the failed project that are incorporated yet they do come off funny at times and actually some of the best parts are listening to people who have never been involved in movie making pontificate and what they went through in the three year period that it took to put this together so anyone out there that's about to make a film especially if you haven't been to film school or worked in the field you should watch this and learn from the film maker's mistakes
<START> how awful is it let me count the ways 1 it is a bait and switch movie that starts out being about a ufo investigation then turns into a high pressure sales job for christianity c'mon if the makers of this movie felt so strongly about their message why disguise it it annoys non believers and pushes fence in the opposite direction 2 it's not even a good sales pitch if the characters in this flick asked me to go to church with them i'd run like hell in the opposite direction they're scary 3 the acting is terrible they all behave as if they were in an educational film about etiquette in the workplace 4 the cinematography is home movie bad wait actually its not even that good 5 script bad bad bad all dialogue no action like a tennis match they bounce back and forth between the talking head close ups 6 direction what direction oh there must have been a director there somewhere i challenge you to figure out where br br believe it or not i have some positive comments about this movie the editing seemed professional but couldn't make a difference a good edit of bad material is still a bad movie the opening theme music was actually very good very scary and ufo ish too bad the movie wasn't about ufos br br if you can't tell already here's the bottom line i wasted my money seeing this movie and it made me angry if they had not disguised what this movie was really about i could say it was my fault
<START> and in this series i've been reduced to an annoying jock with a gay hairstyle remember my friend marco who got all the good lines in the books well in this series his one liners put mr freeze to shame remember our uber evil nemesis visser three he's a bald guy with inane catchphrases remember rachel xena the warrior princess and cassie my sensitive and caring love interest they've been turned into mindless bimbos by the 10 writers who decided the original characters weren't cool enough for tv remember the awesome extra terrestial ax who was cool intelligent and really really liked cinnamon buns in this series he's the token alien with an extremely annoying voice remember the witty banter our team had in the books in this series our dialogue is so dreary and stupid it's obvious the writers were pandering to the lowest common denominator br br so forget everything you thought you knew about the it was cassie who became allergic to morphing not rachel thought speak is supposed to echo and visser three and ax rarely if ever appeared as no it has nothing to do with the budget br br i'm not crazy and i'm not lying the jerks are all around us and if you're unlucky one of them might adapt one of your favourite books or series or graphic novels into a really awful tv show you've been warned br br finally television worth watching the very bald visser three br br r 91
