<START> this film was so well paced that i don't think i actually blinked while watching one intense situation after another kept me glued to the set however i would have liked to have seen corey feldman a lot more in this picture he just steals every scene that he is in this could be my favorite grown up corey performance the ending was clever and unlike other films which back away from severing body parts of likeable supporting characters this film goes for it i liked that it was not graphic blood and gore but left more to the viewer's imagination bravo i literally had to wipe sweat from my forehead during this particular torture scene with a paper cutter ultimately the film works because of its likeable lead character and the awesome presence of my all time favorite bad guy james remar 48 hours remember i strongly recommend this film for anyone looking to break a sweat br br
<START> tv movies generally do not receive as much recognition or credit as great films and it is usually for good reason but the 1996 hbo movie the late shift is easily one of the best tv movies ever based on bill carter's revealing book the late shift is about nbc's handling of late night talk show hosts david letterman and jay leno when it came to filling the vacant tonight show seat once held by johnny carson we see what happens in front of the camera author bill carter director betty thomas and hbo show us what happened when the cameras were turned off br br unfortunately we can never really know for sure what really happened when it came time for johnny carson to be replaced by either letterman or leno but the late shift gives us an interesting possible reality while simply being a very well made film the late shift also does a really good job of portraying all the sides fairly equally although you wonder if the film makes letterman and leno out to be too nice of guys especially leno who seems a bit too saintly br br the performances are also very good in a very deserving golden globe winning performance kathy bates plays leno's extremely pushy manager helen who according to carter and the book film was very problematic for the studio and leno the real actually suited bill carter for over this portrayal john michael higgins breaks out of his usual gigs of getting small quirky comedy parts and gives an excellent performance as david letterman giving an excellent impression of letterman but also creating a dimensional and relatable character daniel roebuck gives a good performance as leno but does not quite measure up to some of the other talent in the film roebuck probably did the best anyone could have done it is just looks hammy whenever anyone tries to do an impression or portrayal of leno bob balaban a squirrelly warren littlefield treat williams a magician like michael and ed begley jr a pompous rod perth also give memorable supporting performances br br the late shift certainly is one of the best made for tv movies i have ever seen i suppose if one has not watched david letterman or jay leno the late shift might not be for them but it is an interesting film for those who get into the late night politics something that has recently reared its ugly head yet again with the 2009 10 conan leno nbc debacle
<START> this is my first review on imdb com and probably first ever written review of a film i've done of my own accord not for some class assignment i think that fact alone says something about this movie not a good thing i am no seasoned journalist or critic though i have seen my fair share of movies but i found this particular film so terribly painful to watch it was necessary for my own peace of mind to vent about the experience where better to do it than imdb as i forced myself to sit through the movie physically writhing from the inability to connect the dots i was sure there would be some light at the end of the tunnel a revelation to explain what in ll was going on the movie ended and i was as enlightened as dog after several rewinds to review certain scenes i still could conclude nothing sensible i found myself wanting to yell does this make sense to anybody i would recommend to not waste your time but then again if i were you i'd probably want to experience it myself if that's the case bring a crossword puzzle or something so you don't get bored
<START> the original story had all the ingredients to make a thoroughly gripping film but failed miserably in this version as even cherie was a pale imitation of what she was to become so much so that i suspected that she must turn out to be an accomplice right to the end sherlock holmes was turned into a warrior quite unlike anything every suggested by sir arthur conn doyle in fact it was doctor watson who showed what little common sense that was going the boot blacked midget from the islands looked as though he could not fight his way out of a paper bag and what the villain was doing taking tea in baker street for a denouement was beyond anything that the old scotland yard could ever have dreamed up so consign this tv film to their black museum please
<START> filmmakers made a rather boring everyman's story look interesting and complex by focusing on his wife back at home at the same time we're exposed to a truly original existential french loner br br the film is more than a documentary hardly ever do i feel that i've experienced something that's accidentally profound which makes it all the more profound br br film has visually interesting interior moments absolutely loved the journey the filmmakers took me on quite a lot of europeans in the credits hopefully pbs will screen this so that it reaches a wider audience in the usa
<START> from reading the back of the box my first thought was that this is probably a knock off of saw 2 i couldn't be further from the truth it seemed to me like they gave somebody with a camera phone and 10 00 and told them to make a movie the plot didn't exist and neither did the acting it was almost as if i was watching a silent film about grass growing it didn't surprise me at all to find out later that the entire film was improvised by the end of this film i had lost the will to live and i may have gotten aids just from viewing this piece of cinematic crap it was about 70 minutes that i could have spent doing something that was less painful like jumping off of a building
<START> i went to see this because of snipes statham but honestly chaos is terrible this movie has absolutely nothing going for it it should not have been made br br don't read this review if you don't want to read spoilers cause i'm going to address a lot of plot holes here br br first of all the opening scene it's the great big event that made the two semi lead characters statham and snipes turn crooked but it's boring and mundane only at the very end we get to see what really happened and by the time you won't care anymore also this whole event where one bad guy and his hostage get killed is hardly big enough news to fill hundreds of newspaper articles as referred to in the movie br br then the bank job it doesn't get off the ground for any second the bank robber makes some un needed references to chaos theory which has nothing to do with the whole story by the way the way statham gets summoned is very 'die hard with a vengeance' but more boring then the things that happen in the bank are strange and pointless what's with the safety deposit box there seems to be some plot unfolding there but then it doesn't why go through the trouble of stringing up two people when it leads to nothing it involves a lot of preparation and it's used for nothing at all why doesn't the swat leader listen to the officer in charge when he tells them to stand down br br and this is only the first 10 minutes it keeps getting worse and worse br br the whole romantic love interest story with the 'he wasn't just a better cop he was a better man' remark to finish it of is painful to watch it's just pointless why would statham's character point out the change in camera position in the footage reviewed from the bank this essentially leads to finding the that will get him all the money why go through the trouble of forging some guys signature and killing him but then not kill the guy that can identify you br br i could go on for ages really but it's like this movie is pointless the whole script is a mess the 'smart' references to chaos theory are really laughable and quite pathetic the plot 'twists' can be seen from miles away and the lead characters seem to be making mistakes all the time it is really painful to watch a movie like this where the audience is taken for granted as dumb popcorn crunching people of which the director hopes they won't see all the plot holes and the over all ridiculous script the scene' at the end only adds to insult it is really really not a good movie in any way br br people who come to see an action film don't get what they come for people who come to see a cop buddy movie don't get it people who come to see a smart thriller don't get that in essence everyone gets the same a huge disappointment and a waste of time and money do yourself a favor and skip this one
<START> i love this movie i just saw it for the first time about 10 hours ago and had to rewind it so that my sister could watch it this movie is so funny there are two times that i was laughing so hard my sides hurt i didn't expect to watch a movie so funny i really only wanted to see it because laura fraser is in it i first saw her in titus which is an awesome movie as well br br like others reviewers have said too many people are expecting a deep moving film you are not going to get it what you will get is humor eye candy and the chance to ask yourself exactly what your perfect mate would look like if you could create them you can also wonder what it would be like to be stuck in the body of the opposite sex br br a hilarious sequence involves justine first seeing herself as a naked man i was cracking up br br i swear this movie is the most imaginative teen film that i have ever seen and it is now my favorite br br just remember why movies were originally created as entertainment not philosophy in motion remember this and you will have a great time watching virtual sexuality
<START> i viewed linda and it is a top rate movie the lives of paul and his wife linda who he adored as a young man and finally married they meet another married couple jeff and stella and the foursome become very good friends but their friendship takes a twisted turn after vacationing together at beach a twist that never returns the married couples to their former status as friends br br linda is a must see the acting by virginia madsen is acceptable however richard thomas steals the movie with his incredible acting and the emotions that he displays br br a wonderful movie lotta honey
<START> manna from heaven is a light comedy that uses exaggeration of human foibles to entertain the audience throughout the film there is the expectation that goodness will surface in each situation the result is that the movie goer finds himself herself sitting with this silly grin on his her face peace in his her heart and high expectations for human kind watching this movie was a most pleasant experience i would venture to say uplifting experience but some would say that sounds corny
<START> the twins effect is a vampire martial arts movie available in cantonese with english subtitles it is a jackie chan production and he does make a special guest appearance although it is not for those that liked shanghai noon knights and the other recent hollywood flicks he has become known for this film is a lot more special than that br br it was originally called the vampire effect but as a very popular chinese female pop duo called the twins charlene choi and gillian chung took the two leading roles the title was changed to cash in on their fame br br the film will appeal to three types of audience those who love martial arts films those who love vampire films and those who loath the rubbish films hollywood generally churns out br br the premise for the film is that vampires are about and a secret society seeks to hunt them down before we all become snacks for the undead this bloody work is carried out by some martial artists who drink a little vampire blood to give them the edge they need well it must be thirsty work things are going pretty much for the course until a particularly nasty european vamp finds out that he if he obtains a set of keys held by all the vampire princes then he can walk around in sunlight etc and generally eat when ever he wants to to say anymore on the plot would spoil the enjoyment of watching the film br br the twins consist of one assigned vampire slayer chung and the sister choi of another it is the twins that really make the film with some of the freshest and funniest acting going the fight scenes they carry out are fast and furious and well choreographed with a mix of genuine athleticism and wire work to add the cherry on the cake the twins are both quite lovely to watch too br br the direction is crisp and the script is sharp there are only 3 things that let this film down the make up for the vampires is quite poor jackie chan seems to be in the film just for the hell of it and adds nothing to its content and some of the slapstick comedy attempted by the male vampire hunter is quite lame thankfully the twins save the day bringing an originality to the film normally only found in european films the best scene for me was one of them choi communicating only by screaming her ability to convey her thoughts through this medium was a comic delight br br their are many other touches of originality in this film i particularly liked the coffin complete with surround sound stereo and tv screen and it is the films' many original touches and acting that stops this from being a tired old flop and turns it into a must see movie
<START> i had the misfortune to see this film recently and have to sit through it a friend purchased it for Â£1 and insisted we watch it as it sounded good from the story on the back cover br br 10 minutes into the film it was apparent that the actors were amateurs and this was an extremely low budget effort br br the scenes were very poorly acted the script was stupid and the story contained many scenes which seemed unnecessarily long just so the movie would be of a reasonable length br br for instance when the lead character rents a warehouse the film spends a ridiculous amount of time on this scene with meaningless dialogue which serves no real purpose or necessity to the plot br br the lead actor is supposedly carrying out revenge on a woman who sleeps with guys to give them hiv he never once thinks to get tested instead he turns into a crazed killer deciding to torture her before killing her and sawing her into pieces br br if this sounds good and you are thinking this will have lots of gore think again this film has no real gory sequences and is quite tame for this type of film br br it does not scare it does not make you think it does not offer fast paced fun it may however put you to sleep it is certain to bore you to tears so please save yourself the despair and follow my heading br br avoid this film 1 2 out of 10 this does not deserve even 1 br br the film was 78 minutes but seemed as if it was 2 1 2 hours
<START> saw this movie last night i don't usually comment good or bad as i think movies are like books in that there is something for everyone and everyone is different tastes vary yadda yadda this movie was bad by the end i thought oh my this is testing my patience how many women really look and live like this when they hit rock bottom and if i could just borrow some cash from mum and carry out to live my fashion designing dreams gosh life would be great i was out for a nice chick date flick with my girl my darling hubby likes watching movies together and i knew this wouldn't be his thing something light and easy on the senses but this was one bad movie we are intelligent and interesting movie watchers and this movie wasn't that annette benning is a great actress she held her own bad bad
<START> see dick work br br see jane work br br dick and jane are married br br they are successful br br they have a son br br they have a nice house br br they have a latino housekeeper br br the housekeeper teaches spanish to the son br br the son speaks spanish br br ha ha br br see dick get promoted br br the pompous ceo is a crook br br see dick take the fall for the pompous ceo br br jane quits her job br br oops br br see dick and jane out of work br br dick jane turn to crime br br as a plot device they decide to rob the ceo br br see the robbery get botched br br see dick jane fund the company's pension plan with the money from the robbery br br yay see the end credits br br okay so you've got the plot beyond that dick and jane careens from one scene to the next one barely connecting with the last one or the next one the whole thing is terribly episodic in nature br br jim carrey didn't bother to bring his a material he just seems bored and slightly ashamed of the whole thing but heck when you're getting paid 20 million plus why bother tea leoni is frantic i guess i would be frantic not to get blamed for this flop br br there's just something sort of off about dick jane carrey and leoni aren't funny and have little chemistry the script isn't funny and it's not well plotted br br but it may be bigger than that the reality of dick and jane is perhaps a little too real maybe it's just not funny for people to lose their jobs in an enron like situation when real life still lacks a happy ending
<START> the lovely yet lethal alexandra stunning statuesque blonde beauty stacie randall who looks absolutely smashing in a tight black leather outfit must find a magic amulet so her evil demonic master faust can cross over into our dimension it's up to fearless rugged cop jonathan graves likable peter to stop her meanwhile two pitifully unfunny comic relief dwarf gnome creatures run amok in los angeles seasoned veteran schlock exploitation expert jim wynorski relates the supremely inane story at a brisk pace and takes none of this foolishness remotely seriously the cast struggle gamely with the silly material the adorable barbara alyn woods as sassy fetching police captain kate raquel as tart sexy hooker jeanine bobby di as graves' bumbling excitable partner scotty peggy as alluring museum curator monica and ace mask as the jolly dr rochelle mark puerile cookie cutter script an amusingly lowbrow sense of no brainer humor chuck bouncy cornball score the two dwarf guys sporting obvious cheap rubber halloween masks j e plain cinematography no tension or gratuitous female nudity to speak of and the tacky less than special effects all further enhance the overall delicious cheesiness of this prime slice of celluloid velveeta an entertainingly brainless piece of lovably lousy dreck
