<START> even a bad julie andrews musical is worth watching and this isn't bad in fact it's quite entertaining actually it's a fascinating study on trying to manipulate a star's personae br br to break julie's goody two shoes mold she plays a german spy english musical hall actress she subsequently went on to take her top off in the movie s o b and play a drag queen in victor victoria and other not so goody girls usually under hubby blake edward's direction br br the movie is admittedly problematic it is hard to feel for her character because she's a german spy we want to love julie but she's on the wrong side of the law probably this is why this movie flopped julie as a german spy our mary poppins our maria van trapp suddenly a german spy br br the romance seems to happen overnight and come from nowhere but never mind it's a musical and it has oh and did i mention hunky rock hudson is in it too br br julie gives a glowing wonderful performance that any musical comedy buff should not miss great ww 1 songs and nice tunes by mancini br br yes the film has plot holes and at times doesn't seem logical for example why is julie and her uncle suddenly pursued by the germans when a minute ago she was spying for them br br but on another note who cares the musical numbers are fun and exciting the costumes and scenery extraordinarily lavish the cinematography quite on the mark br br it has the annoying idiot detectives that blake edwards puts in all his movies yawn br br but it has julie trying desperately to change her image you can imagine dinner with blake and julie julie blake we need to change my image br br blake i will make you a german spy then we will take your clothes off in another movie and then play a transvestite in a another movie they won't recognize you it will be the death of maria von trapp br br fascinating study on changing an image wonderful julie a must see for musical comedy buffs much more entertaining than star

<START> some users are confused about the identity of the armed men walking down the steps in the odessa staircase sequence these men are not but regular army troops br br the arrive at the scene a little later and they are the men on horses slashing at the crowd with their sabers br br to experts on russian history correct me on this if i'm wrong br br but there are a couple of lines in the movie that apparently no one has commented on after the takeover of the potemkin someone in the crowd on shore says kill the jews this is on screen for only a couple of seconds but it is there br br how cruelly typical of history not just in russia but in so many other countries to immediately and instinctively blame jews for any domestic trouble br br perhaps other parts of the movie are not historically factual but the outcry against the jews is all too real comments anyone br br also why can't speakers of english learn to pronounce the name as potyomkin instead of as potemkin there's a need in russian to distinguish the two possible pronunciations of e as either ye or as yo sometimes two dots are used to distinguish these two pronunciations but usually the difference simply has to be memorized
<START> disappointing is the best word i could think for this film especially considering the glowing reviews it receives from some other users br br one thing that really spoils the film is that it is unabashedly partial in both senses of the word not only does it present a very selective description of the games focussing as it does on the us athletics team but it also contains several inaccuracies most of which serve to exaggerate the difficulties the us team faced br br what is even more disturbing is that all the omissions and mistakes appear to glorify us sportsmanship to the exclusion of other athletes with a few celebrated exceptions for example the viewer is led to believe that the us won the majority of medals in the games when in fact they won only one out of four gold medals and one out of 6 total similarly many athletes are portrayed as caricatures of their respective countrymen thus we have an arrogant brit and a wine swilling french this attitude does very little service to the olympic ideals that the film is supposed to celebrate br br in conclusion i believe that this film would appeal to that part of the us audience that is looking for a quick boost of national self esteem those looking for a detailed and historically correct description of the games are advised to look elsewhere
<START> hitchcock made at least 11 films about the ordinary man wrongly accused on the run sometimes really running sometimes not to prove his innocence in a situation beyond his control the first one being the 39 steps which really made him popular in great britain it really is his signature theme br br others include young and innocent saboteur spellbound stage fright strangers on a train i confess to catch a thief the wrong man north by northwest and finally frenzy saboteur starts robert cummings as barry kane a wartime aircraft plant worker during wartime accused of murdering his co worker and best friend during an act of sabotage on the plant he meets up with model patricia martin played by actress priscilla lane during his run from the law and later of course the various nazi fascist sympathizers along the way br br saboteur is mainly like the 39 steps even including similar plot devices such as handcuffs the blonde who doesn't trust the main character in the beginning a race across the country in one case london to scotland and in the other california to new york and meeting the colorful locals along the way and so just like the man who knew too much i believe this is an american remake of one of hitchcock's earlier works br br i think robert cummings was chosen because he comes across as a very ordinary american sort of an everyman with whom the audience can identify i like priscilla lane because her character is a more involved in the action than madeline carroll in the 39 steps and ruth roman in strangers on a train as mentioned elsewhere though otto kruger steals the show as the villain i also liked vaughan performance as the blind uncle his lines are great there are some funny touches all along the way for some comic relief such as road signs featuring priscilla lane's character on them and circus sideshow performers and the truck driver murray contrary to other opinions here there aren't too many characters who believe barry kane's innocence immediately br br there are some slow parts mainly when the action first moves to new york but it picks up quickly when the last planned act of the fifth columnists gets underway br br it's one of my favorite films from hitchcock i put it in my top 5 especially in these days of the new war on terrorism i think it hits home br br it makes you think could my coworker be involved in something evil in fact one of the movie posters for saboteur proclaimed watch out for the man behind your back imagine how that played in the mind of adults during the second world war
<START> if you want to really terrify people choose the devil as your subject after all a good deal of the population believe that he is real therefore you are plugging into a whole meaty swathe of pre existing religious and mythological imagery and bound to cause quite a few nightmares in your young audience br br this episode had all the appearance of a hollywood blockbuster in fact having finished watching it i flicked over to another channel which was playing a recent bond film and quite frankly couldn't split a hair between the differences in sfx with a minimal cast restricted by its situation on a space station complete with overwhelming panoramic views of an universe it was as claustrophobic and intense as alien or event the black hole outside made it feel as if the black weight of dark matter was pressing the station onto the planet and to whatever was sealed inside and as the horror is intensified by the knowledge that the dr and rose are stranded the sinister ood start channelling a disembodied voice and then the characters start being picked off one by one br br this has all the best qualities of the cream of this new dr who endeavour girl in the fireplace and the empty child emotionally engaging frightening and humorous all without seeming cheesy this is far scarier than any amount of flying daleks but it has to be asked is this really suitable viewing for children this is not a family friendly episode pity the poor parent who has to put their kids to bed after this one i'm not sure i even want to see what happens next
<START> not really sure what to make of this movie very weird very artsy not the kind of movie you watch because it has a compelling plot or characters more like the kind of movie that you can't stop watching because of the horrifically fascinating things happening on screen although the first time my wife watched this she couldn't make it all the way through too disturbing for her runs a bit long but nonetheless a worthwhile viewing for those interested in very dark movies
<START> dreadful i hope i can save two hours of your life by warning you away from this i just finished watching the film btw br br i love good cross genre films this isn't one of them show me a sci fi musical a dramatic farce or a religious action flick i'll watch them all but you cannot just throw epigrammatic quips at a rambling camp schlock horror fest and draw my applause br br i love philosophical films this isn't one of them anyone who is amazed at the depths of intellect plumbed in this film hasn't read a good book lately or ever the thought provoking dialogue is trite at best perhaps it lost something in the translation br br i love a good horror comedy this isn't one of them laugh i thought i'd never start squirm only when trying to think of a polite way to phrase my feedback of the film to the friend who recommended it br br rupert is incongruously good in the setting of this film but even he cannot resurrect it i only wish he had shot the director instead if the zombies br br for shame that the land that gave rise to the inferno should also give rise to this dante would be spinning in his grave
<START> this show has been performed live around the country with a wide variety of casts i saw it first in the provincetown production the first summer it was in p town 2001 before it was curiously enough banned in that overwhelmingly gay resort the codes which resulted in its closing have since been i saw it again later in the off broadway long running production in new york oddly enough the p town production was far better than the new york one fresher cuter more spirited and funnier but that was only in the 2001 showing subsequent attempts to clone the production bare naked lads in 2007 were definitely third rate this filmed production features a los angelos production cast and it is as other comments have suggested not the best i would rate it somewhere in between the top notch 2001 p town production and the third rate bare naked lads p town show from last summer
<START> is it really possible that so many people in this film believe that the girl is a witch just because she has dark hair and wears dark make up she is supposed to be a witch and i got the impression that the film tries to present her as someone who is different someone nobody understands she is just a teenager and some dumb girl in her high school says she is a witch and everyone believes her besides brandi is either portrayed very badly or the character itself is made to be so fake she didn't convince me that she is not a witch not that i would believe it in the first place everyone accuses her of being a witch and she acts like she is not entirely sure whether she is a witch or not and the way they dressed her for the court i see old ladies every day who wouldn't wear that even if it was the last outfit in the world brother also wasn't very convincing but you see the important thing is that she put that bad bad girl back on to the ground at the end of the film she has won the battle proved to everyone she is different br br this is probably one of the worst films i've watched in may life way too shallow i only watched it because there was nothing else on the tv at the moment so i was condemned to this trash please do not waste your time watching this film when i saw the 7 star rating i nearly fainted it doesn't deserve it compared to some other films which are also rated with 7 stars
<START> a couple of clarifying comments are in order herschell gordon lewis contributed a brief introduction to the video release of doctor gore aka the body shop wherein he touched upon his collaborative efforts with j g pat patterson director and star of doctor gore patterson concocted the gore effects for the gruesome twosome and a few other lewis movies in the late 60s lewis remarks that whereas 2 000 maniacs was a five gallon film referring to the amount of stage blood required the lewis patterson productions were fifteen gallon pictures lewis does not describe doctor gore as a fifteen gallon film he's only talking about the films he patterson made together lewis has confessed elsewhere that his introduction to doctor gore was improvised before he'd even seen film so take it with a grain of salt br br this may be an unfinished film but like some unfinished novels it does have an ending it's just missing some tissue br br patterson has definite stage presence a dry sense of humor helping to make this simplistic show somewhat more watchable than it should be there's an extremely bare bones plot even blood feast is more complex and a gratingly repetitive musical score by william a bit of nudity lots of skin the entire middle section of the film involves the construction of a perfect woman this is concentrated gore for the bloodthirsty and laughable br br patterson the director is in way over his head but he tries hard to tell his story creatively if it's possible to use frankenstein clichÃ©s creatively but the best reason to see this film on something weird's dvd if possible is that it features a perfect nashville weeper bill a heart dies every minute ain't it the truth
<START> i don't know what it is about this movie the charisma of the two leads their chemistry on screen the chance to see matthau's real life son you can't miss him or art performance but i love it i've seen it a few times and never tire of watching it again rent and enjoy
<START> intelligent nail biting drama came out of nowhere in 1979 and soon was on the cover of every newspaper in america when life imitated the film a nuclear power plant employee in southern california is threatened by superiors when he decides to go public with the real story behind an accident at the plant ostensibly a stuck valve problem a tv news crew's film shows that it was an accident verging on disastrous proportions and worse that safety conditions are being scrubbed to save millions of dollars a cover up that everyone's lives the movie occasionally gets too technical especially in the second half and could use more human interplay however the performances by jack lemmon jane fonda as a puff piece news woman in the right place at the right time and michael douglas as a freelance cameraman are superb the throwaway bits involving nuclear protesters is both entirely accurate and bitterly satirical and the news biz with its corporate structure and vapid yes men is vividly captured 1 2 from
<START> the funniest show ever on tv albeit the humor is not for everyone i realize it would have been hard to keep the show fresh if it had ran longer but it's a shame only six episodes were filmed the gags fly rapidly from the opening credits until the very end when you would see and his boss ed pretending to be in freeze frame as the closing credits rolled during which the criminal still moving would see everyone else motionless and try to escape in another episode the building started collapsing around them as and remained in freeze mode br br leslie nielsen was comedic brilliance as frank and the perfect fit for this show Â how he managed to keep a straight face through some of this is beyond me because the jokes and sight gags came so often and quick you can watch the episodes a 2nd and 3rd time and catch things you missed the first time if you're like me you can watch them over and over and still find yourself laughing even the jokes that made no sense nor seemingly had any reason to them such as the rex hamilton as abraham lincoln tag line in the opening announcement somehow worked Â perhaps they were thrown in there precisely for that reason br br cleverly spoofing the old quinn martin detective cop shows of the 1970s police squad would return from commercial break with the words act two appearing on the screen which was immediately followed by yankees one or some other quip on the opening credits the episode's title would appear on the screen but the announcer would utter a completely different title my favorite jokes and lines from this series are way too numerous to list but one of my favorites is when asks a down on his luck boxer who has previously tanked fights do you think you can beat the champ the boxer responds i can take him blindfolded to which responds back but what if he's not blindfolded a minute later in reference to the boxer's small dingy apartment tells him i'm going to help you get out of this sewer the next thing you see is popping up through a manhole cover on the street in another episode and are questioning a bombing flimsy alibi not believing him says alright let's say you did go the movies after a slight pause and the suspect all look at the camera and in unison say you did go the movies a few moments later when is forced to let the suspected bomber walk free due to lack of evidence he storms away and angrily yells tell that bomber to take off what's seen next is a cop giving the thumbs up signal to a wwii style plane on a runway right outside the building while there were many classic quotes one particularly memorable one was sorry to bother you mrs twice we would have come earlier but your husband wasn't dead then another classic was i'm a Â and i'm a when a visibly shaken kidnap victim's father asks what i do i do Â in classic deadpan fashion responds back well as i understand it you're in the textile business as i said the humor is not for everyone Â many people simply will not get it during the show's brief run i remember the reaction being very mixed some people thought it was absolutely hysterical and one of the funniest things around while others thought it was the stupid and unfunny for me police squad even 20 years later is the funniest thing i've ever seen on tv for younger viewers who enjoy this type of humor but who have never seen police squad because they were too young when the series initially aired i highly recommend i found the six episodes to be even funnier than the subsequent naked gun movies
