<START> what a cast and what a waste of it seriously when a movie has gabriel byrne jamie foxx thandie newton stuart townsend hal holbrook melanie griffith and sylvester stallone in it you would expect some quality the movie is however one big mess with a unlikely story that can't seem to stop putting twist and turns in it yeah i think that they thought they were really being clever with all of it br br the story is not only messy and unlikely it also isn't exactly terribly original it uses elements from earlier and much better poker game based movies but to me it were really the many pointless twist and turns in the movie that did it it made the story such an unlikely one to watch on top of that the script remains filled with a lot of holes silly poker game errors and things that just don't make an awful lot of sense why would any one above all things want to play against a card player that is known as the best cheater in the game this is what the movie is about and builds up to but just didn't ever made a lot of sense to me br br despite that the movie has a great cast it still feels as if most actors were miscast in their roles i don't know what it is about stuart townsend he is a good actor but in most roles he plays he always feels out of place perhaps it are his looks i don't known this basically also was the reason why he got replaced in the lord of the rings the fellowship of the ring also thandie newton isn't much good and actually quite annoying in her female role and what was the point of having melanie griffith in this oh i guess i could go on about the movie its casting and could complaining even some more about the way too limited screen time the jamie foxx character gets but i guess you get my point by now br br damian just isn't much of an original writer director and on top of that he also doesn't handle his own material very well scenes often feel disjointed it tries to put in way too many characters and everything about the movie is shallow and in a way predictable on top of that the movie features some bad editing at times which also doesn't help to make this movie look like one seamless whole the movie was also one major box office bomb and no wonder that damian hasn't made a movie ever since br br a too big mess to make you enjoy this movie br br 4 10
<START> 1980 was certainly a year for bad backwoods slasher movies friday the 13th and the burning may have been the best ones but there were like always a couple of stinkers not far behind like don't go into the woods alone and this one but in all fairness the prey is nowhere near as bad as don't go into the woods but it's still not great either one thing is that it's just boring and acting isn't very good but much better than and this movie actually has some attractive looking females to look at all three of the female leads were stunning one thing what is up with all that pointless wildlife footage it just seemed pointless and it looked as the director used that to just used that to fill up some time space br br so what was there to like about this movie well there were a few laugh out loud cheese moments i couldn't contain a fit of giggles when the final girl did a bizarre type of backwards moon walk to get away from the and there were a few good kill scenes my favourites being the girl suffocated to death with the sleeping bag and the phoney looking br br all in all the prey is dumb boring and the killer i didn't find scary at all this movie could have been a whole lot better
<START> this movie is awful it creates characters not in the book and some of them are ethnic or racial stereotypes including an obnoxious little jewish boy and a politically correct little black girl not to mention the yiddish speaking elves the book was a simple story about belief and this movie is a dark ugly and needlessly scary movie about nothing br br the animation is superb but the story has been ruined by hollywood br br the good thing is that this movie will take a bath in the box office and maybe producers will learn to keep from tampering with a story that needs no improvement hanks was overdone and i don't see why there couldn't have been other actors' voices be used
<START> soderbergh is a fabulous director but nothing he could conjure could beat the amazing cast he gathered for this zenith of sequels clearly he knew this from the get go the term star vehicle has traditionally been used to refer to a movie that builds itself around one star what this film does is net a whole herd of hollywood hot shots and make them shine even brighter than before the last scene says it all all the stars sitting around with nothing happening and nothing being said we just get to see them socialize as though it were a scene from a reality show where george clooney catherine zeta jones matt damon brad pitt and don cheadle are just hanging out being themselves so the story's not important at all at least that's not where the films' greatest pleasures come from if you want a clever heist movie better stick with 11 but if star gazing turns you on this will make your day
<START> this movie is so over the top as to be a borderline comedy laws of physics are broken things explode for no good reason great movie to sit down with a six pack and enjoy do not i repeat do not see this movie sober you will die horrible death
<START> i watched this series out of curiosity wanting to see if they could possibly and with all this modern technology out do cecil b demille's classic epic of 1956 starring charleton heston yul and sir cedric hardwicke of course i was let down yes they had all the biblical characters correct but they didn't give us any of the spectacular theatrical scenes that held your interest throughout the first movie if you going to have a mini series you have to have some scenes the burning bush parting the red sea drowning armies building pyramids could have been done with todays' technology on the scale of blockbuster movies such as lord of the rings or the matrix obviously they didn't want to leave a lasting impression of faith and sacrifice which is much needed in these trouble times
<START> of course i am going to think it was a great movie i recognized several people i didn't see during filming also i was the one playing the guard about an hour into the movie in the death row exercise yard asking for a light for a cigarette i also changed this one scene they had originally had it set to go into the rec yard and straighten out the inmate and turn him around and walk him out the director said it is taking to long what would you do gower i said we need to go in and hook the arms and drag him out backwards that way your camera can stay on his face as we take him off set i also lived at this same prison as a young child as my father was the assistant warden of security i am also a current employee with the tennessee of corrections as a supervisor at the maximum security institution even though a lot of the movie was a joke the part i was in was reality enough also in the bar scene the dancer kicking high in the air and leaving the stage was an actual stripper i use to work with at a club called the classic cat
<START> i've spent quite a while going through all the reviews for this film i'm in total agreement with almost every reviewer in saying that noah's ark is crap crap crap crap crap don't the executives at nbc have any class i feel sick to my stomach for actually watching both parts of this mini series the script is so dumb so pointless and yes totally inaccurate i can understand making a few changes for dramatic purposes but this film changed just about everything in the story god himself is going to go through the trouble to kill off the entire earth's population but he somehow misses one guy that's sailing around trying to sell stuff to noah give me a break and what was up with noah's sons acting like indiana jones saving girls in distress if all that isn't bad enough there's the part where god apologizes to noah and says i'm sorry noah i was wrong newsflash nbc god can not be wrong this film is the most tasteless and disgraceful biblical film ever made
<START> i enjoyed appreciated will view this movie again because i am sure there are subtleties that i missed wonderfully cast no over acting or clichÃ© performance or plot uses a tragic event to reflect multiple relationships how those involved in each relationship are connected or disconnected and perceptions of life what position each one occupies in the relationship in life and how they cope with the confusion joy hurt and disappointment of discovering that things are not what they perceived them to be at first i thought there were observers and the observed but that is not the case we are all connected somehow and our perceived separation is only in small degrees i recommend the movie to everyone especially those in teaching social work religious counseling and every other person that breaths
<START> i don't know what it is about the crew from but everything they produce seems to be genius in its simplicity and stupidity haggard is so incredibly dumb and funny that it's almost comedic excellence sometimes it makes absolutely no sense but who cares br br it made me laugh my ass off a must have for the jackass aficionado
<START> sherman hemsley was great in the jeffersons and especially all in the family he was also very good in amen why on earth would he do this movie this movie has a terrible script and is a waste of a very funny man luis avalos does the best he can but this is awful this movie was the beginning of bankruptcy for sherman hemsley i think he is very funny but this is an awful awful pointless ghost story stick with ghostbusters
<START> i don't think this can legally qualify as film the plot was so flimsy the dialogue so shallow and the lines so terrible that i couldn't believe that someone actually wrote the lines down said holy sh t this is a masterpiece and then actually pitched it to a producer i for one am still dumbfounded and will forever remember this film as the mark of the degeneracy of intelligence in america that and crossroads of course
<START> medical student paula wins a place at an exclusive heidelberg medical school when the body of a young man she met on the train turns up on her dissection table she begins to investigate the mysterious circumstances surrounding his death and uncovers a gruesome conspiracy perpetrated by an secret society operating within the school disturbing and gross lots of scary parts it even has a good script and ending but it has a one poor part what else could you see from this movie it's a good mystery and horror movie but of course if you like it go buy it if you don't there still is not reason to waste your money on this br br rated r for extreme graphic violence sexual situations and profanity
<START> i don't think this movie had the effect on me that was intended seeing american soldiers shooting wounded soldiers from the other side and punching wounded prisoners in their wounds to torture them into making them talk made me root for the other side it certainly made the us forces look anything like the good guys was this supposed to be acceptable
<START> you got to see it to believe it shot in hollywood on the strip in the middle of the sleazy anything goes 70s this cheaply made flick must of really packed the inner city theatres back in the day then again i bet it had a one week run actually its pretty hilarious the acting is dreadful the direction non existent but the hair clothes rotten pre disco music and the general out and out sleaziness of the story are mind boggling sleazy its very sleazy highly if you can find it
