<START> it starts out like a very serious social commentary which quickly makes one think of other clark movies like kids bully etc but then just as quickly it unravels into a direction less mess who is the main character is this a serious film or some gregg araki esquire over the top goofy film is this a skate documentary with moments of dialog inserted i have no clue i found myself watching the clock and wonder when this turd was going to end i kept thinking there would be some big shocker culmination which never came i cut a good 20 minutes out of the movie by fast forwarding through the pointless skate scenes yes it illustrates the changing landscape between the have i got it way back in the beginning kids and bully was done in such a way that i actually felt like i was observing the realities of that group of friends wassup felt very staged poorly constructed and ever worse acting teenage caveman which larry didn't write but did direct was terrible but at least it felt like it was suppose to be a terrible movie that didn't take itself seriously wassup rockers was just plain bad
<START> i've been waiting 30 years to see this film i played the soundtrack album as a teenager and through my 20s recently i located a reasonably priced and i watched it this morning it was in widescreen probably even a 70mm print stereo the colors were quite good very little fading certainly not remastered but i'm very very happy with this clean copy br br now for the film it's pretty good i wouldn't say it's great though there are great scenes in it perhaps may not have been the right director for it but i'll say this for me the center piece of the film was the hurricane scene marvelously staged by one of the great weather scenes of all time br br in fact i'd go as far to say that the acting scenes are better than the musical scenes not that the musical sequences are bad not at all they did lack something though perhaps it was the fact that there are no close ups and very few medium shots it was almost like watching a filming of a stage production perhaps that was the feel that was going after in the end it may not have been the right choice but so it goes it is far from a ruined movie br br having said that not everyone loves the singers on the soundtrack either i always have they are perfect for this film i love the singing voices the actors lip sinking are excellent for the most part i just wish the songs were staged more imaginatively life's two numbers are fine but the intimate numbers don't even feel intimate they just feel far away in spite of that you cannot deny the power of the music and in the end that is what comes through loud and clear once again maybe what was trying to do was to stay out of the way of the incredible music he was working with i believe he had the right idea but perhaps went too far in that direction br br the acting is terrific top kudos goes to the great brock peters who acts and sings the part of crown he is the ultimate we just want him to leave poor bess alone and he doesn't as proud arrogant and nasty as he is sammy davis jr's classic rendition of life is the slick devil himself and a very charismatic one at that arguably davis's best film acting poor bess just can't handle two bad men i'm glad the hermes pan gave davis a tap dance number to do br br dandridge and poitier reportedly not impressed by being in the film really are very sweet together i don't know about chemistry there was more chemistry between dandridge and peters than there was between dandridge and poitier still it worked out fine for dorothy and sidney br br even so i think they should both be proud of the work they did on this film they both managed to bring more than one tear to my eye their characterizations where very 3d and believable sidney poitier's however seems almost out of place in catfish row i couldn't help thinking he was mr in to sir with love very educated and well mannered and spoken fallen on hard times he probably wouldn't have been my first choice for the part of but hey he was a huge star at the time so why not dorothy's bess was as perfect as her carmen jones in fact even more vulnerable this time around carmen was probably the flashier part for her to do br br a very very good film indeed it is two sticks short of what i would call a classic it just doesn't make the ultimate classic grade still there is no reason on earth why the gershwin estate has decided to keep this beautiful film even with all of its flaws hidden from the public as they have may have made some odd choices as a director but the film is nothing to be ashamed and embarrassed about for anyone involved with it it is what it is and there are a lot worse movies than this that are embarrassing out on dvd and in theaters today and bess is not one of them
<START> the first word i can find to describe this movie is awful br br this movie is one of the worst movies i have ever seen first of all is the plot a very thin plot wont comment further on this part and a plot which a lot of movies from this genre is following this makes the movie so bad because you know whats going to happen secondly does the movie contain a lot of questions which never is revealed one of the questions and this is no spoiler is what the hell are the kids doing in that corn thirdly is the characters very bad not only because the movie is bad but also because of the sorry actors they are bad as they can be br br the last thing that make this movie bad is that its a horror movie you are supposed to be scared of the killings or the sudden shocks but you are not scared you a not horrified because you know whats going to happen br br conclusion the movie is as bad as the movie about the killer ants i hoped that it was a very great movie but because the story is bad the actors are bad the film raises a lot of questions and because its not scary the movie is best unseen
<START> oh yawn not another chick flick where the men are all pigs and the women will get even for the abuse they suffered the only difference is that in this film everybody's a pig or has mush for brains i hated this film for the moral issue of why it's right to send a man to prison for life for a murder he didn't commit is that a more immoral act than his abuse and this movie shows all the situational ethics of bad writing i saw it on the cbc's best of britain series if this is britain's best no wonder the british film industry is in trouble br br the only bright spot in this film was david tennant he plays his character as so despicable that i'm likely to spit on the next person who speaks with a scottish accent kate tries to play the victim but comes off in the end as immorally devious as david character they deserve each other br br in the mush for brains category are the parents who see nothing wrong with the obviously psychotic brendan english policemen are made out to be so incompetent that they're unfit to give out traffic tickets the british policeman's union should sue the makers of this film for defamation br br this film isn't worth the electricity it takes to run your dvd to watch it
<START> how can any of you call this propaganda a family film this is nothing but a pc insensitive insult to small town churchgoers the film portrays a woman as the great white savior of some small midwestern town and everyone else in the town mostly men are just mere damsels in distress incapable of honor who can't fend for themselves and have to rely on the main character for redemption this film is just some love affair that the producer has with some undisciplined arrogant pushy little squirt who he expects the audience to admire br br the person who made this movie probably spent his whole life in a seeker sensitive church and had the freedom to dump garbage on small church members as wacky lunatics and not the majority the same people who give money to the salvation army at christmastime collecting donations to help missionaries the poor and the homeless singing fellow shipping and making friends with each other what is wrong with this humble group that offends these self righteous traitors most christians in this world would step in front of a train and give their lives for any person in trouble even if they disagree with them most christians wouldn't mind if the pastor or some church worker of some church took of his or her coat or outer shirt they would not condemn her this film is ridiculous
<START> i saw the film at the brooklyn international film festival world premiere br br a haunting intimate portrait of loneliness and the repercussions of letting it grow and turn into something darker br br the acting of the two leads jessica richard brundage is excellent and makes one wish you had met these characters before they became so damaged br br reminded me in theme of the works of atom egoyan exotica and raymond carver where i'm calling from br br the soundtrack jo crooked fingers is excellent and reinforces moments in the film without drawing attention to itself br br highly recommend the film and the soundtrack
<START> an italian american co production co starring linda blair and david 'the hoff' hasselhoff how could any fan of trashy horror resist such a treat br br well based on the uneventful extremely tedious and utterly nonsensical first forty minutes or so i would have said 'very easily' thankfully however things do eventually get a tad more entertaining with the introduction of several inventive death scenes and for those lucky enough to find an uncut copy a smattering of nudity too unfortunately my copy was optically edited to remove such offensive material br br the hoff stars as gary a photographer who accompanies his beautiful girlfriend leslie leslie cumming to a run down hotel on a seemingly deserted island in order to take pictures for her latest project a book about witches whilst there frustrated gary also hopes to try and cure a bad case of blue balls by relieving leslie of her virginity br br his plans for nookie are scuppered however by the unexpected arrival of property developers freddie and rose brooks robert champagne and annie ross their pregnant daughter jane blair son tommy michael manchester pretty nymphomaniac architect linda sullivan catherine hickland and estate agent jerry rick farnsworth who have come to inspect the island's hotel br br after explaining their unexpected presence on the island gary and leslie are welcomed by the property's new owners and when a violent storm suddenly picks up making it perilous to return to the mainland everyone agrees to spend the night in the old building unfortunately unbeknownst to the hotel's new guests the place is also home to the spirit of an evil witch hildegard knef who requires human sacrifices in order to bring herself back to life one by one victims are pulled into a swirling red vortex which is guaranteed to provide unintentional laughs before meeting a terrible fate br br none of this makes much sense and the acting is atrocious manchester as tommy is particularly bad whilst hasselhoff proves to be one of the better performers which speaks volumes about the others but those viewers who make it past the dreary first half are rewarded with some pretty decent moments of gore rose has her lips sewn together before being roasted alive in a fireplace jerry is crucified and burnt alive linda is tortured by hags and impaled on a swordfish freddie's veins pulsate and erupt in geysers of blood and gary gets stabbed in the back br br oh and leslie is raped by a guy with no lips and blair gets possessed again
<START> the perfect 6 step recipe for a boring middle of the road movie br br 1 take one burnt out rogue ex cop with a bad attitude yet a sensitive touch as well closet concert pianist with a pet cat br br 2 add some cool retro gadgets like a beat up porsche 356 a roaring bike a heavily patched leather jacket and a pair of cowboy boots with holes in the soles br br 3 mix in a couple of free spirit locations e g a trendy sea side apartment and a dedicated diner booth for an office br br 4 spice it up with deep socio romantic themes such as a post divorce traumatized but finally remarrying ex wife a secretly admiring and therefore forgiving waitress a pair of former colleague cops only one of whom is really a complete jerk and a best buddy getting iced over a suitcase full of illegal br br 5 let it simmer for about 90 minutes in a fast paced though not necessarily logical or internally consistent sequence of mediocre action scenes cheap tender moments and sluggish wise cracks br br 6 serve with either a comfortable pillow to sleep straight through it all or something a bit more interesting don't worry even the yellow pages will do
<START> we've seen a story like this before a wife in marital troubles played by nastassja kinski engages in sex with a stranger william baldwin and then wants to go back to her life with husband and girl when she returns home she finds out that her husband has finally found a job everything seems bright however kinski finds out that her husband's new boss is actually the stranger who still shows interest over her and seems to do anything to get what he wants what to do say nothing br br i didn't really like the movie while it wasn't just bad it clearly lacked that something maybe it should've focused more on what's going inside kinski's head nothing to say about the actors themselves i guess baldwin was a good choice for the role of the obsessed boss but the characters seemed somewhat stereotypical acting the way you would see characters acting in your everyday tv films finally the ending totally ruined what could have been an interesting plot br br in my opinion the movie tried to look cool it had a bit of shaky camerawork here and there some stills fast cuts and glamour but in the end i think it fits spelling productions much better same goes for the music otherwise it didn't look that bad br br some might like this but it definitely wasn't my cup of tea to be fair i don't usually watch much this type of thrillers this one felt too long even if it was just an hour and a half long i think it could've worked better as an hour long episode in some tv series there was absolutely no need for some of the scenes especially the shower scene br br my advice try before you buy
<START> buddy holly was a pioneer and victim of the early days of rock 'n' roll the young singer songwriter from texas left his mark on the template of modern music inspired by elvis presley holly would spend a lot of time fighting the system in order to get his rock a billy sound recorded before his untimely death he was mixing lush strings with be bop rhythms holly would take his place with presley chuck berry jerry lee lewis and ricky nelson as the voices of teenage angst br br this easy to watch bio is not without flaws some situations events places and even names were not correct for various reasons what makes this movie so believable is that gary busey did his own singing in the part of holly a well produced soundtrack became a multi million seller br br busey was nominated for an oscar other stars of note are don stroud conrad janis charles martin smith and maria
<START> i like the phrase british post war suburban paranoia that one of the reviewers used it describes so well the kind of films john mills excelled in the october man 1947 the long memory 1952 in between big pictures scott of the antartic 1948 and war and peace 1956 br br this distinctly eric style plot had john mills playing dr howard who promises his friend charles unseen to meet a visiting german actress frieda lisa at the airport a creepy reporter jeffrey windsor lionel jeffries is in his consulting rooms at the time and offers to give him a lift but while he is tracking the actress down windsor informs him she is already in the car waiting something fishy is going on howard is dropped off for his date and thinks no more about it br br the next night he finds her body when he arrives home from work further more he finds his friend charles could not have rung him as he is still in new york and windsor doesn't seem to exist earlier on a patient mrs rene ray who has been referred to him by doctor george mervyn johns tells of her recurring dream about finding a dead body and a brass candlestick with a square base it is a nightmare that is coming true for howard but of course when detective inspector dane roland culver interviews her she denies all knowledge of the conversation the candlestick is later found in the boot of howard's br br when howard is lying low robert brady wilfred hyde white visits him he calls himself a friend he has a photo of windsor that he wants to trade for a box of matches frieda gave howard at the airport howard returns to the flat charles rings and while howard is on the phone an unknown assailant knocks him out and steals the matches who can he trust who hasn't something to hide br br this is a top thriller not quite in the same class as the october man but with john mills doing what he does best playing ordinary men caught up in impossible mysteries br br highly recommended
<START> i'd read all the negative reviews for anna christie you know the gripes about the static camera out dated acting and wordiness of the screenplay but when i viewed it yesterday i found it remarkably affecting and enjoyable yep clarence brown's camera remains stationary for the most part and i'm pretty sure one of the microphones was concealed in the ship's light yep there's a lot of dialogue and no spectacular action sequences it's an early talkie with primitive technical aspects but then there's garbo marie dressler george f marion and charles bickford all proving that great acting is timeless br br i believe anna christie is still one of garbo's most iconic performances and it's a wonderful performance from the divine one in a role that is really quite atypical for her yes we've seen garbo weary and almost beaten yet never with bags under her eyes or her knocking back shots of whiskey garbo played so many delightful costume roles that to see her play a contemporary woman is fascinating she's not weighed down by heavy dresses or make up this performance seems quite raw from garbo br br the plot from the o'neill play follows weary swedish ex prostitute anna and her reunion with her boozy seaman father anna's had enough trouble for any girl of twenty as she tells drunken slovenly marthy dressler in a bar she finds solace in a life at sea and romance with a rough hewn but good hearted fisherman charles bickford but her past threatens to ruin it all br br charles bickford is overlooked in garbo's long line of largely inferior leading men he's one actor who can actually share the screen with her and not get swallowed up by her magical presence the pair have great chemistry together and seemed to enjoy working with one another dressler can never be accused of underplaying and once again the grand dame is up to her old tricks but she's terrific and convincing in her role never annoying as in the dreadful dinner at eight i've never really heard of george f marion before but he was wonderful as garbo's father br br this is pre code and rather gritty and dark by mgm's standards i really enjoyed it and while it may creak in some places it's still wonderful
<START> after 30 years of hiatus once again i immerse myself in the mist of uplifting melancholy the cold slow paced and existential treatment of this crime story comes from a different world melville's world where darkness is pure enlightenment
<START> death promise is a lost 70's exploitation gem and deserves to be seen technically somewhat of a mess and boasting a stock of amateur new yawk types this film never bores i highly recommend tracking this down it's a hoot and a half
<START> a very positive message for our youth is shown in this movie through the sport of rugby as a mean a high school rugby coach leads his players in their behavior and lifestyle on and off the field br br the acting and directing are good the rugby shots are just ok if you know some rugby or really cool if don't know much about it br br i recommend this movie worth watching especially at a point in time when this sport is gaining more and more every day br br the plot is based on a true story taking place in utah the coach portrayed in this movie has been at the helm of the highlanders for over 30 years and loosing only game every 3 years br br enjoy
