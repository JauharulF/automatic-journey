<START> warning spoiler this movie is absolute crap it is not entertainment i haven't the words to describe the disgust that i felt at the end br br this is a badly made movie about the scum of society during the whole movie i kept waiting for it to get better it didn't instead it just kept getting worse and worse br br when i see a movie that is as bad as this one i always try to find at least one good thing to say about it in this case it proved impossible i have not one good thing to say about it how bad did it get well here's an example towards the end dan akroyd smothers and kills vincent d'onofrio while reeves and diaz watch this is not entertainment
<START> black snake moan is uproarious it is over rich fantastically orchestrated strange and cumbersome unique and visionary in continuation of hustle flow brewer paints his portrait of the american south almost as a mythological land one would expect to see in a fantasy or ancient greece epic and yet as far high above us his movies hover they are still rooted rooted in the deepest darkest soil there is br br as in traditional fairy tales brewer paints his portrait in black snake moan using extremes and exaggerations sharp and stark character traits when coupled with such extreme acts as chaining a half naked white girl to a radiator in an attempt to redeem her of her sins exaggerate and emphasize the metaphor the same way such extreme visual techniques such as some characters having colour in pleasantville strengthened the metaphor in that fairy tale film but brewer doesn't begin his film with once upon a time in this film and also in hustle flow brewer presents us with a different fairy tale a dark gothic fable of sex prostitution and ultimately redemption these themes run through the film's veins like blood and resonate and bloom in its dark brooding setting br br but despite these harsh extremes brewer treats his characters like humans and creates extremely well executed three dimensional characterizations in lazarus and rae particularly emphasized with their relationships with friend at the pharmacy angela and mother br br the acting is all around quite perfect one gets the feeling that both christina ricci and samuel l jackson were born to play these roles their characterizations are so intense and so severe it's even more of a challenge for the actors to keep their heads on and craft realistic characters and they succeed admirably samuel l jackson in particular utterly disappears into his character which serves as a polar opposite to most of the character's he's played before with films like pulp fiction jackie brown shaft and others he has crafted for himself a typecast of the ultimate bad ass in black snake moan jackson plays an old broken defeated and earthy character quite unlike anything he's done before and frankly it's just fantastic what comes as quite a surprise though is the casting of justin timberlake and more specifically the fact that he comes across as quite tolerable sure he doesn't have much screen time but like what brewer did with ludicrous in hustle flow he actually gets timberlake to act and do what he is meant to do and not come across as totally unconvincing and irritating br br but what is really so incredibly great about the movie is the atmosphere brewer creates the rural southern locations work to his advantage in creating a dark dirty grimy crusty rugged kind of texture to the entire film which more than fits in with the film's thematic and metaphorical aspects and by utilizing all sorts of elements such as the rising sound of when rae gets her itch or a raging thunderstorm that increases and intensifies as lazarus plays his black snake moan blues number for rae brewer truly manages to create almost a fantasy world an undermined mythology to the rural southern setting and it works so utterly fantastically to craft unique vision br br and one can't talk about a craig brewer film without mentioning the music in hustle flow he utilized a soundtrack of down and dirty street wise hip hop music to emphasize the atmosphere and the vision in this film the music works even better at polishing off and fully representing the unique atmosphere it is a rural blues soundtrack but it's the dirtiest rawest grittiest blues you've ever heard and it sounds just absolutely fantastic br br in all it can be said that had this movie been a simple tale of an old broken lonely god fearing black blues singer redeeming a young white woman who was sexually abused as a child and now suffers from nymphomania there may have not been very much to write home about but this film is not about the plot and not even about the characters as well as they are crafted in the film regardless no this film is about the vision Â and what a unique vision it is it is about the atmosphere the mythology the setting it is about anger fear redemption and most importantly the blues and it's all wrapped up in a unique entertaining stylized and impeccable ribbon brewer has guaranteed himself a spot on the most promising up and coming directors list and with such a solid follow up to a great debut film hustle flow he will definitely be on my radar for future projects br br it also must be mentioned that the film has one of the most fantastic and unique titles i've heard yet
<START> billy crystal is larry a writer who hasn't written and is suspected of murder in throw momma from the train costarring danny devito and anne ramsey the phrase black comedy was invented for this insanity which is a take off on hitchcock's strangers on a train in fact owen devito gets the idea of having larry kill his mother in exchange for owen killing larry's ex from watching that famous film i saw the movie criss cross owen tells larry not that larry knows what he's talking about until it appears it's too late just like strangers larry a writing teacher claims that his ex wife played by kate mulgrew stole his book and put her name on it she has become a big celebrity appearing on oprah where she refers to larry as a beast owen is in larry's class he lives with an abusive neanderthal mother ramsey and has visions of poisoning her sticking a scissors in her head you name it it's not long after seeing strangers on a train that he's in honolulu stalking larry's wife while she's leaning over a boat railing trying to get an earring owen stands behind her and creeps up soon the police are looking for larry to question him but he's at owen's where he's being encouraged to live up to his end of a bargain he had no idea he made you know criss cross there are several scenes copied from strangers which are hilarious i especially loved larry's confession to the sleeping mrs lift owen's mother similar to when guy thinks he's talking to bruno's stepfather br br crystal and devito are complete masters of comic dialogue and timing and will leave you laughing often out loud ramsey is repulsively funny a totally out there performance kim and rob reiner also have roles is crystal's girlfriend and reiner has what amounts to a cameo br br the ending is very clever and the whole film will leave you laughing
<START> the concept of this movie is unique however its execution is less than special when i arrived at the cinema and realised that there were only about 15 people or so in the crowd i thought i had made a mistake however the true mistake was realised in shocking detail when the film has ended and i knew that i had wasted two hours of my life br br without the cruel recordings of the old man and the stupidly funny friend this film would have rated 1 out of ten br br this film is special special because it is probably the worst film ever to be generally released to the public br br there is also the issue of whether you could call it a film or just an advertisement for the probably crummy northwestern br br if you are thinking of watching this film for the plot the humor the filming the locations then don't on the other hand if you like to experience both ends of the film production then go just take a book or a small game or just some novelty item
<START> it has to be said that this film is definitely one of the better bargain bin movies out there i'd feel a bit cheated if i had paid for it but at about Â£1 50 i felt that i definitely got more than my monies worth br br the film can't quite decide if it wants to be mad max or one of the clint eastwood man with no name spaghetti westerns and as such is stacked with clichÃ©s from both even the manic loony who hangs out with the bad guys in mad max is there br br that guy from blade runner also cops a good billing although he only turns up at the beginning and the end of the movie br br favourite bit for me the punch up on top of the oil refinery if you look closely you can see the post apocalyptic rush hour traffic thundering past in the distance as the two protagonists knock seven bells out of each other br br get several in a few pizzas and sit back and enjoy what is ultimately lightweight but entertaining drivel
<START> i do not want to go into a criticism of the movie which i think is for a big budget movie quite exceptional and daring br br i just wanted to remark that i am really fed up with the studios policies and the laws of different states which treat their viewers like children in the database we find at least 4 different versions of the movie according to running time but of course it is likely that there are much more different cuts br br the result is complete confusion and you can never be sure to talk about the same movie unless you live in argentina where the movie runs 115 minutes which sounds quite complete br br later on dvd and video the studios try to rob us further by selling us a presumable director's cut in germany there is already such a version around running approx 110 minutes br br it would be nice if the studios would not only think of the cash they make with their movies but also think of their products as a work of art even at the risk of an unfavourable rating so that i as a viewer don't have to feel cheated and am taken seriously not only as a resource of money
<START> leslie nielson is a very talented actor who made a huge mistake by doing this film it doesn't even come close to being funny the best word to describe it is stupid
<START> she's the man was the funniest movie i have ever seen i laughed so hard that i was crying it was also very romantic channing tatum is absolutely gorgeous and can really act it sure doesn't hurt that he has quite a few shirtless scenes either channing and amanda have amazing chemistry and were absolutely wonderful together i love this movie when you watch make sure to watch the last deleted scene it was a huge mistake to cut that scene because it is one of the best scenes in the movie i highly recommend this movie amanda has never been funnier and channing is going to be a huge star this is just the first of many for this bright new star
<START> this movie is amazing because the fact that the real people portray themselves and their real life experience and do such a good job it's like they're almost living the past over again jia plays himself an actor who quit everything except music and drugs struggling with depression and searching for the meaning of life while being angry at everyone especially the people who care for him most there's moments in the movie that will make you wanna cry because the family especially the father did such a good job however this movie is not for everyone many people who suffer from depression will understand problem and why he does the things he does for example keep himself shut in a dark room or go for walks or bike rides by himself others might see the movie as boring because it's just so real that its almost like a documentary overall this movie is great and deserved an oscar for this movie so did his dad
<START> andrÃ© was a specialist of what the french call theatre de boulevard plays where you find the eternal triangle man wife male or female lover many of his plays gave some of her best parts on stage and the great actress was the main reason to watch them for is not sacha guitry by a long shot the french audience remembers au theatre ce br br still with me plays were not made to be filmed and this one is pretty mediocre material even if the screenwriters call lewis carroll to their rescue i like stewart granger and david niven and ava gardner is eye candy but this might be their worst film being crude predictable even the intervention is ludicrous a knockabout farce around a menage Ã  trois on a desert island where granger would be some kind of robinson niven his friday and gardner his girl friday
<START> i checked out this video expecting to like it wanting to like it i like foreign films i like beautiful cinematography i know the critics liked this film including my favorite roger ebert and i don't mind slow films br br well it's beautiful that's about the best i can say for it the plot is very thin the shots are very long the glances are very meaningful the actors are very sincere and it seems like a very long movie i fell asleep half way though it woke up rewound the tape tried again it was a trial but i made it to the end i didn't like it any better for that
<START> the is set in a small texan town called layton on the eve of halloween as the townspeople treat it like the second coming of christ or something i mean halloween isn't that important is it anyway sheriff pete burton gilliam has been called out to yet another murder as local boy ned co associate producer john william has discovered a body in the local woods could it be the fang lady justin hamilton the central character involved in a local legend about a witch who kills teenagers who knows being the fun sort of guy he is mark director producer robert harvey convinces his missus kelly laurie reeves to ride out to a cemetery that his mate steven josh found the night before for a halloween party the idea of spending the night in a cemetery in the middle of the woods obviously appeals to kelly she agrees along with steven a girl he picked up named camille natalie woods their nerdy friend jerry tim boswell they all set out for a night of fun well as much fun as you can expect to have in an isolated cemetery however they soon discover that the legend of the fang lady is far from the bedtime story many make out br br edited executive produced written directed by christopher the is a pretty rubbish attempt at a horror film the script is very predictable dull doesn't deliver any sort of entertainment value whatsoever in the right hands with a decent budget the could have been an effective horror film but as it is it isn't it moves along at a fair pace but the on screen 'action' is so poor that it doesn't matter i don't quite know what else to say other than the is a really bad film i can't see anyone getting any sort of enjoyment out of it the dialogue is basic the character's are clichÃ©d lifeless while as a whole the film seems a lot longer than the 90 minutes running time there are a few lame attempts at humour which don't sit that well along side the horror elements what was that retard keeping in that cage i'd imagine the budget didn't allow the filmmakers to show it oh if you want to know what happens to jerry at the end then you'll have too keep watching past the end credits as the lame truth is revealed assuming you can actually make it that far of course believe me it takes some doing br br director doesn't do anything special thinks bathing scenes in neon light is stylish i can tell him that it isn't when your film is supposed to be set in the woods there's no atmosphere scares tension excitement or any of the elements that makes a good horror film good forget about decent gore there's a bit when someone eats some skin off an arm a pitchfork stuck through someones throat br br apparently the had a filming budget of 2 which makes it one of the lowest budget films ever to have a commercial release to be brutally honest it shows what about the retarded guy his false joke shop teeth that look ridiculous the terrible special effects the camcorder cinematography the terrible acting from everyone involved that makes it even more of a pain to sit through br br the is straight to video crap it has no redeeming features whatsoever it's low imdb user rating score is fully justified it's one of those films that within half an hour i was looking at the clock wishing the thing would just finish
<START> i hated this film simply put this film is so bad that i almost want to disregard ever watching it and never again mentioning it but on the other hand i can't resist a good bashing and if there's one thing that evan almighty does for the audience it is that it brings out the best criticism br br the film a sequel to the much funnier bruce almighty starts out by reintroducing the audience to evan baxter a mere supporting at best character in the original film that's right this film shows no jim carrey or jennifer not even a small cameo appearance you know your film is bad when the guy that agreed to do ace venture when nature calls won't even have a short walk on role but somehow they manage to keep morgan freeman as god while sitting in the near empty theater bored out of my mind at the lack of comedy i couldn't help but wonder how much money it took to secure freeman for this film then it hit me an hour ago it's just a throwaway role that takes up all of 20 minutes in the 100 minute film god just pops up in between scenes to tell evan to build the ark sure i know morgan freeman won't look at this film in a year and think it's as good as his roles in the shawshank redemption and million dollar baby but it's easy money br br where was i oh yes the plot sometimes it's so hard to keep focused on the plot when you realize that you gave more thought thinking about the plot than the writer of the screenplay did anyway evan steve carell has apparently left his job as a news anchorman for a job as a congressman yeah with no transition in between he never turns to his wife and says i think i want to be a congressman it just happens within the first five minutes and you are forced to deal with the big transition well as a congressman he is to partner for a bill proposed by john goodman's character when suddenly god appears to tell evan to build an ark no hey how you doing how's the weather bit just i want you to build an ark evidence of bad writing evan determines that god is giving him clues to build an ark after noticing a fan hold up a sign saying genesis 6 14 when he's walking past his son whose watching a televised baseball game br br that's basically the plot of evan almighty there are some random supporting cast members that do their best at creating comedy but they don't do very well because they aren't given hardly any screen time it's just your basic run of the mill family building an ark film oh and also there's that obligatory scene where a father has to cancel his hiking plans with his kids and wife because he becomes busy with work they walk off disappointed but they understand as do all the other times in film this has happened just once would i love to see the youngest kid turn to his father and kick him in the chins and tell him you're a real bastard for canceling your plans with us i'm going to turn emo now there's also that drama that you'd expect from the father with his family when they realize the wife actually the three kids have no problem helping dad build an ark that he's gone crazy and he claims god wants him to build a big boat but don't worry his family decides to stick with him oops i just spoiled the drama br br another problem with this film is that there is hardly any good comedy going on i know the decision was made to rate have this be a pg film to get a bigger crowd reaction but i don't think i'm in the minority when i think that family humor is more than just guys getting kicked in the nuts and animals crapping maybe i'm wrong and that's what quality family humor has been reduced to and if it is please bring me more adult comedies so i won't have to sit through anymore of this crap pun not intended br br the ending is extra cheesy all of a sudden the film takes a dramatic cgi filled turn that makes me shudder to think how it is a terrible waste of cgi i bet it was expensive too finally after all that waiting we are told why god wanted evan to build an ark and boy oh boy i hated the reason why i'll spare the details but it was like watching or reading a murder mystery and having the killer turn out to be the person who walked behind the main character for one second and had no lines br br oh and then there's a nice touch at the very end the song gonna make you sweat everybody dance now plays over the credits and we are then subjected to the dancing of the cast i don't get it they spend 100 minutes unsuccessfully making a comedy and then they wrap it up with a thriller i swear i haven't been that scared watching steve carell dance since well never there you have it folks evan almighty is the scariest film of all time br br all in all i thought it was a wasted experience i'm baffled at all the talented actors carell freeman and goodman appearing in this bore fest alongside lauren graham the woman from gilmore girls that has yet to prove to me that she can act her way out of a paper bag but most of all i'm surprised at my will power to actually sit through the whole film without walking out br br rating out of
<START> ever had one of those nights when you couldn't sleep and just turned on the tube to see what was on that is how i ran across this tripe for myself i would have been better served tossing and turning for the 97 minutes i wasted with this film br br in its attempt to be real this movie's characters come off as such gangsta stereotypes that the story should have been the premise for a wayans brothers movie the dialog please it sounded like a white man was trying too hard to write this film br br the editing was horrible one of my favorite scenes involved a car chase down a bunch of narrow alleys cut to the characters being chased though and they are driving through a park complete with baseball fields in the background br br when any of our homies get shot in this film he bleeds miraculously through clothes that have no holes which is more than i can say for the plot of this predictable load of baking soda br br indie films can be great even if they are low on budget and effects but they still need to have some cinematic integrity if i could have given it a 0 i would if you watch it i hope it is on cable because even the cheapest rental would be too much to pay actually 97 minutes was too much to pay
<START> ok when i was little and i mean like 2 or 3 not 6 and 7 barney was one of my favorite shows i then grew out of it and threw all my old barney tapes away so one day as i'm flipping through channels i see that barney now takes place in a and i thought um huh is this the right show once i realized it was i freaked why did they change the show's setting from a school to a ever since then the show has been absolutely terrible and the only reason i'm giving it a 2 is a because i'm nice b because of riff and c because in the old times the show was tolerable now i just hate it hate it br br 2 10
