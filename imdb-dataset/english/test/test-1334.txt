<START> norma shearer dazzles as she is transformed from a brained house wife to an alluring potential divorcee most 1930 films have a creaky edge to them the camera work is pretty sluggish at times but we must forgive these all talking pleasures for their thump a long qualities as a guest of the eccentric globe trotting marie dressler shearer mixes with an odd assortment of lovelorn types including her long lost husband the dialogue is fun oft times clever and the performances on cue shearer and dressler shine the most shearer even shows off her piano expertise in a musical brevity her strange yet appealing posturing and affair with the camera are evident throughout and she hits every emotional note genuinely and on target for its time a good show
<START> evil never looked so bad they meant it br br when a buddy of mine picked this dvd up at a half priced book store i didn't know what to expect i mean based on the title i knew it would be worth a laugh but i didn't realize how laughable it would really be br br the first time through i missed some of the dialogue if you could call it that because we were all too busy poking fun at the plot of the movie it seemed like it was written in filmed in less than a week and they hadn't the budget to go back and fix some of the minor flaws wait did i say minor i meant the exact opposite for instance the main character is credited as but several times throughout the film he is referred to as 'john' br br if the plot holes aren't enough fun for you take a look at the acting nobody seems overly concerned about the zombie raids in their state including the mother of the main character who is missing for days while she sits in front of a fireplace reading a book br br the constraints that the budget puts on the movie are equally as hilarious maybe they didn't have a permit to film wherever they were because during the big motorcycle chase scene the characters are obeying all traffic regulations the zombies who had just killed twenty or so people actually stop at a stop sign coming out of a parking lot i don't even do that but then again i'm not a biker zombie the ending of the movie looks like they just ran out of money it ends so suddenly that it leaves you wanting more on second thought it ends just soon enough br br so if you're looking for a good time with your friends seek out this movie it's a great unintentional comedy
<START> most of this film was okay for a sequel of a sequel of a sequel br br i was impressed by the amount of suspense there was i had actually expecting that to be chucked out the window in favor of gore gore gore it wasn't but there's some pretty ridiculous deaths br br the thing that i disliked however was all of the plot complications those could have been okay if the scriptwriters had taken the time to explain all of them through but what was the purpose of the secret society in the mental institution specifically why were they protected from michael's damage until a certain point what exactly were they going to do with the baby how did jaime lloyd get pregnant for that matter why lock her up for 20 years for her to get pregnant too why did michael kill all his co conspirators in the end why were there fetuses in the lab the actors seemed to have figured it all out once they saw the fetuses but it was never explained to the audience br br if you're just going to watch this film to see people get snuffed then this'll be okay for you however if you can't stand a plot being thrown at you which remains unresolved by the time the credits roll you should go watch something else
<START> this cartoon documents the second encounter between wile e coyote and the roadrunner and is definitely better than their first meeting in fast and furry 1949 br br if measured by aesthetic value then this cartoon would not rank among the top 5 or 6 of the year 1952 regardless this is a very funny short coyote carnivorous chases the roadrunner along the road and gets completely tired out the ingenious scientific latin names of the characters are very original and has been mimicked before in other un related cartoons the coyote collapses and puts on a wonderful expression of i don't know boredom such expressions make this cartoon provide more than its fare share of laughs in seven minutes then he has an idea and another laughable expression is worn the slapstick jokes are all hilarious and mask the fact that it is truly evil to inflict such pain on a poor helpless genius coyote everyone knows but who cares br br the old rocket gag is present too coyote straps himself to a rocket which should produce enough oomph for him to catch up with roadrunner and grab him instead the rocket shoots up into the air and becomes a firework in the distance eat at joe's this classical gag originates from this cartoon though obvious it still makes people laugh br br the highlight truly is the chase through the mineshaft the two wear helmet lights and we see the tunnel through which the two are going with only the lights visible here the comedy reaches a peak a must see sequence maybe even the best sequence in the early days of roadrunner the final touch is provided by the writing of michael maltese as light goes out and he unknowingly lights a match in a room full of explosives the surface is shown where a bunch of cactus jump and spell out the letters yipe after the blast such small things make you laugh all through a mere seven minutes and as soon as it starts the all over the rocket skates are another good idea as is the free drink of water and the anvil on the tight rope a sequence that appears in space jam 1996 to give the results of those away would be useless the free drink proves to be a problem for wile e at the end of the second last sequence namely the rocket skates br br this classical cartoon is littered with fine animation except for the characters though they are animated very well the two characters are very primitive which might be an understatement though at first it may seem weird the humor of the ensuing sequences makes one forget br br if you like vintage jones watch this if you love roadrunner get this on video excellent entertainment rating 8 10
<START> odd one should be able to stumble into tous only by chance it should be on any best of film noir list including imdb's br br lino ventura is as good as ever knowing of his dire delicate family situation gives extra weight to his almost expressionless face and brief dialogues belmondo's restrained performance under firm direction only shows what a wonderful actor he could and should have been br br tous is utterly dry and cold without melville's artistic scenery pretty faces and fancy cars it is almost film noir meet neo realism few hard words to his children describing their life of secrecy from there on get a hold on your throat to the end of the film br br the final sentence of the film a voice over telling of end in no more than ten dry sombre words leaves you with a hard punch in the stomach br br a true jewel in the great crown of french film noir
<START> i consider this film to be a complete masterpiece actually i consider it to be fernando best work and undoubtedly the best of all portuguese movies i don't think you can come across such a zero budget kind of film as impressive and astonishing as this one br br the direction is done with perfection at an incredible fast pace and the music also composed by fragata is mostly excellent the story is creepy and humorous at the same time and it is certainly an advanced study of the old saying misery loves company kind of situations intertwined with a mind boggling mystery a more than perfect recipe to glue the viewers' eyes to the screen from frame one to the last br br it's been called neo hitchcock and i'll agree much like the best hitchcocks it kept me guessing during the entire film and most of my suppositions were far for what ends up being smartly revealed
<START> a ditzy girl yes ditzy is about as complex as her character gets won't take no for an answer and does quirky things to get her husband back it's too far fetched to be believable with such flimsy characters going through the motions but not far fetched enough to be fascinating in the way that say being john malkovich was so it ends up boring br br
<START> the main reason for watching this picture is to savor the brilliant performance of s ms dominates this film with her tremendous presence as nanny the woman who believes in doing good no matter to whom with no strings attached this actress clearly shows a range that is amazing br br thanks to director george wolf for bringing this distinguished cast of some of the best black americans actors together this ensemble group under his tight direction help create the right atmosphere in which the action takes place br br of course none of this would have been possible if ruben santiago hudson hadn't written his wonderful play working with mr wolf perhaps the best theater director of this generation they have opened the play in a way that it evokes that not too distant past where a child lives under the influence of ms crosby when his own parents are not around to take care of him ms crosby becomes the adoring mother of little ruben in a way he represents her reward for having lost her own daughter br br unfortunately there is no time to develop some of the characters as the action solely concentrates in enhancing the relationship between nanny and the young ruben played with such charm by the young marcus carl franklin who is a natural the only thing that could have been done differently was the voice over narration that is at times intrusive as it doesn't clarify or justify what one is seeing frankly just by watching the interaction of the players is self explanatory br br in the background there is always music no matter what hard times these people are going through but nanny's house is full of laughter and that glorious music that takes us back to that era br br aside from ms other notable performances are given by terrence howard one of the rising stars of the moment mos def jeffrey wright marcy gray louis gossett jr delroy lindo rosie perez carmen jimmy and the rest br br ms s deserves to be seen by a wider audience in lackawanna blues she clearly demonstrates she can do anything she wants because of her enormous talent and charisma
<START> the cast and crew of this cheap horror potboiler are more interesting than anything that occurs throughout the movie itself we have barbara payton raymond burr lon chaney jr tom conway paul cavanaugh and woody strode in front of the camera and writer director curt siodmak cinematographer charles van editorial supervisor francis d lyon and production assistant herman cohen behind it the ill fated payton turns the head of virtually every male she comes in contact with deep in the african jungle where she lives on husband plantation doctor conway secretly desires her while hot headed foreman burr's approach is quite literally more hands on on the other hand chaney is surprisingly enough the laid back but knowing authoritarian figure and strode is a native police official the plot is very simple but frankly does not make a whole lot of sense after a particularly agitated dinner complete with thunderstorm burr and cavanaugh art imitating life Â more on that later come to blows in the garden over their affection for payton and conveniently for burr a large snake just happens to be crawling near where cavanaugh hits the ground witnessing the event from behind the bushes enigmatic maid a native witch no less for some inexplicable reason puts a curse on burr who has in the meantime married payton that periodically turns him into a gorilla starting from his very wedding day when his hand briefly turns hirsute consequently burr takes to losing himself in the jungle for days on end Â even if the ape creature itself is barely glimpsed throughout the film it must be said however that the version that i watched ran for just 56 minutes when the 'official' length is elsewhere given as either 66 70 or 76 therefore the film feels understandably rushed and disjointed if never less than campily enjoyable as it culminates in the gorilla's subjectively shot chasing of payton in the jungle with the former being itself pursued by the gun toting chaney and conway to get back to the film's tragic blonde leading lady for a minute after a promising start in movies next to such hollywood legends as james cagney and gary cooper Â in respectively kiss tomorrow goodbye and dallas both 1950 Â her career soon nose dived into b and lesser grade territory thanks to her own 'colorful' off screen antics her most notorious misdemeanor was being the cause of a much publicized bar room brawl between suave husband franchot tone and brutish former lover tom neal which ended with the former in a coma and payton actually deserting him for the latter shortly thereafter but that was not all nymphomaniac payton also boasted that woody strode was among her conquests a controversial issue at the time short lived husband tone having caught infidelities on camera spread the damning photographic evidence around hollywood and this virtually served to end her days as a starlet Â her last film appearance being edgar g murder is my beat 1955 which i happen to have in my unwatched movies pile the last 12 years of her tumultuous life were spent on skid row in the throes of booze drugs prostitution beatings arrests and even a stabbing Â before eventually dying in 1967 in her parents' home at the young age of 39
<START> this is not a movie this is a collection of random shots taken in a fascinating part of the world dubbed over with some random text the footage is not that great and the text is not that great either the end product is excruciatingly dull br br on the dvd turning the commentary on can provide some entertainment value as the director makes a rather deranged argument that this is a sci fi movie it's also fascinating to read about the extraordinary risks and hardship that the crew endured to collect this footage too bad it's rubbish but i think the making of fata morgana would be a fascinating film sort of like 'ed wood was
<START> after stabbing a retarded boy the fifteen years old troubled and pessimist leland p fitzgerald ryan gosling is sent to a juvenile detention his teacher and aspirant writer pearl madison don cheadle gets close and tries to understand him first with intention of writing a book and later becoming his friend leland slowly discloses his sad vision of world showing that he is a sociopath br br the united states of leland is a depressive and interesting study of a character the low paced riveting screenplay discloses pieces of the story like a puzzle there are excellent lines and dialogs the performances are great although the twenty three years old ryan gosling does not convince as a fifteen years old teenager but it seems that a part is missing to complete the puzzle and make the united states of leland an unforgettable movie the disappointing clarification of the why for the violent action of leland against ryan pollard is not convincing or touching indeed shows that this character is a totally deranged sociopath with a weird and sick sight of world further the way allen harris gets pearl's knife is ridiculous my vote is seven br br title brazil o mundo de leland the world of leland
<START> for readers who have already seen one of miyazaki's films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience okay you don't need to read any further now br br i already guess most readers are older than the two protagonists of this picture so i should say is not so much a family film as a chance to remember the feeling of being a small child discovering the world as you wanted to see it making up your own rules and boasting an exuberant enthusiasm at doing things on your own for the first time swerves away from many of the problems that all age films tackle it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems br br the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen they are not simple minded arrogant or naive just curious enthusiastic and learning the ways of the world they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with many films regard children from the outside as the adult looking into a world only a child could enter brings everyone back to that world in there lies the first time to learn and choose what you care about most which the film values with high esteem it is worth it to remember to feel it again
<START> i just re watched this thriller one i had previously believed to be one of hitch's lesser efforts how wrong can you be maybe because i'm older or maybe because the film gets better with every viewing but now i think it's amazing every bit of suspense is wrung out of the tiniest detail and that final scene on the merry go round is just breath taking perfect in every way highly recommended
<START> the only thing in sudden death that outdoes the amount of non stop action is the incredible number of plot holes what with that and the sheer amount of contrivances one could hardly call what's left a storyline to say the screenplay has borrowed from the die hard premise would be to make the world's most blatant understatement br br here we have a troubled hero working in the huge pittsburgh indoor ice rink as a fire marshall on the night of the seventh game of the finals series he gets tickets so he can treat his estranged children to the deciding game and of course spend a little time with them also catching the match but for political reasons is the vice president of the united states raymond j barry when a bunch of incredibly well organised mercenaries capture the v p 's box and demand hundreds of millions in government money our hero darren mccord has his plans more than slightly put out br br each time a new one of these formula flicks is made it seems that all we get in the way of innovation is nastier bad guys and more and more spectacular and gruesome ways in which the good guys dispose of them director and his screenwriter have gone over the top not that this is an original sin in trying to make us loathe the wicked terrorists the horrible baddies go about shooting the secret service the security and the civilians both old and young with gay abandon and with scant regard for the relative threat of each victim br br van damme engages in plenty of cuffs and gunplay heroics and death defying stunts the script asks little of the musclebound european almost everyone else has walk ons apart from powers boothe who seriously overdoes his under written shallow role as the cruelest meanest old ring leader there ever was br br there's a lot of clever cinematography and enough explosive special f x to keep anyone awake but really that's all this action flick has action though there are some nifty sequences nothing could be called outrageously brilliant br br saturday february 10 1996 greater union melbourne
<START> this is a wonderful old fashioned christmas favorite which i try to catch on tv every year if i can it revolves around a martha stewart like journalist named elizabeth lane charmingly portrayed by barbara stanwyck however in contrast to martha this lady is a phony with no domestic skills whatsoever the other cast members effectively complete the story and include dennis morgan jefferson jones reginald gardiner john sloan and sydney greenstreet alexander yardley br br elizabeth lane is a journalist who writes food articles portraying herself as a happily married country homemaker with children in reality she is a single woman living in a new york city apartment and cannot boil an egg her recipes are borrowed from her hungarian chef friend felix elizabeth gets away with her deception until the publisher of her magazine alexander yardley decides he wants a nice old fashioned country christmas and invites himself to visit her bringing with him a returning war hero jefferson jones a sailor who had been shipwrecked yardley demands total honesty of his employees to get out of her predicament and save her deception based career elizabeth borrows the connecticut country home of her longtime architect suitor john sloan a dull fussy chap who has long sought marriage she also borrows a baby actually several to pass off as her own and her sloan's br br of course this scenario makes for much merriment it's a screwball comedy and a charming romance with the added attraction of a christmas atmosphere whenever i think of this movie i picture the falling the tree beautifully decorated the fire roaring in the hearth the turkey roasting and christmas cookies baking br br why did hollywood feel compelled to do a remake i understand there is a 1992 version directed by arnold schwarzenegger and starring dyan cannon kris kristofferson and tony curtis i have not seen this modern adaptation nor do i wish to this old favorite is perfect just the way it is and a holiday 'must see' along with it's a wonderful life white christmas miracle on 34th street and of course all the versions of a christmas carol
