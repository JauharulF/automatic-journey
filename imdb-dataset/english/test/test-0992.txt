<START> i think that you can not imagine how these people really work before i came to the studios to watch the guys work there i actually thought quite the same as you do but since i saw and did the work the guys on that tv show have to do i have to say that they really do deserve respect for what they are doing all day long that really is no easy work and also the actors which in your eyes may be terribly bad are really great people and a lot of them really can act i don't think that the material given to them can really show that as i think this material isn't very good but they are truly good so i don't think that you before you haven't seen these guys doing there work can judge over them and i shouldn't have judged over them as well before i met them but i did and am now terribly ashamed of it so please do not allow yourself to judge over these great people unless you haven't seen them doing there job
<START> this was a movie i came across by accident i was flipping through and saw it was on showtime so i watched it now i watch it at least once a month this is a movie that is filled with symbols that might cause some people to trash it don't listen to people that hate this movie if they want an action movie with expensive f x they should have rented a movie that promises them if you are in the mood for a good sci fi i highly recommend if purchasing on dvd i recommend the alliance atlantic edition of the film it contains many more extras than the dimension films edition
<START> peter hunt started out as a very gifted film editor and got his first stab at directing when he helmed the james bond film on her majesty's secret service considered by many bond fans to be the best of the series other titles in his filmography include epic scale adventure movies like gold and shout at the devil both adapted from wilbur smith novels gulliver's travels is an odd one on his list of films it seems strange that a director of hunt's style and expertise would choose to direct a film of this kind a half live action half animated retelling of jonathan swift's classic satire the film looked twenty years out of date even when it was made and in all honesty it simply doesn't work and there's not a damn thing that hunt with his usual eye for fast paced action or star richard harris who can usually enliven the most stilted of roles can do to rescue this one br br gulliver richard harris is a brilliant medical student living in 17th century bristol his father norman shelley wants him to go to london to make his fortune but gulliver prefers the idea of receiving rather less pay but a heck of a lot more adventure as a ship's surgeon aboard a ship called the during a voyage the is blown off course during a storm and hits a reef the ship sinks and everyone is lost apart from who finds himself washed ashore in the kingdom of when he comes round gulliver finds that the strange land where he has washed ashore is populated by incredibly small humans no taller than his toe to them he looks like a giant they persuade gulliver to help them in a war against another race of tiny people who live on an adjacent island but gulliver doesn't like being manipulated for purposes of war and devastation so he makes plans to br br harris is left to carry the entire film here his first couple of scenes involve other actors but once he is shipwrecked in he spends the rest of the film striding over knee high sets and acting alongside his animated counterparts the idea of mixing live action and animation was not new at the time but it certainly hadn't been done a lot a few disney movies like song of the south so dear to my heart and pete's dragon had tampered with the idea but it was still pretty much in its infancy gulliver's travels is not an especially well animated film but the scenes showing interaction between harris and his cartoon co stars are at least competently done occasionally the film tries to be true to its satirical origins there's one scene where we learn that has gone to war with its neighbour because of eggs and the point seems to be that wars can begin over the most ridiculous of things but at its heart this is very much a kids' film and the satirical overtones are barely dwelled upon everyone involved has done better things during their career Â gulliver's travels might fill an otherwise empty afternoon but apart from that it is a forgettable and underwhelming experience
<START> latest attempt to revive the series actually based on a pretty good idea but without the required gore fx violence for this type of thriller and thus boring good special fx sets costumes etc but the film comes of just plain silly and a near waste of time hopefully the next installment will correct this problem
<START> kevin kline offers a brilliant comic turn in the 1997 comedy in out kline plays howard brackett a small town history teacher who excitedly sits down to watch the academy awards this year because one of his former students matt dillon is a nominee he is nominated for his performance in a film where he plays a gay soldier and when he wins he thanks howard in his speech for inspiring him because howard is gay now this floors howard because he as no clue why thus guy would say this on international television howard is even engaged to be married to joan cusack in an oscar nominated performance so he has no idea where dillon s cameron drake got the idea that he is gay and finds he has to defend himself to everyone at school but is shocked that no one seemed terribly shocked by what cameron said on the oscars howard has a birthday party where he is given birthday presents like the soundtrack to yentl and ends up explaining to his guests why barbra streisand had to make funny lady his parents wilford brimley debbie reynolds are shocked but promise to support their son even if he is gay he also gets a visit from an out of town reporter tom selleck who wants to do an article about him because he's gay too the moment when selleck plants a big kiss right on kline's lips is a classic but all of these little things have howard actually questioning his sexuality and wondering if he really is gay much to the aggravation and frustration of his fiancÃ©e cusack who is beyond confused the scene where she leaves a bar in her wedding gown and stands in the middle of street screaming about the lack of single straight men in the world is a classic but what i like about this movie is the way kline fully invests in the role and was not afraid to look foolish or look gay there is a fabulous scene probably the most famous from the film where he buys a record on how to be macho and the guy on the record is talking about how real men don't dance and a disco tune comes on i will survive if memory serves and the narrator on the record says no matter what you do don't dance but howard can't help himself and he ends up shaking his groove thing all over the room it's hysterically funny and kline plays it with sincerity and gusto the film is not pro or anti gay it's just a deft and amusing character study about a man trying to figure out exactly who he is wonderful film
<START> though this film doesn't stand out particularly from the movie crowd its still a very nice film to sit down and watch with your feet up there maybe the odd one or two mistakes you catch and the cinematic are a little slipshod the film itself is very enjoyable and has a wonderful atmosphere to it the music contributes a lot to the mood of the movie br br the acting is none the less impressive especially the dog he he with john travolta taking the lead of the fun troublesome loving michael other characters feel very genuine and perform very well within the film br br so after a long day at work stick michael on in the evening with some ice cream and enjoy a very quality film in its own right
<START> i am speechless simmons has managed to do something i thought impossible he has made the harlem on gilligan's island look like citizen kane painful cannot even begin to describe this piece of i don't know mind you the premise sounded funny but now that i've seen it it's funny in the way that dropping an anvil on your scrotum is funny br br i won't bother to describe the premise as the title says it all if only to say i don't think there was literally one funny thing in this film not one not even the monkey bite how could one of the funniest characters in the vacation franchise the sleazy white trash eddie randy quaid be made so horrifically unfunny i never felt so much sympathy for an actor in my life i equally pitied the other actors participating in this comedic atrocity miriam flynn catherine eddie's long suffering but sunny wife dana barron the original audrey griswold fred willard and the stunning sung hi lee perhaps the only reason to watch the film if only with the sound off save for that old commie ed asner uncle nick he had it coming alas the audience didn't i only say thank heavens that chevy chase who has been in a slump for years steered clear of this diarrhea splatter it's the smartest career move he ever made br br i don't know if you folks are religious like i am but i know i'll be praying to the lord tonight to add 2 hours if not 2 years to my life to make up for the time i spent in front of the television that i'll never get back otherwise br br hot water burn baby says zero out of 10 stars if you take a few hits off the bong and drink the water maybe 1 10th of a star out of 10
<START> this movie deserved better mike judge's satirical wit brought to light something too many in this country are trying to deny we're getting dumber as a society br br could the 24 hour a day anna nicole coverage be any more proof mike judge paints a frightening future where the dumb survive and thrive makes you stop and think and laugh can you look at the world and not ask are we getting dumber are we being overtaking by the human trash as well as our own trash beware of br br the movie is really funny i'd tell you more of the plot but i don't want to spoil it br br so why release this film with zero promotion could it be that the stupid are already taking over
<START> first i played the second monkey island game and i liked it despite the low quality graphics and sound then a few months later i found out a new game was made i tried it out and liked it a lot first thing you notice is the great graphics the areas are huge colorful and detailed with lots to explore the game requires you to use your brain a lot as always the game is challenging with all point and click games frustrating the jokes haven't gotten old a third time around the animated cut scenes are a great addition to the game also this is the best mi game out there perhaps the best p c game too if you like cartoony games that play like a movie get this game
<START> 17 02 09 more 1969 dir barbet schroeder br br for a film that most viewers have agreed is pretty average i'm impressed by quite how many differing interpretations have been offered of it i've only scoured the web quite briefly and i've already been informed that more is a 19th century style romance an allusion to the story of icarus a plain film full of dull people and of interest only to pink floyd completists it's fair to say then that critical reception is mixed i would argue that these wildly disparate readings of barbet 1969 directorial debut are proof enough that more is anything but a pretty average film br br neither is it a masterpiece of course i approached more as i did easy rider and antonioni's blowup as a 'time film a snapshot of an era despite the differences in pace style and content between these movies they all have similar flaws either vague or downright unlikeable characters acting that seems slightly adrift from reality relaxed editing and abrupt endings that have left viewers indignant these movies never try to be persuasive or meet the audience half way they are what they are man this in itself is not a problem as long as we are left with a souvenir of the experience thankfully more offers several truly memorable images sounds and suggestions to the viewer and this is what saves it br br stefan is a young man who arrives in paris fresh from his studies in germany the first part of the film follows him as he falls in with a group of french hipsters accompanies them to devastatingly cool and self conscious parties and bars before meeting estelle the two characters become sexually and romantically involved and he promises to follow her to ibiza against the advice of his friend charlie this is where the icarus thing comes into play she is the sun he is pursuing her you may now be able to guess how this all ends br br ibiza is an idyll so far away from the bustling urgency of the over populated paris that the naive stefan knows he must be on to a good thing estelle remains elusive and erratic and the island has a less desirable underbelly up until now i had cared little for either of these characters and their unfocused pursuit of somewhere to be really free but once the action is pared down to just these two the film becomes poignant quite suddenly during just one single wistful exchange of dialogue in the remote villa they inhabit the place where their volatile love i went from watching with a fading optimism to being utterly enraptured i can't think of many other films that have done this br br the relationship between stefan and estelle is real and human in that we can see it go from life defining intimacy to disillusionment and cruel coldness they take a lot of drugs and cavort naked on the the rocks and beaches their lives revolve around nothing but each other and the beautiful mediterranean surroundings for a while their situation is the very essence of freedom emotional openness and experience for its own sake but stefan is not in control and this is the downfall of more than just his future on ibiza br br pink floyd's score is a perfect fit for the exoticism the intimacy and the foreboding of more it is one of the most memorable inclusions along with the mosquito netting around bed and their hallucinogenic exuberance around the windmill which appears on the soundtrack album's front cover a scene in which they take acid to escape from heroin withdrawal is illustrative of the fundamental flaws of the couple they cannot without a crash maybe they've come too close to what they wanted br br stefan never makes contact with any family or friends from before his arrival in paris we are left to presume they have no idea where he is while other 1960s counterculture movies dwell on debauchery excess the media and voyeurism schroeder has instead presented us with a story focused upon one man who backs himself into a little corner somewhere in the world and quietly disappears
<START> i really wanted to love this movie and not only cause it had aaron in it but i thought the premise would be cool cause i enjoy movies and shows that revolves around chefs the cinematography was good but besides it being revolved around chefs everything else is just very clichÃ© oh and little miss sunshine was very irritating in this movie although abigail breslin seems to be a bit irritating in every movie she is in cause she plays a lot of roles where she is whinny it has some decent flashes of cooking but food really didn't play a big part in the movie than i expected which was a big disappointment for me this film had some good potential the cast was great but they just had very little to work with i like a good light hearted romantic comedy but this was just bland and longer than it should be cause it felt way longer than it is it's not a terrible movie you just won't miss anything by not watching this movie br br 4 5 10
<START> the great news is that this film is now available on dvd from http com for all those who wish to own it as well as on video this is good news as it is one of my favourite films br br i watched this film for the first time in the 80s and it is compulsory holiday viewing living in the small market town called picturesque and with its own traditions of reenactments and traditions we are also a cosy tight community we are now also faced with large housing developments which threaten to destroy the community and you can see why i love this film first of all and most important there are lashings of snow then there is the lovely legend of the christmas tree and also the christian denouement as all the community cough up the money to help the destitute farmer save his farm and stay in the community the evil developers only after the money are sent packing as the whole town pledge their money to help protect what they have which is very special i love the way the whole community send their message to santa via the post office which is misunderstood by the hero he and his daughter have a long journey to make after the death of the wife and mother of the family there is a likely candidate for this even a sleigh ride and most heartwarming of all is that the taxi driver whose engine is broken is mysteriously given a new one on christmas morning and no one had engineered it there is a lovely moment where denver sings a lullaby and an exciting search great gentle film for everything christmas is really about
<START> today you die was the 4th seagal movie in a mini marathon i just held wow i don't know where to start he seems to mumble his lines more and more as time goes on and the scenes between seagal and where they seem to improv are embarrassing and what did his girlfriend's dreams have to do with anything else in the plot i can't recommend this to anyone but the most die hard seagal fan and even then you are better off with his earlier work of the 4 films in my marathon submerged into the sun foreigner and today you die today was the worst a previous reviewer mentioned this but the usage of stock footage was quite obvious
<START> you have to see this movie it's a big footnote in the history of film when this film was made american film industry reached the bottom of sucking see this movie laugh and feel sorry for yourself for wasting the last 2 hours of your life it's the worst acting i've seen and even worse directing the villains laugh like they're taken from a clown circus and if the guys who did scary movie want to do a parody on superhero movies they only have to take the script from this movie and do a remake called black scorpion iii the threat of really really bad movies who in some way manages to lure the production companies into a sequel suicide
<START> the closer she gets is an artful documentary dealing with the death of a person i actually knew it allows a glimpse into the private moments of the family involved in the most trying time of their lives parents tend to support the work of their children in this case the subject of the documentary went above and beyond she was willing to share her death experience as an act of love for her son it is a most touching work of art weaving the serious serene and lighter sides of life for this family the story is one which can make you laugh but also cry as it addresses issues we all must face i highly recommend this documentary to those unafraid to cry and are willing to deal with the issue of mortality in a most human manner this film will touch you
