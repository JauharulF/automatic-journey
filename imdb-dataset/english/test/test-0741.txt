<START> wow i didn't even know about this movie until i was searching for the name of another mark hamill classic time runner some things are better left unknown mark hamill's role is quite limited i would compare his appearance in this movie to all those appearances of vincent price and christopher lee in those bad horror b movies of the 60's and 70's in those movies they appeared in the the first and last 5 minutes of the movie memorable acting by mark with such great lines as don't try to run you're under arrest did i mention he says that exact thing more than once bill paxton fell into an type spiral of drugs and booze after aliens because he ended up in this movie after waking up on the set after a binge session the hair the hair priceless bill truly should have been game over for bill but somehow he got treatment and went on to better movies this movie blows it is more dull and boring than the crazies at least that movie was crazy this is just boring do not watch this movie sober
<START> i have recently found this film on one of my husband's vhs tapes the blank variety which he uses to record stuff from the telly the film looks as if it was last shown in the eighties and i don't remember having seen it since it has not to my knowledge been released on dvd or vhs although i shall browse around for a copy br br the film tells the story of three young people two girls one on the edge of puberty and the other much younger and a young boy who go to live with their mother's brother and his young mute irish wife his wife also has two brothers who live with them the children's uncle is an unpleasant control freak who forces his young wife to wear a silver collar whilst she watches a marionette show put on by him and her brothers in his br br the eldest girl and one of the irishmen the younger develop a love for each other whilst they live in the same house the girl helps her aunt out in the shop whilst her brother helps his uncle to make things in the workshop br br there are a lot of very disturbing elements to the film there is the uncle's treatment of his wife as some kind of dumb literally possession illustrated by the collar whilst the irish indulge dancing drinking and somewhat forbidden love interestingly though i have seen far more explicit themes played out in other movies made in hollywood today br br makes you wonder whether the british film industry and the bbc have some kind of hidden agenda going on br br still despite it not being a children's movie there are a lot of playful magic moments in it and the one irishman does some beautiful paintings
<START> the real best picture of 1947 also deals with anti semitism and is superior to elia kazan's gentlemen's agreement the eventual winner at that year's academy awards in practically every department near perfect direction john paxton's terse script and j roy hunt's expert expressionist lighting are wonderfully abetted by a superb ensemble cast although robert young playing an easy going methodical and very likable cop and robert mitchum who actually does have the occasional throwaway witty remark are the nominal stars of the film it's oscar nominees robert ryan and gloria grahame as well as paul kelly in the small but pivotal role of grahame's pathetic husband who give the film's most memorable characterizations ryan proved so convincing as a homicidal racist that he was eventually typecast for a while excelling in equally villainous roles in such films as act of violence 1948 caught 1948 the racket 1951 clash by night 1952 the naked spur 1953 and bad day at black rock 1955 the film is also notable for its atypical structure in that ryan's flashback sequence a complete fabrication is shot in a straightforward manner while the actual truth emerges from the hazy distorted recollections of the real protagonist of the film who furthermore isn't even played by any of the film's stars also crossfire was originally to have treated homosexuality as per richard brooks' original source novel the brick foxhole but this taboo subject was unacceptable to the hays office at the time a far cry from the situation we have today when at least 3 gay themed films are in the running for this years' major oscars br br the print utilized for warners' dvd transfer shows some regrettable signs of wear and tear at times but the audio commentary by noir experts james and alain silver is a good one even though i don't happen to share their opinion that career declined steadily after his huac troubles as such excellent pictures as the sniper 1952 the caine mutiny 1954 broken lance 1954 the young lions 1958 warlock 1959 and mirage 1965 amply prove having said that his collaborations at rko with producer adrian scott and screenwriter john paxton murder my sweet 1944 cornered 1945 hopefully this will be part of the next film noir box set from warners and crossfire do constitute his best work in any case in my opinion the latter is not only one of the key films of the 1940s but also one of the finest noirs ever made period
<START> one of the two best films of the year a well filmed well written well put together film with an outstanding cast lau ching wan and his friends wong chi wa anthony wong sun francis ng chun yu jordan chan siu chun cheung man tat had great chemistry before the film and their friendship shows in their performances theresa lee plays her comedic role well though much like a female version of michael wong her gag seems to be the foreign born chinese surrounded by native and i found myself cheering for innovative explosive scenes something i haven't done since 1 the fan boys took over alt asian movies and 2 john woo's hardboiled sure the ending was expected but i feel better cheering for cops than a bunch of young gang members highly enjoyable
<START> thirty years after the 1939 classic film won robert an oscar and made greer garson a star goodbye mr chips overcame a multitude of problems before stumbling to the screen in this musical version original stars rex harrison and samantha eggar were replaced by richard burton and lee remick who in turn were given the heave ho in favor of thankfully peter o'toole and clark andre score was rejected and the one eventually used was composed by unfortunately leslie first time director herbert ross was handed the monumental task of transforming a simple love story that of a man for both his wife and students into a big budget extravaganza that it succeeds as well as it does despite the many obstacles in its way is a testament to its two stars br br arthur chipping is a latin teacher at a boys' school in suburban england where he himself was educated introverted and socially inept he is dedicated to his students but unable to inspire them prior to summer holiday a former student takes him to a london music hall to see an entertainment starring katharine bridges the young lady he hopes to wed the post performance meeting is awkward for all and chips as he is commonly known sets off to explore some of italy's ancient ruins unexpectedly he runs into katharine who has booked a mediterranean cruise to allow her time to mourn a failed love affair and ponder the direction of her career in the time they spend together she discovers a kind and gentle man beneath the befuddled exterior and upon returning to london pursues him in earnest when the fall term begins chips returns to with his young bride and the two settle into a life of quiet domesticity complications arise when aspects of past surface and again when world war ii intrudes in their lives but chips is bolstered by his wife's support and his new found confidence makes him a favorite among the students br br aside from a couple of musical interludes the delightful music hall production number london is london and declaration of love you and i most of songs some of them performed in voice over as the characters explore their emotions are easily forgettable and in no way enhance the film eliminate the score entirely and goodbye mr chips works quite well as a drama terrence script retains elements of the original while expanding upon it and updating it by a couple of decades he has crafted several scenes between chips and katharine that beautifully delineate their devotion to each other and infused a few with comic relief courtesy of friend and cohort over the top actress ursula delightfully played by phillips o'toole's real life wife at the time he also captures life at a british public school the equivalent of a private academy here in the states with unerring perfection br br ross does well as a first time director liberally sprinkling the film with breathtakingly photographed moments the opening credits sequence during which the school anthem echoes in the vast stone hallways of the school perfectly sets the tone for the film costumes and sets are true to the period the students portrayed by non professionals who were enrolled at the school used as handle their various small supporting roles well br br highest praise is reserved for peter o'toole and clark in the lead roles o'toole was long established as a first class dramatic actor so his academy award nominated performance here comes as no surprise clark a veteran of some two dozen b movies in the uk and the previous year's rainbow is absolutely luminous as the music hall soubrette who a theatrical career in favor of life as a wife her golden voice enriches her songs and almost allows us to overlook how insipid most of them are and she more than matches o'toole in their dramatic scenes together the chemistry between the two is palpable and leaves us with no doubt that this is a couple very much in love br br this version of goodbye mr chips is no classic like its predecessor but hardly the disaster many critics described when it was released ignore the score concentrate on the performances and revel in the atmosphere ross has put on the screen it's a pleasant way to spend a rainy afternoon with someone you love
<START> one of the perks of my job is that when things are slow i can watch the movie in our downstairs theater i work in a little 2 screen theater in the cry room and still keep an eye on the concession stand i have seen italian job probably 20 times and i'm still not tired of it the atmosphere reminds me of ocean's eleven although the acting isn't as good mark wahlberg is ok charlize theron appeals to the guys but seth green is awesome in this movie i thought edward norton did a very good job playing a dirtbag although a lot of people disagree i also enjoyed mos def as the explosives expert that's afraid of dogs i highly recommend this movie and will continue to watch it whenever i can
<START> even though i tried to avoid german films recently positive reviews lured me into renting this one there i stand fooled again by german media which has been hyping domestic flicks over and over again to me it is no wonder no one abroad wants to see this crap the idea to make this film is no idea at all i guess some fool read a women's magazine article about speed dating in short the characters which are none dialogue and content are so stunningly trivial trite and clichÃ© ridden i continued watching because i could hardly believe what i saw btw to call the flat theses mechanically delivered by the figures certainly from the aforementioned magazines dialogue would be simply incorrect acting is so over the top i can't remember worse than that on screen in a long time you have to guess the director had has no clue at all amazingly distributors and producers around the country are still wondering why german films with rare exceptions generate no interest world wide why because it's waste of time and money
<START> is a b movie no doubt about it br br of course if you take a look at the cast lineup you might have some high hopes for its entertainment potential this film is stuffed with all of those wonderful character actors that you grew up with the ones with the faces you immediately recognize even though you probably don't know their names it's amazing that the filmmakers were able to get all of these people together on one project almost like they decided to do a b movie actor reunion the cast even includes a couple of really first rate actors david warner who most people will recognize from 'titanic' although my favorite of his roles is jack the ripper in 'time after time' and lance henriksen who many will remember as bishop in 'aliens' these two actors have done some excellent work in their long careers and made some very fine films br br however as impressive as this collection of actors is their talent is never fully manifested on the screen the writers of spent a lot of money to assemble a dream team cast and then missed their golden opportunity because of one important factor the common denominator of all b movies a silly script br br we start with a silly premise the bad guys are caught on tape committing a gruesome murder and they relentlessly pursue the film crew in order to acquire the videotape and destroy the evidence but honestly why bother in the time it takes them to track down the film crew a thousand copies of that tape could be made and circulated to every law enforcement agency and media outlet the criminals don't seem to realize how futile their effort is and they talk as if stealing and destroying the one original videotape is going to solve the whole problem silly but i suppose if the bad guys were so logical there would be no movie br br then there is the dialogue it is at times silly at times clichÃ© and at times unbelievable everything you have come to expect from a b movie of course i have always believed that strong performances can overcome a lot of weaknesses in the material this cast includes actors who are definitely capable of strong performances and although a number of the cast members are not good actors at all and have achieved b movie status quite deservedly one still might be hopeful that the stronger part of the cast would be able to infuse some life into their parts however it's disappointing to see that few of the actors in this film really seem to take the movie seriously enough to give it their best shot there's not much inspiration evident in these performances but then again it's an uninspiring script now i'll admit that some of the more colorful actors in the cast do manage to add a certain amount of pizazz into the delivery of their lines but honestly even the very fine actors i mentioned earlier seem mostly disinterested and uninvolved with the story br br speaking of the story even if the acting had been of a high enough caliber that it made the dialogue seem a little less cheesy it still would not redeem from the fact that its writer commits the ultimate faux pas of low budget action movie scripts a plot with as many holes as a block of swiss cheese you can watch this movie a hundred times and you still won't figure out how everything adds up in an effort to create suspense and always keep the viewer guessing the writer throws in all kinds of surprises and unexpected twists into his script and ends up with a jigsaw puzzle but when you get to the end you find there are a bunch of pieces that just don't fit anywhere and others that are missing i admire a good thriller that keeps me guessing but creating plot twists that exist just to confuse you and which are not consistent with the rest of the story is amateurish there was so much that was never explained that i felt extremely frustrated at the end if you decide to watch it be prepared to be confused br br i haven't even mentioned all kinds of other silly things about this movie but i won't bother the funny thing is that despite everything i've said i have to admit that i can't give 1 10 stars although i can't exactly put my finger on why i actually found this film to be somewhat likable the silliness can actually be fun at times if you are in the mood for it plus i really like some of these character actors and even though their performances are somewhat lackluster considering their talents i still got a kick out of seeing them br br now i realize i have been rating this film from the standpoint of a serious moviegoer it's entirely possible i have completely missed the point it could be that the filmmakers' intention all along was to make a b movie maybe the silliness is all completely intentional if that's the case and if i were to rate it on those terms i would have to say that is a classic in the genre of tongue in cheek action flicks b movie fans will love seeing all of their favorite actors together in one film will get some chuckles from the script and will be entertained by the healthy dose of guns explosions and chases
<START> this is a great comedy highlighting what it was like to live next door to racist bigot but also shows that both main characters are actually as bad as each other based on the hit itv comedy this is very politically incorrect and its all the better for it comedy after all is to entertain the movies only real drawback is there isnt much of a plot however the cast are as great as usual jack and rudolph walker make one hell of a team playing off each other in a kind of way it's been many years since i saw this movie and last week was finally able to buy it on dvd the fact that the movie still contains genuine laugh out loud moments means that i can recommend this movie just like i would of back in the 1970's
<START> starts off with fulci playing a version of himself writing down some ideas for how people could die followed by a fake looking cat eating what is presumably a brain the copy i watched was dubbed in english which i always hate but i was particularly disappointed not to get to hear fulci in his own voice br br fulci is in a sort of feverish state working on his latest horror movie his stomach turns when he sees things that resemble effects from his movie and he starts to that he is witnessing acts of horror he visits a psychiatrist who hypnotizes him and unfortunately he does not have his improved mental health in mind i was reminded of the psychiatrist played by david cronenberg in clive barker's 1990 the shrink in this one is played by david l thompson who is pretty bad probably a real life friend of fulci's he has a big toothy grin when he kills people though this may be fulci's black humor at work which i thought was pretty poor too br br the movie is composed of a lot of clips from fulci's movies either as if fulci is on the set directing them watching recordings on tvs or witnessing the acts i've never been too much of a fan of clip shows in tv series and i also think things like charles band's full moon entertainment cutting their old films down and putting three such cuts together as new anthologies are pretty lame i guess they need to make money br br the shrink in cat in the brain makes reference to the theory that violence in movies begets violence in real life one of fulci's co workers talks about having a documentary crew follow fulci to see what his life is like lots of self referential stuff like this br br in the end some of the characters sail away on a boat named perversion
<START> a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever that's how i'd describe this painfully dreary time waster of a film so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies i've seen it isn't even an achievement as a so bad it's good or so bad it's memorable movie the idea of lassie turning bad is intriguing but so little actually happens and so slowly that you feel your life slipping away while sitting there watching the non actors read their lines off cue cards waiting for their measly paychecks br br it's an empty hollow shell of a movie seriously it's not worth wasting your or your kid's time on unless you're both heavily medicated that's all i have to say br br avoid avoid avoid it will drive you barking mad hahahah get it barking br br sorry i've had a rough week
<START> i suffered the watching of this movie at festival last month if there would be a possibility of a movie to avoid its existence this should be the first in the list marÃ­a isn't a director she is just a dumb woman that pretends that holding a camera with the hand and shout action makes her a professional film maker what a mistake the movie itself is pointless and a total waste of good actors that could be doing something better in another project val kilmer does nothing but place his face in front of the camera his character don't have specific weight in the movie the same thing can tell about joss ackland vincent gallo or joaquim de almeida it's a shame the way rade serbedzija's character has been written warning spoilers br br he spends most of the time alone in the tunnels talking with himself in the way now i'm doing this now i'm low of bats i'll search in my bag now i'm turning left now i'm turning right only to bring the audience a clear idea about his actions it's simply nonsense and proves the lack of talent of the director end of spoilers br br the usual joke about this piece of garbage among the audience was that the title of the movie itself brought the clue about the rating everyone should give it zero
<START> a true comedy the dialog is fast and very witty eleanor parker at her physical peak flynn as only flynn can be the charming although now past his prime most of the scenes between the principals are short so the movie moves well if you haven't seen this movie please give a look you will be surprised at flynn's comedy timing the scenes between him tucker parker and sakal are hilarious just on the basis of the outfits worn by the most attractive parker this movie is worth a look the romance of this 40's movie will not be lost on those so inclined to watch movies from hollywood's golden past my bet is that never say goodbye won't disappoint
<START> isabelle huppert portrays a talented female piano teacher who is staid unfriendly and distant in public and bitter towards her students privately she seethes with violence and frustration and her sexual life is solitary and perverse she lives with her overbearing mother who obsessively drives her to become noticed and so advance in life as a talented pianist the key to the characters of both mother and daughter is ' these characters cannot change their impulses anymore than a rabbit caught in headlights can avoid death br br the piano teacher meets a young attractive talented pianist who from the beginning is attracted to her they start a relationship in the most unconventional way but from the outset she makes perverse and violent terms that he must perform on her which sickens him enough to want to terminate the relationship before it has really begun br br the film ties itself to the female lead isabelle huppert amazes with a brutal completely convincing performance as the piano teacher she cleverly shows a woman who is drawn to beauty and perversion but her violence is fed by her perverted impulses as a film that is so character driven you know it would not work half as well had she acted poorly br br this is powerful intelligently acted and intelligently and sensitively adapted from the novel the camera work also suits the film there are what i can only think to call framing shots where the director holds a scene and forces the eye to dart about this is done extremely effectively against a blank bathroom wall and is a further testament to the director's mastery br br expect to be disturbed and sickened by this film but be brave have the guts to go and see it this is a very private look into essentially one person's life but do not expect to be entertained in the hollywood sense there are no car chases in this film
<START> it is one of the best of stephen chow i give it a nine out of ten br br i was surprised to see that shaolin soccer was rated on top of all movies unbelievable
