<START> this is the 1990's tv show not the movie from 1979 it looks to be three episodes totaling just under 90 minutes before watching i thought it was one of the movie versions and i noticed right away it had a tv show feel to it i didn't care for it too much i just felt the story wasn't there and there wasn't much in the way of excitement or drama i was looking at the time elapsed on my dvd player frequently as i was really bored i also thought some of the dialogue was to put it politely not good plus i thought the acting left a lot to be desired but that's just me however it is good clean wholesome family entertainment there's certainly nothing offensive here kids will likely enjoy it for me the black stallion is 4 10
<START> it was a fascinating story waiting to be told fat man and little boy takes us inside the trials and tribulations of a group of top american scientists handed a lofty task during the second world war beat everyone else to the atomic bomb sequestered in a heavily guarded new mexico compound the brainiacs slowly turn the idea from ambitious concept into immense reality br br fat man and little boy is one of those films that requires your close attention it's a real thinking person's movie not only from the scientific aspect of developing a seemingly impossible weapon but also the moral implications of contributing to killing on a massive scale characters are constantly torn between that reality and their wartime duty as americans the film is never preachy about however leaving us free to marvel at the enormity of the inner turmoil these men face the performances deserve special mention as well paul newman delivers one of his great understated performances as the general in charge of delivering the ultimate big stick for the allied forces br br where fat man and little boy loses much of its traction is in the unnecessary romantic component dwight schultz as the leader of the scientific team struggles with his affections for his family and his relentless obsession with his big project director roland apparently felt the need to explore the more human angles of this story but the romantic overtones serve primarily as a distraction besides it's the interaction among the scientists and their military hierarchy that give us the greatest insight into the thoughts and feelings of these brilliant men br br still it's difficult not to recommend fat man and little boy it's a largely forgotten gem that puts a human face put on one of the most intriguing stories in human history
<START> forget any angst ridden documentary this film is really an out and out comedy about a 40 yer old porn star whose goal in life is to sing junky circuit party songs the only problem colton ford can't sing and the film cuts away whenever he appears to be ready to burst into song yet ford and equally vapid boyfriend blake harper whine and and run around in their tank tops determined to make dreams come true even funnier is manager kyle who appears to have the i q of a turnip and whose collagen injected lips look like a bee stung him how can grown men be so self delusional ha ha as for the documentary the filmmakers don't appear to have any pov and the film is poorly structured and wildly uneven very little background information is provided about the three leads such an inclusion might have made the three seem like something other than aging west hollywood stereotypes
<START> peter watkins' rarely seen punishment park is a brutality laced uncompromised political weapon set across a never ending an unapologetically left leaning anti authoritarian abuse fest the escapades at first appear to be so over the top militaristic and sickening that it could come off as some distant fantastical dystopian alternate history one harry would even enjoy but once we delve deeper in and really pay attention to the abhorrent diatribe spouting out of those presiding over the tent topped tribunal as well as the shotgun toting guards overseeing the bloody affair our eyes are truly opened suddenly we realize just how prescient watkins' film making is as much of this is the kind of neo con talking points about youth culture and the legality of divergent thought tossed around by politicians today granted much of it was drivel pouring out then as well but it really shows us how little has changed and informs of how in some ways we are closer to such a world where punishment parks would be a real and frightening operation br br the main players in nearly every scene are seasoned non actors mostly chosen for their rash political views and desire to get them on camera this lends an unprecedented heap of authenticity to the entire experience as we never even for a second question the reality of all the chaos shot documentary style with 16mm film this appears like a gritty documentation of some despicable government test project that was classified until found years later at least it appears to have that history to it now maybe not as much when it was barely released but this gives an added weight to all the proceedings and helps draw you into this incredible not so alternate universe of torture for convicted
<START> tom clancy uses nevsky in his book red storm rising in the book was show in theatres across russia as a prelude to the soviet invasion of west germany i felt i had to check it out it was the cinematography was magnificent and storyline incredible i do not regret watching this movie and added in to my collection
<START> i had to lower my rating of this movie to a 4 due to the terrible sound track i'm pretty sure it was not a problem with me or the tape because some actors and the sound track sounded great but most of the actors voices were distorted or garbled beyond recognition especially for non brits br br there are plenty of cute little twists that would make this an enjoyable movie ending up in bosnia by mistake is great but much of the humor was lost in the sound
<START> this is a clever story about relationships and a display of three main categories of players in the game of relationships playboys max manipulative women alice and the fools who may be indeed in love lisa muriel and lucien br br max and alice are very unlikeable and perhaps despicable characters but who are always in control in the game leaving their partners around in the dark but as the profusely discussed ending tells us as veteran players as max and alice were they would be happy to part ways anytime they see fit as if the game was just announced to be over and each one of them could not care less to get on with his or her own life and play another game with some other anonymous people when another opportunity presented itself lisa muriel and lucien might be the ones who felt like investing something real in a relationship only not being able to realise that they were the baits in the game and the ultimate losers as far as what we were shown is concerned who knows if they are also advance players of some sort in their worlds not shown to us on screen br br this is a very fast paced delicately crafted and seductively witty story with an enticing execution by the cast it also deserves some deeper thinking how much is real in a game of relationship
<START> this was pretty bad from bad acting bad technical details bad camera shots and bad audio even though i was watching a dvd sometimes i couldn't hear what they were saying sometimes it was blowing my speakers even within the same conversation the plot was predictable and the characters consisted of mostly unbelievable neurotics bi and caricatures character development was awful the bratty little sister why was she even written into the script the nagging mom again what purpose the whiny girlfriend why didn't he dump her long ago the 'dark gang how original couldn't think of a better name i guess the drug dealer's hot girlfriend gotta have a hot latina if your going to have la gangs i guess but really etc etc can't believe i watched the whole thing
<START> to quote jason connery and mark ryan on one of the many dvd commentaries that wobbly music over the htv logo was enough to get me jumping from whatever i was doing to glue my face against the screen for an hour the individual stories contained within the series were excellent and the character development was wonderful robin of goes through a very convincing journey over the two series he appears in even though his departure from the programme was unplanned marian also develops her relationship with both of sons very well br br after languishing for many years in tv wasteland i re encountered the series on sky 1 in the uk in the mid nineties and was even more impressed that the series seemed even better than i remembered this is no children's television programme it deals with witchcraft treason rebellion and injustice and it manages to do it without showing too much blood as far as i can recall you only see a bit of the red stuff in the pilot film episodes 1 and 2 on the dvd set the dvds are great containing a wealth of extras including cast commentaries on series 3 only the jason connery robin and crew commentaries for series 1 and 2 the picture quality is very good and the remixed and remastered surround sound is amazing br br the idea of freedom is important freedom prevails nothing's forgotten nothing's ever forgotten
<START> left behind when the ostensible heroine's venus makes any man whose sexual advances are forced upon her ahem disappear fiona this is my career horsey is an attractive enough although i found her acting chops to be suspect with better direction and a better vehicle she might improve likely as not her leading man paul mine too conway never will proving to be one of the most unlikeable unattractive love interests i've seen in a film in recent memory there's some nonsense involving siamese twins a frying pan to the head obvious hot dog joke a reasonable amount of bare boobies production values in the low budget to laughable range scripting that would make syd field cry acting that by and large only an ed wood could love and camera work a step above pedestrian the vagina gimmick might well have made for an interesting horror movie but angst botches the premise strictly for stoned out viewing and even then you could do much better law or revelation still holds
<START> even with it's low budget this movie could have been worth watching if there was a story to tell here it started out pretty good and fairly engaging and believable the actors and characters were interesting although there wasn't much character development my favorite scene was when they were all eating their rations some seemed to hate it and some seemed to think it wasn't too bad the story starts out very airtight and then br br and then it dipped into a little horror which is usually a death sentence for most sci fi suddenly no scientific basis for any of the goings on no real believable end game for the villain no real explanation of what's going on generally if a movie has to use the f word for every other word it usually spirals down from there too i still get offended believe it or not i often wonder what inspires people to make bad sci fi isn't there a universe of fantastically good stories out there don't people feel like they are wasting their time and everyone else's when they put out stuff like this why do we get so much mediocre sci fi like this no female actors characters either none at all this had the makings to be another predator but alas fell far far short br br my final comment poor editing and finally too low a budget to build a real campfire what gives br br my advice for any low budget sci fi movie production companies out there make sure you got a good story before you start and edit out bad special effects it's better we see nothing than something that looks fake or ridiculously fuzzy
<START> in 1913 in carlton mine pennsylvania the cruel owner of a mine uses poor children in the exploration and after an explosion a group of children is buried alive on the present days karen lori has just lost her husband after a long period of terminal disease when the family savings have been spent in the treatment without any money she moves with her daughters sarah scout taylor compton and emma chloe to an old house in the mountains that belonged to her husband karen is advised by her neighbors to stay at home in the night and sarah hears that there are zombies in the area when emma becomes friend of mary he mother believes she is an imaginary friend however when sarah's friends are attacked and eaten alive by zombie children and emma vanishes karen and sarah chase her nearby the mine br br wicked little things is not a totally bad movie the acting is good the make up is creepy and the cinematography and the music score are excellent however the story and consequently the screenplay are very weak indeed a bad collection of clichÃ©s the beginning is reasonable with a widow moving to a house in a remote location because the family spent all their resources with the illness of the patriarch but when she arrives coincidently the little zombies attack people without any consequences for example families do not search the missing persons then the wicked mr carlton comes to the place with the most disgusting attitudes a typical clichÃ©s that he will die in the end there is no explanation why the children attacked innocent people and why they should stop after killing mr carlton when sarah is running away with her mother and says that she is tired and cannot run anymore it is one the most stupid lines that i have ever seen in a horror movie my vote is four br br title brazil zombies
<START> taken the idea out of a true diplomatic incident the wind and the lion is a very good adventure film set in the deserts of africa br br el sean connery head of an arab tribe kidnaps an american woman candice bergen and her two children to obtain some concessions for his country out of american president theodore roosevelt brian keith out of this simple plot john milius gets a very complete and enjoyable movie in the genre br br the outdoor dessert locations an impressive color photography very well handled action sequences and perfect settings turn the picture in a sort of epic one with an undeniable sense of greatness the musical score is also remarkable an fits accordingly br br sean connery is very good as the arab leader and proofs he can handle almost any kind of role so is candice bergen as the woman who shows strength under dangerous circumstances but deep inside is scared and has her weaknesses she gets to admire connery and even understand his complete different focus on life arising from their also completely different cultures brian keith plays one of his best roles ever as american president teddy roosevelt br br most entertaining and very good cinematographic sample in the genre give it chance you won't regret it
<START> ok by the time you read this i might have stopped crying this movie was so horrible as to be quite vexing the creatures are kinda cute but the only really good thing about the movie was the growing attachment among the prisoners and their guard after getting marooned on this daffy island even seeing barbara bach with her hair all was no payoff for buying this sterling bit of poop she goes about with a whispery i've never used my voice before that just don't wash when one is screaming bloody murder hey the leading man was cute too but i'm still not assuaged this is a cry into your beer ripoff of the good ole island of dr moreau poor richard johnson who was surely born for better things is just unrelievedly bad as the bad guy i mean how bad can a bad guy be ask richard johnson joseph cotten tries hard not to look embarrassed as he staggers through his cameo appearance in the name of all that's holy don't rent this darned bomb
<START> a somewhat typical bit of filmmaking from this era obviously it was first conceived into this world for the stage but nonetheless a very good film from beginning to end peter o'toole and susannah york get to do their stage performance act for the silver screen and both do it effectively there is very little in the way of story and anyone not familiar with this type of off beat character study may be a little put off by it all in all though a good film in which peter o'toole and susannah york get to overact
