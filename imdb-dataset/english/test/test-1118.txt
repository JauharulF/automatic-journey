<START> jack webb is riveting as a marine corp drill instructor in the d i webb play sgt jim moore a tough but fair marine whose job it is to prepare young teens for possible combat no one could have played this role any better that jack webb as a former marine i can assure that this is the most accurate film dealing with basic training in the corp extremely entertaining
<START> this was another one of those shows that i watched to root out the positive elements and because i've been a nick fan for years some of those would be the stage sets b plots guest stars and a few of the main actors that were good i dabbled in the show through high school as i quickly grew to despise jamie spears along with the other chicks in the show that can't act the only characters i seemed to like were dustin quinn stacey michael logan quinn is a perfect outcast that eventually started to fit in stacey is a complete oddball dustin gets put through a bunch of strange random situations and michael is kind of the comic relief right hand man of logan there's a remarkable difference between the execution acting quality of the b plots that involve them and the a plots that showcased a bunch of screeching girls and an iconic miss perfect repeating bad lines and obsessing over guys this show would have been great if the main plots contained the quality of the side plots but the main plots just don't deliver anything when it recently came back in reruns and i tried to watch it again i was more calloused towards the girls' abysmal acting and had to change the channel however i will give the previously listed characters credit because they did make the show more or less worth my time
<START> do not rent this movie i ended up buying the previously viewed tape of this for 4 00 that was close to the price of a rental so thought i might as well buy it i'm tossing it out after i finish this review the movie which stars lowe is a music video with few lines of dialogue slow moving shots and poorly done editing i thought i'd be seeing a mindless action flick which is what i wanted to see i didn't even get that this movie is an exercise in slow moving shots no script close ups terrible edited and a poorly developed plot i can't believe that is actually ends with a scene in which they think the audience cares about the characters by the end of the movie we still don't even really know who they are believe the hype stay away
<START> it is a story as old as man the jealousy for another man's wife and possessions there are even commandments against it br br in this story raymond burr perry mason ironside is the manager of a runner plantation who lusts after the owners wife and feels that he isn't treated with respect the wife the starlet barbara payton who was trying to make a comeback after a string of sordid affairs was lusting after burr who killed her husband paul cavanagh br br but lurking about was a strange woman the housekeeper gisela who sees everything and who was capable of some voodoo to avenge the wronged which also included another young woman carol to whom burr also professed love br br burr is poisoned and becomes or thinks he becomes a gorilla payton will have to mate with kong if she ever wants her marriage consummated as he goes into the jungle every night br br the end is predictable but the stirring question of this film is why payton would ever be afraid with those sharply pointed missiles jutting out from her chest no animal could get near her to do harm
<START> the rise of punk music was scarcely documented on film and most people tend to focus on the happenings of other cities such as london or new york penelope managed to preserve a snapshot of los angeles circa '79 which proves a vibrant and diverse art music community had spawned which rivalled any other to some the bands read like a who's who of now legendary american punk black flag x circle jerks germs fear purists argue that vital bands were missed weirdos flesheaters and that the movie was the cause of an onslaught of suburban poseurs and macho violence however the issues touched upon in the film remain relevant the intensity of the music remains unmatched and the influence continues to be seen and heard in the cliques fashions of today
<START> i must say i didn't expect much about this movie but it turned out not to be bad at all most striking of course was aidan quinn's performance i would never expect to see this fine actor as an action hero the great thing about it is that he really builds up his character i mean it was not like mel gibson or bruce willis would do it he was sensitive and modest for example he's really upset when he kills someone i also noticed that some clichÃ©s were avoided when gets his training you would easily expect him to be a rebel and act like any average american would do in such a situation ask what the f is going on and refusing to cooperate but is a professional marine officer he doesn't give up and he tries not to lose his courage in which he succeeds pretty well except for a brief break down on christmas eve which i think was very realistic i'm glad that aidan quinn got this opportunity to show another side of him in fact two because he plays the villain as well even although the film wasn't that successful
<START> this movie had the potential to be a decent thriller but it was hampered by only having about twenty minutes worth of good script which was mostly used up in the beginning after that holes started to appear in the story that one could drive a truck through the movie followed a descending curve from good to ordinary to bad to ludicrous by the time it concluded it's not recommended
<START> now this is a real turkey by the overrated director franco who gave us such classics as las vampyros lesbos yes i think that bad films can be great fun i adore the hilarious howlers of doris wishman and ed wood jr but this one proved to be too much for me it is the first film i rated 1 where should i start the screenplay is idiotic to the utmost the dialogue is unbelievably bad the directing seems to be nonexistent the best music cue used repeatedly in this film was taken directly from the movie der 1964 and it's boring poor shirley eaton and george sanders in one shot sanders reads a popeye comic while his henchman torture a girl this aspect is probably the intellectual highlight of this movie the only thing that baffled me was that franco promptly showed female nudity whenever i thought the movie would gain from it this is real directing skill still i'm afraid that a movie in which actors pretend to shoot with machine guns by shaking them is not really worthwhile
<START> a great cast a fantastic cgi monster and a brilliant script if this film had had any of those things then it might not have been amongst the worst films i've ever wasted an hour and a half on infinite chimpanzees with infinite typewriters have not yet written the complete works of shakespeare but along the way this has appeared in their waste paper bin and somehow it got made into a movie you can tell the the actors regret signing those contracts with every word they mutter directly into camera the cgi is amateurish in the extreme and they might have created more tension of the cast had been attacked with the sinclair spectrum it was created on i wanted to like this film it has nice cameo appearances by gil gerard and walter koenig so i expected a fun horror movie that didn't take itself too seriously it actually does try to take itself seriously but is about as much fun as trip to the dentist do yourself a favour don't watch this movie you'll only encourage them to make more
<START> how much can you really say about a condom with teeth the plot was really out there but it was something campy to see on a friday night the story has a lot of unexpected twists and it's a great way to offend all you're conservative friends
<START> this was a romantic simple funny movie i really enjoyed it and would definitely say to watch it and enjoy it will smith was funny nervous sweet and just a simple guy who got hit by love it was cute to see him fall for someone and be so nervous and lost as to what to do or say it was great he was great funny as usual eva mendes was better than i expected her to be as well i thought there were moments in the movie where will got the shaft he was doing everything he could being a good guy and still getting treated bad the ending was romantic and happy and it was great i have seen it several times and would watch it again a funny movie something you don't see a lot of anymore it had the old time feel with a fresh new look
<START> my spoiler is in my pants because thinking about this movie made me so angry i crapped myself br br once you finish watching it you stare at the tv set in confusion and horror then there's a soft tap on your shoulder and a voice hisses you will die in seven days you turn around and one of your best friends is standing there with a look of absolute hatred for the one that suggested this movie when you were in blockbuster br br i won't lie this is the worst movie on the face of the earth i saw it with 5 of my friends all 18 year old guys and these were our reactions one person actually began crying and punching himself one person screamed and passed out one person stood up and staggered out the front door to reappear more than an hour later one person simply blacked out this one was me one person started babbling incoherently as if he had both cerebral palsy and syndrome one person went into a sort of catatonic trance and did not respond to our voices for more than twenty minutes br br the movie really is that bad there's one part where the retarded cameraman actually trips while holding the camera but the producers decided to leave it in seriously you can hear him grunt and swear when he hits the ground there's only one special effect and it's special in the same way that a retarded kid trying to solve a cube is special the camera rotates so that the on screen action action n some dumbass lost in a corn field for 80 freaking minutes does a barrel roll br br under no circumstances should it be watched and the movie itself even warns you of this fact do you know what the tagline on the back is some warnings should not be ignored i honestly think that the release of this movie to the public is a sick practical joke on the producers' part that's not to say however that you should pass it by if you see it at the movie store it would then sit on the shelf for some other poor sucker to see rather buy every copy of it you can get your hands on and mail them to people that you hate
<START> this movie shows what you can create if you have a camera some spare paint and cardboard a toy ship a few friends who acted in community theater and the incorrect notion you can make a film the end result is an unwatchable time waster that you'll skip through unless you take it out of the dvd player and toss it through the window first br br the acting in the opening scene especially by the rotund lee morgan as and the toy ship crashing into the rocks before the credits is a good indicator of what you're in for with all the foam it looks like this special effect was shot in a kitchen sink i guess figured he save some cash by washing the dishes at the same time in terms of bad cinema the funny thing is dungeon of harrow seems to have inspired maybe by coincidence the twist ending of manos the hands of fate yep it's the same lame i was the victim and now i take the mad villain's place ironic ending the bigger irony is that two inept talentless filmmakers could make two equally wretched texas filmed horror movies and get away with it br br monotone nerd russ harvey is a noble in a great family line why they were great is never broached boring us while lamenting the death of his family line and crest before his ship even crashes we're also treating to a droning narration throughout the film sadly we aren't so lucky his family's toy ship crashes into some styrofoam in a sink and he's washed ashore with his bloated captain and some woman conveniently deposited on a mad count's island br br meanwhile the count is visited by an evil spirit who dressed in a magic kit outfit assaults him with various puppets spiders snakes bats all the icky stuff the count william overacts worse than shatner and has a visibly difficult time keeping a straight face through the typical madman ranting br br i'd be mad too if i had to be in this disaster the woman is promptly killed by the count's ferocious dogs and the two jerks are captured by his manservant the count accuses them of being pirates apparently his worst fear he slaps his manservant around a lot apparently his greatest joy fatboy gets tortured there's a woman who's a servant and one who's a nurse the rotting leper hag in a wedding dress countess in the dungeon she digs the nerdy noble and is the only effective creepy thing in the movie a lot of inane dialogue at a dining room table the captain gets killed while making a pathetic getaway to watching a sloth battle a pack of lions it's all an ugly haze to me i spent most of my time on the fast forward button br br anyway the jerk noble and nurse make a getaway and think they're going to be rescued by three guys in a rowboat on the lake yeah we're supposed to believe a lake is the ocean they don't since the nerd's hair turned gray and he scares the would be rescuers away honestly i think they simply took the opportunity to row away from this hideous film while the had the chance they head back to the castle the nurse starts rotting like the countess and your stomach by this time and we end with these two getting ready to descend into the dungeon of harrow blech br br i love old lousy horror films but they must have some sort of entertainment value i feel ripped off even at the low low price of 5 99 for this biscuit mystery science theater would have a tough time making this one fun i was taken in by a few nutty reviewers who claimed this film had atmosphere and some creepy moments wrong avoid this tripe at all costs and don't even waste a buck if you find it in a dollar bin somewhere this movie makes corman's the terror like like a masterpiece of horror and atmosphere
<START> everybody seems to compare this to the matrix and the 13th floor and when i first saw it i would have agreed i was expecting the matrix and was a little disappointed but upon repeated viewings my respect for this movie has grown immensely br br the thing to keep in mind is that the matrix is a great action movie with some philosophical mumbo jumbo thrown in the 13th floor is a passable action movie with some slightly more interesting philosophical mumbo jumbo thrown in is not an action movie at all and is not as many seem to believe about reality or any such deep concept it's about the human tendency to intentionally replace reality with an artificial both in its origin and in its behavior world of make believe br br the most chilling moment in the movie is when geller repeats her scripted line it's at that point you realize that the people in the game have voluntarily surrendered their free will in order to participate in a story this is made even more frightening at the end when d'arcy nader or rather his player comments on the possibility of spending one's life in the game i sympathize completely with the realist philosophy that providing interesting worlds in which people simply locate the correct predefined path to the end goal is ultimately a recipe for a soulless existence living in the game is not living at all but is a tempting way to spend one's time on earth as comments about the real world there's nothing going on here might as well jack into someone else's imagination and pretend to be doing something interesting although i have to ask whether cronenberg considers this a self indictment considering that he himself offers up worlds to be experienced in 90 minute snippets br br upon leaving the theater after first watching this movie i thought it was one of those movies that was watchable only to see how it ended but having seen it a couple more times thank you scifi channel i've realized how much deeper it goes seriously if you've only seen it once it deserves another viewing
<START> the recent death of stephen bach one of the producers of heaven's gate has raised the specter of at least a partial resurrection of the reputation of the cursed film moreover the original release the long version was recently shown on tcm exposing the film in probability to its largest audience ever br br i saw the film when it first came out at a packed screening in a 3rd avenue cinema across the street from i think it was released on a friday and withdrawn on the following wednesday maybe that wasn't a fair release but it was and is a terrible film seeing the full length version recently confirmed that judgment and with some thirty years more experience watching and writing about films i am better able to articulate why br br first there is the dreaded phrase mise en scene whose definition is at the same time so simple yet so amorphous that it puzzles even after being defined basically it's everything that happens in front of a camera for example a crowd extra will be given a piece of action say just walking by on the sidewalk and a spot to start from when the assistant director yells action the extra will go through their action if there's another take the extra will return to the start spot and go again on action all of the extras do this then say a cab drives up to the sidewalk and the star gets out and embraces another principal while all the while the crowd extras are doing their thing this is mise en scene in the theatre they call it blocking but cinema is far more multi dimensional br br the importance of defining mise en scene is because when the french critics developed their theory of the auteur the opposite of an auteur was a en scene even more referred to as a traffic cop an auteur was intimately involved in the meaning of a film and through the director's body of work a theme or themes discerned the en scene was basically a company man rendering in film what had been handed to him on paper it is the difference between say john ford and sam wood br br the second point is how the director michael cimino got into the position of directing films cimino first gained prominence directing the first million dollar tv commercial this depicted a chevrolet floating down the grand canal in venice this commercial never appears on any lists of greatest tv commercials of all time and is notable solely because of how expensive it was and how utterly exaggerated it was the effect is like that of a three year old girl brought out to entertain company who gets her biggest response when she flings her dress over her head cute for a three year old embarrassing for a thirty year old so cimino was praised early on for spending a huge amount of money for some over the top image and so he learned br br his first film thunderbolt and lightfoot 1974 has a scene where clint eastwood and jeff bridges are passengers in a lunatic's car that drives back and forth back and forth until it drives off the road and the driver opens the trunk full of rabbits which he proceeds to shoot one by one i had the feeling that if the producer eastwood hadn't stepped in that the scene would have lasted until every rabbit had been killed br br which brings us to heaven's gate i guess if one watches the film on a dvd in snatches like a mini series it can be impressive this is because scenes are directed with such a dense mise en scene that each scene is like an encyclopedia it's just plain exhausting to sit through nearly four hours of this its like sex at some point it just becomes a whipping there is the opening 40 minutes which takes place at harvard brilliantly photographed at oxford it is something of a non sequitur i personally favor the artistic way of unfolding a story as opposed to the more commercial now i'm gonna tell you what i'm gonna tell you of most films however the whole preface adds up to only one line kris kristofferson and john hurt went to harvard together now twenty years all of that time money and effort not to mention all of the audiences' attention and energy just to deliver this almost useless piece of information br br then there's the scene in the street between kristofferson and which just goes on and on with a populated city of background extras and horse drawn vehicles in the background in continuous motion to deliver a tiny bit of expositional information it's just so exhausting there is just one scene after another like this it's like trying to eat a thirty pound pizza then there are these long conversations of inconsequential details and unintelligible witless dialogue which go on and on and are exhausting and boring br br of course any single scene excerpted looks brilliant overall it's a rich piece to spin praiseworthy articles about seen in snatches with the possibility of fast forwarding through the boring bits or turning it off if feeling mise en scene whipped it's basically painless but don't let anybody tell you it's a good film when i saw it in 1980 there was a guy sitting in front of me who commented on the scene where kris kristofferson is on his horse and he turns one way and then the other and does this about six times that's symbolic he said of he doesn't know which way to go that is basically at its kernel the basis of every pro heaven's gate critique br br watch it if you must but be forewarned this is not a film whose time has come this is a stinker which will smell for all time br br heaven's gate is historically inaccurate in the extreme i recommend the book of the plains by mercer on the johnson county war
