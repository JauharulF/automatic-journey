<START> for me this movie was a disappointment somehow i expected that it would explain the reason for general popularity and his success as a military strategist in ww ii but there is none of that it deals with the last year or two of his life and tries in a way to whitewash him so i just have to suppose that rommel was primarily an amoral and apolitical in the conquering and killing business without any particular charm or notoriety in behaviour such real life people just do not make good movie material i almost feel sorry for james mason really one of my favorite actors who had to impersonate a pretty wooden character actually a good director and a lot of great acting talent was wasted on this movie Â with the exception of luther adler who gives a really memorable and weirdly naturalistic portrayal of adolf hitler br br there might also be a cultural problem for people like me who are part of the german speaking world famous british actors impersonating germans are just not credible rommel for example is perceived here not just as a german but as a typical from you immediately think of a certain dialect a certain kind of wit a certain way of seeing the world the total opposite of eg a prussian i also think that there are now mixed feelings about the assassination attempt of july 20th many of those who were in on the conspiracy were not democrats and just wanted the german troops to join the western allies against the advancing bolsheviks thus prolonging the war forever br br the best movie portrayal of an intellectual intelligent military mind is in my opinion still patton 1970 incidentally general patton can be glimpsed for a short moment in the ample documentary footing used for this movie a low angle shot while he is inspecting passing vehicles the open holster and the revolver with the mother of pearl grips are clearly visible
<START> being a long time fan of japanese film i expected more than this i can't really be bothered to write to much as this movie is just so poor the story might be the cutest romantic little something ever pity i couldn't stand the awful acting the mess they called pacing and the standard quirky japanese story if you've noticed how many japanese movies use characters plots and twists that seem too different so then steer clear of this movie seriously a 12 year old could have told you how this movie was going to move along and that's not a good thing in my book br br fans of beat takeshi his part in this movie is not really more than a cameo and unless you're a rabid fan you don't need to suffer through this waste of film br br 2 10
<START> drivel utter junk the writers must not have read the book or seen david lynch's film not worth wasting your time br br longer does not make better while more in depth then lynch's film it has gross in accuracies and down play's key parts of the story br br a night at the roxbury is more worth your time
<START> what a waste of talent a very poor semi coherent script cripples this film rather unimaginative direction too some very faint echoes of fargo here but it just doesn't come off
<START> like most musicals of the era one must check reality at the door broadway melody of 1938 is not remotely believable nor plausible but kind of fun in its strange way this movie is really just an excuse to execute the talents of the stars some scenes just happen as if they were in a review not a plot driven movie br br judy garland shines and it's a pity she has so little to do unless much was left on the cutting room floor br br one of the most inane happenings are the way eleanor powell get a lead role in a broadway show and robert taylor says it's going to be work work work from dawn til dusk several scenes go by and there's no work no rehearsals nothing she needs money to win a horse in an auction she has no money isn't she getting paid while she rehearses taylor has to borrow money to help he's supposed to be a big time producer he has no money anyway that's just two elements in this strange story br br the musical numbers are quite wonderful which saves this from being a total loss broadway melody of 1940 is much better as is broadway melody of 1936
<START> talk about rubbish i can't think of one good thing in this movie the screenplay was poor the acting was terrible and the effects well there were no effects i can't believe the writer of this movie did identity everything in this movie made me sick to start to finish br br the front cover of the video box shows a showman with shark like teeth and scary eyes i looks like a scary villain but like the old saying never judge a book by it's cover the whole villain looked like a cardboard cut out one part in the film a girl gets killed by a salad tongs terrible the setting was bad enough like they could of set the whole thing in but no a tropical island instead br br i took this movie as a spoof which i think they wanted it to be but the only thing that made me laugh in a bad way was the tacky effects you can argue that i haven't watched the first one but seeing this i would be safe if i wouldn't attempted it br br the biggest joke in this movie is the effects the snowballs looked like they were home made and that carrot was a complete embarrassment if i would of guess the budget of this movie would of probably be between 8 to 9 pounds fifty the producer in a last minute panic must of grabbed the actors for the street gave them the script told them they have 6 minutes to practise these lines and shoot on a island br br lastly the acting in the film was painful it was like the actors forgot their ordinary lines and made them up the way through br br in conclusion i give this film 0 stars out of 5
<START> i've been waiting almost 25 years to see this hard to find horror thriller and i finally did since it's proper rebirth on dvd of course it didn't have the same impact on me as it would have if i had seen in it the 80s but director his film squirm is excellent makes good use of the lovely oregon location and takes the time to develop the characters not just to have them dispatched in creative ways a high note brad whistling music is really creepy and adds to the desolate proceedings making this great fun for genre fans a must see if you like underrated horror films to describe it would be an intelligent friday the 13th sprinkled with some tasty bits of deliverance with that aside there are some really cool original moments like my favorite when a couple are swimming in a lake and the guy disappears underwater to play a trick on his gal just when you think it's the usual scare she suddenly looks to shore and i honestly can't spoil it you just have to watch it for yourself also the ending is just one of those that you just have to see to believe Â it came out of nowhere and it's weird wild the dvd includes commentary by
<START> i had the chance to watch blind spot in barcelona and i enjoyed it tremendously i thought it to be one of the most captivating movies that i'd seen for a long time one of the best points of the film was to meet new fresh faces and great actors behind them in unexpectedly and brilliantly filmed great locations the three heroes share a chemistry on screen that runs all across the film making it so thrilling they are set on outstanding landscapes spotted by such an original eye the work is just great that makes you feel like you are discovering them for the first time the mood of the desert floods everywhere and even the scenes filmed in the streets of los angeles or san seem to be a natural extension of it the story rides you smoothly through all these beautiful settings to lead you to a bitter sweet ending being the perfect climax for this perfect journey the construction of the film itself is a master craft the skilled use of innovative resources like stills stitching danny's memories into the film will compare to those hand made pieces of work so rare and so enjoyable blind spot achieves to capture the essence of the desert taking you to an universal common ground where anyone of us can feel being both discoverer and native
<START> i bought this dvd from walmart for cheap thinking it would be a typical crap straight to video monster junk but it turned out much better than expected there isn't really any criticism to say about it it's obviously low budget but that just adds to the cheesy old fashioned fun it's very cool and entertaining br br there's everything horror sex a great plane crash and good characters and i'd say it's pretty original cuz it really doesn't come off as any other movie i've seen it has it's own unique look which i liked very much that's why this film deserves credit i look forward to seeing more of these awesome movies from the scare master brett piper whom i've never heard before this one br br the dvd menu is really creative with groovy music playing over it so it's perfect just to keep it on when you're not yet ready to sit down and watch it it also includes some special features which are really interesting but we never get to see the director or hear him in the commentary must be shy this comes out of studios in vermont usa i highly recommend it to all horror buffs you'll love it
<START> sacha baron cohen is a genius and this movie is good although the film doesn't nearly reach the quality of the tv show it's still very funny and has some seriously wicked moments i've liked ali g since the first time i saw the material from the show i think he's one of the best comedy characters of all time up there with say peter dragon action and the blues brothers biggest surprise with this film was that they've actually got some serious actors to do it dance and after this i will absolutely respect them even more for having the good sense to take this chance i have nothing really bad to say about this film it's very funny very juvenile but hey so what br br one more thing to mr g sequel please br br
<START> file this one in the how do movies like this get made ' column a seventies drag indie version of macbeth ' adapted fairly faithfully but pointlessly in a conventionally unconventional black comic style the cast gives it a shot with christopher walken phoning in the eccentricity as and with maura tierney rising above the dull script as pat the other actors are wasted as is the audience's time knee jerk fans of this brand of quirk may like it though 4 out of 10
<START> four daughters begins as just another clone of little women type melodrama a single father with four musically talented eligible daughters has his hands full trying to keep them in line and guide them in their courting rituals what turns the film around is the sudden appearance of a new hollywood star some critics say the first anti hero long before james dean graced the big screen from the time the dark foreboding figure of mickey borden john garfield appears at ann priscilla lane gate splashing his self pity and doomed philosophy on the rest of the cast four daughters becomes much more than just a chick flick br br though garfield is the main reason to watch four daughters there are other flashes of brilliance to enjoy hungarian born director michael curtiz later responsible for such gems as casablanca and mildred pierce pinpoints certain images with his camera aided by cinematographer ernest of rebel without a cause fame that sticks in the viewers mind for example the screeching gate that ann's first suitor felix jeffrey lynn swings on so merrily becomes symbolic of the shifts in moods and affections by those who use it br br that garfield delivers the standout performance is obvious but the rest of the cast keeps up with him most of the way the underrated jeffrey lynn plays his role to perfection as the neglected suitor whose love for his cherished ann never falters even when she's with another man claude rains somewhat miscast as the father of the four coming of age young women gives a fine portrayal of a set upon doting family head who gets lost in the shuffle the three lane sisters already famous for their musical abilities turn into accomplished actresses playing their parts well a raft of supporting actors including dick foran frank mchugh may robson and eddie makes it all believable br br how opposites attract is part of the ploy for touching the quick of the viewer's imagination ann is the eternal optimist even when she and mickey are down and out she always looks on the bright side and like so many caught in the pliers of the great depression in those days she saw prosperity just around the corner mickey recites an entire list of bad things that have happened to him seeking company in his misery from ann which ann refuses to do mickey expects to go out with a bolt of lightning striking him dead as he rounds the corner of life mickey has meager talent as a composer ann has talent to spare as a singer and musician ann is big on beauty mickey is big on personality in a warped sense of a way and the differences go on and on how all this is reconciled in the end is an important part of the movie not to be missed br br see four daughters for john garfield's doozy of an acting debut on the big screen the only time he was better came seven years later when he again mesmerized the film goers with one of the greatest screen performances ever as frank chambers in the postman always rings twice opposite the equally charismatic lana turner but also watch four daughters to catch important elements that may be missed if too much concentration is placed on the star of the show
<START> i bought this in the budget department last week i had halloween and halloween ii already and since i aim to collect every horror film ever i chose this after all the 1st two were good br br this film is pretty intelligent to tell the truth it seems to create the correct atmosphere and has a nice history of michael myers it uses the old locations from the original and the main character is the kid whom laurie strode babysat that fateful halloween in 1978 br br the climax also is fairly satisfying anyways it is a lot better than h20 which frankly is absolute crap
<START> unfortunately producers don't know when to leave well enough alone or are into recycling to the point that every scrap of trash that hollywood generates is up for rendering into alpo it seems that every sci fi action adventure flick must endure a sad list of follow up films and robocop is a tragic example the first film under paul verhoven's direction was a wild stylish ride even finding time for a little social commentary on what the dark side of bio tech is capable of turning us into this film has none of that aside from maybe telling us that drugs are bad for you and could make you do things you'd regret when sober robocop 2 lacks the vision the profoundly scary vision of what we are becoming and instead clumsily takes us on a boat ride into how nauseating drug dealers and their victims really are social commentary be damned this one really bit the big one for me if you don't care for anything but the sfx go to it my friend otherwise don't waste your time with this sour cake and preserve the first film's accurately measured heavy weighted hot out of the oven it's that simple
<START> this movie is really stupid and very boring most of the time there are almost no ghoulies in it at all there is nothing good about this movie on any level just more bad actors pathetically attempting to make a movie so they can get enough money to eat avoid at all costs
