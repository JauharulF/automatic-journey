<START> i have watched love jones over thirty times it is one of the rare films that depict a love story about people who happen to be african americans the dialogue was realistically written and delivered with honesty it was so nice to see a film where the story line centered on young professional african americans this is virtually an untapped market love jones was visually captivating as well the chemistry between lorenz tate and long will bring memories of past and present love the feeling of the film is jazz and blues and brings to mine the sensuality of a warm creamy hot chocolate with a splash of kahlua and if you hadn't guessed i loved it
<START> having had more than a few mates suggest i check rise of the out i eventually got round to it last night undoubtedly the story colton leach has to tell and did so in his autobiography is a compelling tale of one mans ascent from terrace boot boy to connected underworld villain this film sadly compromised in quality by appalling accents and woeful acting ricci in the lead role of leach does a reasonable job of conveying the transition from thuggery to serious criminal but his accent is all over the place as his voice provides the stories narration it is something that after ten minutes was driving me nuts terry stone as tony tucker provided the unintentional comedy with an ill fitting wig or the worst barnett going dialogue that was so expletive riddled it bordered on juvenile and an over the top in line delivery reducing tucker to parody what troubled me most about this film was that the events leading up to the shooting in essex and the formative years of leach are of genuine interest to crime fans and fans of football hooliganism so to have this story sabotaged by a lack of credible accents and acting left me feeling an opportunity had been missed roland and frank harper provide the films only source of authenticity on the positive side some of the films pacing and construct flowed well and kept the attention the violence was well choreographed and aside from an over reliance on projectile red syrup for blood was on the whole realistic if you enjoyed the film then it is worth checking out essex boys telling a similar tale from fictionalised viewpoint and also featuring billy murray
<START> silly comedy casts an embarrassed seeming ray milland as a british officer in world war ii europe escaping german confines and taking up with a man hungry gypsy woman played by marlene dietrich slowly paced overlong and miscast the leads are far too old for this type of juvenile fodder although marlene shines in her solo moments it took three scriptwriters to adapt yolanda book for the screen but this material must have already seemed dated by 1947 it smacks of something ernst lubitsch might have turned out in 1939 the scenario is musty and the stars have absolutely no chemistry together from
<START> i found dominion to be a lousy attempt to continue the success of the story the original movie was a story about evil and how it can infiltrate our lives br br schrader's version is lacking in evil viewers do not get an overwhelming sense of dread fear or even foreboding harlin's version offers evident evil shows violations of the church's sanctity and builds a convincing story that is plausible given father background schrader's story leaves one wondering exactly what happened dominion does not evoke the emotions of the viewers to empathize with father and leaves the viewer wondering exactly why he was troubled in the first place br br anyone interested in seeing a sequel which lives up to the original should see exorcist the beginning
<START> as a child growing up in the sydney of the 1950s i can readily identify with the content of this fine film each week i visited the newsreel cinema on george street to watch the and usually 3 stooges shorts never has there been a better blending of b w and colour in a film faultless production values round off a never to be forgotten movie experience
<START> babette's feast and the horse's mouth are the two most insightful accurate films on what it is to be a real artist the key lines in babette's feast are not as some other commentators here have said an artist is never poor but two lines that come before and after it br br i was able to make them happy when i gave of my very best throughout the world sounds one long cry from the heart of the artist give me the chance to do my very best br br i spent nine years producing experimental multi media music theater in san francisco raising money for productions that involved dozens of singers actors designers etc and the artists i supported stretched every penny in their effort to do their very best they were just like babette they were desperate to get every dollar necessary to do their very best work babette's art is fine french cooking and for her to perform her art at its very best costs 10 000 francs when after years in political exile from france isolated with two caring spinsters on a bleak scandinavian coast she suddenly gets a of 10 000 francs she does what every real artist would do she sees that she unexpectedly has the chance to do her very best and so she does it she spends all the money so that she can do her very best work as an artist the twist in the movie is that we don't know she is such an artist until she is actually cooking and serving the meal up until then she appears to be just a working class french lady who a bit with the and is very serious her husband and son were murdered in paris violence in 1871 br br to such an artist it is secondary whether there is an audience for the art that is competent to appreciate it that is why the author set this dinner in a community of people who could not possibly have any understanding of what they are receiving babette did not cook this meal as a gift to the two spinsters or to the religious community it was not her goal to achieve a reconciliation or spirit of good feelings among the members of the little religious sect indeed she never once leaves the kitchen to speak to any of them after the meal she is sitting alone sipping some wine not paying the slightest attention to how the guests reacted she is basking in the satisfaction of finally having the chance to have done her best as an artist br br that is why it is so satisfying and so important to the story that the general unexpectedly shows up for as babette knows instantly a general will know what she has placed before him and will appreciate it for there is a sort of tragedy in a great work of art being shown to an audience that lacks even one person competent to appreciate it she is glad very glad he came in fact he is the only guest she ever mentions during the entire dinner the only one she singles out for special treatment not either of the spinsters but she did not plan the meal knowing that such a person would come to receive it br br to anyone who has had the chance to enjoy a real first class parisian dinner as i have my father was naval attache to paris in the 1980s and i had my honeymoon in france this dinner and babette's satisfaction in making it and the pleasure it brings to the diners is absolutely convincing if any art has the power to the recipient with a sense of joy it is a fine french meal cooked and served in france this movie makes a claim about the transformative effects of great art on the recipients before the dinner the members of the little religious sect are quarrelsome up old resentments the old hymns fail to restore good fellowship people ignore them talk over them but the shared experience of sensual great art for the people can enjoy the tastes of the foods and even if they have no conception that they are experiencing great art contents the people puts them in a forgiving mood reconciles them and by making them happy encourages them to love each other and thus has a god like sacred effect of bringing peace this is the claim found in the modern art movement today that art can supplant the traditional religions in making mankind more peaceful thus contrary to those commentators here who say that this film speaks for the power of christian belief it is more accurate to say that the film claims that art can heal wounds that christian ritual cannot after all my years in the art world i have to say that this claim that art brings peace that religion cannot is overblown and invalid but it is a pretty conceit and it is the second main theme of this beautiful film br br one last note at babette's arrival at the home a particular french general is named as the person who in 1871 executed babette's husband and son and imposed a military rule that she had to flee at the end of the film as the general tells the story of the magnificent meal he enjoyed in paris many years before before 1871 at the conclusion of some military maneuvers it turns out that this same was his host at the meal as the general tells the story french general praised the chef of that meal as the greatest woman the only woman he would risk his life for of course that woman was babette thus ironically the same french general who said he honored babette above all other women was responsible for driving her away from france forever
<START> i had gone to the movies expecting to see a great film based on all the word of mouth and terrific reviews the minute the opening sequence started i knew i was in trouble the music and credits were trying so hard to evoke emotion i wanted to puke all i got from this film was clichÃ©d characters contrived dialog and an unemotional script director writer paul has managed to get great reviews with his manipulative self righteous writing but it doesn't fool me some performance were good don cheadle is always good i think terrance howard is slightly over rated but he was decent ludicrous was way too on the nose he should stick to rapping brendan fraser was fine jennifer esposito left no impression what so ever i find nothing interesting about her sandra bullock is always the same in every movie she's just okay matt dillon was very good and i enjoyed watching him work ryan philippe was good as well but as far as the script and the lousy directing this is actually one of those movies that is so annoyingly bad i actually took the time to write about it i would not recommend this film to anyone what a waste of time
<START> you can't watch a film like peter watkins' privilege a story of the exploitation of a pop music performer by big business the state and even organized religion without thinking of creatively degenerate like michael jackson or britney spears who hawk corporate giants like pepsi or some other poison for money or any number of entertainers in music or movies who become tools of political parties or commercial religious interests like scientology and kabbalah a film like privilege must have seemed almost like science fiction when released in 1967 so fantastic was its premise today we tend to take celebrity endorsements for granted giving little thought to its more alarming implications watkins' vision has not only become reality we tacitly accept this reality as normal br br now consider punishment park as privilege challenges the viewer to examine what is being sold to us and why punishment park demands that we reckon with what is being taken from us and why br br heaven help america and for that matter the world if contemporary politicians get their hands on this film it is already so close to reality that in viewing it recently i experienced a genuine nauseating feeling of anxiety br br again skillfully employs a documentary style narrative whereas in privilege some rough edges to this technique were apparent in punishment park it has been honed to sharp seamless perfection the sense of realism is enhanced by disarmingly unpretentious economical believable portrayals by the entire cast this is the kind of acting hollywood has completely turned its back on to its detriment in favor of cosmetically perfect image projections the cast has first rate material to work with in watkins' screenplay br br many cinematic visionaries have tried to shake the viewer out of their complacent false sense of security no one has ever achieved this result with such stark and chilling accuracy as peter does here br br what seems quite clear now is that instead of trying to bring the estranged and excluded americans such as these people back into the national community the administration has chosen to accept and exploit the present division within the country and to side with what it considers is the majority instead of the politics of reconciliation it has chosen the politics of polarization br br to paraphrase one of the characters we don't have to call them pigs because they know what they are better than we do
<START> it would be a shame if tommy lee jones and robert duval ever see this movie as they will probably be associated with it in years to come oh yeah the public will say moon' that's the mini series about the texas rangers and the comanche indians that starred tommy lee jones and robert duval it was a real stinker and probably the worst movie they were ever in i think it was a comedy but a not very funny comedy i really don't understand why they agreed to be in it that would be such an injustice as the original lonesome dove was a true western classic and this turkey is a real bomb and jones and duval will be remembered for it
<START> pat o'brien portrays the all american notre dame football coach no doubt this film will be considerably more appealing to those interested in some aspect of all american notre dame football probably it's most interesting to serious followers of football and or notre dame football you will see some good documentary style film footage br br otherwise it's difficult to recommend this as a film it's not much more than an historical document you'll know the end is near when gale page gets a chill and don't blink or you'll miss ronald reagan doing of all things camille br br all american 1940 lloyd bacon pat o'brien gale page ronald reagan
<START> once you can get over nic cage playing an italian soldier who loves opera and believes in making love not war you can get down to enjoying this beautiful looking film this could be used as an advert for tourism in the mediterranean john hurt is great and penelope cruz isn't bad as you might expect christian character is somewhat one dimensional which is a shame br br the main drawback of this film is the adaptation from the book having been told subsequently the differences between the book and film plots i feel cheated out of a much better and more convincing storyline
<START> i have no words to really describe this series br br the premise behind this concept a highly hyperactive girl with a very eccentric personality which ends up whirling up a team of oddballs into her own rendering of the world which after all was a creation of since she wants a world with aliens and time travelers is a breath of fresh air in a world ridden with repetitive anime series and non innovative tv shows br br characters are well developed and you will end up loving them some less than others the word to describe the animation job does not exist since excellent would really fall short to describe how was done there are many funny situations which either will make you smile or put you into deep thoughts don't fall for the impression of the first episode since that's only the tip of the iceberg as the novels are yet to come br br the only problem comes due to the lack of chronological order in the episodes but you can solve that problem no br br conclusion unquestionably one of the best series of 2006
<START> the only thing of interest about this movie is its subject matter taking a look at the manson family from the point of view of the family members themselves is a great idea however trying to make sense of the uncomprehensible is something that can really only be accomplished in a masterwork and this ain't it br br presumably because there was so much information to squeeze into a screenplay this film was done in a faux documentary style with reenactments thrown in trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on br br worse there's an incredibly weak sub plot thrown in that follows a little band of latter day as they go after a reporter who's working on a story on the anniversary of the killings it's dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time br br all in all this movie is one big wasted opportunity the one ray of sunshine is the acting of marc who plays tex who in real life did most of the actual killing whereas the female characters come off as giggly airheads in the 60s flashbacks manages to convey real feeling br br in short don't bother with this movie
<START> this could have been a great movie with plenty of educational potential for teachers around the world about evolution biology the creative work in science research and darwin's life but it is not br br the screenplay is mostly historically inaccurate and transforms a true story into a mexican soup opera melodrama while it is true that darwin gradually lost his religious beliefs this was in great part due to his findings during the voyage of the and not solely due to the loss of his daughter he was certainly disturbed by his loss but that did not made him literally insane delusional and detached from his friends and family the such portrayal of darwin is an invention of the script writer thus it cannot be used in any way as place to learn a bit about darwin's life and psyche according to most historians darwin had the theory ready by the end of the voyage and kept it from going public because he wanted to develop further the consequences of it and check against more data in the movie it is an imaginary conflict of darwin with his religious beliefs and the mental illness that he developed after his daughter's death that kept him from going public br br the movie brings a modern situation the vs scientists debate into the life and times of darwin thus it is anachronistic it depicts thomas not as a man trying to develop further understanding of biology but as someone eager to kill god in his own words from the movie and destroy the church who would accept the theory of evolution for such purposes and not because it was a synthesis of plenty of disconnected data is presented as a very arrogant and insensible person a combination that i interpret was an attempt to ridicule active atheists who speak up against religion in real life accepted darwin's ideas after publication only gradually and before the work of darwin he thought that there was not enough evidence to support evolution his first support of evolution was published one month after the origin of species became public he was agnostic but did not think it was necessary to kill god only thought that there was not enough evidence to believe in the supernatural the debate vs scientists appears throughout the movie and catch phrases such as it is only a theory are part of the discussion of course no such dispute or catch phrases existed at that time in fact the anglican church published a positive review of the saying that they saw god's work in evolution in some sense quite in fact in contradiction to the way that the clergy is portrayed in the screenplay br br another awful aspect of this movie is that it gives the wrong impression to the general public that scientific research is done by a solitary crazy man who just writes a lot nothing could be further from the truth the conception of the theory of evolution was the result of thorough observations of living forms by darwin during five years in the hms and was developed gradually as it can be seen from darwin's notes of the voyage even though the voyage was the sole most important part of darwin's life to the conception of origin of species the voyage is briefly mentioned only once at the beginning and no attempt is made to show that the book came as an elaborate analysis of observations to make it worse darwin is shown performing a single experiment pigeon breeding to test his theory and in the end quits it and i'm not really sure whether such experiment did actually occur br br great disappointment it is not in any way a homage to darwin and science
<START> no way this overly simplistic script with basically one character should be interpreted as feature entertainment in reality it has about enough material for an eighteen minute short and even that would seriously tax your attention span zero characters beyond noble willingham are developed the never ending closeups of lips and telephones are sleep inducing and the script is so underdeveloped that a chimpanzee could have written it in fact this whole sad thing shouldn't have even been put on film a tape recording would have been more than sufficient to put you to sleep definitely not recommended merk
