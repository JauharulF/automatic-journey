<START> there were a lot of dumb teenage getting sex movies of the 80s and a lot of slasher flicks but there were only a handful that were made with thought made you laugh and captured the time period right this was one of them cage is hillarious so is forman who from her bio has from the hollywood limelight i'd love to see this released on dvd with in a special version with commentaries by cage and forman wishful thinking i know ever want to plan a true 80s movie weekend rent this sure thing and 16 candles and breakfast club it will take you back to a totally rad time which it seemed at the time was a lot more simple memo to studios time to release the dvd
<START> bbc's 3 hour adaptation of the novel by sarah waters life is tough without money especially in dickensian london dark deeds lead to despicable dilemmas is love really just a luxury for the rich and free elaine cassidy as maud lilly and sally hawkins as sue trinder both give fantastic performances as the leading ladies asking this question of each other whilst rupert evans shines as the delightfully bad gentleman with great support from imelda mrs david mr and charles dance's uncle the plot twists and turns and i wasn't sure i could be led to care about characters able to hurt and use each other in this way but somehow i do care and thats because of the quality of the performances love feels like love hate feels like hate betrayal confusion well hopefully you get the idea and hopefully you will get the dvd and enjoy elaine cassidy is just great in this gorgeous in fact i have to declare i am in her fan club hi elaine
<START> if there's anything worse than this movie i don't want to see it i remember so many amazing things a nun dropped out of a coffin to make a raft for a little blond boy the little blond boy himself adored as a god lots of stock footage of peru as an ideal vacation spot shining path and alberto should blast away any notion that peru is a vacation paradise the whole thing is so awful that plan 9 or even robot monster is an aesthetic treat by comparison this film should be bombed and and bombed again
<START> the main criticism of at the earth's core is that it's cheap the special effects are bad and so on and so forth yes some of the special effects are painfully bad but what a lot of folks overlook about it is that it's actually quite fun which is very important in my book br br in comparison just look at the latest star wars films they have the latest greatest special effects created by the latest technological advances which are capable in creating stunning visual effects as far reaching as the human imagination can imagine and yet with all the razzle dazzle those films were as exciting as a funeral as yoda would say fun they're not in other words who cares if the fx aren't the greatest when the spirit of the film is fast paced humorous and clearly set on the side of action i love everything about at the earth's core the contrast between stodgy victorian england vs the wild other worldly colorful setting of the cast of characters the concept of a lost underground world the telepathic pterodactyls the human slaves rebelling the ugly one lol the inspired teaming of peter cushing who's great and doug mcclure the excellent music it's really good cinematography by the amazing alan hume and last but not least caroline munro she's effing sexy in this movie one of the sexiest b movie babes ever captured on screen br br seriously anyone who doesn't like this movie doesn't know what fun is gimme at the earth's core over any turgid star wars prequels any time at least it has caroline munro which no cgi fx can ever recreate
<START> this story documenting the rise of china's first emperor and his efforts to unify the empire was the most expensive movie production in chinese history br br it's worth every penny visually dazzling cinematography a sweeping score and outstanding characters make this one of the finest epics ever put on film foreign or otherwise please do not miss the opportunity to see this on the big screen
<START> the french babbette appears at the modest house of two danish sisters wet cold and alone fleeing revolution in paris she seeks refuge in an obscure religious community on the windswept jutland coast br br unbeknownst to those who so generously take her in she is a great chef an artist of food babette gives herself to her adopted community through thrift and shared faith she leaves only when she wins the french lottery 10 000 francs she returns laden with exotic cargo the makings of a single meal commemorating the birthday of the sister's father the community's founder br br this meal looms darkly in the minds of the pleasure denying faithful but its subtleties are translated by an aging military officer who as a young man in paris learned to appreciate the sensory experience unfolding here the meal is the film's climax a communion of love in the transitory artistry of food uplifting about art love and the meaning of life
<START> i liked this a lot br br the camera angles are cool it's not all jumpy like a blair witch and i thought they did a great job with the sound when we see things from kane's point of view lots of fun plenty of people were shouting at the screen br br kane did a great job with his various psycho emotions he's a lot less one dimensional than most horror heroes br br kane is a lot less scary and more believable than most movie psychos it was not clear to me how he would react to various situations there are not many twists here but it is clever and original in it's own way good creepy b movie slasher fare
<START> this film was total rubbish i was sitting watching this absolutely furious that this was funded they most definitely spent all their budget on the special fx rather than the script writer and director and some of the actors br br first the acting was bland and rubbish the story was not relatable to the audience enough rather than being from the peoples perspective of the storm the narrative was told more from government figures and the army which really isn't a way to connect to them as most of us hate politicians anyway the writer attempted to add a human element to the unrealistic characters by adding the little subplot about the father and son which failed completely br br as for the directing oh god his techniques to try and create tension and unease are repetitive and over the top the sped up camera movements and then the sudden flash bolt pauses on a characters face when something horrendous has happened was pathetic br br the only reason i watched it till the end was to see the special fx which is a bad thing as special fx shouldn't make the film it should only amplify the story and experience there was no story br br i really wouldn't bother watching this total trash and an embarrassment to the british film industry
<START> umberto hits new lows with this recycled trash janet plays a lady who is looking for her missing sister it turns out the sister is part of a jim jones type religous cult in new guinea she hires a scruffy guide played by robert to help her get to the cult's compound located in the jungle this is another cannibal movie and i probably would have liked it if not for padding this film out with scenes from his superior the man from deep river i mean every cannibal scene is directly lifted from this film which i guess makes him about as credible as al adamson i felt ripped off spoiler 1 2 star and that's for the dildo scene
<START> i watched 9 souls in 12th international film festival september 2006 where the director was also present and answered many questions of the audience this road film is about 9 fugitives all very different characters from each other they decide to stay together travelling with their red van across japan every time the van stops we see these 9 fugitives trying to escape from their past in order to build up a new life or to fulfil a dream however no matter how hard they try it seems impossible and their violent past comes after them and leads them to their final destruction br br though a very pessimistic film it is not a dark film on the contrary it is full of beautiful pictures surreal elements and elegant humor heroes cannot escape their prison and they face a divine punishment for their crimes they are small pieces of a beautiful painting where the tower of tokyo depicted as a huge knife turned upside down prevails
<START> the good news for imdb is that this movie was so very bad that it compelled me to register and make a comment i should add here that i'm a film buff who rarely passes harsh judgment but sometimes a movie is so poorly acted poorly conceived poorly edited with a such a poor story line that it begs criticism br br i'm surprised by all the claims of how superb brilliant dark and beautifully shot this movie was i can only conclude that the cast and crew are active posters here the acting was extremely thin the pace of the movie was agonizing i gave it new chances at every turn mostly because i didn't want to feel like i was wasting a saturday morning in ny but with every new scene it dragged longer delivering characters in which i took no interest with which i could not connect for whom i could not empathize br br when i see negative reviews on imdb of small independent films like this i sometimes wonder if the poster has a personal axe to grind something like he used to date the gaffer she dumped him and now he's going to trash everything she ever works on but here nope i know no one who worked on this film and i wish it would have been great but the film wasn't dark as some have mentioned or depressing as others have claimed those suggest that i connected with the film nope henry may long was just too long empty and tedious br br that's the tomas take on this one
<START> the only reason anyone remembers this steaming load of fecal matter is because it was scored by pink floyd or as they were known then the pink floyd stefan a really annoying eurotrash hitchhiker hooks up with american model estelle and they proceed to get high and naked throughout the whole movie br br and the point of this is what exactly that drugs are bad or only heroin horse is the problem becomes that you don't give a crap about the characters and for that matter even pink floyd wasn't up to their best work when overdoses at the end you are almost glad to be rid of him because he was so annoying
<START> shut the front door that's what i said when i was told that blockbuster got a new movie in called snakes on a train okay maybe that's not exactly what i said but you get the point i didn't need to know who was in the movie or anything else all i knew was that i am renting this movie br br i probably should have asked what it was about though in retrospect i don't know if i would have really wanted to watch a movie about a mayan curse that causes a woman to give internal birth to snakes and have them spit out of her mouth nor would i want to see a movie that features a guy who looks strangely enough like a version of leif garrett br br anyways while the curse might be interesting on some levels well maybe not there was still promise of these annoying characters getting eaten or at the very least killed by snakes so i was willing to sit through the first hour of very little happening other than a texas ranger forcing a girl into a nice little titty grope so she can keep her cocaine or the hispanic shaman that likes to occasionally stab people but then all hell broke loose and the girl started to spit out more and more snakes br br spoiler alert so everything's going well at the end and i'm willing to overlook the fact that some of these snakes all of the sudden turned out to be 25 feet long after all people are getting eaten so it's all good but then all of the sudden and i'm not going to tell you how because that would ruin the best part one of the snakes is about 300 feet long then it proceeds to squeeze and devour the train with all the graphic artistry of from the old gi joe cartoons unfortunately i could not make a nemesis enforcer connection with this movie anyways so you would think that a snake that big who ate a train would be pretty unstoppable well not if you know your mayan voodoo rocks and have the ability to summon tornadoes from heaven yeah that's all i'll say about that br br in short this movie is bad really bad to the point where you might be numb after watching this or your brain might hurt i didn't give this a one because no matter how stupid it was it still wasn't as bad as date movie so if you like camp or badly constructed b horror movies this is the one for you if you think this will actually be cool like its bigger more infamous brethren just walk away from the box if you see it and i'll leave you with a quote from the movie that should basically sum it all up br br snakes can't get on a train because that's just silly not like they make stops or anything
<START> this movie felt so real i actually felt all of the emotions portrayed here during my life at various times that of both rory and michael i have muscular dystrophy like rory so what you see here is exactly what i've actually felt myself some won't believe there are disabled people like rory full of anger and rebellion i know they exist because i'm one of them br br the story is great for a drama character driven movie the story moves fast i was never bored maybe partly because i was seeing stuff that is close to my heart but i think most people with intelligence will be glued to the screen and care about the characters the acting is phenomenal james mcavoy is perfect as rory o'shea who has muscular dystrophy he steven robertson deserves an award for his portrayal as michael connolly who has cerebral palsy br br michael's love isn't returned by a girl and rory helps him come to terms with it i've felt this many times and the question is doesn't she love me because i'm just not the one or because my disability turned her off no matter what the girl says we will always be skeptical as to the truth it's just natural and it hurts either way br br a few parts made me cry a little because it is sad and i have to face the issues myself people without a terminal disability just cannot begin to fathom how it can feel this is a must see film for everyone disabled people are everywhere and greatly misunderstood this film brings a little light on some of the facts of life which are so taken for granted by the able bodied we want to be just like you to live on our own terms to go out to get drunk to be loved on the outside we can't do much but on the inside we're dancing
<START> there isn't much about reckless that feels right beginning with the off putting title thanks to screenwriter craig lucas who adapted his own play bringing the title along with him and continuing with the casting mia farrow playing wife to tony goldwyn who's young enough to be her son the couple live in an idyllic winter world that appears to be the inside of a snow globe but farrow gets a startling dose of reality after he admits he's hired a man to kill her she flees into the night taking refuge with a very strange couple who want to help her rebuild her life the production design and art direction of reckless are fine but they are services rendered for a completely inane often alienating screenplay it's supposed to be a dark holiday comedy though the cast is at a loss with this unfunny occasionally offensive material 1 2 from
