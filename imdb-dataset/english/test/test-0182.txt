<START> when you think 'oliver stone' the movies that come to mind would be his biggest and most controversial ones like platoon jfk born on the fourth of july or natural born killers talk radio usually doesn't it's a pretty small movie actually more than half the movie takes place with barry at his radio station talking into his mike but believe me this is one of oliver stone's greatest movies and should not be missed br br above all things it's a character study barry is a rude self destructive risk taking talk radio show host who says one too many things and starts to get in trouble with his boss his lover s his fans and even some nazis he doesn't like his audience and callers and a lot of them don't like him that or do like him but have no idea why but at the end he says on his show i guess we're stuck with each other br br see talk radio even if you don't like oliver stone movies you might be surprised i sure was br br my rating 10 10
<START> richard a very wealthy man has died and his relatives have assembled for his funeral included in the funeral party is youngest sister cora while none of the family has seen cora in at least 20 years they all agree that cora was always a bit different so when cora says something about having been murdered most laugh it off as one of eccentricities but someone is obviously taking cora seriously the next day cora is found dead in her bed having been beaten violently is there a connection between the two deaths it's up to hercule poirot to find a killer br br after the funeral is one of the most well put together episodes of the entire poirot series i've always been a fan of this particular agatha christie book and from what i remember the movie is as faithful to christie's source material as any of the poirot installments the mystery is top notch with plenty of clues suspects and red herrings and as i've written before i always enjoy an christie story where hercule poirot gathers everyone together in a drawing room for the final reveal it might be old fashioned but that's the way i like it getting beyond the plot technically and artistically after the funeral is a winner sets editing direction and cinematography are as good as you'll find in one of these movies the acting is equally impressive i've come to expect an enjoyable performance from david suchet as poirot and he doesn't disappoint here the rest of the cast is just as strong with monica dolan giving an especially noteworthy performance other than a minor quibble with the rapid fire way the characters are introduced i've got no real complaints it's a good show all the way around
<START> watched last night and right away was reminded of two early peter weir films from australia the last wave and picnic at hanging rock they were films loaded with atmosphere but short on actual horror to me seems clearly influenced by these films it has a number of fairly mundane scenes that become more portentous the deeper you are sucked in by the film it also has more scenes of outright horror and although i don't think the film actually measures up to those two films it is well worth the time of most thoughtful fans of the unusual not necessarily horror 7 out of 10 seems fair but i must say that years after seeing the last wave the film still stays with me and it is precisely picnic at hanging rock's unresolved ending that makes it so haunting p s all the people criticizing the acting in this genre
<START> this is a totally awesome movie if you haven't seen it yet you damn well should sure the plot is slow to develop the special effects are laughable the acting is ridiculous and the action is badly choreographed but as wrestler ddp would say that's not a bad thing that's a good thing everything about this movie is hilarious especially if you get the dubbed version which has even worse actors it's countless laughs until you get to the end yearning for the sequel where the mummy fights wrestling women thus i give it ten stars unless you're one of those and people with good taste who likes only 'high quality' films of the highest calibre i recommend this utterly movie
<START> maybe it is unfair for me to review this movie because i walked out well before the end that's odd because i usually like shakespeare on the screen and i enjoyed night's dream once many years ago when i saw it on the stage br br i think that two things did me in that squeaky twerp with the shakespearian name calista and michelle sitting in a giant clamshell well i suppose you could say it supposed to be a comedy but when the scenery is funny and the actors aren't i'd say we have a bad movie on our hands
<START> a wonderful christmas story on the moving theme of susie homemaker finds her inner amazon no i'm serious geena davis's amnesia starts to improve when she is knocked on the head from this familiar beginning we move in an unexpected direction good pace good action fun story lots of explosions and mayhem
<START> bud abbott and lou costello always had a good following among children but in their careers i think you could say that they only made one film that could be designated for kids jack and the was that one film br br it was part of a two picture independent deal from warner brothers the second film being abbott and costello meet captain kidd these were the only two films the boys made in color br br the two of them out of work as usual take a job for a very precocious and obnoxious young david as a babysitter although it starts out with costello wanting to read the kid jack and the as a bedtime story the young lad winds up reading it to costello lou falls asleep and in his dreams he fantasizes he's indeed jack the giant killer br br buddy baer who menaced the boys in africa screams plays the giant and he's got a giant size dorothy ford as his housekeeper dorothy was a big girl and you can imagine she had some difficulty being cast except when her height was used as a joke one of the only players who ever looked down at her was john wayne in three godfathers at henry fonda and james stewart in on our merry way also stood barely above her but again her height was part of a gag br br shaye cogan and james alexander were the princess and prince of the fantasy and they sang beautifully but couldn't act worth anything this was the last film of william who's career dated from the early silent screen days and even to the turn of the last century on stage he played princess father the king br br some not terribly memorable musical numbers came from jack and the save the title song i well remember as a kid having the 78 record of bud and lou singing the song and reciting the story i was in my early single digit years but became a lifelong fan of their's through that and their television series br br jack and the is still a good children's picture for the very young though i would warn parents to warn their little urchins not to imitate young master
<START> hunt for justice is about the setup of milosevic for his trial in the hague while it was a little too clinical in presentation the subject matter could have gotten very depressing very quickly a canadian judge louise becomes the chief war crimes prosecutor at the international criminal tribunal for the un in yugoslavia she battles everyone to pull out the evidence that sent milosevic to trial not a bad docu drama with class a directing and production work the 'evidence' was disturbing by the shear discussion of the facts happily they didn't go into too much detail and no real pictures of the tortured
<START> my entire family enjoyed this film including 2 small children great values without sex violence drugs nudity or profanity also no zillion dollar special effects were added to try to viewers from a poorly written storyline a simple little family fun movie we especially like the songs in the movie but we only got to hear a portion of the songs mostly during the end credits would love to buy a sound track cd from this movie this is my 4th bill hillman movie and they all have the same guidelines as mentioned above with all the movies out there that you don't want your kids to watch this hillman fella has a no risk rating we love his movies
<START> this movie was different from most of jimmy films of the 1930s in that it was not done by warner brothers first national but was a loan out to a smaller studio because it was a poverty row studio the production values are lower than you might be used to seeing with cagney films plus the plot is certainly one of the strangest i have seen instead of him being a gangster he was a good guy in this one fighting for the law this isn't all that unusual because cagney frequently played lawmen such as an oss leader the forefather of the cia of fbi agent but to make him an investigator for the bureau of weights and measures was indeed odd especially since at times he acted pretty much the same way he did in the movie g men br br all in all a time passer and that's about it br br finally the videotape i saw this on from memory lane video was perhaps one of the poorest i have ever encountered the sound was terrible and scratchy and the print looked very white and had lots of torn film and gaps
<START> shaggy friendly yet frustrating film has the same old message if you want to make it in this world being imaginative isn't enough you have to live up to your place in society and that means living by the heterosexual rules that govern us drag queen comedy drama from australia is a mostly upbeat journey of three male friends traveling across the outback in their pink bus christened priscilla while not a formula film per se there are the obligatory road movie sequences bonding by the bonfire facing down the rednecks etc writer director stephan elliott follows every potentially mean spirited moment with a little humor and sympathy but there are puzzling gaps in his narrative a dire subplot about a gay man's relationship with his ex wife and estranged pre teen son both of whom are comfortable and the child wise with his lifestyle and a third act with no energy whatsoever it has some wicked transvestite humor and a fairly game cast but a script that seems to have been watered down along the way from
<START> i enjoy gay themed movies where the characters aren't stereotypically gay and that's what attracted me to this movie that and the principal actor which is the only reason i'm giving this movie one more star than it deserves although not because of his acting in the film let me tell you a lot of people complain about the cinematography but the camcorder feel of the movie added a certain underground quality to it for me and there are a couple of scenes usually around sunset or sunrise and among trains that would make any movie screen blush br br but the acting is cardboard the music is repetitive i got through the latter half of the movie listening to a soundtrack from another film you have to wait almost twenty minutes for any dialog and then it is awkward and amateur the subject of graffiti could have made this movie great had it been gracefully exploited and had the art itself been more intriguing but it isn't br br worst of all there is no climax there wasn't really a plot to begin with the movie just crawls back into its shell of silence and dies a forgettable movie
<START> some of the early talkies survived to become classics the is a classic all right but not in the way it was intended melodramatic in story and acting today it seems ludicrous particularly the casting of myrna loy as a seductive gypsy imagine nora charles breaking up a young couple and driving a young man to steal outrageous however as many people know when loy first came to hollywood she did quite a few of these exotic seductress roles br br based on a play the concerns the aforementioned gypsy who in the film is now in hungary spain in the play running away from her cruel master and inviting herself into the home of the lajos family richard tucker and alice joyce basically by appearing at the door one by one seduces the men of the family and the farm talking her pidgin english not bad do nothing wrong and dropping hints about nice presents the son in the family paul carroll nye is engaged to the beautiful irma loretta young and can't wait to marry her he loses interest when he meets br br with the exception of the lovely alice joyce zasu pitts as a woman who lives in the household and the stunningly beautiful loretta young the acting is uniformly awful loy is stuck with the hallmarks of her character bad english whining and hysteria with her darkened makeup peasant and curly hair she is not only beautiful but right out of the 1980s quite modern though richard tucker's putting the back of his hand on his forehead reminds us we're just emerging from the silents br br robert osborne on tcm commented that this film is one of his secret pleasures while it is deliciously bad it's not deliciously bad enough to sit through again it's just bad but a great example of how far we've come and had someone not picked up on myrna loy's sense of humor how limited her wonderful career might have been
<START> i rented this movie without having heard or read anything about it what a shame this movie is intelligent witty hilarious fast paced and realistically ridiculous the characters manage to get developed without relying too heavily on clichÃ©d tired stereotypes it was refreshing to watch i couldn't help thinking that marketing would have helped lob this not so mainstream movie into the starved for intelligent comedy mainstream the quality of the dialogue and the ease with which the actors execute a huge range of awkwardness heartbreak and comedy is so rare these days i felt that the actors must have really enjoyed participating in something this rich how is it that national treasure was number one at the box office for three weeks in a row it is so weak in too many ways to mention i guess i'm just happy that movies like seeing are still being made somewhere out there
<START> challenge to be free was one of the first films i saw as a child it was also one of the first vhs tapes that i owned i hadn't seen the movie in years so yesterday i decided to stick the tape in and watch it wow the story is as powerful now as it was the first time i saw it i think now that i am older i can better the values that are implanted in the movie self reliance the value of freedom and the love of nature it is a b movie to be sure but it's one that you'll remember for years especially if you see it as a child
