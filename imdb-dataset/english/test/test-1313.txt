<START> in fact it was awful the main chick in it who gets topless was obviously sleeping with the director at the time it was shot at some warehouse most likely owned by family or friends also they chose not to bother coming up with a story sure these are ways to cut cost but are they smart ways of keeping costs down no they aren't at the very least they could have found a middle school student in a creative writing course those kids may have at least had a lesson about story structure at the very least they could have read up on 3 act structure but acting obviously wasn't a priority either watching these jerks run around in funny clothing that was stupid by 1980's standards was an embarrassment the fact that none of these actors committed suicide in humiliation is probably a testament to the limited distribution this film received had the actors actually seen the final result of their hard work there would have been a line of people waiting to jump off the brooklyn bridge br br i'd give this movie 10 10 stars but it only deserves 1 for being released at all this movie should be shown to film students everywhere it's better than 90 of student films i've seen and wow is this movie a piece of
<START> it was tough watching harrison ford obsessing over nothing kristin scott thomas should have slapped this guy and told him to take a hike br br save your money don't even bother with a rental fee unless you need a good nap
<START> if you're like me and you occasionally enjoy watching terrible movies i guess it's kind of like slowing down at a car crash you can't do better than this the plot is inane the special effects are hilarious and the acting is some of the worst you'll ever see 4 thumbs down seriously i have no idea how the director and the actors can sleep at night it's painful and yet hysterically funny to watch and i highly recommend it for those who want to punish themselves for something if you can watch this crap without wincing you're a better man than i'll ever be i wonder if the producer of this garbage had any idea what he was getting himself and his money into
<START> is absolutely hot as hell in this movie but really all the characters are amazingly fun to watch br br minor spoilers as per usual the main character b is the sane one of the bunch b has this crazy idea to make up his own college when he's rejected from all colleges he applies to he's known for making fake ids so an acceptance letter is no problem br br because b's dad is a hard and suspicious of this university he's never heard of b gets his friend sherman to design a website for the university sherman has been accepted to a great college and is in fear of being arrested for fraud he's very quick with witty lines but his flaw is he wants to be accepted socially too much br br glen hands and rory are the three stooges that follow b along glen got a zero on his and has no thought process he's constantly proposing battle royals but he's very good at making which gets him a lot of hot girls somehow hands was a great football player who didn't receive the scholarship he was counting on and turns to crafts to cover his lack of athletics rory was preparing to go to yale since the 1st grade and was not accepted she spends her time meditating br br uncle ben was my favorite character picture lewis black playing himself if you have no reason to see this movie then see it for lewis black and jonah hill they're amazing br br monica is a b's love interest as most of these stories go she's more popular than him and doesn't even notice him until half way through the movie unlike many other stories though b actually gets her and keeps her until the end monica is actually a good character on her own but of course she's primarily there for b to adore br br there are more supporting students at the made up college who are fun to watch a d d 's name is self explanatory and funny enough he ends up in the meditation class kiki is a hot ex stripper who falls head over heels for a chance to go to school and eventually gets a crush on glen maurice is an ex military idiot who got his g i bill and wants to study rock n' roll in college the final guy is only known as freaky student who thinks he can blow things up with his mind ye who have little faith in him wait until the end of the movie br br of course the villains are the dean of an opposing university his student body president the president's girlfriend and their circle of friends br br every character is lovable i believe this movie has a good plot and is well done despite what a lot of people say even thought the overall story is predictable the characters keep you guessing and make the movie great go see this film i give it 9 out of 10
<START> i have to say that i had low expectations for the movie before viewing it all the people around said it was great but i perfectly knew what they like they like song which is indeed great they like the amazing special effects which had coasted a lot they like the comedy side of the movie and of course many girls who love affleck who according to my opinion is a really bad actor who tried not to be one failed and now he is nothing and all these things plus the reviews and the ratings i read in internet gave me a clue the movie would be a huge disappointment since i am a big disaster kind of movies fan well i've been right but at least i was prepared br br the movie is really commercial it's been said but i will say it as again we have over 100 million budget we have a romance between hollywood stars ben affleck and liv tyler and many other famous actors who are popular with the fact that they rarely agree on becoming a part of the cast of a commercial movie if their names aren't written with big letters on the screen such as billy bob thornton and steve buscemi which are highly respected actors that i also like a lot they could play many characters in many different kind of movies they could improvise they could turn tasteless lines into hilarious jokes on the whole they could turn small movies into really interesting funny or dramatic motion pictures people love and will always love such as fargo in buscemi's case or a simple plan thornton and to be honest i am really disappointed they took part of armageddon thornton plays a smart and refined man involved in politics if i remember correctly buscemi is one of the members of the deep core drilling team which is sent to save the world by destroying the asteroid which is about to vanish the world br br what i didn't like well i guess i've been already understood i pointed out bad factors the story is dull artless and silly it is so obvious that the movie depends on the effects and the dramatic ending that it's ridiculous at least movies like deep impact and godzilla have something special that might be considered as art at least it ain't that obvious that the movie is made of financial purposes other than that bad performances from all the huge stars the jokes ain't funny the lines are absurd and sometimes they doesn't make sense at all in fact i recently read that on the stage ben affleck has asked bay whether it would be easier if they teach astronauts to drill than drillers to becomes astronauts and bay's reply has been simply shut up which is a really funny story which perfectly shows the desperation br br and enclosing i'll give an explanation why i give 4 to the movie well i like don't want to miss a thing and i was impressed by the special effects which are obviously the only good thing in the movie the first scene is memorable these are the the only 2 good things i liked about the movie michael bay is an average director but the rock and both bad boys were hundreds of times better than armageddon which was is and will always be one big bad movie
<START> 1 bad acting br br 2 for a bunch of castaways on an alien planet it sure looked like home especially with the houses and roads you can glimpse in the background br br 3 terrible plot with stupid making idiotic decisions and blithely losing precious survival equipment and clothing left right and center br br 4 cool 70's scifi possibly the only good thing about this movie br br 5 interesting ship at the beginning this crew must have been watching space 1999 a lot too bad it blows up so early the escape ship also got sunk too fast sigh br br 6 anthropologists might find some aspects of the movie interesting in terms of primate group behavior
<START> years ago when i first read john irving's the world according to garp i was astounded that most of the younger adults with whom i had contact didn't like the book when i loved it i began to understand that it was an age and experience thing i experienced somewhat of a dÃ©jÃ  vu when reading some of the comments on this site that were clearly written by younger viewers fully enjoying separate lies is surely an age and experience thing br br in this film the viewer sees a seemingly happy upper middle class couple he a successful lawyer she the perfect wife of a successful lawyer they have a townhouse in london and a home in the country all's well until there enters the villain in the guise of the son of the richest man in the village this guy appears to be a cad from the word go he is disdainful of everyone and everything including his own children in the traditional form of nice guys finishing last the lawyer's wife engages in an affair with the bounder you see the lawyer really is a nice guy but with the marriage killing trait of an organized perfectionist even though he truly loves her he is boring his wife to death the bad boy is far more exciting br br all of this is entangled with the hit and run death of a man in the village in which all the facts point to the cad being the driver of the vehicle br br it's easy to determine that this movie doesn't build to a happy ending however it does lead to a very satisfying ending in that the man and his wife learn and grow from their experiences and probably will be able to conduct their personal lives in a more successful manner br br three excellent actors play the main characters in this film and it is there performances that make the whole thing a pleasure to watch tom wilkinson is perfect as the husband his portrayal shows us a kind man who has so much control over his emotions that he has lost touch with the world emily watson shows us a woman who has become so trapped in the role of perfect wife that she has almost lost her knowledge of passion that passion is reborn by the character deftly played by rupert everett br br if you have reached that point in life in which you understand that everyone has feet of clay and that everyone even with the gifts of intelligence and opportunities makes many many wrong decisions then you will probably enjoy watching these excellent actors creating the lives of three such people this is a beautifully acted and directed adult film about realistic adults
<START> the only reason i haven't given this film an awful rating is because i feel that it was such an awful film in every aspect that it deserves at the very least a 2 10 for not trying br br the plot is the least of your worries as you are slapped in the face with over the top language and scenes like 'the singing arse hole' in a poor attempt to shock and disgust seen as the main aim of this film is to shock and the main body of it didn't achieve this the final scene disgustingly manages to erase the memory of this shockingly pointless film and fulfil its aim to be the most filthy film ever br br a really low budget film awfully acted and the dialogue is shockingly bad br br i give it 0 10 really
<START> the weakness of this comes from the confusing storytelling plots often coming out of nowhere but it really didn't matter because i still enjoyed it to it's full length once you actually accept that this movies not to be taken too seriously then you'll enjoy it even more it's basically a love story a confusing one at first but as it evolves it really is something worthwhile sure it's been done so many times before but the complicated version of this is quite inspiring and touching br br the over the top fantasy and cgi was overwhelming at first but i still enjoyed its purpose and people quit whining about how it borrowed from other movies guess what we know and it doesn't really matter because its purpose was to humour and entertain sometimes people has to stop being so critical and think for a moment before they start yapping about comparing this to hollywood standards is utterly stupid and ignorant it's a totally different style and target audience as far as i'm concerned some the best films i've feasted my eyes upon are from eastern producers and directors there's your police story 4 shaolin soccer kung fu hustle dragon tiger gate fist of legend hero crouching tiger etc i for one like this movie and from the philippines us england libya and now australia i'll always be interested in these types of films now try and judge my perception but i warn you i do see things from from the point of view of those 5 countries i've lived in so you better be as experienced and open minded
<START> this is an excellent movie that tackles the issue of racism in a delicate and balanced way great performances all round but absolutely outstanding acting by sidney poitier br br he makes this movie breathe and alive his portrayal of a guy who struggles against discrimination and violence is simply mind blowing his acting is forceful and delicate and subtle at the same time truly worthy of an oscar poitier had to wait because of his skin colour for many more years before the sheer brilliance of his acting was recognised by the academy br br cassavetes turns in a great performance too withdrawn troubled and realistic as it has become his hallmark he and poitier contrast the forces of cowardice courage and human transformation through friendship br br the movie is enjoyable and at the same time deeply haunting in its portrayal of racism in the us the irony is that it somehow mirrors the realities under which poitier had to work
<START> perhaps it's just me but this movie seemed more like sequel or follow up than the separate project why when it was filmed just few years after the war most of the viewers probably knew why rommel was so famous why his death was so important to allied why he was hitler's favorite general but now 50 years later it isn't so obvious anymore br br desert fox the story of rommel is a decent war movie but it's just isn't in any way explained how rommel did get his nickname what was he doing that allied considered him as their best general why their soldiers were so afraid of afrika that's what is missing in this movie we see his fame his character his way to treat soldiers and enemies but f e we also see that hitler was complaining about his achievements in africa calling him coward etc so we're missing the big picture here it is the story of rommel but unfortunately the desert fox part is missing
<START> if there's one thing i want to distinguish myself from all the other great reviewers here it's that i am the queen of finding strange movies in thrift and dollar stores that said you can't possibly imagine how happy i was when i found this one br br i can even remember that saturday morning when every station it so you were stuck if you wanted to watch something else then again i guess that was the idea as a kid i didn't know if i liked the way all the different characters were stuck together there are some crossovers that just do not work but i guess the special had it's intended effect don't do drugs because you will have nightmares about the muppets br br now if you watch this as an adult on the other hand you will be treated to the strangest anti drug movie this side of reefer madness i think i'll just leave it at that before i get into trouble
<START> rainbow and the star stealer in my opinion is an excellent masterpiece i felt all warm and tingly when rainbow voice of bettina and voice of david mendenhall set out to get revenge on the princess voice of aldrich if you ask me the princess was absolutely bitchy and diabolical to me she deserved to have rainbow and seek revenge on him however i liked her castle as well as the rest of the setting in addition i thought that of pat and murky of peter cullen were diabolical before i wrap this up i'd like to say that everyone was perfectly cast the direction was flawless and disney has scored a big hit in conclusion i highly recommend this excellent masterpiece to everyone who hasn't seen it especially die hard fans of the tv series i guarantee you you'll enjoy it
<START> i stopped watching this film half way through it was just terrible boring contrived subplots a complete lack of the pathos seen in norman bates buffalo bill or steve portrayal of ed gein a movie doesn't have to be historically accurate but the true story of ed gein is so much more interesting than this third rate melodrama that was completely made up for no good reason ed gein as portrayed by kane hodder is a cartoon sadist the attempts to show the trauma inflicted on him by his mother are just weak exercises in recycled style and this movie wanted to be stylish but it even screwed that up fortunately there is a better film of this story 2001's ed gein told the story efficiently and offered a few real chills as we watched a sick man not in control of himself steve railsback who played ed gein that time was already famous for memorably portraying another famous serial killer charles manson his ed had pathos his film is the one to see avoid this mess
<START> i started to watch this show by accident but i love it the fact that main character is in a wheelchair is something that lacking in television especially for kids shows my five year old nephew as most children do would just stare at people who were in wheelchairs or had some other type of handicap but after he watched pelswick it just seemed to be a normal occurrence to him every time he saw a wheelchair he would simply say like pelswick and go on with what ever he was originally doing and yes the animation is a little crude but if you can stand to watch through the first season of the simpsons then this isn't that bad the genie is actually an angel who is there to help pelswick learn lessons in life he can not walk some else said he could walk some of the time i've seen every episode and he never to my recollection walked he is a he has no feeling below his armpits he mentions it in an episode as for the humor if you can get a copy of the episode which lampoons boy bands you will instantly love this show
