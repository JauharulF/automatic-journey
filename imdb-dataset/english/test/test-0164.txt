<START> rented this from my local video store it was titled black horizon i guess someone felt this was good enough for a 2004 re release br br micheal dudikoff is not a ninja in this movie one of the major flaws of this film right off the bat another major flaw would be that ice t's action scenes are stolen from other movies particularly the first scene of his rescue which is directly from the wesley snipes movie the art of war with ice t edited in i hope they paid for that footage br br the plot is awful the special effects had little effort put into them love those wires holding them in space the acting is wooden also love those new york russian accents ice t being in the movie is pointless these guys also forgot the fact that there is no gravity in space but i guess they weren't worried about it br br micheal dudikoff should go back to doing what he's good at and make american ninja 6
<START> is there any reason to revive characters 10 years after the fact when the only reason they worked the first time was due to the actors playing them br br who can replace jim carrey or cameron diaz or better yet who can replace them at cut rate prices since most studios know that sequels don't bring in the same amount of revenue as the originals so they cut corners from the get go br br where are the good movies going to play if powerful hollywood studios can clog up 3 000 theaters opening weekend with whatever turds they feel like the general public can be suckered into br br enough's enough people this sequel itis has got to stop and the hollywood people need to start getting their act together or start distributing the much better foreign product that's floating in limbo br br wake up hollywood cause the people have woken up and they aren't buying it just cause it's new and shiny give us the good stuff and send the rest to the dvd shelves cause we are taking back the theaters once and for all

<START> at last a movie that handles the probability of alien visits with the appropriate depth and loving warmth just in case we're not alone i do believe that these visitors are just too to care for us or give that wayward bunch of anthropocentric goofs a stable proof of their existence we wouldn't interfere in the battle rites of some agitated desert tribe either unless we're out for messing with our travel insurance huh br br anyway the movie depicts the transitional of a weary mind and body by a superior entity that happens quite unspectacular and rather unrecognized but we're dealing with a movie here right so hospitalization is just a trigger to the plot br br jeff bridges acts great as usual but spacey is hilarious the role seems tailored downright to him convincing and lovingly mad eating bananas sitting in a tree giving his doctor a hard time with quickness wisdom and most of all stunning quotes they made me think and philosophize for hours already br br it's an encouraging film to say the least and the soundtrack by edward shearmur is simply beautiful just go and get a copy catch a beam of light now
<START> i guess i should now comment upon a 4th flick in the magnificent seven franchise the sequels still surprise or amaze their sleaze and deliberate absurdism they constitute or forge a 4th classic not revisionist not a sleaze americana kindred to the violent vigilante '70s movies absurd trash this installment too is bombastic awkward and even somewhat strange br br now what i find disturbing that these sequels not only have their opportunist fans but that the fans simply do not sense any difference between the original's style and the br br these sequels are not boring or bizarre they are of course very badly scripts rubbish lines it's straight crazy in this installment each gunman gets several van cleef's young wife begs him to release a young prisoner he finally does the young man resumes his life shoots van cleef kidnaps the wife rapes and kills joins a van cleef who has previously refused to help defending a village now assembles a small bunch and charges the hacienda then the charge the village where van cleef has set br br i liked the cast br br van cleef is chris stefanie powers pretty active in the '70s screwy westerns is van cleef's darling callan very is noah a writer and chris' sidekick the rest of the aggressive bunch are askew one of the only three survivors lucking lauter rita rogers is truly hot fleshy beauty
<START> i cannot understand why this 1971 hollywood production is currently only available through an australian video company but such is the unfortunate obscurity of this peter sellers classic leonard maltin's movie guide continues to grant it the same bomb review they gave it in the 1970's with so many scene stealers on display sellers comes through with what may perhaps be his most hilarious role it all begins with his discovery of a patient who expired at 11 but sellers argues that the corpse is still living due to the fact that the new day doesn't start until noon the final straw for the beleaguered hospital commissioner comes in that very room the do not disturb sign still on the door once he exits the room handkerchief holding his nose there is a brief conversation with the doctor with him doctor we can't save them all that man was at least 85 commissioner how old was he when he died 63 harold gould plays an inept surgeon who shuts his eyes when the knife digs in richard lenz whose pompous ass reporter in the shootist was booted in the rear by john wayne plays the patient who exposes the fraud he only came in for a chest x ray until they discovered he owns a house also in the cast on screen and supplying some excellent country flavored music is keith allison former guitarist for paul revere and the raiders who also worked with michael on a few monkees recordings and co wrote municipal court with on the birds the bees and the monkees alas there is some missing footage from this print including a topless sequence with uschi digard near the end also a scene with actress kathleen freeman who wants to use green stamps to finance her operation who gets locked by sellers in his office never to be seen again in the uncut version he returns to his office to find that she has written in large letters on the wall unfair prick his response you misspelled price
<START> there is a complete copy now available at the internet archive watch it or download it today br br http www archive org details the mascot complete br br one of the greatest animated shorts ever made starewicz is endlessly inventive and his techniques still astound animation fans 70 years later we may have computer generated techniques now but all he had in 1934 was an imagination that wouldn't take no for an answer whatever he wanted to see on the screen he created br br and he wanted to see some truly bizarre stuff every imaginable piece of scrap is called up for service old shoes chicken bones utensils broken glasses dolls monkeys rats seems like there was nothing that was off limits br br a truly eerie even unsettling film that should be seen by anyone with even a passing interest in animation this film must be seen to be believed
<START> in 1989 here in nz wrestling was somewhat of a mega hype phenom and who was steering starship at the pinnacle was the orange goblin himself hulk hogan one of my uber heroes at this time so it seems obvious to me now why i adored this movie in 1989 90 when it came out here hulk hogan a k a terry is a shockingly bad actor and zeus a k a tiny lister is worse the story line follows a standard wwe then wwf circa 88 91 story line culminating in the standard good guy beat down hulk up and then get beaten down again story line only to follow that the good guy calls on all his inner strength gained from eating vitamins saying prayers etc etc to mount the epic come back pretty standard formula here worth watching if only for reminiscing your youth
<START> the squire of is one of the sillier episodes of star trek and therefore one of the most entertaining ones the entertainment factor is generally speaking fueled by the stand off between william shatner and the episode's hilarious guest star william campbell br br during an unspecified routine mission sulu suddenly vanishes into thin air and kirk follows soon after wards spock immediately begins looking for his missing colleagues and though he'd hate to admit it friends while the two stranded crewmen must deal with the mysterious all powerful flamboyant campbell the self proclaimed squire of a being capable of creating or destroying anything he wants through the sheer power of his mind br br at first sight the plot may seem recycled from previous episodes honestly are there any sci fi shows that didn't feature at least one god like character but that feeling vanishes pretty quickly thanks to the script's winning use of exaggerated humor all conveyed through campbell's deliberately camp performance his is essentially the trek version of a spoiled child in the body of an adult while his ignorance fueled curiosity for the human race his knowledge is quite limited probably served as inspiration for gene roddenberry when he came up with the character of q for the next generation pilot some two decades after this episode aired br br in short the key to appreciating the squire of is this silly doesn't necessarily equal bad
<START> amazing movie some of the script writing could have been better some cliched language joyce's the dead is alluded to throughout the movie beautiful scenery and great acting very poetic highly recommend
<START> i generally love srk as a villain how can you not and i believe that srk and juhi are a perfect match on screen as they both are actually more nice than pretty br br this movie is great to watch although it has some major flaws br br 1 the good guy sunny not only he's so much less attractive than shahrukh what in my opinion is soooooo important in but his role lacks character it would be much better if there was a conflict between two strong personalities instead we have a conflict between a personality and an average soldier br br 2 and reactions for actions are unbelievably silly and naive even for a bollywood production br br but all this is not that important in comparison with the wonderful melodramatic atmosphere great songs really truly great and let's say it again shahrukh as a villain i just love him when he's so pagal br br a must see along with and duplicate
<START> following his role in the fine caper seven thieves 1960 â which iâve watched several years back â edward g robinson seemed to be stuck playing elderly criminal mastermind types apart from the odd juicy role as in the cincinnati kid 1965 iâd previously watched the pretty good effort grand slam 1967 and apart from this iâve yet two more similar titles from italy to check â one of which was directed by future goremeister lucio fulci anyway this is the kind of international production â featuring american and italian actors and a british director â which was prevalent during the 1960s itâs harmless and easy going in itself but hardly memorable and definitely overlong â especially since to procure finance for the heavy duty equipment required for the heist such as an army tank and an airplane the gang involved have to pull a variety of minor thefts first br br the gang of course is an incompetent lot led by an american robert wagner and his bimbo girlfriend raquel welch â the others are a black man a hungry italian and a diminutive englishman they try to induce an ex gangster vittorio de sica to turn over his fortune to them except heâs under the auspices of robinson he proposes instead a caper of 5 million worth of platinum needless to say the gang members trust one another wagner instructs welch to seduce de sica so as to get the name of their fence in morocco â where they are to retreat after the robbery or else bungle the job commissioned to hold up a restaurant the italian canât resist sitting at table and order a multi course meal for himself amusingly in the face of similar failures de sica tries to show them how they used to do it in the old days â however ostensibly holding up a petrol station it transpires that the owner is a nephew of his and he merely asked to borrow some cash br br the central heist sequence is typically elaborate while the gang including welch the train transporting the platinum wagner kidnaps pilot victor and his airplane when the job is done he fully intends to double cross de sica â but neither his partners nor welch herself are willing to go along with this so heâs forced to coming from the time when crime didnât pay the gang contrives to lose all their stash in mid air when the bomb bay doors are accidentally
<START> i love the tv contest hate to see it end there are so many talented contestants it's a shame that only 2 will be picked i love watching the judges also at times they are as entertaining as the contestants i have been watching the show faithfully every sunday night wouldn't miss it for the world it's the best reality show that's ever been on television good luck to all the contestants though i have already chosen the two who i would like to see play danny and sandy on broadway i am anxious to see if my decisions are correct i am not aware of how long the contest will go on until a danny and sandy are chosen but i will keep watching until the end
<START> wow i was told this would be a b movie worth watching i feel that i was misled after seeing this preview event the plot is a twisted make of several films at best even the title is a take on another film if you can give the movie that much credit i am sorry to say that i was taken to the cleaners i wouldn't waste your time on this one this movie appears to be a bunch of wannabes who got together and made a poor idea of a movie on a weekend with a borrowed camera being in the entertainment business i can judge a decent film and this one deserves to be shelved or discarded my advice stick to a classic like the 1979 dawn of the dead on a scale of 1 to 10 even a 1 is being nice to producers because this movie blows below limit of what sucks the producers need to stay with their daytime jobs if you do view the movie please be honest in your posting this one seems to have been hyped up and inflated by a few there are a few who have seen this for what it is and posted correctly sorry but i have to say this is one to be skipped
<START> this has to rate as one of the cheesiest of tv shows in a long time br br jose ferrer played the title character nemo he did the part justice and certainly looked the part but nowadays it strikes me that the nemo he was made up to be bore more than a passing resemblance to captain bird's eye from the tv commercials or maybe it's the other way around br br his nemesis professor cunningham was overacted brilliantly by burgess meredith he never seemed to get over his penguin days from batman although he doesn't do his penguin quack here he is without parallel as the maniacal professor only john of battlestar galactica fame chewed up the scenery better as a maniacal despot br br i never can recall what the grudge was between nemo and cunningham but it must have been severe since the prof never missed a chance to try and nemo and vice versa br br the effects were nothing special though prof cunningham's submarine was way better looking than nemo's it also had a crew of strange fish like amphibians that served cunningham and did his every bidding br br however the most memorable aspect of the whole show was prof cunningham's secret weapon the delta beam he was forever saying fire delta beam whereupon a fishy crewman would horribly the motion of firing the weapon by use of a full shoulder shrug truly priceless they don't make them like this anymore and perhaps just as well but like other series of this era for those who remember it it will always have an affectionate if cheddar covered place in our hearts
