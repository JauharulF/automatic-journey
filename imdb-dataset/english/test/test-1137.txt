<START> this review may contain spoilers or maybe not the warning is the same for all br br dang it just when i thought that scifi channel had used all of its ridiculous ideas for movies they give us this actually the plot itself it's nothing we haven't seen in movies like snakes on a plane deep blue sea etc that means a monster animal menace of some kind is lurking in a close environment threatening a bunch of people in this case an alien in a train wow br br i must say that when i first saw this thing on cable i couldn't stop laughing no scifi film had prepared me for this it was so incredibly pathetic i couldn't believe it the actors are all a bunch of stereotypical genre characters but since they're not so famous to say the least i wasn't expecting much of them except diamond phillips no comments there but i think the guy was desperate to find a job the problem was something called 'special effects' horrible even for scifi channel standards that model toy they made us believe it was a real train not to mention the model toy helicopter bigger than a train's wagon the meteor coming from space the 'baby' alien a sock puppet and i ain't kiddin' the regular aliens who looked pretty ugly while they were static when they started moving it was awful the explosions the terrorist blew up literally and what about the exploding helicopter just how many barrels of gas was that thing carrying the insane mathematics used they couldn't even solve a school problem right and i won't talk about that doomsday like ending by that time i didn't know if to keep laughing or to start crying if i remember right i did both br br it's an ideal movie to have a good laugh alone or with friends but be warned it's so ridiculous at so many levels and you need a heck of a lot of suspension of disbelief
<START> this film is about aging geisha in post war tokyo played by the incredible lends money to two other ex geisha and yuko and they resent the way she is somewhat smug about it has a son a daughter who during the film announce they're leaving them while never a mother gets visits from two men in her past who it turns out just want money from her its a compelling tale of what choices you make what you do to get through life and who you're responsible and beholden to has always been in my eyes one of the greatest character actresses ever from any country and she plays the mostly unyielding less than compassionate with an air of superiority that makes you not like her but at the same time almost envy her at a time when great films were made by ozu and kurosawa amongst others mr is right up there with him if you have a region free dvd player you should attempt to find the two box sets released in england i think this film was a great character study of women who are in danger of being irrelevant that they are really not makes this film a veritable masterpiece
<START> this may not be the most exiting or incredible episode they've made but in my opinion it remains as one of star trek and the sci fi genre's most original episodes most ideas from retro sci fi series especially including star trek has been reused several times this one the other hand remains mostly as a one time triumph this among the episodes that impressed me the most towards the end br br another thing i like with this episode is how it has accomplished to create such and exiting and captivating story with such few special affects now without criticizing the episode i must admit the effects are very dated but then again what can you expect from a tv show from 1967 but still the creature in this episode is basically just a carpet with some coloured rubber on it yet you forget this after about 1 minute and you only start thinking about it as what it's supposed to be also the caves don't exactly look like rock but again you forget it after a few minutes this episode is a living proof on how good acting and a good story can make you ignore the visual effects br br the acting from the main cast is as usual great this episode features the series second mind meld by spock and is one of my favourites so to say it simple leonard nimoy is definitely a scene stealer here and his acting is excellent not that kirk or bones don't get their share of the episode but spock is the most intriguing in this one i like the fact that the episode is not about one specific character but evolves around the trio handling an alien problem also it's nice to see an episode who doesn't only happen on the enterprise br br like most star trek episodes this episode tells us to have an open mind i won't spoil the story but evolves around what in the start seems like a typical monster story it has killed several humans and therefore must be killed but is that really all there is to it i can assure you that the explanation in the end will not disappoint you this is still my favourite star trek tos episode and i give it a 10 10
<START> dear reader watch out this movie is not really a movie though its creators have the to call it so if you have not been warned about its content here it goes the film is simply a sequence of imagines which flow continually and are trying to transmit a certain feeling concept they could be called therefore symbols the images are accompanied by a soundtrack it's purpose being to create atmosphere as well however the images the director has chosen can only transmit feelings to an american audience because they are in an overwhelming number american icons though the film is intended to express the idea of civilized warfare it fails to do so not only because of the general chaos but also because it is far too long and tiresome and i strongly felt that a lot of the scenes have not to do with war in whichever conception to conclude i was greatly disappointed by a documentary which is not a documentary a movie which is not a movie a something whose only strong point is the extraordinary use of technology in image processing
<START> i came out of rendition with a list of flaws a mile long so how is it that my overall impression is that it was a pretty decent movie it's definitely a film whose sum is better than its parts br br those parts include a cast of big name stars not one of them giving a memorable performance omar a relative unknown is the one you'll remember serviceable if undistinguished direction and a screenplay that's both too complicated and too simplistic at the same time is an egyptian born american citizen who gets kidnapped by the u s government's rendition program otherwise known as the process by which america tortures suspected terrorists into confessing information whether or not it's remotely true reese witherspoon plays his pregnant wife who calls in the favor of an old college friend peter saarsgard who works for a senator alan arkin and helps to track her husband down meryl streep plays the head of the rendition program jake gyllenhaal is a young agent assigned to the interrogation and whose conscience gets in the way meanwhile a whole parallel storyline follows the daughter of a top egyptian official who is allied to the american rendition program and her boyfriend who's in training to become a suicide bomber br br yi yi that's a lot of plot to pack into a two hour movie and i was about to wash my hands of the whole thing especially the egyptian romeo and juliet subplot that felt like nothing more than a distraction but then near the film's finale a twist of chronology brings all of the plot strands together in a way that makes you want to reassess everything you thought you knew about the motivations of the various characters and makes rendition a much more interesting movie than it seems like it's going to be br br witherspoon gyllenhaal and sarsgaard all look like high school students playing adults twenty years older than they actually are gyllenhaal in particular usually a fine actor looks so bored that you wonder if he's going to muster the energy to deliver his lines and the screenwriter should be arrested for having an actress as good as meryl streep at his disposal and giving her nothing more to work with than this one dimensional dragon lady the movie of course strives for relevancy but instead of addressing the tangled web of arguments surrounding the national security issue it charges right down the middle of the debate in a predictable fashion there are moments when you think maybe the film will veer off in an interesting direction what if witherspoon did actually begin to doubt her husband's past for instance what if actually had been in contact with terrorists as his accuse but no the movie takes the path of least resistance br br but like i said upfront i recommend this movie i know i've done nothing but list a bunch of its faults but it's got its head in the right place and it is entertaining or at least as as entertaining as a movie about torture and interrogation can be br br grade b
<START> this is without doubt the most exciting and satisfying film i've seen in years the plot seen in print is almost banal a ship crashes on a desert planet with three suns the survivors have to adjust to the landscape and each other then darkness falls and the monsters appear pilot fry after a moment of cowardice during the descent through the atmosphere when she almost jettisoned the passengers takes charge of the group and enlists the help of convicted murderer riddick to lead them through the darkness to the escape ship he's the one with surgically enhanced eyes that can see in the dark but it's really not that simple every character is complex three dimensional with conflicting traits so you never quite know who's good and who's bad br br the performances are uniformly superb radha mitchell shows fry herself for leadership overcoming her own fears and trying to prevent further bloodshed while cole hauser as the man taking riddick back to custody shows he has his own agenda and his own idiosyncratic standards but the film belongs to vin diesel as riddick he has the most magnetic screen presence i've seen in years for much of the film his face is in shadow and he doesn't actually say a great deal but he draws your attention all the same sometimes he draws your attention by not speaking or by not moving and diesel doesn't trivialise the character as could so easily be done by giving him a heart of gold riddick is still one mean and vicious man as they approach the ship he just lets us glimpse those first tentative steps from caring only for the self to caring for others br br technically the film is very good the lighting effects are excellent at both ends of the spectrum the triple sunlight and the pitch darkness special effects showing both and the monsters' points of view add to the suspense as do sound effects of the monsters flying and using to see the monsters themselves are anatomically plausible and suitably frightening editing is so tight it's almost jarring at times there is literally no padding in this film no fades no time to re orient yourself br br from the opening shot to the end of the credits you have to keep your wits about you every scene every line of dialogue every single camera shot is important see it three times to understand it all br br my only caveat is about the science the solar system as shown in the model is impossible planets revolve around suns not vice versa however that doesn't affect the human story so i haven't taken points off for it
<START> this is probably my least favorite episode i lived in cape for quite some time i can tell you there is no ocean or shrimp boats fresh crab or scallops anywhere near missouri cape is the only inland cape it's on the mississippi river it looked like the license plates were from mississippi which may explain why there was so much racial tension missouri and mississippi are 2 completely different states that don't touch one another there are many roads in and out of town and none of them are route 6 or route 666 this whole inaccuracy was very distracting also cassie did not seem like someone who would want to hang around dean if she was well educated i did not buy them as a couple and didn't enjoy the lengthy love scene jo was more dean's style
<START> the coen brothers have truly outdone themselves in this wonderful saga of three escaped convicts though it is based on the odyssey the ancient work of homer you do not have to have read the odyssey to be able to follow the story the brothers coen have woven a tapestry of celluloid and aural delights the soundtrack is intrinsic to the film indeed it is as though the soundtrack is the product and the film is wrapping paper each character is wonderfully exploited and harkens back to the days of old when films were rich with character actors whose very appearance in the film adds richness texture and authenticity george clooney is magnificent as the grease haired everett ulysses mcgill a honest con on the run whose pompous linguistics and vocabulary are comical and endearing o brother where art thou is easily the best coen film to date as well as clooney's best effort clooney is good enough to warrant a best actor nomination as is tim blake nelson's portrayal of the dimwitted friend delmar while the film itself is deserving of a best film nod
<START> at the beginning of this film which i found myself watching on ifc in the wee hours of the morning i was filled with a sense of claustrophobia and general discomfort the feeling of being trapped with no way to escape was so powerful that i didn't know if i wanted to continue watching although it didn't really seem to me that i had much of a choice so compelling was the situation br br gradually though that feeling of discomfort waned although it never really disappeared entirely and i felt drawn into tessa bobby's predicaments and really just hoping against hope that they might get back together br br really just a moving powerful story fit snugly into a tiny package i had no idea that sarah had anything to do with it until perusing her trivia so now i love it even more br br i definitely recommend it if your lucky enough to catch it on the independent film channel sometime or wily enough to figure out some other way to view it
<START> caught this movie on dd while flipping channels and thank heavens that too when it just started having studied in this film touched off many happy memories of the city that apart one wonders why more movies like this aren't made every character is so well etched the grandpa the kid the doc except for the social worker who grates a tad the rest of the movie hardly has a flaw a deserving entry for the oscars even if it wasn't nominated definitely leaves a lump in the throat who u need mush to tickle ur and to think that this movie needed sachin tendulkar to propagate it inspite of being in marathi there was hardly a moment where i wasn't able to follow the movie the subtitles were good a must watch for any fan of good cinema
<START> my gosh this movie was nothing more than filmmaking by numbers struggling salesman can't make a go of it in new york mentor with a heart of gold takes him under his wing struggling salesman moves to california and makes it big then loses it big then bounces back with the simple life then hits rock bottom trying to get back to the top i don't think i can remember any part of the plot that took more than five seconds to develop case in point spoiler when the john character calls to say he and his girlfriend were coming to santa cruz to visit and james woods says there's practically no chance he would come you knew with 100 certainty they were coming in the next scene or two br br on the other hand sean young sure looked good
<START> what an awful movie full of cliches perplexing scenes very bad acting and an script it is hard to believe the same guys that wrote the people vs larry flint and man on the moon wrote this garbage man this makes my list of top 10 worst movies of all time didn't this guy this director if you can call him that realize that the first problem child was bad enough let alone make a sequel for it amazing that piece of trash films like this can be shown to children let alone be released 1 out of 10 's
<START> i am surprised that so many comments about this film are positive having read the book several times and all the other historical novels by there is no way to say much good in this film if i forget the origins of the story i might consider it a reasonably good epic of course to bring such a brick of a book to the big screen is a task not to be envied but it could be done with class i can't understand why even the name of had to be shortened to just i love peter ustinov as and marlon brando probably would have made a better but the overall attitude is too hollywood to ever make justice to the book mind you left the premier of this film in the middle of the showing that's how much he liked it
<START> just before dawn is an underrated horror film from the early eighties i haven't seen it in years but it had a great impact when i watched it quite original for its day the only problem is that it has not been released on video or dvd for years if you like horror i urge you to check this little gem out
<START> strange enough shorts like this get a 10 why they are hilarious this is hilarious notice a lot of the quirky humor dated and childish to toon naysayers but they don't know what they're talking about they got to know that cartoons aren't just for kids the art in this is the best non road runner art of the 1950's looney tunes shorts it's hard to come across something better than the art in the great piggy bank robbery although nothing ever will this runs a close 3rd or 2nd shorts like this one might have spawned witless lt rip offs like tiny toons adventures to try to squeeze out all the old comedy out over and over again like how great movies like scream spawned crap like i know which was released just to squeeze out all the old horror from scream but like scream this is great alone chuck jones has had his faults with shorts once in a while but he does make up for them take hopper for example few people like hopper but it never ruined the lt reputation but i'm sure this was his make up on things as such bottom line this is not as good as duck rabbit duck but close catch it on cartoon network frequently
