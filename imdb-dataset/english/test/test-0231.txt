<START> i approached this movie with the understanding that it was one of the worst flicks ever made i sat down to watch it with this mindset and was pleasantly surprised br br it's not great it's not even that good in fact it's pretty poor however it's not as bad as i had been led to believe by a long shot it's pretty inept and evidently as a cost cutting measure a lot of stock footage is pressed into service a lot of which has no apparent relation to the narrative br br what it is however is an intensely personal movie made by a man who evidently did not have the skills or the funding to do his idea justice before you discount glen or glenda out of hand examine your own artistic skills me i'd love to be able to draw but anything i try to sketch comes out like stick men i'd love to be able to sing but all i do is frighten young children br br wood had an idea and unfortunately he didn't have what it takes to make it work however this was an incredibly daring movie for the puritan 50s however exploitative or incoherent it may appear at first glance
<START> firstly i am a huge fan of crap films b grade is always good for a laugh unfortunately this film is just plain bad i dressed up as a zombie for a party and my make up looked better than the ones in this film especially the big guy at the beginning it just looked like a kid had drawn on his face with crayons br br the acting is so bad i need not comment on why the effect are also extremely amateurish with obvious blood tubes firing a straight jet of blood out the back of zombies heads when they get shot br br it also seems many people commenting on this movie are trying to boost the rating nobody without their finger in the pie would rate this film above a 5 10 frankly it is disgraceful that people who worked on this film are boosting their own ratings br br i suggest everyone avoid this movie it isn't worth wasting the 90 minutes of your life br br absolutely awful
<START> i think this is one hell of a movie we can see steven fighting around with his martial art stuff again and like in all segal movies there's a message in it without the message it would be one of many action fighting movies but the message is what makes segal movies great and special
<START> being a huge fan of conte http www imdb com title i was expecting to be wowed by another french beach romance with a lot of honesty realism and humor same director same actress what could go wrong unfortunately pauline a la is a huge disappointment it's very slow and talkative which would be fine if the dialog conveyed insights into the characters was meaningful or original but it comes across as a typical soap opera alternating between irrelevant pillow talk and jealous accusations the only thing that saves this movie from being a complete disaster is a small amount of character development or at least character change with regards to pauline the source material is standard fare sexual awakening during a beach vacation but it could have been a decent film nevertheless if any of the characters were sufficiently interesting unfortunately that's not the case event though there are other shortcomings with rohmer's season cycle most of his later films are definitely leagues above this one
<START> a couple of teenagers have a little sex on the beach in the 1960s that's all they say they are fifteen while one of the actors is really twenty five maybe this movie was somewhat revolutionary in 1978 in its way of touching topics but i can't imagine that at that time anything shown in was regarded as br br shallow dialogues are mixed with disco music that is even shallower the selection of songs doesn't involve anything but the very very well known that are still heard on every second radio station today the plot of american pie is not much different but it is at least a little bit funny eskimo is dull flat and not aesthetic almost unbelievable that it had six sequels
<START> i'm a historian this movie is so wrong it hurts tried to watch with an open mind but if you're going to delve into a movie or anything for that matter of this nature at least do some homework regarding history locations church protocol et cetera stop playing to the dumb audience please there are those of us out there that actually put on our shoes and venture out to the theatre when something of this nature worthy of a theatrical release comes to town a little research all i'm asking but then again the book it's based on is somewhat of a joke in itself so basically they took a novel with many errors and decided to make it into a screenplay pour millions and millions and millions of dollars into it and make an incredibly promoted world distributed theatrical release and at no time have anyone take the time to do a little research on the lot of it i know several of my colleagues who would have done it for just the credit alone or at least given it to a body of students as an assignment for several weeks to research various aspectsÂ or just pay someone knowledgeable a couple of bucks just to run through it because trust me there are plenty of starving historians out there who would have jumped on the opportunity if it had presented itself
<START> i saw this in a theatre back in 1982 i expected a stupid t a movie that's not what i got br br it's basically about three teenage boys trying to have sex we get the expected sex jokes and scenes but for once they're actually pretty funny br br yeah they're stupid but i enjoyed them anyways also there was a surprising amount of male nudity br br then the movie about halfway through takes a sudden dramatic turn as one of the boys winningly played by lawrence falls in love with a girl then the jokes stop and things get very dark i'm not going to give away what happens but i was very surprised at the sudden turn in events the movie brings up some very important subjects and treats them realistically and with intelligence and it has a real heart breaking ending br br i'm giving this a 10 because this is probably one of the best teen sex comedy dramas ever made it mixes fantasy and realism together and works what more can you ask for also it has a great soundtrack
<START> a superman cartoon br br a huge shipment of gold is being sent across country by train using ultra modern techniques a sophisticated gang of hooded thieves try to waylay the gold with intrepid reporter lois lane as the only passenger on board it's superman to the rescue but now that it's become a runaway train can even he stop the billion dollar limited br br this was another in the series of excellent cartoons max fleischer produced for paramount studio they feature great animation and taut fast moving plots meant to be shown in movie theaters they are miles ahead of their saturday morning counterparts
<START> before i review this film i must make a confession that is rather a bold statement to make as a film reviewer anyone who has already read any of my previous reviews may know that i've always been controversial in a low key sense giving high marks for flops such as captain america and creature and panning such film classics as alistar a christmas carol and shakespeare in love with that in mind this confession might not come as a surprise br br the simple fact is christopher lambert is probably one of my favorite actors woah now don't start getting crazy on me just yet let me explain myself i by no means think he's the greatest actor in the world i clearly confess that he is not he is certainly no morgan freeman or anthony hopkins but i would say that his acting ability is probably somewhere up there with at least bruce willis what i admire about him however are the human qualities that he brings into his action heroes he is just an average guy who laughs and cries and bleeds who is a hero because he has to be not necessarily because he wants to be it takes a lot in my opinion to be able to bring out those qualities in a character especially in the movies he's worked in and lambert's heroes are a far cry from or stallone's quite frankly lambert's characters are easier for me to relate to hence he's not the greatest actor in the world he's just a personal favorite br br i can't say that same however for his films however much i his acting it would be foolish not to confess that his choice of films leave something to be desired most of them are quite frankly terrible and any ridicule that he's gotten over the years from me isn't due to his acting but rather his bad choice in scripts br br with that in mind i can say that his debut film tarzan is one of his best films and probably his greatest performance as i mentioned it is effective of the he brings to the role and for how seriously the director writers and actors handle the material this is a far leap from the b movie action adventures with johnny from the 1940's in fact i would hesitate to call it an action movie instead it is a serious drama that takes all of e r burrough's material seriously showing tarzan's quest to discover his real family in scotland after realizing that he doesn't fit in as a white ape he is torn in between his old family and his new one which includes a wonderful sir ralph richardson in his final role in an attempt to adapt to humans his ape instincts also kick in and he can't decide what he loves more his real family or the one that he's always known all in all it is a wonderful commentary on society and a wonderful character study br br if nothing else it launched lambert into international stardom which continued will into the 1980's with films like highlander and he sicilian unfortunately it didn't last but just wait a while his latest career moves such as gideon and resurrection have proven that though he still have a long way to go he's a competent enough actor to be able to perhaps make a ahem comeback if he'll just pick his roles better br br for now however here's the verdict on his first film br br out of
<START> i come from bangladesh and here c c costigan is a goddess of awesome sex all kidding aside a friend and i were awake in the middle of the night watching movies on the encore action channel when we came across a series of sci fi esquire flicks there was robocop 2 not bad not bad at all then judge dredd stalone almost ruins his career then a movie called lethal target one would think the title lethal target could only be awarded to a really cool and really cheesy rambo knock off but nay what is delivered is what i would like to call a semi softcore semi pseudo action semi sci fi film actually i think i can say that this isn't even a film at all if it wasn't for the main character's sheer hotness my friend and i would've turned off the movie as the opening credits rolled br br i have a few questions to the people i wouldn't even dare say professionals who made this film one in the future why are they using the weaponry we used in 1999 oh wait i get it it's all that they could get their hands on right well then why is the main character wearing what looks like a normal everyday linen shirt and a vest kinda like what people wore in the late nineties oh i get it in space it must have been a fashion statement well then why oh why does the main character pull out a 3 5 floppy disk at one point in the film so that she can some bullshit wtf we've progressed so far that we have space travel but we still haven't progressed past 1 of space br br i guess i'm just asking for too much br br question two let's just say that yes this is a softcore porn then why is there only one real sex scene and why does it last for 2 minutes br br i mean you're taking the reason people are staying up in the middle of the night to see this crap dare i say 'movie' anymore and it down to 2 minutes hell they should've just taken that sex scene and sold it to another porn movie and they would've still made more money off of this crap than they did br br c c is hot and no offense to the actress but she acts about as well as i do and i'm mentally retarded and only have one testicle c c e mail me we'll have lunch i would write more but i've run out of space
<START> this is another one of those films that i remember staying up late to watch on tv scaring the crap out of myself at the impressionable age of 12 or so and myself thereafter to a life of horror movie obsession this is a great movie and stands as living proof that there were indeed realistic effects before cgi br br set on an isolated base in antarctica this version seems almost to pick up where the original version the thing from another world left off the american scientists discover a decimated norwegian base some miles distant everyone is dead and only the half charred remains of some unidentifiable thing left to smolder outside the compound might offer any answers to what may have happened the thing is brought back to the american base and too late the scientists realize that it is alive and lethal the thing thaws out and is off not only killing anyone and anything that crosses its path but also absorbing them making itself into whoever and whatever it wants the film then turns into a brilliant paranoia piece everyone is suspect anyone can be the thing and no one trusts anyone anymore gone is the strength and security found when human beings band together in spite of their differences to battle a monster the group splinters and fear rules supreme who is the thing br br the gore effects here are absolutely amazing and messily realistic i could have done without the dogs head splitting open like a banana peel but that's just the animal lover in me being picky kill all the humans you want but leave the kitties and puppies alone sanity and reason disintegrate rapidly as one by one the humans are taken over by the shapeshifting alien the power of this film lies in its paranoia and although i liked the original version i prefer this one the real threat lies within and is scarier for the fact that it cannot be seen or easily detected when it is forced out of hiding it's wrath is huge and the results are horrific br br this is one of carpenters best films right up there with the fog and halloween all of the actors give strong realistic performances and the special effects are so powerful that they stand as their own main character this film has something for any lover of the horror genre don't miss it
<START> i rented the video of the piano teacher knowing nothing about it other than what was written on the video box i did this with some trepidation because films that win awards at cannes are usually very good or very bad unfortunately this one falls in the latter category about one quarter of the way into it i found myself saying out loud this movie is boring about half way through i was saying to myself where have i seen this before at the three quarters mark i had figured it out br br in spite of its literary origins this film is essentially a remake of robert altman's much earlier 1969 and better that cold day in the park although the details obviously differ and altman's work was more plot driven and less of a character study the two films are thematically identical there is nothing new to be seen in this production every aspect of it has been done before a character spiralling out of control with increasingly self destructive behavior abel ferrara's bad lieutenant 1992 a perverse and doomed 'love' culminating in an operatic near death scene david cronenberg's m butterfly 1993 uncommonly brutal sex scenes david lynch's blue velvet 1986 and so on hence i am bemused by the fact that so many found the film to be shocking shattering etc this highly derivative film seems to have been made for the sole purpose of making viewers feel uncomfortable and clearly succeeded with some however i largely attribute such a reaction to a lack of film viewing experience see enough movies and you really will eventually have seen it all and while it is true that i saw the expurgated 'r rated' version i doubt that the additional scenes would change my overall opinion of the piano teacher br br technically the film is not without merit there is some very good camera work and the lighting is excellent isabelle huppert's creditable performance also helps save it from being a waste of time this is the first of haneke's films that i've seen and if i were to see more i expect i would have the same opinion of him that i have of ferrara an interesting director but not nearly the genius others make him out to be rating 4 10
<START> if you want to see what could be classed as the version of gypsy this is the film for you br br if you enjoy ed listing to the merman recording of gypsy then you really enjoy watching midler as mother rose it's my opinion that midler has the volume vibrato and presents that merman once had br br it's not often these days when listening to update versions of musicals that i get that tingling sensation that makes the hair on my neck tingle but bette midler certainly shows her talents in this movie see how you like them apples br br i know you may not like it but for me ms midler is the definitive gypsy
<START> after watching this movie i have nothing but contempt for any of those who were involved in the making of this abysmal film for one as a general comment the storyline was literally unbelievable and filled with incredible clichÃ©s all around the same obviously goes for the dialogue which panders to the lowest common denominator and manages to offer absolutely zero unpredictable original lines the acting was terrible as well with kane showing throughout the entire movie at the very most 3 separate and distinct emotions even the use of modern special effects failed as each prop was easily distinguishable from its real life counterpart overall i would not recommend for anyone to even think about viewing this feature as it will most surely waste 83 not even 90 minutes of your life
<START> this movie serves up every imaginable greek stereotype in one particularly galling scene the tycoon says i'm just an ignorant peasant as the grandson of greek peasant immigrants who passed on a legacy of wisdom and love to their children and grandchildren i found this movie contemptible and odious
