<START> the story was well plotted and interesting by itself however it is difficult for me to write the review of this film without spoiling you to avoid that i am not going to talking the story here br br i regard this film as a good adaption of sarah water's book as compared with the previous one tipping the velvet i read the book first and then watched the dvd later the film did retain most of spirits of the main characters in the book of course due to the time limitation the film in the last 30 min seemed to be in a rush to cover the part iii of the book therefore it couldn't illustrate well the scene when they all met in the the kitchen of mr place and those after that even the book seemed to me to be a rush on that kitchen scene despite that the film actually did a good job in representing the story it really worth watching it's still unclear when bbc america can broadcast this film that's pity br br ps noticed that the ages of maud and sue were set to be 20 21 instead of 17 18 in the book the latter is more reasonable while the former is more close to the ages of actresses
<START> nothing really unpredictable in this movie but a solid flick in all respects everything from acting to cinematography was solid not a perfectly linear plot line but there wasn't anything you couldn't see coming perhaps a tad melodramatic at points but again a fairly decent movie none the less definitely worth checking out if in doubt of what film to rent over the weekend give this a go though you may not feel like running out and buying it i found it to be quite worth while
<START> this is the australian tv series it is a classic the stories and actors are excellent who can forget picker and his gramophone or chet being ambushed this is cult tv the australian actors in the series were the best of their day and have immortality in the outsiders what can i say timeless adventure the music and song just fantastic the closing credits starting with the close up of the wheel then keir sleeping n being jostled around and then the long shot just cannot get much better than that all 13 episodes are equally solid in the portrayal of the australian myth and i think this is what this series has it does not matter that the two main characters were from overseas i think that is the key to the series and why it is so good
<START> anthony wong stars in both this and the original far superior untold story but the similarities stop there wong doesn't reprise his role obviously and instead plays a bumbling policeman who gets involved with a rather suspicious female fung 1994's miss singapore sun who's a repressed nut job sure but her tame jealous wanna be with a guy who's with a girl killer is no where near as compelling as what wong played in the first one the movie itself seems tired and by the numbers yeung fan as the love unfaithful girl tries to keep one from total boredom by stripping down whenever possible and sun does have a nice ass but even that can't save this dud br br my grade d br br mei ah dvd extras sub titled interviews with cheung kam ching sun anthony wong filmography a very brief synopsis theatrical trailer for the film trailers for chinese erotic ghost story and twenty something
<START> i remember when i first heard about jack frost i was in video at miranda with my family on a monthly video hiring tradition it was at this time that i worked up the courage to venture over towards the horror section of the store browsing the various titles i finally came across jack frost the cover was enough to convince me that the film was beyond my viewing pleasures years later the film disappeared only to be replaced with the inevitable yet unnecessary sequel i once again ventured to the horror section and picked up the case only to come to one conclusion the film would be but not intentionally br br jack frost 2 revenge of the killer mutant snowman quite a title follows off where it's predecessor left it sheriff sam is seeking counseling after his ordeals and jack is now in the form of anti freeze to escape his past sam and his wife head to an island hotel where he is in the company of a wide variety of slasher film stereotypes including busty female models thick headed sports jocks and caribbean staff however jack is released from his liquid grave and is back to his icy methods he heads over to the island and proceeds to kill anyone that would prove to have an awesome death only sam can stop him br br let me just say that this is a straight to video film so it's bound to be bad but this is terrible even in the eyes of other over the top films the camera work is poor using a camera that would make a soap opera look majestic half the actors look like they've come out of a porn shoot and the other half look like they've come out of a retirement home but in actual fact they've actually come out of an asylum there is an extensive use of special effects used in the film which tends to alternate between bland puppetry and cgi that can be bettered by an infant and the death scenes are mostly off screen showing us little of what has happened to the hapless yet deserving victims but the film is most memorable for it's killer one liners such as there's something that needs a little christmas stuffing and i know pronounce you officially f ing dead ultimately the whole purpose behind a film like this is to make a popcorn flick for those friday nights of boredom and even it fails at that to make a sequel to a film that was a poor slasher with a concept that a child would find unbelievable must've taken some nerves of or a total frontal lobotomy to director michael thanks for wasting my time to everyone elseÂ avoid like arsenic
<START> not sure why the other comment on this film was so negative but i loved this movie i am a student of asian art with a particular love of korean art culture and history i thought this movie borough a very controversial and interesting character to life jang seung up is one of the maybe the most famous korean artist and continues to be revered as a master given the tumult of the time in which he painted and his own conflicted nature it is amazing that he produced so much work in so many styles and with such skill this movie honors his talent while taking a direct look at his erratic and somewhat self destructive personality the cinematography in my opinion was beautiful many of the outdoor panoramic shots looked like korean landscape paintings which i found a lovely conceit rather than overly arty and i think that choi min portrayed jang up with a necessary intensity and unpredictability i would highly recommend this film to art lovers and movie lovers alike
<START> while not quite as good as a murder is announced which was not only delightful but almost surpassed the book this is an excellent adaptation and you know what it is a huge improvement on the geraldine mcewan version now i don't take pride in bad mouthing the geraldine mcewan adaptations two or three of them were surprisingly good but others started off well but ruined by either a poor script a confusing final solution or both the geraldine mcewan version suffered from a plodding pace and both of the above problems and i would consider second worst of the itv adaptations worst being mystery which even on its own merits turned out dull and confusing this adaptation of the book nemesis is a huge improvement it not only respects the book despite a few liberties but it pretty much the problems the itv version had despite the added character of lionel coming across as rather irritating more to do with how he was written than how he was acted and one or two moments of sluggish pacing this is solid as an adaptation of a decent book it is beautifully filmed with nice photography and period detail and the music as always is excellent the performances are wonderful this time around and make the most of an in general well done script with joan brilliant as always as miss marple and solid turns from liz fraser helen cherry joanna hole and anna cropper margaret is outstanding though in a chilling and moving performance as overall well worth watching better than the recent version in pretty much all departments 9 10 bethany cox
<START> an awful b movie at best with video quality similar to dead alive i challenge anyone who is a aliens james cameron 1986 movie fan to count how many times either lines or almost entire sequences were ripped off from the first two alien movies to make this classic piece of garbage br br cast members such as r lee ermey and ray wise were the only two actors with any talent and the lead jack scalia was really absolutely horrible i think they cast him for his massive chin i was also annoyed with the stereotyping of the only black male on the set john bey who must look at this movie and just wonder look him up sometime as he has done a lot of interesting movies br br but on this movie the script as i said earlier was a rip off of aliens tweaked and turned into a submarine thriller it included such lines as i got a bad feeling about this and kill me as one crew member is infected by one of the mutants and his belly starts doing the alien hop just before it pops out of his stomach there is also a rip off of the classic get some via bill paxton we also have a bunch of navy grunts running through caves with creepy popping out of walls even the explosions of the mutated creatures is very similar to the popping of aliens as they charge marines in the movie aliens and the kicker is that some of the mutants spit acid as opposed to having acid for blood there are many more major examples so if you want to see this script done well watch the first two classics alien and aliens with sigourney weaver you'll have a more enjoyable time br br the plot could have been interesting and done better if not for confusing sequences in the start of the movie and generally poor editing camera shots were pretty dull and honestly it wasn't very hard to stop watching it and walk around the room to get a snack or check email many of the interactions between characters made little or no sense and went nowhere more often than not the whole command structure between crew and capt was poorly done i'm not even sure if there are captains in the military that have full control over nuclear subs in general this just shows that there was little research done for background information to make the movie seem at least a little respectable and there are many other similar examples like dive depth etc br br if you like horrible movies or are a big fan of alien and aliens and want something to just laugh and shake your head at then this movie may be for you as for me this one is going back on the shelf permanently
<START> for a brief moment the opening scene with traci lords and the br br techno bar is incredible i'd probably follow her to my ultimate death too best vampire movie of all time but with a twist the fight scenes are awesome wesley snipes displays an athleticism you dont get to see every day and stephen dorff is impressive and very believable as an ambitious new recruit moving himself up the hierarchy by any means necessary great flick 9 10 where's blade ii
<START> this is definitely one of the most scary and spell binding films ever made you are stuck to the movie from the beginning to the very end even though there are some plot holes it keeps being exciting to the final showdown besides 8 mm and peeping tom this is one of the best films about snuff movies a taboo theme of our culture if you like the scream trilogy you will probably love that one
<START> what an absolutely charming movie the cast is wonderful and the story is witty and fun an all around pleasant movie experience although the plot is somewhat predictable it doesn't make the story any less enjoyable in fact i didn't want it to end i've always been a ingrid bergman fan and i was interested to see her in a comedic role she didn't let me down ingrid bergman's performance as ms dickinson is fun to watch i loved her interaction with toni at the music store as well as her dancing and doing the dentist it only further proved what i already knew that she is one of the greatest actresses of all time goldie hawn is also delightful to watch her fun gentle hearted and lovable toni is the driving force of the movie you don't even question why she would be so concerned about her wife you just accept that she's just that type of person who wouldn't be happy unless she knew everyone else was also and walter matthau is great as julian his actions never create a feeling animosity for the viewer in fact they almost make him more enduring there wasn't an unlikable character in the bunch this movie has definitely with stood the test of time i watched it just last night and i think it's one of the best romantic comedies i've ever seen if you're looking for a fun lighthearted romantic comedy look no further
<START> the old dark house sub genre that dominated the early talkies rarely fails to disappoint when we re view the oldies to day here is one that provides so very many suspicious characters you have to wonder how they will be able to tie up all the loose ends in the 6 reel running time br br the crooked circle is a gang of and thieves who have decided to take revenge on col walters berton churchill who has sent one of their ranks to prison they decide he must die that very night meanwhile the colonel's own group the sphinx club is determined to protect him at all costs this does not sit well with thelma irene purcell fiancÃ©e of club member brand osborne ben lyon late of the mega budgeted hell's angels 1930 who wants him to quit the club and stop endangering his own life brand promises to resign after saving the colonel's life everyone heads off to walters newly purchased mansion on long island to await the assassin br br the colonel might be the new owner of melody manor but it's an old dark house complete with eccentric neighbours like raymond hatton as a local hermit and maybe even a ghost top billed zasu pitts is nora the housekeeper who expects to see a spirit around every corner throw in a cop james gleason who is certain brand is a criminal and we have a picture which is packed with action and surprises br br you will notice right away that the script writer was at a loss to come up with too much dialog because a lot of characters repeat the same lines over and over c henry gordon a hindu mystic which movies of that time were loaded with says evil is on the way many times and i lost count of how often ms pitts says something always happens to somebody there are many suspects and two characters mr gleason as the stereotype dumb cop and roscoe karns as mr pal who serve as comedy relief the house itself is appropriately spooky looking in fact i think the same set was used in the phantom 1931 with lots of secret passages and violin music coming out of empty rooms but somehow you never really get a feeling of danger maybe it's because no one in the movie and i do mean no one is entirely what they seem to be it all comes out right in the end though but to go into any more detail would spoil it for you br br watch carefully for robert frazer from white zombie and frank reicher best remembered as capt from king kong to pop up among the suspects br br the crooked circle is a fun film some aspects of the plot are predictable and then again several others are not i suspect you will enjoy it
<START> this was the second movie i ever saw and still holds a place in my heart as one of the most hilariously awful film experiences you are ever going to have br br miles o'keeffe sp is in this using his chiseled physique to score another payment on the mortgage on his condominium he's stiff wooden and unconvincing but he still comes across as a cool likable guy and at least he's photogenic that's the only decent i can find to say about the movie so i thought i would get it out of the way right up front the fact that he is in the movie adds another point to the score and saves it from being a 1 out of 10 br br in no particular order examples of how badly put together this film is br br 1 ok the tanya roberts clone mila quests to 'the ends of the earth' to find ator which takes 3 minutes of screen time including the time she spends stumbling around dying from a poisoned arrow in her shoulder which i assume would have slowed her down quite a bit so ator heals her up and takes his trusty aid thong and sets out to go back to the her castle and proceeds to take the next 50 minutes of the movie recovering the ground that mila traversed in 3 minutes how does that work i know that the intrepid crew is being harassed by magical forces and enemies etc on the way back but still br br 2 apparently the writer director felt the need to add 'depth' to the film by adding a running debate dialog game of 20 questions between the mean john saxon wannabe and the wise man the richard harris wannabe but joe apparently got his philosophical training from hallmark cards t shirts and bumper stickers and he doesn't understand tempo pacing or timing and neither do the actors remark during one of these exchanges is the tag line for my entry the scenes with these two drag on and on bringing the movie to a screeching halt and killing any momentum or excitement generated by the sword fighting and questing of the heroic trio br br 3 once ator arrives at the castle and is captured things go even farther downhill decides to feed a bunch of women victims along with ator and mila to the serpent god he keeps in his basement this scene had some potential for excitement so the director immediately kills this potential by instilling the scene with all the drama of people waiting in line at the dmv to pay their traffic fines ator proceeds to have a big battle with the serpent that is barely more convincing than bela lugosi's battle with the rubber octopus puppet in bride of the monster br br 4 the climactic scene in which ator invents the hang glider out of twigs and animal skins is so patently silly that it completely blows the viewer out of the movie and makes you roll on the floor laughing until your sides hurt br br 5 oh yes and the filmmakers decided to include stock footage of an atomic explosion at the end with the moral that ator decided to destroy the mcguffin that drives the movie because mankind was 'not ready' message coming in just like bride of the monster again come to think of it all it needed was a bystander to observe they tampered in god's domain br br 6 for some reason the version of the movie i saw features introductory and closing homo erotic credit sequences that have absolutely nothing to do with anyone or anything else in the movie i have no idea where this footage came from but it is actually worse than the actual movie it bookends br br watch this only if you are a big fan of miles or if you enjoy the way mst3k skewers material like this
<START> every review i have read so far seems to have missed a crucial point shakespeare wrote for the accent and the pronunciation just as he did for northerners in other plays the scottish accent changes the emphasis and rhythm of the language and affects profoundly what is said and the way it is taken so listen again and note the difference the play is well done and the rhythm of the words are so much better than that provided by people using received polite well enunciated english i am reminded of the time a teacher in a school in leicester unknowingly asked me age 14 to read a piece of walter scott which was written in the tone of the border i come from the border and when i read it as it should be read it made all the difference
<START> one of the scariest movies i have ever seen was carrie the first one now as with other movies they have totally ruined the carrie franchise with the rage carrie 2 from the the movie plods along like in a beat up van there are hardly any scares and this movie is chock full of all the various high school sterotypes i e the football jock the bitchy cheer leader the followers and of course the black wearing misfits another sad thing about this show is that you know what's going to happen the moment you see the opening credits sure sure girl gets and then turns into crazed psychic murderer yawn br br been there done that br br even the actors look like they were forced into doing this movie emily is as frightening as a cabbage patch doll while jack london let's just say i didn't pay to see wood act apart from the actors the serve more to irritate than to link up with the first movie br br bottom line if you can beam objects around like carrie then for the love of god beam yourself out of that theatre
