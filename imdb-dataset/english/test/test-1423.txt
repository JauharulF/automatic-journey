<START> i ran across yvette in a film at the los angeles film festival and thought she was a doll after writing my review of her film there i wanted to see more of her found this movie it was pretty bad not her fault she is only in the first few minutes where she is obviously being the person to pull you in to watch this bad movie bad directing scenes are looped over and over with all the actresses amber smith has a very bad breast job yet the other actresses looked pretty good i really like yvette but this was obviously a bad choice of hers i can't believe i rented this trash to look for her i hope to find her other movies
<START> when you think of golf movies you think of caddyshack but what if there are kids around go right to this movie disney uses is proved formula to make a movie that the adults and the kids will enjoy the acting in this movie in my opinion is quite good and the leading cast for the most part is very young this movie is also filmed very well and unique seeing all the angles of the golf game i think this movie should be up for some academy awards for film editing or something like that because the entire flow of the film is top notch though the ending might be a little predictable the movie does well on its own it also shows that you do not need swearing nudity or violence to make a great golf movie
<START> adventures in dinosaur city though a creative idea was a nauseatingly atrocious attempt at filmmaking being sucked into a tv and into a new world is interesting three teens obsessively enthralled with half animated dinosaurs is not don't waste the time or the brain power to see this sure loser i wouldn't even let my kids watch it
<START> after 2 years of using this site for movie reviews i finally registered with imdb just so i could give farscape a 10 the show's writers cast and crew have proven themselves the unambiguous masters of the science fiction genre even those who do not normally appreciate sci fi should be encouraged to give this exceptional series a chance br br virtues are simply too numerous to list but one of them stands out above all the quality of the writing is amazing i haven't heard dialogue this good since blake's 7 in fact farscape feels a lot like a blake's 7 with good special effects and a bit more romance br br everyone enjoy
<START> this film was very interesting to me virtually a film within a film which is about a very whimsical director who cleverly persuades an actress and and actor who happen to dislike each other in producing sexual chemistry on film the director is faced with a of obstacles as she tries to get the two individuals to perform beautifully on film sex is comedy is much more than a comedy packed with uncomfortable quirky moments the movie also addresses the psychological and innate instinctual behavior of men and women in regards to the sometimes controversial act of sex i loved this film the character jeanne played by the beautiful anne performs wonderfully on screen as you share in her struggle to produce a motion picture work of art
<START> the vhs cover for the evil below makes it look like a cool underwater horror flick sadly it's closer to a boring adventure flick and has no real horror elements it starts off with some divers who get attacked and we see a bit of blood but that's the only blood in the entire film br br the evil below isn't the worst around but for a horror film it is tediously boring the acting is decent and to be honest the only thing that keeps you watching is the developing romance between the two leads there's a few nightmare sequences where it just seems like the director didn't know what to do i manged to sit through it all just about but i wouldn't recommend this film to anyone horror fans might want a copy for the cool vhs cover but it's best left at that
<START> mom begins at night in the middle of nowhere at what looks like a wooden building in the desert a pick up truck pulls up an angry father chucks his slutty daughter virginia monroe claudia christian out leaves her there but she isn't alone as the shadowy figure of nestor brion james watches her from a short distance virginia tries to make conversation but as she grinds a cigarette out under her leopard print thigh high high heeled boots nestor grabs her by her throat drags her off into the darkness nestor then rips her top open turns into a monster starts to eat her innards virginia is the latest victim of a serial killer that have lieutenant carlo hendrix art evans the lapd baffled or at least that's the message a local tv news reporter named clay mark thomas miller is telling his viewers clay is happily living with his pregnant girlfriend alice mary beth mcdonough therefore his mother emily jeanne bates has a spare room going which she decides to rent out to the 'blind' dark sunglass wearing nestor unfortunately for emily she accidentally knocks sunglasses off which reveal he has strange coloured eyes nestor then turns into a monster again bites emily turning her into a flesh eating monster just like himself nestor takes emily out to train her they find a suitable homeless bum rory murder him eat his guts but emily's son clay has witnessed the whole thing he must choose between doing what is right his love for his mother who now just happens to be a grotesque bloodsucking flesh eating monster br br edited written directed by patrick rand i thought mom was a pretty awful film looking at some of the other comments on the imdb the genre listing it has been given it appears many seem to think that mom is a comedy horror well i can tell you now that i didn't see any comedic elements in mom at all because there aren't any unless they are very subtle the only thing that i can assume is that people see comedy in the actual situation which mom presents that being an old lady turning into a flesh eating monster the predictable problems emotional angst that it causes to her son who finds out there are no jokes apart from naming a prostitute beverly hills stella stevens slapstick humour or anything even remotely funny in the film itself as far as i could see it is played totally straight throughout it's 90 minute run time so with there being no comedy in mom that must mean there's lots of horror right wrong mom sucks is painfully slow to watch especially after the first thirty odd minutes which consist of nestor turning into a monster a couple of times biting emily showing her how to hunt for food clay finding out until this point mom was moving at a fairly decent pace had some ok special make up effects had me interested unfortunately mom runs for another hour which is basically the emotional crap suffered by emily's son the eventual breakdown of his marriage him being torn between love for his mother the fact that she's a flesh eating monster this part of the film is incredibly slow boring as dull as dishwater even having the nerve to resort to a clichÃ©d role reversal scenario where clay tells his mom to go to her room stay there locking the door behind her telling her off putting bars over her window so she can't escape her room mom's script totally ignores the monsters origins ask's us to just accept that this thing exists without giving a single reason why we should no matter how silly an explanation might have been i think some background to the monster would have helped technically mom is bland cheap looking although i can't say it's badly made it's very average stuff all the way with nothing that particularly impresses or anything with which i could make fun of to pass the time the special make up on the monster are ok but their used in very quick flashes blink you'll miss them don't be fooled by any fancy video box artwork like i was the monster is only in it three times maximum all of those are within the pacey first thirty minutes there isn't much gore either a severed arm some brief intestine eating a burnt body a drill in someone's arm is all we get the acting is ok but please mr brion james what is that dodgy accent all about at least james had the good sense to know he was in crap sensibly opted to be killed off early on in the proceedings everyone else are nobodies expect the black lieutenant who was also a black police officer in fright night 1985 but you may recognise him from die hard 2 1990 he made mom die hard 2 in the same year talk about opposite ends of the spectrum overall there is nothing by which i can really recommend mom as a horror film it certainly isn't a comedy as far as i'm concerned very poor very disappointing yet again i've been conned by fancy video box artwork with lots of stills of cool looking monsters definitely one to avoid
<START> it starts really interesting the story develops around the main character who runs a cleaning business specialized in cleaning up crime scenes as a former cop he runs into some strange situation when one job does suddenly vanish furthermore he discovers some relation to an investigation into police corruption his columbo feeling is justified the deeper he gets into the background of the story the good actors jackson ed harris eva mendes play in an suspenseful story with some twists but only up to the last 25 minutes up to here 7 of 10 stars spoiler suddenly the movie looses its touch and in the end there is a completely unnecessary shoot out involving the 14 year old daughter a betrayal of friendship and a not justified righteousness out of the character development why not having giving up his investigation for the sake of the friendship or having the daughter discovering some facts or many possible much better story finishes are imaginable a truly wasted ending
<START> we sat through this movie thinking why is this or that scene in the movie what does this have to do with the plot we hoped that by the end everything would be slightly more clear it was not to be br br i think the director in a fit of pique threw the script up in the air and then some minor and vengeful underling reassembled it randomly with no regard to the scene being filmed possibly with scissors and glue stick br br the film's motifs include communism bad nihilism bad poor parenting bad threesomes bad tv bad coherent scripting bad good it's really not clear br br finally no german water taxi would ever have an unchained staircase that would let passengers fall in to the water the abundant quantity of signs everywhere is testament to this fact
<START> i heard the stories of the ravers in the movie and thats great but that is only 1 100 of the movie the problem with this movie is the cheesiness i never really got the plot or why the guy was stealing girls that makes no sense but hey why they were in a club randomly was curious also many parts of this movie make no sense but overall i was interested it was confusing on many levels maybe i am just not indie enough for this movie but judging from the b looking end scene they ran out of money just cut some stuff in and forgot about the plot its low budget and appears so i like the fact that they used little special effects which were bad but they used none that were quality i would say this film is the quintessential bad script with alright production it is definitely not as random as many movies i have seen but the pieces of the puzzle just don't make sense together in effects i would give exception to the final battle when all the effects went 1950's on my ass sparks out of models and the like watch it if you like an unintentional comedy from an action movie mystery science theater has a candidate
<START> coming from oz i probably shouldn't say it but i find a lot of the local movies lacking that cohesive flow with a weak storyline this comedy lacks in nothing great story no overacting no melodrama just brilliant comedy as we know oz can do it do yourself a favour and laugh till you drop
<START> i remember watching this movie many years ago on vhs at a friends place at first i thought it would be a boring car movie but much to my surprise it ended up being one of the best movies i can remember watching for its time br br it has a good story line and best of all it has some awesome aussie cars and street racing i really loved fox's car the most which was a worked dodge charger the paint work which was done on this car was truly outstanding in my opinion br br there's also a black two door blown 57 which comes into the movie later on br br i actually managed to get a copy of this movie on vhs last year at k mart over here in australia i did have plans of converting this movie to dvd myself as i believe it is a movie worth the conversion but much to my surprise this weekend while i was browsing the dvd movie bin i came across it on dvd so of course i grabbed it while i could as it was the only copy there br br anyway if you really want to see some classic street racing with real muscle cars including a great story line without a rice burner in sight then this movie is for you br br here is some additional info taken from the back of the dvd br br he'll win at any cost fox is a young man that lives in the fast lane he believes he is the fastest man on the road but street racing is illegal if he doesn't accept his latest challenge he could loose his girl if he does accept he could lose his life living dangerously living fast and winning at any cost is their obsession they don't turn back the don't give in and the don't ask for help
<START> i just saw this movie last night at a midnight sneak preview screening i work for an independent theatre chain in colorado it's one of the perks i'm sorry but this is one of the worst movies i've ever seen i know that there are some bruce campbell fanatics out there who like star wars die hards will string you up from the nearest tree if you dare speak any ill of their beloved cinematic icon nevertheless campbell this particular work from the chin is a celluloid black hole br br before you make any assumptions that i'm some hoity toity film buff who only watches real movies like ladies in lavender and sideways think again i'm a huge fan of b movies and bruce campbell in particular his trademark character ash is one of my favorites and his portrayal of the aging elvis in bubba ho tep was phenomenal br br but hey b movies still have the potential to be bad and not in that good campy way we all love and that's what watching this particular one was like for me and my fellow co workers with the exception of that one tracking shot where bruce runs through the square and scares the kids there were no laughs to be had overall we found the story to be mind numbingly stoopid the pacing like and the so called humor dumber than a bag of hammers i'm sorry but ted raimi's character was not comic relief he was just plain retarded believe me we all went into this really wanting to like it but left feeling incredibly disappointed and robbed of two hours br br if you absolutely loved this movie plan to see it multiple times want to marry and have kids with it etc that's fantastic we all like what we like so you get no judgement from me but don't go questioning the sense of humor or fan loyalty of those who aren't having multiple orgasms over campbell's latest cinematic coupe this flick was a steaming turd sandwich in my humble opinion and as a true campbell fan i'm allowed to say that
<START> coming at the end of the cycle of the universal monsters horror films and before the golden age of sci fi films house of dracula is more science fiction than horror and incorporates some of the more cheesy read enjoyable elements which would come to the sci fi films of the coming era lon chaney jr plays the wolf man and john carradine dracula and glenn strange the frankenstein monster br br a mad scientist sets out to cure both monsters of their by means of modern read mad science when the scientist's beautiful nurse assistant is revealed to be a hunchback early in the film the viewer is thereby alerted to the fact this film is not going to be typical universal fare this film foreshadows the kind of sleazy exploitation we would come to take for granted in 1950's sci fi br br if you don't mind the slower pacing of the older films and black white does not throw you off this film is recommended viewing this one is not currently available on dvd but amc airs it occasionally so keep a lookout or you could always wishlist it on your tivo
<START> i saw heaven's gate on its opening week nearly twenty years ago tickets were sold in advance based on the great anticipation of seeing cimino's long in the making follow up to his 1978 masterpiece the deerhunter the reviews came in and critics trashed the film with an influential new york film critic led the way and most critics followed suit and the 40 min film was pulled from distribution united artists had cimino shorten the film by about an hour and it was re released many months later to equally horrible reviews and to dismal business the film at that time cost about 40 million dollars now considered low budget making it one of the most expensive in history and cimino had free rein on the project with endless retakes despite it being only his third film the deerhunter had also received a negative backlash based on a perceived political ideology which was not popular i mention all this to present a possible bias building up against cimino at the time i thought the film was very good and when i saw the shorter version it was still very good only less so the film showed up again in a museum in the early 1990's they were supposed to show the long version but they could not find an existing print nevertheless seeing the film years later i now thought heaven's gate was a masterpiece finally the long version started to appear in a few select cities i got to see it recently and it was well worth the wait heaven's gate begins with the graduation ceremony at harvard university two of the graduates are kris kristofferson and john hurt and we some of the flaws in their characters early on despite the mandate joseph cotton gives in his speech to the graduating class to use their education to enlighten and improve their country many of the graduates behave as if they are part of an elite country club the film flashes ahead 20 years to johnson county in wyoming a cattle company called the stockholders association has hired poor people to shoot 125 poor immigrants claiming they are cattle thieves kristofferson sides with the immigrants while john hurt is part of the association although hurt is totally against this insane action he is too ineffectual a character to do anything about it a massacre takes place but the immigrants do well in defending themselves a united states cavalry comes to the rescue of the association to allegedly arrest them after most of the damage has been done when in fact they sanctioned the mass killing kristofferson also suffers a great personal loss and the film ends with him years later as part of the elite class of his harvard days married bored on a yacht living but dead on the inside br br this is a very complex film which is brilliant in every department such as it's themes structure direction cinematography writing music editing set designs and acting kristofferson walken hurt huppert dourif bridges waterston and cotton are all excellent portraying very complex characters some of the major complaints i read about this film state that is ugly to look at incoherent too long that the characters make no sense and that the words are often unintelligible in its defense heaven's gate has the look of photographs of that period just as mccabe mrs miller did some of the scenes are smoky looking to suggest the industrial revolution or sometimes horses wagons people are passing by from all sides creating a sense of reality the critic who called it one of the ugliest movies ever made likes to use his thumbs a lot but in spite of all that the composition of each frame and the cinematography are impeccable the film makes a great deal of sense if you pay attention to it everything is not spelled out for the viewer and one has to observe closely to understand the motivations of the characters or its themes as to its length it is a beautifully structured piece at times moving poetic exhilarating or devastating with virtually one great scene following another at times some of the words are unintelligible especially in some of the scenes bustling with activity but one could understand such a cinematic film as this through its use of film language the glances between characters or their actions one day soon this film should be re released in its full length so that people and critics could give it a second chance do not let michael cimino become another orson welles under appreciated in his lifetime and not able to make the kinds of great films he is capable of making
