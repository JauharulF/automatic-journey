<START> b b thornton proves to be a great actor in this little seen movie thornton really gets into his characters literally i caught this on cable one night and enjoyed it too bad it was released nationwide in theaters the same year as fear and loathing and half baked
<START> writer director emilio estevez shows a definite lack of talent here with this un redeemable supposed comedy the script is completely hopeless let alone the fact that it is unoriginal and badly worked the comedy just does not work when estevez isn't using poor taste sex jokes he is borrowing used gags and re doing them very poorly you would think the teaming of estevez and brother charlie sheen would be cool but it isn't br br the entire cast is uninspired and unfunny never managing to raise a laugh and barely coaxing a smile from their audience do yourself a favour and leave this one on the video shelf br br thursday june 25 1992 video
<START> this movie was the worst movie i've ever seen no story no point it wasn't even funny at all not sure why people say this movie is hilarious because it sucked so much felix bean the main character sucked susanna sucked this movie was made in 1996 and it really was set in the 80s what else i'm never letting my friend pick movies ever again hmm the movie cover said it was from the producers from super troopers who kidnapped them and stole their identities wow what a waste of time the only minute thing that was funny was freaky ricky he was funny especially when he and emily ended up together that was funny all and all it sucked waste of time and sleep wow never thought a movie like this could be made so dumb for watching for watching it to the end
<START> we bought the dvd of walking with dinosaurs and have been nearly ecstatic over the things that are done so very well on it br br many dvds today offer the bare minimum the feature itself and maybe one other language which doesn't help the viewer at all but makes it easier for the company to see the dvd in multiple markets br br not so in the case of there are so many wonderful extras and well thought out vignettes that watching even the navigation menu is interesting the intros to each chapter in the making of dvd are laugh out loud funny the quality of the sound and video is terrific and of course the story and content what more could a dinosaur lover ask for br br i did watch most of the version broadcast on narrated by avery brooks then watched about half of the dvd narrated by kenneth branaugh as near as i can tell the broadcast version slipped in a number of mostly american slang terms in the narration i e in a section about t rex mating says the female is tiring of the male's attention and brooks says the honeymoon is over and cut out some of the closer in puppet work i prefer the version simply because it is more complete br br overall a great value and wonderful production many kudos to the bbc and the crew that made this gem
<START> this movie is definently a horror movie and if you do not get scared than you must not be watching this movie it works on the old techniques but throws something new into the mix this movie grips and runs and hides within your mind the movie has a point to it unlike other horror movies watch it for a thrill and shock to your system
<START> i've always enjoyed animated ducks for some reason duck tales darkwing duck daffy duck donald duck though none of them are as deranged as originally broadcast between 1994 and 1997 lasted for a total 70 episodes but could easily have gone on forever without becoming stale br br the titular character is a discombobulated unapologetic slob and pretty much the worst living person in the world he's a private detective a widower a peeping tom an alcoholic a sex maniac a murderer a fill in the blank you name it has done it but who can blame him for being such a slimeball when the world he we live in is so insane outrageous and just plain nonsensical eric voiced by the maniacal jason alexander could carry the whole show by himself but when he's surrounded by a bunch of eccentric supporting characters you just know that trouble is just waiting to explode at every opportunity my favorite has to be or just pig incredibly deadpan sidekick who is seemingly talented and highly skilled at everything and is perpetually oblivious to his partner's infinity of vices and incompetence br br the typical plot will involve some bizarre case he'll inevitably blunder through or will revolve around his highly dysfunctional household though every now and again arch enemy king chicken tim curry a sort of professor moriarty in fowl form hatches some diabolical scheme in revenge for being bullied in high school br br since i was a teenager this has been my absolute favorite animated show better than the simpsons family guy and even king of the hill nothing will ever surpass it there never was or will be anything quite like ever again the level of satire observational humor and writing is so sharp it's deadly and the animation is done in that unique klasky csupo style anyone who has seen rugrats will understand it's a wonderful highly imaginative and wild world and all with a noirish 1940s feel br br you can never have too much of this particular bird
<START> i just re watched a few episodes of this series on very poor vhs tapes that i recorded the series on i'm glad i did though br br is based on the children's books by beverly cleary and follows the adventures of the title eight year old sarah she has fun with friends and family and gets into trouble much like many eight year olds all ten episodes are pretty good mystery meal kind of me out as a vegan but it's funny seeing the parents trying to get their kids to eat cow's tongue and any episode that mentions godzilla versus the smog monster twice can't be all bad i like bad day even more although it's disheartening to see going through a rough day she does imagine herself getting revenge on her friend howie's uncle a pre factor barclay hope who always teases her the perfect day is also good br br lori plays sister i swear i've seen her on something else but imdb doesn't list anything besides this show unfortunately this series is not on dvd why is every crappy show made these days on dvd except something i'd actually like to buy an injustice if there ever was one
<START> returning from 20 years in china a young missionary refuses to become the cat's paw for a gang of hometown hoodlums br br this movie was a bit of a departure from harold lloyd's previous movies comedy derived more from dialogue often rather serious predominates here rather than the elaborate sight gags which powered harold's classics of the past there are some splendid moments however which are pure visual fun as when harold attempts to follow a convertible down a crowded street or when he desperately tries to keep a nightclub stripper from losing her clothes there is also the climactic scene set in a chinatown basement in which harold gleefully jumps unabashedly into the darkest comedy but most of the humor derives from harold's refusal to be the patsy of the criminals who've run his hometown for years br br and it's quite a collection of crooked politicians thugs harold finds himself up against played by a bevy of fine character actors george nat pendleton grant mitchell edwin maxwell alan warren hymer stuttering fuzzy knight pert una merkel is on hand as the tobacco stand girl who catches harold's eye and keeps him intrigued by her no nonsense outlook on life br br movie mavens will recognize samuel s hinds as harold's missionary father charles sellon as an elderly clergyman and herman bing as a german gangster all uncredited also showing up for only a few seconds as an attempted kidnapper is noah young a familiar face from harold's silent films here making his final appearance in a lloyd picture br br fox gave the film fine production values especially in the opening scenes set in china
<START> i learned a thing you have to take this film like a funny period comedy if you don't want to be disappointed the film's enjoyable because it's a delicious comedy i think the over hype damaged it the too much glorified monica bellucci appears in few scenes and isn't so good as they wanted to let you believe she sounds unnatural false the best actress in this film is sabrina who speaks with a perfect tuscan accent and shines together with massimo elio is very very good the most promising young italian actor according to me daniel auteuil looks like napoleon but i preferred other actors so the most hyped performances were also the worst br br costumes and production design are okay sure american period movies are more accurate about these things because have bigger budgets but the italian ability rewards the lack of money a nice period comedy in short with a first rate casting except for bellucci and auteuil
<START> this movie sucks so bad its funny to see what a poor story this has where two pea brained american twins who know about nothing outside their school can come to another continent and do unimaginable things there its just so stupid and so bizarre how can they just find two french guys hit on them and in the end kiss them not knowing anything about them more realistic would have been having the guys take them away and rape them which could have easily happened in such a situation as for the bit where they make the french president drink 'bad water' that was just lame i don't think he would have been too pleased in real life everything worked out too easily for the girls and they could have been in real trouble many times in the movie if it at all depicted real life br br my rating 0 10
<START> yet another version of mother of all gangster flicks the classic godfather and yet another case of over hype due to media circus sarkar the 13th hindi film of ram gopal varma as director is also the weakest in his underworld trilogy including the other two being the excellent satya and company the charisma the magnetic persona of the two playing father son duo on screen for the first time is definitely a treat to watch out for not just strong performances but their perfect chemistry is the biggest scoring point here for which varma should be applauded however the same equation of the duo is missing with the other characters in the film reason the other characters look more like cardboard caricatures esp the villains represent the typical bollywood baddies a character who attracts attention is elder son played by but again not able to hold due to half baked characterization the drama and conflict is brought alive by the excessive use of close shots which brought a claustrophobic effect rightly needed to construct an ambiance the haunting score amar and the sound design kunal mehta dev together with dark murky background overlapped by shinning powerful images camerawork by amit roy contributes to visuals so typical of ramu's style but there is an overuse of music though fortunately no songs are there in the film but can interest of today's intelligently growing audience be sustained just on shoulders of two performers and strong visuals i don't think so surely audience more and here film fails to deliver in any adaptation in order to add a new dimension the biggest pre requisite is the screenplay which is sluggish here not being crisp at places and therefore the pace slackens quite often what finally audience is subjected to is a highly predictable very commonplace drama with very little surprise elements top stunt director allan amin is also not in his best form some scenes which require a different treatment includes a minister is talking foul about sarkar and the son is overhearing a very amateurish shoot out in the jail on sarkar sarkar jr escapes from the clutches of his enemies a son easily motivated to kill his own father a son is secretly entering his father's room to kill him a police commissioner slapping sarkar jr all this requires a more realistic hard hitting approach which is the back bone to create the required conflict the dialogues are weak for eg look at an amateurish line where a cm says to sarkar jr Â wo jo police commissioner tha na maine the women folk take on working is completely ignored the uninterrupted negotiations about criminal activities while sarkar is with his family also look slightly out of place in fact the film follows a graph quite similar to ramu's own production ab tak in depicting the battle between good and evil the other side of life the law police administration politics is completely ignored certainly more is expected in content here the film definitely falls short and could not rise above an average fare dear ramu agreed that now you are laughing your way to the bank you definitely need to take some drastic measures in your film production factory before it is too late
<START> this movie is the worst thing ever created by humans you think manos is the worst movie ever it doesn't even come close to this garbage i dont even know where to begin the russian commander and the rebel chic are the worst actors ever to appear in a movie they make the sister in troll 2 look like meryl streep the goofy faces the chic makes while she's in kung fu training have to be seen to be believed then there is the music during the prison break the totally out of place love scene the stupid song that plays during the out of place love scene the fake castro the fact that everybody has either a headband and or a on some part of their body the goofiest rape scene ever filmed and the worst acting ever put on film this movie deserves to be more well known among bad movie fans definitely the worst movie ever made
<START> lately i've been watching a lot of westerns from the 1930s to the present there are some great low budget spaghetti westerns from the late 1960s and early 1970s this movie had all the elements of a decent western a good story with talented actors and everything else although it's a spoof of this genre and for me the way it was done just didn't work and made for a disappointing movie br br this movie can easily be divided into two parts br br the first part is great it has a great opening scene and an interesting story develops of a bounty hunter a k a the stranger going after a bandit who is going after a large bank shipment guarded in part by a banker over the course of the movie these three characters form shifting alliances in an attempt to get the money there are subtle comic nods to the contrivances of earlier films from this genre but the comedy doesn't disrupt the overall story br br the second half of the film is where the comedy goes over the top and essentially ruins the movie the turning point is right at the part where the barmaid causally scolds the dwarf to stop shooting the customers as she goes about waiting on other patrons seemingly oblivious to the four dead bodies laying about the place from this point onward the movie shifts from a decent spaghetti western with comic undertones to a stupid silly spoof br br there are three horrible fist fight scenes one at the river one in the market and one at the baths that follow in rapid succession as if one wasn't bad enough the fighting is so fake it's ridiculous and since the sound is out of sync with the picture it makes it even worse in the market fight scene the banker bounces about the place on hidden and twirls around on poles like he is in the circus it's clownish although the worst part of these fight scenes is the music it's this light hearted sprightly mix more suited for a square dance or a cheesy episode of these scenes practically derail the main story br br overall this movie was disappointing because it had a lot of potential as a decent western but the comic turns just mucked it up if you want to see a good western spoof then see if you want to see a good spaghetti western then avoid this movie
<START> a ridiculous movie a terrible editing job worst screenplay ridiculous acting a story that is completely br br if god was going to decide if movies should continue to be done judging by this one the entire world movie industry would now be dead br br a wonderful movie to show that cinema should not be done by people who think they can make movies br br i am still wondering who are those two girls who show up in the movie for over half an hour and are never introduced to us br br
<START> i am sorry to rain on everybody's parade just a little background about me i like and know a lot about asian cinema especially japanese chinese and indian admittedly i am a novice when it comes to south korean cinema but if this is the best of the best sorry i just want you to know that i am not at all narrow minded when it comes to appreciating foreign movies and i do not fit the stereotype of the dumb american well not perfectly br br i cannot believe the high praise this piece of nothing is bestowed upon this is a disgusting and ludicrous movie hammy acting everything is badly done and overdone like begging for the uneducated viewer's attention horrible camera work with an insistence on meaningless close ups derived from the mtv aesthetics br br the plot is more full of holes than a gigantic piece of swiss cheese nobody expects a thriller to be 100 realistic and for the sake of entertainment i'd be happy to close my eyes to small unfitting details but excuse me what's happening here that can stand even summary scrutiny this story of an unbelievably intricate and contrite act of revenge is worse than the worst tabloid story one can read in a line at the supermarket don't want to spoil your enjoyment if that's the word so won't go into details of the plot the fighting scenes are violent unbelievable downright stupid the main hero taking on dozens and dozens of opponents in the same time after he only trained while imprisoned punching a wall the truly outstanding features of this movie are two the lurid and incestuous sex brother on sister and father on daughter well we've evolved since oedipus didn't we and the graphic violence the cut off body parts hands teeth tongues together with industrial quantities of spilled blood how many tens of thousands of tomatoes had to die for this movie to be made have no function motivation whatsoever br br a feast for the s m inclined admittedly but even for those a feast of no merit nor subtlety heavens even mel gibson's recent and much discussed work on an almost similar theme wasn't that bad br br the invariably good press this pretentious overblown overlong piece of gratuitous gore coming from korean shores obtains makes me wonder what's happening i don't think of myself as being the ultimate paragon of taste and often i am ready to accept that a movie i didn't enjoy may be better than i was able to perceive however i have no scruples whatsoever in calling this one as i see it bad bad bad no redeeming qualities my find something better to do with your time
