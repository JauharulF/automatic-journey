<START> words cannot describe how horrible this movie is well maybe they can i'll take a stab at it 1 pitiful hollywood makes more talking animals set in graphics apparently script and storyline aren't needed anymore br br 2 violent kids movie but yet one of the characters is viciously attacked and killed br br 3 blatantly stupid the movie is actually depicting the farm animals as having human abilities in nemo the fish could talk but for the most part they are still fish we only hear the english as a translation in barnyard the animals are actually speaking english that other people can understand br br 4 unintelligent no smart story line or even any smart humor ok the 13 year old dog on crutches was funny br br 5 culturally insensitive the black cow is actually played by a black actress the pink cow is played by a white actress the black cow was playing a stereotypical black person br br 6 ignorant no such thing as a male cow that i'm aware of i believe we call them bulls if we are going to expose our children to drek it might as well have the simplest facts correct br br 7 boring and my 4 year old had us leave after 45 minutes he practically fell asleep br br i'm sure this movie will make millions which is unfortunate because it only proves to hollywood producers that the american public at large is just filled with suckers waiting to pay 8 bucks just to get some peace and quiet from the kids for an hour or two an unfortunate circumstance why should the producers spend real money when the returns will be the same either way
<START> the acrobatics mixed with haunting music make one spectacular show the costumes are vibrant and the performances will just boggle your mind simply amazing
<START> i caught this on local mexican television at 2 00 a m and i decided to give it a chance since it's based on a real life case that deals with the murder of the typical all american family a dad a mom and a young son br br on the beginning the hints point to walker to be the murderer as he had strong differences with his father shortly after when walker and luke are taken to the sheriff's dept to being examined by the lies detection machine things turn out to be very different br br also when walker and luke attend to an appointment with their father's lawyer they learn that luke would receive 200 000 and walker is out of the heresy luke immediately buys a convertible br br anyways this is an excellent mystery movie that deals with betrayal ambition feelings and cold very cold blood br br i know the real names were changed but still the experience is the same give this movie a try i know there are hundreds of based on real murders or events of the like but this one is truly worthy pure quality on acting direction and plot
<START> after learning that her sister susan is contemplating divorce kate decides to travel to the distraught woman's remote country home and spend some time with her when kate arrives however susan is nowhere in sight that's because someone has murdered her and stuffed the body in a trunk in the basement as a storm rages outside kate tries to figure out where her sister could have gone and places her own life in great danger the killer is still on the premises in her first post bewitched vehicle elizabeth montgomery gives a solid dramatic performance gerard's teleplay is based on a short story by tale was first brought to television in 1962 as an episode of boris karloff's thriller anthology series thriller stuck very closely to the story which is kind of a pity for it could have used a little punching up granted wrote a moderately creepy number but gerard creator of the one step beyond show adds several clever ingredients that heighten the tension and suspense
<START> christopher nolan's directorial debut is a memorable one the film was very well received and help land contracts for making and quite rightfully so br br following is an exquisite example of how films should be made no fancy effects or blood dripping gore just brilliant writing and good acting nolan manages to captivate us once again with his writing the actors all unknowns to me and i suppose most people did a good job bringing the characters to live they were all believable and that's all they need to be the film is confusing because it plays with chronology a lot but it's very rewarding in the end the film's a little short to be a full length feature but any additional length would've ruined the style of the movie and the brilliance of the writing would've been diminished though short the film has every aspect that makes a film attractive imo an intriguing beginning an exciting middle and a surprising end br br i dare say following is almost as good as memento his best film by far the scrambled chronology is equally masterful used in both films the amazing plot twists are present and the acting is very good br br this film was made with a mere 6000 but the quality is much higher than most almost all million dollar box office hits the use of b w may be a hard pill to swallow for the big audience following is primarily nolan showing off his skills to the studio bosses and what skills they are rarely have i enjoyed writing so much as in even pi doesn't even come close imo though it's also very good br br this is a film surely not to be missed by any self respecting movie lover if you liked memento is definitely for you
<START> aah yes the workout show was a great not only did many women get in shape but many teenage boys got a great workout as well i am not saying that the show was in any way not appropriate for family viewing but if you check the other works from the shows producer you will find more adult themes in his works which are also excellent many of the viewers looked forward to the show men and women alike all gained good information and a wonderful release from the workouts the girls were perfect and beautiful the show is a classic and should do well in syndication the show should still be on as there are never enough choices to view when it comes to health and beauty
<START> there are other movies about boarding schools and the antics of the students and staff but the belles of st towers above them all the plot has been thoroughly summarized by other posters so i won't cover the same ground i just want to say that it's a shame that it's finally out on dvd but in a format that can't be used in the u s br br enjoy fellow fans in new zealand and australia and if anyone reading this has any pull in such matters please help get it released on dvd with region 1 also is it possible to be notified via e mail when i won't say if it is released on dvd in the united states thanks
<START> one of my favorite movies of all time beautifully done well written and well acted it portrayed 20 something blacks in a way i don't think has yet been duplicated and the dialog hmmmm so stimulating makes me want to find love like that
<START> rarely have i seen an action suspense movie that was so boring none of the action scenes are exciting the story line is nothing special and except for a couple of actors the acting is bad charlie sheen platoon major league stars as the white house chief of staff who gets himself in the middle of a conspiracy that wants him and more people dead donald sutherland a time to kill fallen plays a friend who he tells everything he can and linda hamilton linda hamilton terminator dante's peak plays a reporter who gets involved in the situation charlie sheen is ok as the star donald sutherland is a good actor who gives a good performance linda hamilton gives a poor performance with a bad movie i can actually like it if it has a good ending but this movie has a very cheesy ending with some almost laughable stuff
<START> this is the second adaptation of charlotte armstrong by claude chabrol for the screen the first was la rupture 1970 from novel the balloon man and it's really a pity no one cares about it it's chabrol's sleeper and i urge any of his fans to see it br br the chocolate cobweb was not that strong a detective story to begin with i read it 20 years ago and forgot all about it the movie promises some good things at first though then finally disappoints to a fault this is a confusing chabrol movie mixing elements of the heyday circa 1969 and a lotta tongue in chick stuff coming from the eighties the likes of au not one particularly memorable work br br part of the disappointment comes from the cast this is a distressingly poor gathering jacques plays like a zombie isabelle huppert reveals herself a somewhat limited actress finally rather vulgar it worked in une affaire de femme it does not here they are not supported by the young couple both are bland and unremarkable actors from the past say stephane or michel bouquet both in la rupture were brilliant and contributed to chabrol's then unique atmosphere br br the story itself is undistinguished beginning as some kind of serious la vie est un long besides a character hints at etienne very funny movie the movie drags on and on as a laughable psychological drama afterwards we will not congratulate the young female pianist who after all she learned about her wicked hostess agrees to drive a car along a dangerous road br br because he makes too many movies chabrol frequently releases turkeys one wonder why people who wants to watch one of his movies should choose this one among all his stuff up for grabs br br it seems that chabrol's bourgeoise satire has finally given way to leniency in la rupture the first armstrong adaptation an average detective story which chabrol completely transcended you should hear say they have so much money here chabrol has lost his bite his strength
<START> i remember seeing this movie for the first time with a friend while on vacation in anaheim california in october 1976 while driving the tourist laden city streets we saw a movie marquee advertising alice in wonderland xxx so before even checking out version of the lewis carroll classic a half mile away our curiosity won out and we ventured into this cinematic threshold i remember even before the movie began how surprised i was to see this kind of film appearing in staid ultra conservative orange county br br thirty two years later i came across alice in wonderland at a local video store i wondered to myself if this was the same film until i looked at the back of the jacket and saw a picture of lovely kristine debell in the starring role and decided to rekindle some fond memories subversive video to their credit has released two versions x and xxx in the same package as it turns out the version my friend and i saw in anaheim was rated x in spite of the original xxx advertising at the there seeing it the second time around makes me realize what a delightful romp director bud townsend brought to the screen as an example of this man's scope behind the camera in his salad days he directed two episodes of tv's death valley days br br miss debell appearing in the april 1976 cover of playboy is ideal as alice she brings a fresh all american innocence to the role as a librarian in her early twenties yearning for a better life when her boyfriend is rebuffed from taking their relationship to the next level alice reaches her turning point this is a comedy' yet the melodies are quite catchy with appropriate strings and brass to offset the generally suggestive lyrics miss debell has a pleasant singing voice as she about wanting to be free that's when the magic begins the pacing of this movie is surprisingly fluid given the genre and the supporting cast of wonderland are there to enable alice as she blossoms into womanhood special mention goes to tv veteran larry as the white rabbit who seems to be the only character not obsessed with sex as he is always running late for an or something br br special features include comments from noted feminist advocate lena ramone who imparts how viewing this movie while attending college influenced her in choosing a career as an adult film actress after graduation br br what makes alice in wonderland such a delightful is its garden like setting partly filmed in the lush natural splendor of vancouver b c 's stanley park the movie belies its pornographic roots you don't come away feeling you've watched a sleazy skin flick at this writing i haven't viewed the triple xxx version the extra sex footage tacked on afterward would in all probability disrupt the overall flow and remove the light breezy atmosphere evident throughout br br naturally the lewis carroll version is the best way to curl up and explore alice's adventures in wonderland however for a time capsule representing 1970s' adult film archives alice in wonderland is worth following that white rabbit for a ribald ride full of mayhem

<START> i usually like movies about animals or reptiles turning against the mean old humans who threaten their environment but i have to say snake island was a major letdown br br the premise is interesting a group of people including a writer numbly played by william katt goes to an island called duh you guessed it snake island and what the island lives up to it's name that is one thing i will give this movie there are snakes lots and lots of snakes of all sizes and kinds so that part of the movie in fairness lives up to its name but the writing acting and directing is soooooooo lame it is almost painful to sit through br br the characters are so unlikeable i was begging for the snakes to finish these horrible people off to put us all out of our misery there are a couple of scenes that are so surreal and ridiculous they have be seen to be believed snakes gyrating to really horrible disco music while 2 women dance together and a scene with a snake holding some inane dialogue with one of the actors it's beyond absurd i think the writer was trying to be funny but this just came off like some weird lsd trip br br i remember william katt years ago back when he starred in carrie what a hunk he was not that he was ever a major star but to be reduced to this garbage i feel for him br br avoid this movie like the plague unless you are really into movies that feature lots and lots of snakes and really horrible humans
<START> i am a big fan of this film and found the tv mini series children of the dust the version fans should look for at least 20 minutes or more are cut on the dvd version of this film br br i would also suggest viewers who enjoyed this film to check out the book there is a more rounded storyline with corby and rachel more on black history and buffalo solders there were two many storylines for the series or this film br br sidney poitier only shows he gets better with age the talent just keeps growing the chemistry between his character of gypsy smith and regina taylor were wonderful viewing i also enjoyed the billy wirth joanna going storyline they seems to play off each other well br br billy wirth is of course the model of indian vision the look the attitude the dream of every woman who was wanted to be carried off in one of those romance novels by a native hero worked for me also br br much more could have been done with this storyline but it did give the viewer a brief glimpse of racial problems back in the 1880's white take over of native schooling lack of black pioneers to setup towns in the west michael moriarty maxwell as always a great actor comes across as a very caring and confused teacher not sure if the whites should be interfering with native culture br br for anyone who enjoys characters and watching them change this film is for you i thought the chemistry between poitier's character and that of the orphan very moving and thought wirth and poitier worked very well together billy wirth did some of his best scenes when working with poitier br br going got on my nerves sometimes when you want to just stop and shake her or give her a wake up and grown up call but on the whole it was a great evening of entertainment br br look for the two tape version of this mini series if you are a fan you will really see the difference
<START> but it is also and pete's too yes the grumpy captain may not look like pete but it is mickey and minnie are the best characters both of them are very sweet and likable interestingly minnie is more of a lady in this than what she usually is today and mickey is less than considerate in this than he is now pete is still the same old meanie but he looks a bit different br br in this famous episode on board a little steamboat mickey minnie and some side characters have a great deal of fun and a great deal of annoyances even in their first appearances the three main characters are very developed br br i quite like this episode although overall i prefer the mickey mouse in the future i like the animation the steamboat and music theme the clever gags and of course mickey and minnie br br like many early cartoons this is very random walt came up with a very basic plot and just added gags to gear it along there is also a parrot side character who is very annoying and rather unnecessary these are the things i do not like about it br br another interesting thing about this episode that a colour version has not been made for it or if it has i've never heard about it br br anyone who just enjoys mickey mouse and disney will enjoy this
