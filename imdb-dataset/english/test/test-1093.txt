<START> this movie reminds me of 'eternal sunshine of the spotless mind' and state' not because of content but because it is one of those movies that you don't hear about except through word of mouth or you read the back of the dvd at the video store and think why not needless to say i was pleasantly surprised like the aforementioned films at how good it was and how much i enjoyed it br br best seen with little knowledge of the movie and with only intrigue guiding you to actually watch it also best seen with someone else or if you know someone else that has seen it you will want to talk about it it's a beautiful film that stays with you well after you watch it it's also an intelligent watch that requires little effort into figuring out parts for yourself br br just enjoy
<START> we get to see who the good guys are the union and who the bad guys are a rich man who steals elections and his spoiled son the filmmaker forces us to see good from evil all the characters hate the bad guys so that when watching the film this can help us along on hating the bad guys this is the worst kind of film making manipulative and childish the plot centers on a cop who is in between the good and the bad and he's stuck in this ugly film it's boring and pointless the narration by star keach is really bad and a good actor don stroud overacted to the hilt playing the guy no one likes and who we aren't supposed to like it takes a long time for this bore to take off and for the title to assert itself then when it does take off it crashes a minute later boring one of the worst films ever made
<START> this was amongst the worst films i have ever encountered the cinematography was dull with long tedious shots like a camera on a tripod filming a stage play interspersed with dramatic angles that made little sense to the content on screen the editing was terrible scenes matched together with the delicacy of a butcher the plot hinged on the viewer being familiar with the historical night in which mary shelley wrote frankenstien the acting was forced with the type of character development that left you with an intense interest in seeing each of them die horribly the sooner the better
<START> an airplane transporting some scientists and a prototype of a dna machine a powerful and revolutionary invent fall in a jungle in pacific the insurance company sponsors a rescue expedition commanded by harlan knowles lance henriksen the owner of a huge corporation which owns the prototype and father of one of the scientist there the group finds the rests of the plane five miles far from the expected location and the machine and the remains of the persons further they realize that a sasquatch a kind of big foot is chasing them this movie is so ridiculous that i do not know what i am doing spending my time again in this garbage the direction is awful the actors and the lines are horrible copying parts of the and even the blair witch project' to summarize how bad this movie is its best scene is when marla lawson the character of andrea roth is wounded and the guide of the expedition says that she needs to have an injection of tetanus vaccine andrea undresses her jeans and the guide says 'nice butts but the shot needs to be in your ridiculous my vote is two br br title brazil sasquatch o sasquatch the br br
<START> legendary pop star steve don't let the sun catch you crying stars as an unlikable stock car racer whose career has hit the skids ha ha because he constantly crashes his car or as he laments i'm tired of being run down by every grease monkey that gets behind the wheel he falls into a bad crowd of humorously inept nazi bikers improbably named banjo fats and er linda fats is the most likable of the bunch he took a surfboard to the back of the skull and now only communicates through grunts sort of a harley davidson leatherface br br anyway steve is fooled by the cops into catching the dastardly crooks in the middle of one of their bank robberies the gang only robs banks for kicks man i guess they give the money to charity steve fails constantly the bikers get and the whole thing never comes off as daring because it's so dull this movie looks like it was filmed through a grease soaked paper towel not since has a movie so trampled my soul br br the guy who played fats went on to direct deranged the ed gein biopic starring robert blossom br br anyway in summary wild rebels hilarious on mst3k dreadful everywhere else
<START> the novel weapon which serves as the basis for this atrocious piece of garbage is one of the best techno thrillers to come down the pike in a long time the character of solo who is not supposed to look like a human is a wonderful creation and it was simply awful to see him reduced to just another terminator clone with mario van peebles horrendously trying to act like a robot there is nothing worthwhile about this film br br why does hollywood insist on snapping up the rights to excellent novels and then butchering them there are so many things wrong with solo that listing them seems as unfair as inviting a man with no legs to a brisk game of avoid this awful film and seek out the 2 novels by robert mason that feature the awesome character of solo the books are weapon and an excellent sequel solo but don't pay any attention to this awful dreck of a film
<START> trying to catch a serial killer did they ever think of tracking the license plate number of the black van or fingerprint the video tapes he sent oh brother the plot of this movie was so full of holes it was pathetic now i know why there are bad movies in the world this one however was one of the worst
<START> this film has not been seen by me in quite a few years it came on the disney channel in the wee hours of the morning i stayed up to watch it and found it even more entertaining than the first time the story the scenery and the characters are as good as they come i know that if anyone takes the time to view this film they will find it definitely worth seeing a second time it's very memorable in more ways than one i would recommend this film to anyone because it is both entertaining and educational for all concerned br br s
<START> this is a little seen anti war film that has been ignored for too long the time is thanksgiving of 1972 the place is a typical suburban home somewhere in texas the oldest son has just comeback from vietnam and he is having a hell of time readjusting to the life he had left behind and the family does not know how to handle the problem i honestly don't think i'm exaggerating when i say this is one the most heart wrenching war films i've seen the funny thing is that there are only a handful of combat sequences in the entire movie most of the story takes place inside a house over a period of a couple of days but the kind of war that takes place in this home is as intense as any real battlefield action the film does something that is difficult to accomplish somehow estevez and his team have created a film that embodies the entire vietnam experience and considering the similarities between vietnam and the current invasion of iraq the film is surprisingly relevant estevez does a magnificent job with material he gets a lot of help from a hand picked cast martin sheen and kathy bates in particular are superb as the parents a truly moving film highly recommended
<START> a friend of mine who has a mysterious knack for finding and horrors liking bad movies recommended i watch 'the pest ' at the time unaware of just how truly pathetic his taste in movies was i decided to give it a try br br bad mistake br br the story although clearly ripped straight out of any sixth grade english textbook as far as the manhunter theme goes would be amusing under the right conditions good actors writer director wardrobe and so on and so on to almost no end clearly these factors are absent br br 'the is supposed to be funny i think i say think because i let crack nothing more than a slight smile throughout the whole film not a guffaw not a laugh not a chuckle not even a grin a smile at best and that happened so rarely while watching this film i even remember how often i did smile maybe 3 or 4 times at best br br so do yourself an immense favor never watch this movie avoid at all costs
<START> this movie is very modern and forward it is about 75 in english it is aimed at english speaking multiplex going young audience basic plot is similar to ddlj acting is below average br br unfortunately they are portraying a wrong picture and setting a bad example for the youngsters is shown drinking from a bottle or taking shots of tequila about 5 6 times in the movie the director does not even acknowledge she is an alcoholic and has a drinking problem all through the movie she only wears bikini tops whether she is at work at a beach or at a wedding the heroine of the movie doing this makes the youngsters feel this behaviour is acceptable br br the less that is said about failure of chopra doing shahrukh khan's ddlj role of arrogant girl chaser the better the movie is about equality of sexes but equality should not be about making the same mistakes instead about doing the right to do the right thing if men have been shown as chronic casanovas in movies does not mean women should also portray same behaviour br br even though the movie is made in light hearted fun spirit it promotes so many wrong social notions in the name of being forward that fun part of the movie makes no impact not even in canada women dress like this or guys behave like they have shown in the movie it is certainly not a reflection of indian society or even canadian society perhaps they should have a disclaimer at the beginning stating all characters and events in the movie are imaginary and do not reflect the actual culture of the cities and countries mentioned in the film the only good thing about this movie is the length 1 5 hrs thank god
<START> i share the same opinion regarding underworld as the previous comment br br i sat through the 1 5 hours of this movie wondering what this story was all about and more importantly why the author and or director had made certain decisions for the plot on the whole i found the movie to be unbalanced consisting of strange sub plots which imho actually had nothing to do with the movie furthermore when writing a thriller i'd say you want your viewers to wonder about the story and not about the way the story is filmed
<START> don't change your husband is on the one hand the beginning of a series of lightweight marital comedies from cecil b demille on the other it is his first picture to star gloria swanson probably the greatest actress of the silent era and is the film which made her a star br br although the old demille formula was beginning to change and his films were becoming and less purely visual with such an expressive performer as swanson we regain much of that silent storytelling style her character does very little but conveys volumes through subtle gesture and facial expression Â with a particular talent for looks of disdain in real life swanson was herself coming towards the end of her disastrous marriage to wallace beery and it's possible that this fact fuelled her convincing performance br br as if to best complement his leading lady's talents demille's use of framing and close ups is particularly strong here he uses cinematic technique to show off the acting Â often holding swanson in lengthy close ups at key moments Â and also to clarify the story visually for example when we are introduced to the character of she is shown reflected three times in a dressing table mirror her character disappears from the story only to become important towards the end that attention grabbing first shot of her helps us remember who she was later at the anniversary dinner swanson and future husband number two lew cody are framed together in one shot while elliot dexter is isolated in his own frame also Â and this is a sign of the increasing sophistication of cinema in general Â there is much use of reaction shots Â for example the disapproving glance of the bishop when cody acts out his intentions with the wedding figure dolls br br in contrast to demille's visual narrative method was the increasingly verbose screen writing of his collaborator jeanie macpherson as i've remarked in several other comments macpherson could put together a strong and dramatic story but like demille she tended to state her themes in a somewhat pretentious and flamboyant style and so we get these very long quasi philosophical title cards about the pitfalls of married life which if they improve the story at all it is only because they are unintentionally funny for example only jeanie macpherson could come up with a line like fate sometimes lurks in christmas shopping fortunately though in this picture these titles mostly introduce scenes rather than break them up br br although the pictures he made around this time tended to be small scale it is at this point that demille seemed to develop his taste for the spectacular you can see him start to sneak in excuses for a bit of razzmatazz like the little fantasy scenes of swanson being showered with pleasure wealth and love it wouldn't be until the early twenties after the unofficial on historical pictures was lifted that he would get the chance to go all out with the grand spectacle br br all in all don't change your husband is a fairly decent demille silent picture although to be honest it is only really the presence gloria swanson that lifts it above the average it's curious though that this is supposedly a comedy and swanson was cast at least in part because of her background at mack sennett's slapstick factory she hated comedy acting and here gives a dramatic rather than a comic performance it makes sense then that the only straight drama she did with demille male and female was by far the strongest of their collaborations
<START> okay it is terribly and i mean terribly easy to pick apart this film what do you expect with the title synopsis and actors in leads such as carol gilley ralph baker jr dorothy davis bill thurman and my personal favourite roger ready yes b star john agar is here as a sheriff out to rid the texan landscape of a robot like ape from a nasa experiment gone awry the movie has dreadful performances dreadful scenery dreadful special effects and dreadful lighting i really cannot find much good to say about it other than as bad films go you could do a lot worse as far as finding something dreadful to sit through it is short and has many moments of unintended humor missed cues lighting faux pas off screen terror an unbelievably inane score and of course john agar trying his level best to be the core of the film with an earnest performance amidst this muck the beginning is the hardest part to sit through as it seems like it takes forever for these two teens to get their comeuppance for traveling in the woods down the texas back roads where great ape soon will reek his vengeance in his own terrible way yeah right night fright bah
<START> sadly a great opportunity to utilise a superb cast to bring king lear up to date however instead we got a contrived family drama that appeared to dip into lear when the writer had run out of ideas the cast worked hard but it just didn't gel recently stephen showed how to adapt and update the classics with his screenplay for the magnificent tv movie king of texas
