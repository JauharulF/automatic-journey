<START> this movie is on the level with welcome home roxy carmichael for biggest pieces of garbage that have ever hit the silver screen if these guys weren't adam sandler's gay friends this script would have ended up where it should have as some big time movie toilet paper i hate this movie it makes me want to injure people i will admit that i have high standards but honestly i'd rather watch step up 2 the ultra sad part was when i logged onto imdb and read that you pieces of trash actually gave this movie a 6 9 rating this is a testament to all of the retards in our society that will go watch terrible movies that are just hour and a half long dick fart and weed jokes with little to no originality after seeing this rating i would like to suggest tyler perry's house of pain to all of you guys who enjoyed this film you'll see some high quality humor there on about the same level of this abhorrent abomination
<START> ordinary decent criminal is sad because it is obviously trying to succeed and equally obviously hasn't a chance in hell of making it apparently owing to the absence of a clear sense of purpose a abysmal failure at droll irish comedy with spacey as a thief who enjoys the cops and his competition becoming a sort of folk hero in his own mind this flick manages to be mildly amusing when it's trying to be funny slightly more than boring when it's trying to be interesting and forget sentimental or poignant or endearing though it takes shots at those qualities as well ordinary decent criminal has a clumsy screenplay naive direction journeyman execution thin story poor casting mediocre acting and eventually becomes lost in itself and sinks into a mire of hopeless mediocrity pass on this one d
<START> when underdog the cartoon debuted in 1964 at the age of 7 i was hooked immediately he was top dog pun intended in my book that is until batman premiered on abc a year or so later even when it was clear that disney was going to make a live action version of the once popular saturday morning cartoon it was equally clear to me that it was going to be a piece of crap even reading the reviews in the papers seemed to confirm this however i made it a point to a never attempt to write a review unless i have seen the movie from start to finish and b never to spend one red cent on a movie that i'm almost certain i will hate br br thanks to youtube i a am fully qualified to write this review and b it only cost me 84 minutes of my hard earned time br br it also proves my point namely that this movie is not merely a piece of crap it's a steaming pile of dog droppings it resembles the tv series in name only even though they almost got it right with simon and cad br br all in all underdog is a huge waste of time and money which thankfully i didn't have to spend br br rating 1 2 out of
<START> the only reason i rented the movie was to see jeri ryan in it omg that was the most boring pointless movie i've ever seen how lame i mean really give me a break after voyager i'd hope she'd be offered better roles br br if i were one of the last people on earth i would not still be living in a travel trailer in the dessert this is just such a bad movie the thing about the indian tribe and how he compared it every 10 seconds really really got old poor jeri better luck next time
<START> i actually went to see this movie with low expectations since it was the only one that fit my schedule and amazingly i found it really original i have commented on other colombian films before and i agree that colombian movies tend to have a similar scheme and always try to make reference to the average vulgar people especially trying to make jokes out of the continuous cursing but let's face it the language used in this film is not especially exaggerated unfortunately this is how real people speak the storyline and the pacing are brilliant and it could be to any country in the world the acting was great and the script is to me one of the best ones ever produced in colombian soil i think that anyone around the globe can get a good one hour and a half of entertainment with a beautifully well directed bluffing black humor comedy it kind of reminded me of films like snatch and others of the sort i highly recommend it and hope it can be viewed by more people since colombian movies seem to have started to be more internationally focused since last year
<START> this is a low grade cold war propaganda film crossed with a it may have some long term significance as a snapshot of 1950s us thinking but there is little else to commend in the mawkish storyline wooden acting and grating style there are some interesting photos of long gone aircraft but that was not enough for even this aircraft enthusiast to leave it on the screen for the full length
<START> a complete and utter waster of my precious two hours the entire movie could have been made in less than 60 seconds by simply showing people getting coked up a car crashing people getting more coked up people having sex people crying and people getting more coked up the tagline for this movie should have read come see how f up our characters are they're stoned they're coke addicts they're a mess who are these people do you really care does it matter just give us your money please because we sure don't care about anything else an absolutely terrible movie it never went anywhere you never got to know the characters they never even said what these people did to earn such a big house and so much money and cars and coke and it was just downright boring you might like the movie a little more if you're a stoner yourself but for the vast majority of us that aren't this movie is a waste of film and of time
<START> seriously i don't understand how justin long is becoming increasingly popular he either has the best agent in hollywood or recently sold his soul to satan he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing the only film that he has attempted to anchor that i've remotely enjoyed was waiting and that is almost solely because i've worked in a restaurant but i digress aside from it's terrible lead this film has loads of other i understand that it's supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesn't mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive lewis black's considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained which the pg 13 rating certainly won't allow the film's sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim his one liners were funny on occasion but were certainly not enough to make this anywhere close to bearable if you just want to completely turn your brain off or better yet don't have one then maybe you'd enjoy this but i can't recommend it at all
<START> a tedious mixture of puerile efforts at humour with romantic relationship melodrama fails to provide this weakly made film with any flavour of reality as action opens reno a j buckley enters his apartment there discovering his girlfriend in flagrante delicto with his roommate who gloatingly tells reno well at least it's with someone you know resulting in reno's decision to never have another roommate this decision told to viewers by means of a soon abandoned voice over the storyline then proceeds ten months where we find that reno is indeed true to his word concerning avoidance of roommates although this appears to beg the question due to his garnering of a live in lover holly holly fields with whom he has generated marital plans the plot briefly shifts to a sleazy hollywood strip club wherein reno's uncle charley enamoured of a dancer whom he finds eminently desirable keels over dead atop the club's bar after seeing the unadorned charms displayed by the object of his affections it is apparent that charley had been aware of the flawed condition of his heart because he created a video tape during which his commentary bequeaths his large and residence in hollywood to reno and we see the latter deciding to contrary to his vow interview applicants for two roommates as tenants with he and holly sharing the selection process in an organized manner following an inane sequence involving bizarre renter candidates all of whom reno and holly unsurprisingly find unsuitable for living along with them in their house they unknown to each other each select a renter of the opposite sex with the lovers manifestly cool toward the choice of their partner the newcomers chad and nicole would seem to have little discernible point to their existence other than highly aural fornication with a broad range of partners and it is not long before jealousy mars the harmonic relationship of reno and holly reno is bent upon and merchandising a type of sporting travel bag and as he has given an engagement ring to holly the potential success of this entrepreneurial adventure is of great financial significance if he intends to advance his marital plan unfortunately the rapacious team of chad and nicole whose every action is ostensibly laced with lust is likely to disrupt any future wedding intentions of reno direction is slack plainly far from fulfilling basic needs of the players although an erratically composed script provides scant material with which actors may work and ad libbing falls embarrassingly flat as a result the performances are undistinguished not aided by spotty editing while the manner of camera work changes as abruptly and often as a tail light filmed with a low budget and on location only a modicum of skill is required for the designing processes but a larger measure of value might have been placed upon the tasteless d j background soundtrack generally blaring and nearly always invasive a good deal of discussion has been stimulated by the movie's final sequences that are apparently not expected by a viewer based upon what has come before but in reality these comprise probably the only thoughtful portions of a poorly cobbled screenplay and bids fair to make the work almost watchable despite the shabby quality of the production as a whole
<START> officially the first martial arts movie in ussr cinematography featuring actual martial artists like and russian bruce lee bad people a ship in the high seas but fortunately just about everybody on board is a trained martial artist a collectible for martial arts aficionado
<START> if this is film noir then noir must be french for glacially slow take a cast of completely unlikeable characters give them nothing to say punctuate the whole thing with gratuitous ultra violence and you've got the formula for an aggravated dash could be subtitled sleazy hollywood types attempt to make money from chinatown rip off bruce dern's one minute part is orders of magnitude better than anything else in this flick by the way i didn't like the film
<START> okay i marked this spoiler so don't be upset when i wrap this up now i went into the movie expecting to see a very predictable movie and i was right as almost every horror flick i have ever seen it was predictable but not as bad as most what helped was the story i did not expect there to be a why to kane's madness but there was and while somewhat foggy you still got the idea and understand the madness now of course if you like something that will scare you for nights to come this is not the movie your looking for but if your a fan of saw or some other movies that claim their fame thanks to sadistic content this is a movie to watch now where i really throw in a spoiler for a second warning i give this movie a 9 perhaps because i'm a fan of the wwe and a fan of kane but who doesn't like a movie a little bit better when it stars somebody we love however this movie could have scored a 10 for me if spoiler at the end of the movie when it showed kane dead on the pavement while a dog pissing in his eye was cute it could have been classic with the kane undertaker quick sit up and turn of the head a perfect 10 would have been awarded if that would have happened it was a perfect opportunity but either the wwe didn't think of that or a future sequel will begin with that very sequence i mentioned that's all 9
<START> the producers of this film should be sued for the misrepresentation of copyrighted materials namely the advanced dungeons dragons players' handbook fear and ignorance breed the sort of mindless propaganda that inspire garbage like this film if any of you have any doubts about the innocence of dungeons dragons why don't you go to your local hobby store and see about sitting in with a gaming group so you can see for yourself that d d is nothing to be afraid of
<START> one of the dumbest movies in the history of cinema wait i take that back this movie can't be included in any category related to cinema it belongs in categories like waste turds or similar categories ironically it's even about two garbagemen the movie is men at work a lightweight crime comedy starring the estevez sheen brothers from 1990 setting aside the asinine and implausible plot line bad acting bad dialogue poorly executed stunts and slapstick continuity errors and high rate of no name actors never to be seen again all in all it was a pretty bad movie anyway at its core i mean it was the kind of movie that might be good for one thing you can watch it about 200 times learn every line and in a campy kind of way repeat them back and forth in public with your wasted friends thus securing your status as the biggest dorks in your tenth grade class br br to make matters worse i actually submitted an imdb trivia entry along with this bad review to the movie's imdb web page if only because i spotted a silly little punk music joke that apparently nobody else spotted yet about the surfer statue i'm so conflicted about why i should even waste my time submitting what looks like a supportive trivia note when what i really want to do is blow up acting career no wait he's already done that himself thanks dude i'm so glad i wasted only time on this not real money for that matter can i maybe have at least one tenth of their budget anyone other than this director emilio could have made two or three much better movies with just what they spent blowing up cars carefully placing bikini clad bimbos in the background and beating up useless extras henchmen in mat suits i'd mention writing credit but it would be a stretch to call this screenplay writing it's more like crayon scrawled cartoon ideas and charlie sheen if you're reading this i assume m a w must have been made during the part of your career in which you were a coked up hooker loving hollywood brat who had not grown up yet oops sorry i guess that part of your life isn't over yet get well soon you half a man such a promising talent so wasted Â oh look there's that word again
<START> this movie is without a doubt the best i have seen in my entire life the stellar star cast is only an added bonus over the amazing special effects and profound story and sublime choreography the movie is about an ancient love affair that folds down into the modern world two lovers in heaven the wrath of a great sage and are cursed subsequently the woman is born again on earth while she is in college she is raped and commits suicide the rest of the movie basically focuses on the hunting down of the people who were associated with the rape by her lover who possesses superhuman strength and the mastery of several languages delivers a very mature and deep performance in this film and all the other actors do almost as well te action scenes with akshay kumar are mind blowing and must not be missed you simply have to watch this movie
