<START> i really liked this movie it totally reminds me of my high school days the soundtrack is awesome i am a huge nic cage fan and this is my favorite movie that he is in i love the storyline it is a total love story against the odds kind of thing i think anyone who graduated in the early eighties 1980 1984 should see the movie it totally brought back memories of high school for me
<START> i want to start my review by thanking the makers of this documentary it is obviously a labor of love and i think they did a pretty good job of putting together an enjoyable documentary about a person who has had so such little info available about him it definitely has a fan worship feel about it which is a good thing br br i had heard of bruce haack but didn't know much about him and i found the start of this documentary frustrating because i could hear other musicians talk about him but bruce haack himself was kept way too far off in the distance i wanted to see this bruce haack guy i felt as though the makers assumed i already knew him as well as these musicians on the screen which i didn't so i felt a bit left in the dark br br when bruce was finally shown in action it was great and gave me a taste of who bruce haack was but it was only a taste we got treated to more musicians and i felt as though i was being told look all these cool musicians are into him so he must be cool i didn't really care much for the musician's commentary on bruce br br i wanted to see bruce as a person you know the important stuff more interviews with people who worked with him or knew him more about his life and yes his use of drugs and other issues i would of liked to know so much more about his project i wanted to get inside his mind even if they did this via some voice of god commentary and photos it would of been ok br br the animations were good but again i felt these were used as filler they didn't really do anything other than allow me to hear his music and see some imagery based on the dimension 5 records i did think it was clever and creative but again i wanted to learn more about bruce br br maybe bruce haack was this elusive in real life br br anyway in the end i enjoyed this documentary and felt a sort of sadness that such amazing pioneers and geniuses such as mr haack get forgotten as the march of time stamps ever onwards i am glad that this film is around to educate people about bruce haack even with its flaws
<START> sometimes when a film is panned by the critics one just has to see it to see if it is really as bad as the claim well in this case it was i believe it was meant to be a sex comedy but it was neither sexy nor funny i think i chuckled once when johnny vegas failed to vault a roadside fence and that was it br br the film follows the lives of four men who deliver potatoes for a living each of them has a problem with their sex lives dave has left his wife and seeks out an old flame who once invited him for a threesome a few years before ferris is living with his mother in law who treats him as a sex object has an obsession for involving strawberry jam in his encounters and jeremy claims to be in a loving relationship but is in fact stalking some poor woman br br the tone of the jokes varies from tasteless to i don't believe that anybody could write that an example of the the latter being when they tell a small child his father has died in a car crash then for the punch line when the boy asks how his mum is they tell him she is in a coma the blame for this all lands squarely at the feet of the writers the actors obviously made a poor choice agreeing to be in this film but i didn't think their acting was all that bad not that it was all that good either surprisingly for a fairly sleazy film about sex there is no nudity and the sex is never erotic br br i certainly wouldn't recommend seeing this for any reason other than morbid curiosity although judging from other reviews this seems to be a love it or loathe it film i suspect it would be better watched after a few beers and with your mates
<START> serendipity i thought i was off to a bad start bringing home the wrong dvd in the case of the intruder rental staff so i did not want to see this film but i am glad i did in all my chosen movie would not have been as superb a slice film as this delectable and delicate taste of what in both us and europe can do together seven years apart two heroine sisters embark on fantastic journeys through early 1970's post student demo europe sumptuously shot in the portugal and in berlin paris and amsterdam reminiscent of the feel of the exterior shots in paul verhoeven's early masterpiece the fourth man it's touchingly acted by brewster diaz and especially christopher ecclestone the story unveils itself along an abstracted plot capturing the ephemeral emotions of these characters as they confront their relationships and see idealised images of each other and themselves shattered a movie with great refinement and taste not for arnie commando fans which is probably why the reviewer upstairs is so wide of the mark in 'his' claims that this is a girly film daft criteria wrong too well worth experimenting with
<START> i saw this movie when it first came out in 1973 and loved it since then i've searched for a video but never found it until now 33 years later when i ordered it from sorry to say it doesn't hold up this version just can't rise up to the 1937 production level i love burt musical score that is if to by itself and i even bought a cd of it but for my taste it doesn't lend itself well to this mysterious and compelling story just doesn't fit michael york is lost here sally kellerman tosses off a fine performance but olivia hussy is just ridiculous and not worth lugging through the himalayas the best performance is charles boyer as the head lama
<START> this is one of those inoffensive and mildly entertaining little movies that strive to make you to like them more but like so many others it's material isn't strong enough to successfully fill a couple of hours br br the pitch is promising three drag queens drive a bus through the outback from sydney to alice springs they run into lots of trouble with homophobic locals with the engine with their pasts br br the real trouble is with the dialogue the leads are fine though continual becomes tiresome but the one liners and epithets feel forced where they should be casually thrown away characters shouldn't laugh at their own gags br br writer director elliott also feels the need to pile on the pleasingly incongruous shots of flamboyant drag costumes against stark desert backgrounds like so much cheap make up for a movie about self confidence and just being yourself it all seems very insecure with itself
<START> this movie takes the voice of terror and makes it better holmes is protecting an inventor in switzerland and is on the trail of professor moriarity who has become a nazi this is a better version of holmes in a wwii world rathbone does a great job with holmes as a spy and a detective see this if you liked the voice of terror
<START> mr bug goes to town was the last major achievement the fleischer studios produced the quality of the superman series produced at the same time is evident in this extraordinary film br br the music and lyrics by frank loesser and carmichael with assistance by veteran sammy are quite good but not as much as the scoring of the picture by leigh harline who also scored snow white for disney atmospheric music is superb and a treat for the ears br br the layout and staging of the picture was years ahead of it's time and once again the fleischer's background artists outdid themselves the beauty of the film cannot be denied and while the grasshopper is the star the characters of swat the fly and smack the mosquito steal the picture voicing by jack mercer of popeye fame is priceless kenny gardner brother in law of guy lombardo and a featured vocalist in his band does his usual pleasant job in the role of dick br br the movie has been criticized for all the wrong reasons the fleischer studios were animation experts par excellence and this shows very clearly in the finished product the movie is tuneful the story great for all ages and the final scenes of the bugs scrambling for their lives upon a rising skyscraper is some of the best staging and animation of any animated film past and present br br do not miss this wonderfully hand drawn film also don't fail to appreciate the title sequence with the most elaborate example of max fleischer's remarkable 3 d process which took four months to construct and employed 16 000 tiny panes of glass in the electrified buildings of manhattan br br do not miss mr bug goes to town aka goes to town i'll wager you'll be bug eyed at the results
<START> it was praised to be a fast paced screwball comedy and the best german movie of the year so i gave it a try even though i've already seen some films by dani levy or at least parts of them br br i got what i had expected no comedy at all unless you think that heart attacks are funny it's a fine example of sloppy screen writing with an implausible plot and characters loaded with clichÃ©s that might be true but surely are not funny either br br the most annoying character is that of wife played by she has to behave incredibly strange to keep the plot moving for example she doesn't know a single thing about judaism but by reasons most likely unknown to even herself she gets the idea to play the charade that she and her family are jewish laws obeying jews for her husband's family who really are and of the very orthodox and self righteous variety to make it a bit more complicated she invites the four of them to stay at her city flat because they arrive from frankfurt in berlin without having booked their hotels in advance something no 60 years old business man actually no grown up german would ever do this gives the viewer a lot to swallow but still fails to produce any jokes br br zucker and his brother samuel haven't seen each other for forty years but it turns out that his daughter now a lesbian and son now a militant orthodox were once lovers and he's her daughter's father daughter a nympho goes after gay son is this supposed to be a somehow humorous parody of jewish incestuous tendencies probably it's just a thoughtless way to add some love action turbulence every screwball comedy needs and of course is also fails to produce any jokes br br the praise for this movie is purely political therefore only people who enjoy watching movies that are supposed to be politically important will enjoy this one even though alles zucker quite clearly has no importance of any kind br br for all the rest don't watch it without a fast forward option i really missed it
<START> and it got it in france why not in the rest of the world while the studios keep churning out expensive post grisham trash will anyone remember him as a fine writer and not the most betrayed by the screen author this side of stephen king this one has it all okay the situations are not always original has minor plot holes and it has a tendency to be too clever some brief times for its own sake but it actually delivers and is obviously a work of love i'd be curious to know what the budget was and for once this is not a cheap tarantino copy well film noir didn't started with tarantino you know will it once again be saved by europe like john dahl's movies were so mr can make another one like this if you ever read this mr thank you and se
<START> this is definitely a movie that will make you think about the everyday struggles a person can go through every day great acting by the two leading roles exemplifies this further and you will not regret seeing this movie in any way br br it's a heartwarming tale of two new friends exploring the ups and downs of everyday life seen from the seat of a wheelchair their friendship is tested as well as their spirits when they get their own flat outside the nursing home br br i recommend this film to everyone who likes buddy pictures or just wants to see a wonderful and heartwarming film that steers clear of all the clichÃ©s and pitfalls and not once gets soggy
<START> this movie was a rather odd viewing experience the movie is obviously based on a play now i'm sure that everything in this movie works out just fine in a play but for in a movie it just doesn't feel terribly interesting enough to watch the movie is way too 'stagey' and they didn't even bothered to change some of the dialog to make it more fitting for a movie instead what is presented now is an almost literally re filming of a stage play with over the top characters and staged dialog because of all this the storyline really doesn't work out and the movie becomes an almost complete bore and obsolete viewing experience br br it takes a while before you figure out that this is a comedy you're watching at first you think its a drama you're watching with quirky characters in it but as the movie progresses you'll notice that the movie is more a tragicomedy that leans really more toward the comedy genre rather than the drama genre br br the characters and dialog are really the things that make this movie a quirky and over the top one that at times really become unwatchable sure the actors are great peter o'toole and susannah york amongst others but they don't really uplift the movie to a level of 'watchable enough' br br the story feels totally disorientated basicaly the story is about nothing and just mainly focuses on the brother sister characters played by peter o'toole and susannah york but what exactly is the story even about the movie feels like a pointless and obsolete one that has very little to offer like i said before i'm sure the story is good and interesting to watch on stage but as a movie it really isn't fitting and simply doesn't work out br br the editing is simply dreadful and times and it becomes even laughable bad in certain sequences br br more was to expect from director j lee thompson who has obviously done far better movies than this rather failed stage play translated to screen project br br really not worth your time br br 4 10
<START> the of this picture was best proven on the intended target audience namely teens my 14 year old son became so engrossed in this film that i rate it considerably higher than its imitator mad city it sparked debate in our household on issues such as peer pressure and loyalty vs doing the right thing for that alone i rate this film a 10 parents should watch it with their teens and discuss it afterwards br br i very much liked the smart dialogue and consistent acting i thought that james remar was adequate in his role but the teenage cast really carried this picture other imdb users have praised corey performance which truly is inspired all in all i give this picture my highest recommendation go get this one
<START> when i first saw this movie back in the middle of january 2005 i didn't like it i thought it was too weird and thought that some parts that the main star judith light acted were so unlike her which of course is true and then i watched bits of it the next day when it re aired and i felt pretty much the same then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing i even cried the first 2 times but mainly because the actress was actually crying and i am a big fan of hers br br it is a very well acted and done tv movie judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film i keep watching it over and over it's a sad movie but very good br br if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it it's not usually my type of movie but i did enjoy this one a
<START> no holds barred is that movie that when you were nine or ten was the coolest movie this side of arnold schwarzenegger but then when you grow up and watch it you feel embarrassed that you were so gullible to have liked it you feel cheated embarrassed and stupid if you have a little brother and you show him this and he tells you it's gay give him a high five and take him to the strip bar for his eleventh birthday
