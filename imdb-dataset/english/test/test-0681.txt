<START> i do not write reviews here often but i can not stand by and let other people suffer through this movie without a least trying to warn them this movie is horrible and it is not because i do not know what the director was trying to convey or i am too stupid to understand the plot this movie is horrible because of poor direction screen writing and acting this is the trifecta of bad move making and the reason the film was direct to video it tries to be something like high tension hostel and with the lifting of some of those ideas but it just does not work i did not have high expectations or even medium ones going into the film but was still very disappointed it had potential to be very good with a nice setting and good idea for a film but it was wasted
<START> contains really bad spoilers so what can i say about this it's a really horrible and awful movie too much cgi and special effects you could tell how fake the ridiculous baby is please at least go watch dungeons and dragons which is another terrible pile of trash son of the mask makes dungeons and dragons way better pure crap i hate this trash i would also like to say that superbabies 2 was also a really stupid movie probably just as stupid as son of the mask 2 was just as fake as son of the mask and also contains way too much cgi br br anyway yeah this was a bad bad really bad movie just please avoid it do not recommend this to no one please its just way too ridiculous makes no sense and really bad plot the baby on his dad was just lame
<START> as a cusp pre baby boomer born in 1944 in los angeles thereby having the dubious distinction of having been alive while hitler was still actively involved in his last great offensive but also with our president roosevelt still actively fighting the offensive this was one of the most important first films of my young life having the opportunity to see it in re release several years after the 1946 opening a common studio custom in those years answered even to my very young mind oh so many questions i had being surrounded by our returning vet heroes ensconced in all the many of william wyler's of subtle multi plots intentionally not surrounding mini or sub plots in all their colors and shades of intensity did more than anything else i can recall to provide to me some semblance of reason and rational explanation of what had been going on all around me in real life my personal experience perchance being a new and different angle when looking at this classic film
<START> if you are in to bad movies for the entertainment of witnessing bad movies bad acting bad production etc aka mystery science theater 3000 quality you will love pacific inferno jim brown will be forever remembered as one of the greatest football players to ever play the game as an actor he will forever be remembered as one of the greatest football players to ever play the game i am not sure who rolf was but i am hoping he was 15 or 16 years old when he directed this perhaps he may have been the next spielberg in the making because if he was a grown man directing this a 15 or 16 year old could have done better the basis or plot for the movie probably had some historical merit and maybe even truthfully accurate but the actual film may be one of worst movies made in american film history i kept waiting for lee marvin william holden or charles bronson to pop in to somehow save whatever face was left of this film i would have loved to have been at the red carpet black tie gala for the hollywood opening when this movie previewed as this movie had to have many a viewer laughing and cringing under their breath it is on the dime dvd racks now look for it for entertainment value this movie is so bad it is too good to pass up
<START> it's valentines day and we decided to stay in have a nice dinner and watch this movie on tcm instead of going out we're in our 40's 50's love romance and are both softies but this movie just bombed for us it's hard to imagine that it was nominated for oscars etc but i guess that was then the cinematography was beautiful but for the most part the movie as a whole is terribly dated jennifer jones' character made so many references to her being that we started counting and after a while we were giggling every time she said it add to that the theme song played incessantly throughout the film and we couldn't wait for it to be over so we could watch the evening news
<START> if you feel reshammiya as the singer is too much of a pain to watch on tv try watching him in the movie for 2 hours straight his face is bland all throughout the movie and it is very comical to see him act the demanding and intense scenes this is way far from a real love story get the spelling right reshammiya it is not luv or and is complete with him doing a mithun da dance auto rickshaw fight scenes himesh getting imprisoned himesh accused of murder he fleeing from prison etc if you want a good laugh there is nothing like this one especially the scenes where he howls in mehbooba if you despise the nasal and want to know out of curiosity what two hours of reshammiya can do to you then don't miss this movie br br i couldn't stop laughing from the beginning till the very end the only saving grace that this movie has are the cinematography locations and a couple of the songs even then until you are a die hard reshammiya fan avoid this movie at all costs
<START> i had been wanting to see an american werewolf in paris for a long time because i loved its predecessor but this film didn't impress me as much as an american werewolf in london actually to be quite honest it didn't impress me at all br br tom everett scott and his dude pals are wandering paris and in a preposterous stunt off the eifel tower rescuing wolf babe julie delpy from death before you've time to work out if the constant mugging and lumpy dialogue is meant to be the stuff of comedy a full moon has hit and the brats are being chased by dreadful cgi werewolves down parisian sewers br br the script is disgustingly poor the actors were made to make this film they're horrible performances match the status of the movie from start to end this movie is never entertaining engaging or even slightly watchable i had trouble watching this whole film without throwing up my dinner to be quite honest br br the action scenes aren't exciting the jokes aren't funny and the werewolves aren't scary in short miss out or be haunted forever br br i rate an american werewolf in paris 2 out of 10
<START> when it comes to those eerie and uncanny little crime films the sorts that revolve around characters that are bordering on scum and inhabit equally scummy surroundings and additionally carry that wavering and bleak feel thanks to some pretty grotty cinematography and some very black comedy dead bodies is the sort of film paul wishes he could make alas the maddening and sporadic gangster no 1 as well as the equally all over the shop but interesting exercise in surrealism mixed with realism effort entitled the acid house are the only ones of his we've got to go on so far dead bodies is robert quinn's piece based on a derek landy script a film that the line between psychological horror and neo noir intermingling elements of crime and terror with themes linked to morality and unnatural obsessive disorders br br british based crime efforts carry that wavy and distorted feel like witnessing somebody's nightmare and having front row seats in the process his films are able to disgust is some areas and amuse in others what with their outlandish and all over the place approach they carry a very dream like sensibility despite being grounded in a very realistic down trodden grimy looking world Â the real world with as much an emphasis on the horror and the terror of the situations his characters spawn than anything else dead bodies is a film that tackles both some pretty harrowing character driven situations as well as a brief inclusion of a study of a delicate psychological mindset only here the film balances both the eccentricity of its characters the terror of the scenarios they find themselves in and the questions of morality that arise much better br br dead bodies is effective and rather simplistic without ever feeling like manipulative its suggestive and knowing tendency to want to hammer home exactly what people are thinking and feeling does not detract from the experience early on we meet tommy mcgann scott a young lad whose girlfriend jean davis dominates him his life and the screen whenever she's on for the brief time that she is the point as to the fact his situation of living in a less than desirable house with a job stacking shelves and a partner he doesn't get on with at all well is put across in a distinct manner as is the manner in which the audience are given distinct permission to dislike jean what with the bratty spoilt and expectant attitudes she so clearly possesses later on the film will linger rather obviously on a police officer's face as suspicions and tensions rise in what is clearly a cheap and easy way to tell the watching audience that our hero is not quite out of trouble just yet br br but compare this to gangster no 1 in which such is the episodic and misguided approach applies to the material that a vital vital plot point arises when a character is spotted leaving a building by someone else out on a drive' in a scene set several months after the previous one the feeling isn't as grounded nor fulfilling dead bodies' set up is dominated by kay davis' jean a would be femme fatale just itching to pick a fight of some sort but just not really being able to find one she has lead tommy jumping through rings going there doing this and that without tommy ever really reacting in the manner he could principally because he is controlled by her promises of sex the beginning builds a certain amount of tension because of tommy's underplayed reaction to what's going on and it culminates in a distinct release when the initial incident happens and jean dies br br if the set up is simple enough then that's one thing but the pinch of the project is the manner in which tommy decides to rid jean of his hands by burying her without informing anyone of her death bar a best friend things tighten when it transpires there was a second dead body in the exact same place tommy buried jean with suspicions denials and general trouble the all round ingredients of the day it is at this point the film blurs the lines between noir and horror indeed tommy inhabits rather a large ominous spooky and even gothic house which he shares with an elder relative whom inhabits the upper areas of said house this evokes memories of hitchcock's 1960 film psycho and bates' set up that he has with his mother and where she's positioned it is additionally no coincidence this would be place of horror is the setting for unfortunate demise br br the placing of a dead body right in the hands of the hapless male lead in order for it to act as the initial incident is a classic set up for any noir from 1945 film detour right up to a more recent and more contemporary compared to dead bodies 2006 film entitled big nothing what this film unfolds into is a twisted rather unpredictable and quite frightening tale of genre hybridity and mind games told under a palette of distinctly drained visuals the voice overs and the treading on the fine line that the lead does for most of the film between right and wrong aid in pushing it into a realm of the neo noir if we consider the fact that the lead is essentially innocent and his murder charges are unfair then that's one thing but his attitudes towards jean initially saw him act without thought and his covering up of her death is the anti thesis for dropping the murder charges dead bodies is taught entertaining to watch without ever feeling exploitative and provides a consistent tone for the rather nasty physical and psychological content being explored
<START> clearly this would have had potential in more capable hands but given uwe boll's track record it would have been surprising if there would have been any merit to this farce br br the first 5 minutes are classic monster movie madness even the horrible one liners delivered by gi joe type soldiers feel as if they were lifted off another venture into the same genre br br you will be doing yourself a favor if you exit the movie at this point you've already passed all the highlights and you will have spared yourself the suffering of sitting through some of the worst acting in recent history br br next enter absolute rubbish talent the leading man has the same amount of charisma that you will find in garden slug br br there is an awkward bit of contrived romance thrown in this feels so wrong that you can only speculate why this scene was conjured up in the first place normally the genre uses interludes of romance and nudity to inject some humanity and sympathy into otherwise cardboard cut out characters here it backfires on all cylinders br br the effects are bad and the action unbelievably boring where other classics show originality and imagination in the face of budget restraints here it just seems like everything was spent on catering br br there are in fact no redeeming features here not even the it's so bad it is almost good applies it's just bad and in a bad way br br our hero questions the leading starlet about the night they spent together and how she would rate him she gives him 2 out of 10 i give the whole affair 1 i'd have gone for 0 if that were possible br br don't waste your time on this dribble there is plenty of crap cinema out there which exceeds this ridiculous rumble in the jungle br br oh and finally the movie has little to nothing at all to do with the popular game far cry at best it is extremely loosely based on it br br horrible move along
<START> i had never heard of this film until it came to dvd i was immediately intrigued by everything about it the actors the title the cover and especially the author arthur miller you can't go wrong with him can you yep i haven't read the novel but i'm going to guess it was a lot better than the film i had high hopes for this movie i love macy and dern and it looked interesting unfortunately this film never really rises above cookie cutter messages about racism and bigotry if you've never seen any other films that deal with this subject or if you never knew that america was founded on bigotry then maybe this film will wow you others will probably find it predictable stale and overall bland
<START> this film without doubt is one of the worst i have seen it was so boring that i simply could not wait for it to end i talked my girlfriend into watching it after this site had good reviews and after even 30 mins in she looked at me as if to say your nuts the scenery was as boring as the film with nothing but driving around in the car looking at the wind blowing bits of bush around the acting was un inspiring and the film was simply a waste of what have been a good idea into a waste of a br br guy pierce should have stuck to neighbours as at least he washed his hair all he done was talk on his phone but yet sold nothing as a salesman he would have been sacked weeks before his girlfriend once in coyote ugly should have remained dancing on the bar as at least she looked hot in that br br the guy who played vincent those who watched know was so annoying with his phone calls that any normal person would have drove to his house and hit him with a bit of 4 by 2 br br i do not on this earth know what anyone liked about it i actually want people to watch this to suffer the torture i went through
<START> i was watching tv one day with a friend and we caught the last twenty minutes of going bananas believe me when i say it was enough to get a good judgment of the film the first scene that i saw was the monkey the kid the fat guy and the black guy who looked like dave flying around in a crop duster thousands of feet in the air while everyone else was solemn about the journey the monkey seemed to be on some kind of drug binge where he kept shouting something that resembled the english word faster they then landed on a twenty yard long dock in africa after a heart felt goodbye where the monkey cried hahahaha the villains of the film appeared they were tearing complete ass in their vintage cadillac when the evil monkey took an air jordan leap form the dock onto the boat that was sailing away a clean 40 yards away and made them sink their beautiful car into the pacific ocean after seeing this film i have a new purpose in life to find the midget who played the monkey and stab him in the eye with a fountain pen
<START> if one were to return to the dawn of the talking picture one would prophesy a bright future for harold lloyd unlike his competitors he was comedic actor trained on the legitimate stage not a performed raised in the purgatory of the music hall or vaudeville circuit he had a good voice which matched his image moreover from 1924 on his silent films had incorporated sequences based on sound gags lost on the audience e g the bell sequence at the fall frolic from the freshman and the monkey sequence in the kid brother yet lloyd's sound features consistently failed at the box office once the novelty of welcome danger had lloyd blamed his fall on many external sources but never realized that the glass character's enemy was not sound but the great depression pre depression audiences giddy with optimism may have rooted for this ambitious go getter in whom they saw their surrogate depression audiences despised him as the person likely to on their mortgage and throw them in the gutter compounding this problem of character choice is lloyd's perception as an insincere glad hander sincerity of course is a subjective appraisal but it is undeniable that lloyd despite his own tragic upbringing could never play a convincing down and outer perhaps this is because he feared returning to that state permanently the cat's paw fails for these reasons but it alone suffers from the revelation of lloyd's pro fascist agenda many film scholars believe that lloyd was prompted to make this film because he saw the presidency of fdr as a dictatorship bent on soaking the rich and soft on crime we should remember that he was not alone in this feeling demille had directed this day and age a pro police state drama the previous year we should also remember that america was founded by tax protesters and continues to be motivated by those who want something without paying for it tcp suffered because it treated fascism lightly in a comedy and because its release was particularly ill timed given the events in germany in that year the production code of 1934 would ultimately curtail the glorification of vigilante justice and reaffirm the rule of constitutional law cumbersome as it might be the ideal of the benevolent despot the good intentioned all powerful leader who brings about a utopia once freed of the checks and balances on this dates to classical antiquity for this reason totalitarian regimes fear laughter even though it acts as a safety valve ironically the mere existence of tcp a film which the democratic experience of the country of its origin shows that america was secure enough to accept criticism one sees no parallel criticism in hitler's germany ussr or mussolini's italy but can one laugh at the gallows humor of pending fascism lloyd's unnuanced film is skewed to the right and might have been written by dr goebbels himself if he'd had a sense of humor of course it posits an alternative history in which a chosen one restores order and lost honor by any means necessary and does so with good nature and fun impending fascism approached by the left is of course chaplin's the great dictator this latter film has the benefit of being set in another country and based on a thinly veiled actual persona and events the great dictator produces few laughs today because it under estimated the extent of human evil but it succeeds despite its artless and inappropriate speechifying because it has the distinct advantage of being vindicated by history lloyd however should be credited for two things first he neither made any further pro fascist films nor produced any subsequently hypocritically pro allied films during the war second he never sold tcp to television the post 1945 world had seen the face of fascism and it wasn't amusing
<START> there are frames in this film that could be renoir paintings with vivid colors against muted backgrounds the humorous combination of sexual honesty and innocence is refreshing in this fifties film and makes palatable the old story line of the ingenue that becomes a star the can can number at the end seems realistic and exciting but not over the top as in an american dance sequence
<START> i was able to see anywhere but here last night as a free sneak preview i absolutely loved the film i was drawn to it because of the realistic portrayal of a mother daughter relationship there was definitely a connection between adele a and ann i think that speaks volumes of the outstanding performances of both susan sarandon and natalie portman sarandon was just the right actress to portray adele and after leaving the theater i could not think of another actress in the role portman was also excellent as ann she brought a sense of maturity and intelligence to the role that i don't think any other teenage actress could i think it would the academy of motion picture arts and sciences should give credit where it is due and nominate both sarandon and portman for awards in the actress and supporting actress categories it would be a shame if they were overlooked
