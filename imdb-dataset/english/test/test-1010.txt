<START> the worst part of all is the poor scripting leading to superficial acting br br dreyfuss' character is intensely repetitive and annoying and dreyfuss himself has the annoying face to match br br holly hunter's character is exaggeratedly self centered and hunter herself indulges in serious overacting as usual br br brad johnson was wooden john goodman made the best of it br br furthermore the whole death ghost thing has since been somewhat overdone and now appears rather lame br br barely watchable only if you like old
<START> leave ed wood alone to call plan 9 from outer space the worst film ever made would be to deny this abysmally vulgar heap of hollywood guano its rightful title this pretentious fusion of witless whimsy and bathetic sociopolitical commentary actually does seem to be formed along the lines of plan 9 with badly staged scenes of down on their luck actors on cheap sets interspersed with what appears to be footage of battle and crowd scenes cribbed from higher budget epics but whereas plan 9 occasionally manages to be funny when it means to be and reasonably entertaining overall this tacky pageant is appallingly lacking in basic showmanship with scenes ranging from offensively unfunny the disgusting burlesque of groucho marx stealing manhattan from the indians to low camp hedy lamarr attempting to impersonate joan of arc hearing her voices to tedious dennis hopper doing absolutely nothing with the role of napoleon to the unexpectedly poignant performance of peter lorre as the psychotic nero give the worst director trophy to irwin allen for turning so much into so little
<START> sadly this movie is relegated to status it seems many people that i've asked did you know the monkees made a movie usually answer 'no ' that being said if you are one of that large number i recommend you see it but with the following caveat s if you expect monkey style humor it is in there it's just not all over the place like the tv shows br br yes they are trying to break their tv mold a bit by poking fun at it like a bunch of no longer teenagers who have been on the short end of a lot of sticks br br no you don't have to be inebriated to enjoy it br br no you don't have to be inebriated to understand it br br if you like classics you'll love the interspersed clips throughout br br if you like the psychedelic era you'll love some of the cameos br br if you are a monkees fan you might recognize some of the jabs they are taking at the heavy commercializing of the band br br in the nigh immortal words of one of my best friends after seeing 5 minutes of it this is a weird movie man in fact it might be better if you don't try to understand it just sit back and react to it it's weird it's funny it's a bit surreal it's experimental still it is many things overall it is an experience
<START> on the heels of the well received and beloved coming of age film classic concerning the lives of teenagers as they headed into adulthood george lucas' american graffiti we have cooley high an adaptation of sorts by one eric monte co creator of the popular 1970's cbs sitcom good times br br cooley high was and is viewed as a black version of american graffiti instead of central california as in american graffiti we have the black slum of chicago's green as the backdrop for the story here instead of america in 1962 cooley high is situated in 1964 the movie stars welcome back lawrence hilton jacobs and glynn turman as the movie main protagonists and its' main characters it has garrett morris playing the principal who tries to keep and turman's characters named and preach out of trouble a great deal of the time br br you know i would like to say that cooley high is a worthy comparison piece to american graffiti or that it is a great film on its' own but i can't the problem lies with the fact that the producers of the film couldn't or wouldn't hide the sad underside of black life in america having the film in the green part of chicago doesn't help things br br neither does the crass gross attempts at humor here when is looking for a letter of intent from a college he finds his little brother has thrown down a toilet when the gang visits the chicago zoo one of the gang named has manure thrown on him by an ape when the turman's character preach is being chased by two hoodlums in the school hangout a dirty and depressing place to eat food in much less meet people at he opens the door of the girls' bathroom while a girl is relieving herself as he escapes through the window of the same bathroom the high school the homes of the characters the bathrooms just about everywhere in the film displays the unfortunate look of urban decay and poverty br br if that wasn't enough there was the rough display of humor in the film the use of violence and profanity in the film cooley high may be an coming of age film but it is a hard and rough coming of age film with little or none of the wit and liking of the use of nostalgia that made people like and appreciate american graffiti so much br br motown records had a hand in making the film the company's music was part of the film's soundtrack but even here you get a sense of same old same old as one has heard these songs before a million times over not that they weren't great songs within themselves but black music of that time period was more than just motown especially in chicago the song nearing the end of the movie by the g c cameron was not all that impressive there have been better motown ballads that have been done by better motown artists than cameron without question br br the last part of the film showing where the characters went to pay homage to the film cooley high aimed to be american graffiti it shows that preach an intelligent but underachieving student went to hollywood and became a successful television writer eric monte may have patterned himself as turman's character the last shot of film show's preach running away from funeral held on a dark rainy afternoon and all the bleakness that cooley high came to represent eric monte through preach and that final scene had one little lesson for all of us when watching cooley high and for the love of the past don't look back
<START> it's embarrassing i had like 3 minutes on my way to a job to stop at the video store and it was 2 for 1 night and i was really intrigued by the half nekkid pic of the 'star' br br i guess this film shows what the new york film school and sir daddy's fortune judging by the bio of this clown in the lead can do for you and you and you cause that's about what we have here and in addition a photoshopped pic of the lead actor with someone else's body in a still image that doesn't happen anywhere in the movie it's weird cause in so many ways it had money thrown at it obviously low budget money buckets but from the outset when all the extras are laughing in their scene of terror it doesn't bode well would have maybe had some charm if it had been done for 2 cents in short order i skipped scenes and fast forwarded to see the image on the box that was all i really cared about strange why don't i just rent a porno or something but wow there is bad acting that's funny i guess and bad acting that's just bad robert englund is pretty pathetic in this along with everyone else it does make you appreciate the more not so straight to video horror that's out there blah most of which i wouldn't bother with shoulda watched uh hellraiser 3 if i wanted to see an 8 pack i would imagine horny old gay guys with 2 minutes in the video store are going to be the principle renters of this and they ought to start a class action suit
<START> so this is where columbia's head of their short subjects unit got his directorial start eh yeah it's none other than mr jules white who is credited or is it rather exposed as the director of this entry into mgm's dogville series given co credit as co director is one zion myers whose name is heretofore unknown to us mr meyers was no doubt the guy who controlled the four legged thespians and was responsible for training and acting in short he must have been the dog trainer on the set br br the title of this comedy short is no doubt a play on the mgm feature of the same year the big house which starred chester morris wallace beery robert montgomery and a stellar cast in support we must plead ignorance in regards to this title not having seen it up to this point sorry schultz but there are many of the doggie gags that relate to what we've read about the movie not to mention some particular character specific gags for example we observed a canine convict who st st stuttered and deduced correctly that the bow wow actor was mimicking character comedian roscoe ates we later cross checked with the cast of the big house and presto his name is there brilliant deduction one fit for holmes watson br br the practice of lampooning popular features was already a tried and true practice in the realm of the comedy short it was one that seemed to draw no objections from the producers and copyright owners of the major films but rather quite contrarily received heaps of approval after all imitation is said to be the sincerest form of flattery besides any producer would welcome even some seemingly irreverent parodying as for the movie itself we found it to be interesting in a sort of perverse manner seeing so many of man's best friends being so artificially animated into one long and boring sort of anthropomorphic gag seemed very tiring to we who make up the audience i mean just how many were made to bark needlessly in order to achieve the illusion of br br when it comes to pets or animal companions as the politically correct crowd prefers we are quite eclectic favoring not only dogs but also cats and we don't enjoy seeing any animal exploited in such a non funny extended play format br br as incredible as it may seem the step that mr jules white made from mgm's shorts to heading up columbia's 2 reeler production would seem to have been not only a tep up in the area of finance but al o in the tic content we never thought that being producer director for the likes of such luminaries as the 3 stooges andy clyde and hugh herbert as well as some who certainly had seen better days such as charley chase buster keaton and harry langdon would be a step up cinematically br br in case we haven't made our point yet we're officially panning this one so view it at your own risk we warned you br br note we read excellent accounts of both the big house and the laurel hardy send up pardon us hal roach mgm 1931 in both mr laurel mr hardy by john mccabe 1962 and the films of laurel hardy by william k everson 1967 both books have our most enthusiastic endorsement br br note the prison picture became a genre of its own all owing a debt to the big house in pardon us laurel hardy hal roach and its director did a first class spoof the first of many for a prison comedy became a required theme for so many a screen funny man to come
<START> one of the worse surfing movies i've ever seen this movie is so bad i don't know where to begin okay let's start with the premise some dude from the mainland who barely knows how to surf travels to hawaii and enters a big wave contest which he more or less expects to win a good analogy for those who don't surf would be a that of a grossly overweight chain smoker slapping on a pairs of running shoes and entering the la marathon with expectations of winning no way and the contest is held on the north shore which conjures up images of 15 foot waves but contest day the waves are maybe 6 foot the acting what acting if you must see this woof see it on tv don't waste your money renting it if you want to see a pretty good surfing movie granted it is flawed but that's another story rent big wednesday
<START> this movie is true action at its finest it doesn't get any better then this this is one of those movies that you can just kick back and watch some real good non stop shooting and killing plus there are some excellent lines to go along with all of this my favorite is there is a one bad guy who is breaking into this old couples home and he is stealing a tv or something and he goes right up to them and yells i will come in here anytime i like and right before he jumps out the window he yells anytime i mean this is just classic stuff all the way around so you got a choice you can watch that crappy will smith try to go an action film or you can watch one of the masters charles bronson
<START> to surmise this film involves two actors caine and moran trying to con a gangster the plot is flimsy at best as several plot holes occur throughout however this normally shouldn't matter as the comedy should carry a film like this there are some genuinely funny bits mostly provided by dylan moran however other times there are long melodramatic scenes that fail to add anything to the movie caine's character seemed overdone to me especially at the start he continually quotes shakespeare and acts like a pompous actor one could say he was playing the part properly but the character seemed to me flat and unfunny overall i would say see only if a fan of the actors involved otherwise wait for video or tv
<START> how can so many blundering decisions can be made all that waste of resources its an idiotic story to begin with but theres no need to make it worse a loose interpretation are you kidding it diminishes my regard for voight and coburn i hope they were paid well
<START> i love this movie one of my all time favorites this was the first big screen movie my mom took me to see when i was 9 i highly recommend it to every african american this story is about love trust challenges and everyday life of a black family all the actors worked well together i wish it was on video but as of yet it is not available that i know of i caught it on television a few years ago and recorded it so whenever i get the urge to watch it i have it the soundtrack is awesome too a must see
<START> i think that it's great how chiller picked up this series and showing it for this generation film making has come such a long way especially with the special effects and for one to be able to watch archived shows that they never knew existed they will certainly be able to see the progress compared to now monsters is neither lame nor spectacular but it is entertaining it takes creativity for the types of story lines they came up with and each generation seems to have it's own horror series this particular series was not as horrifying as the friday the 13th the series nor as adult oriented as the freddy's nightmares it was something that an entire family could watch and still get a laugh and a fright at the same time i am happy the chiller channel shows it in their line up i am just about caught up on the episodes i missed when i was growing up
<START> there was some good build up of suspense throughout the cinematography was surprisingly good considering such minimal budget we witness occasional spells of good acting however this is quickly deflated by some quite cheesy lines understandably there would not be much of an intellectual conversation to be had sitting up on trees while a crocodile is stalking you silence would have been golden here there could have been a bigger play on suspense than dimly uttering i sat in the cupboard for fear of my brother something tells me there's a slight difference in getting a beating from your brother than being eaten by a mighty croc you decide throughout the film i can't seem to find a connection or for that matter sympathy with the characters perhaps thats because they don't develop one throughout the film character that is there are some occasional good scares when the crocodile sneaks up on the characters overshadowed again by some questionable scenes in one instance we should be terrified by an ear floating in the water but later we sit beside a decapitated limbless corpse and only worry about a broken finger a definite roller coaster of a film when it comes to logic
<START> ok i am a sucker i loved it i had no expectations and had them all fulfilled it was a terrible movie i loved it i have managed to wear out a dvd from over use no one can understand my obsession i can't either to tell the truth for those who have seen the movie this will come as no surprise but i asked the clerk at the video store if i could buy a copy and i could because there were two in stock and only one had been check out and over half of the time it had been to me br br now the movie is terrible the special effects are terrible the acting is terrible but i loved it the actors are silly the plot silly the goofs numerous like being able to see through the monsters the looked like they were made out of plastic garbage bags maybe they were there was light underground tnt wasn't deafening etc br br you must really love b movies to get any enjoyment out of this alcohol helps enormously for others
<START> this was an attempt toward a romantic comedy and one which did not work although the film was cast in an interesting manner the dismal script betrayed the best efforts of all the director's fey mannerisms may have succeeded if he had adopted a point of view it was embarrassing to watch william baldwin and in particular armin muller stahl
