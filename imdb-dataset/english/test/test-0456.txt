<START> this film has an excellent premise and is really crying out to be turned into a hollywood blockbuster as i recall and it's a few years since i've seen the film the action starts with a london omnibus filled with people there is an horrific crash and one passenger dies the rest of the film is then told in flashback with 13 characters who were on the bus getting their recent lives explored in intricate detail at the end of the film we return to the crash and find out which of these chirpy vivid characters has met a gruesome end great stuff a little like a good tabloid news story fleshed out in precise even handed detail if only it were available on video
<START> possible spoilers br br the sixth halloween film is an utterly depressing affair but unfortunately not in the manner envisioned by the filmmakers by now everyone knows the story of how it was butchered and released in such a sloppy incoherent form the second half in particular makes little to no sense as plot elements are introduced and dropped seemingly at random the very ending left me scratching my head what the hell happened is dr loomis dead or what this is what you get when you put a shameless hack in charge of a motion picture it's not a pretty sight br br on a related note this is the most graphically violent entry in the series i have no problem with gore if it's in the right place but this movie takes it to absurd levels the infamous exploding head must be a new low for the series michael himself even seems to be enjoying the act of murdering another human being inconsistent with his efficient methodical approach in the john carpenter original br br i'm not quite sure who was responsible director joe or the producers probably a combination of both i'd be perfectly happy to grant a pardon to all concerned if only they'd release the legendary producers' cut a more complete version of the film that is a vast improvement from every account from what i understand it's like a different movie altogether i offer to pay full price to purchase the dvd if miramax comes to its senses and releases it br br there are a handful of good elements however the idea of michael being controlled by the druids is intriguing paul rudd is solid as tommy doyle whose appearance is a neat tie in with the original the slick visuals help make the proceedings a bit more watchable but these meager offerings are overshadowed by the overload of drivel we have to put up with br br finally the curse of michael myers is noted for being donald pleasance's last film many of his scenes were excluded from the final cut and when he does appear he seems frail and unhappy the movie is dedicated to his memory a blatant if unintentional insult if there was ever one the fact that a talented performer should end his career like this is too depressing to even think about br br 1 2 out of br br released by dimension films
<START> this is the most frightening film ever made in hollywood it is a cautionary tale of how to take a european masterpiece and suck the life of of it until it is a dry husk like an insect carcass on the the frightening because it reveals how the world of hollywood really works ignorant money begetting dross it makes me wonder how many great films could populate the corridors of my memory if the hollywood process had not leveled them to forgettable mediocrity cry for the murdered children see spoorloos or read the golden egg if you dare because they will come back to you forever in the idle moments of your life when you're walking along the street and you see a 'missing' poster in ordinary looking parking lots when you hear the tour de france on the radio and especially when you you think what's the harm in wearing a sock with a hole in it on a perfectly ordinary day br br if only i could give this a zero
<START> this film is absolute gold if you haven't seen it do mani outdoes himself once again this film introduced me to nandita das as well though everyone shines in this movie my only regret is i've never found a copy with subtitles to the lyrics of the songs we are led from the jungle of northern sri lanka to the serene beaches of southern india as well as from the terror of war to the ultimate conquest by love of the human heart beautiful subtle witty with a few hidden surprises waiting for the viewer this movie stands up to being seen again and again and the story within the story the umbrella is done so well as we watch the scene unfold from drawings in a book lovely watch it
<START> it's not often i give two stars to a horror movie because horror is my favorite genre a movie can be bad in that it isn't a masterpiece but can be enjoyable on the basis of unintentional humour bizarre characters etc a case in point are a great number of horror sci fiction movies from the 1940s to 1980s era they are enjoyable for genre buffs and guilty pleasure seekers because their badness is entertaining however this movie has none of the humour or effective gory scenes of the piranha 1978 original br br i suppose in 1995 it was the heyday of political correctness so gore on tv was at a minimum now in the mid 2000s with the c s i shows tv's an absolute blood fest good for us horror fans br br william katt and alexandra paul are no bradford dillman and heather menzies the original 1978 stars it's not and paul's faults but the writers and director who created this tepid turkey how the main characters interact is the main flaw of this movie i won't say how because that is part of the plot br br this tv movie probably had a bigger budget than the original but flopped as good horror as can be seen from the user votes here stick with the 1978 original if you're in the mood for a killer fish movie
<START> pretty funny stuff charlie was still working towards his peak when he made this rather daring short about soldiers in the trenches of world war one daring because after all the war was still going on and this was a comedy about a serious business br br the gags are amusing without being either hilarious or tear jerking one successful scene follows another as chaplin and his comrades try to sleep in a bunker that is knee deep in water that's where we got the term trench foot from probably the most ludicrous episode has chaplin disguised as a tree and foiling any number of german soldiers as they try to execute an allied soldier caught behind the lines edna chaplin's main squeeze at the time is a woman who with the americans and is saved from execution too br br chaplin would go on to do funnier and more ambitious things but this is better than most of his shorts during this early period
<START> i don't understand how some people can stand playing half life counter strike when there are so many better first person shooting games available br br counter strike is a game that doesn't use any imaginative ideas in its weaponry all the weapons in the game are real life weapons but there could have been at least a cheat that allowed players to have access to a supernatural weapon like the all powerful bfg in the quake doom games br br another problem is that the player actually has to reload the weapon manually this can become extremely annoying especially while in the middle of a firefight when you are so close to killing the enemy the reloading delay also gives the feeling that the gun is slow at performing its task br br there are not many choices of characters to choose from if i remember correctly there are 4 types of characters each for the terrorist and counter terrorist forces this means that many of the characters look the same as each other which really brings down the game's realism br br the game is pretty sexist when it comes to character selections in the early version of counter strike there was a woman available to choose in the terrorist force selection which was good for the female gamers in the latest versions however the female character was deleted and replaced with another male character i wonder if the women who played the game were disappointed at the newer versions br br finally the maps in the game are very small the biggest map seems to be the desert map but it has standard detail in fact all the maps in the game have standard graphics in other words nothing new br br to sum up i think half life counter strike is the most un imaginative first person shooting game of all time there are plenty of better more imaginative shooting games to play so why waste your time on this boring game you're better off playing the unreal tournament quake and doom games avoid this over rated over hyped game br br i give the game a 1 10
<START> i'd have to say that i've seen worse sci fi channel originals but this nu image from yossi was still quite a drag the big problem with it is that it simply isn't convincing not just its creature but acting writing and any attempts at drama the direction lacks any kind of flair and the script from boaz davidson and danny lerner never really works predictable often laughable whilst it delivers less howlers than a fair few of these sorts of films it never offers anything to engage or raise the pulse the actors do their best but with such material their workmanlike efforts have little effect matthew reilly burke is a blandly watchable hero meredith morton similar as a blandly watchable love interest actually she was a bit less convincing but at least she was easy on the eyes the film at least has the dignity to bowl along at a reasonable pace but its biggest plus is that the octopus isn't entirely cgi rendered so even though it doesn't look good at least there are a few legit scenes of characters inanely grappling with rubbery tentacles in pretty amusing fashion i also chuckled at the disparities between different representations of the octopus the cgi shots of the creature as a whole vary over the course of the film they are also different not only in size but appearance to the practical shots of it and there are scenes where the tentacle action suggests that the makers had abandoned pretending they were making a film about an octopus and just envisioned their creature as a bunch of miscellaneous tentacles the scenes of the creature attacking people get old pretty swiftly but there are a few funny scenes where it takes on other things like a boat and a crane yes these scenes are poor but they did make me chuckle highlight though is a hilarious sequence in which the octopus takes on a new york landmark the scene may not be much more than a minute but it really is inspired and well worth looking up on youtube apart from that things are uninspired all round a pg level lack of gore or nastiness stops this one from even pulling off much in the trash good times the film does take a turn into semi gripping disaster movie territory at the end but i can't really give it credit because the best shots in the last few scenes were culled from the stallone flick daylight which by my recollection is quite good altogether this was pretty rubbishy stuff and not something i'd really recommend to anyone except creature feature die hards better than a poke in the eye with a wet stick but not by much
<START> this movie was groundbreaking in the former soviet union because it was the first movie released there that contained a real sex scene however the movie can be considered great for many reasons not the least of which is its true gritty portrayal of disillusionment and pain in the family of a working class soviet family i would definitely recommend it
<START> the curse of monkey island is a brilliant video game and its a stroke of genius from the video game designers at to have created this sequel all the characters are brilliant the voice overs for the characters were realistic and funny a lot of effort went into this game and it deserves the 10 i gave in the vote keep up the good work
<START> has anyone ever read or heard comments by scorsese or david chase soprano's exec producer about death collector family enforcer i bought the dvd after not having seen it for a while on cable like 20 years but having seen goodfellas and the entire sopranos run to date in retrospect both guys must have seen death collector family enforcer and absorbed the flavor perhaps inspiring the tone for their masterworks both of which the polar opposite of the romanticized godfather trilogy being a jersey guy it is interesting to see how the jersey meadowlands have evolved since the mid 70's it is not the swampy dumping ground it used to be although once in a while a body will turn up in a local waterway also it's a little bittersweet to seen a newly constructed world trade center in the across the river in the opening and closing scene who could have imagined
<START> master plan have the winning team in a deadly tournament one of several martial arts action pictures that attempted to capture the flavor of the famous enter the dragon from '73 this one is an effort from south africa the villain's stronghold is a bit different appearing as a white castle like fortress in the middle of the desert from a distance the villain himself a baron or general is a slightly more perverse version of the dr no or han mold of master villainy having strange flashbacks to the glory days of nazi germany he does wear the full regalia nazi uniform at some points his main ambition in life is to hold an illegal martial arts competition tournament against his japanese rival an extension of their complicity in the 2nd world war my army is better than your army it sounds silly and it is though the suggestion of madness and crazed machismo almost works the central hero steve chase ryan resembles a white 'bruce character having a similarly lean lithe physique though obviously not on the same level of martial arts expertise i thought he would be some secret government agent here but apparently not he and his girlfriend have joined the baron's team of fighters but decide to quit what did they think they were getting into of course it's not that easy there's an odd sequence of them escaping through the desert using a wrecked car with a rigged sail those desert winds can do wonders for travel it seems br br the plot kind of meanders in the 2nd half as the hero joins the team of the villain's competitor and the girlfriend is held hostage by the villain in a cell under threat of rape by the hero's rival the most interesting character turns out to be chico a dwarf who is the villain's assistant he's loyal to the baron but is sympathetic to the plight of the hero much of the fighting utilizes the ballet like capabilities of the hero with a lot of leaping and slow motion the sound fx are also amped up and exaggerated in an attempt to add more impact to the blows there are a few good fights during the tournament towards the climax but none really stand out if one had to pick i suppose the best involves the brutish muscle man henchman of the baron introduced late in the story he lifts the back of a car at one point you wonder how the hero will take him out at the end since the brute seems to shrug off most of the punches the acting is very mediocre descending into camp as far as the girlfriend who tends to laugh for no reason as if she's high on grass though she is very cute some of the training scenes are also campy especially all those guys running over or rolling down the desert sands and with such a title there's surprisingly few actual killings ryan as steve chase returned as a traditional agent in the sequel kill and kill again hero 4 villain 4 femme fatales 4 henchmen 6 fights 6 stunts chases 4 gadgets 2 auto 3 locations 5 pace 5 overall 4
<START> robert altman's quintet is a dreary gloomy hard to follow thriller where you finally give up after awhile because it's so complicated br br i remember seeing this at my local twin on opening weekend with a full house by the time the picture ended it was less than a quarter full never have i witnessed such a mass exodus without there being an emergency to drive people out that should tell you how bad it is i believe it to be the worst film ever made involving such major talent in front of and behind the camera
<START> rowan atkinson's mr bean ranks right up there with laurel hardy buster keaton the marx brothers and other comedy greats i have never seen people laugh out loud so heartily and literally fall out of their chairs as when i introduced them to mr bean via my videos and now dvds i'll never forget the first time my brother saw him he was over for a visit and i asked him if he'd ever seen mr bean who he said so i got out my video and showed him the one where mr bean is in church and starts to nod off my brother laughed so hard he fell out of the chair and was holding his stomach from laughing so hard he became an instant fan of mr bean we all know how hilarious these episodes are but the fun is in sharing them with others i have seen so many people laugh 'til it hurts favorite episodes are the visit of the queen the hotel room stay late for the dentist appointment the christmas episode a classic plus kids love it and the new year party rowan atkinson is a comic genius
<START> the kindred opens to shots of a porsche racing along a highway it catches up with an old pick up truck and gets held up as it speeds past the pick up the driver benjamin j perry as ben perry shouts obscenities and honks his horn distracted he doesn't notice an obstruction ahead and crashes his porsche he is quickly freed from the wreckage and is taken to hospital on the way the paramedic randy harrington trying to save him suggests that he probably won't make it then the ambulance is attacked and forced off the road by a van the driver of the van jackson jim as james f beats the paramedic up and steals the patient the ambulance driver harry charles makes no attempt to stop him once the injured man has been placed into the van jackson turns his attention to harry whom seem to know each other harry asks jackson not to hit him because he broke his jaw 'last time' jackson punches harry to the floor and throws a bundle of money at him the film then makes it perfectly clear we are in san fransisco by showing a shot of the golden gate bridge sharon raymond is woken up by a phone call for her boyfriend dr john david allen brooks to inform him that his mother amanda kim hunter who has recently had a heart attack has regained consciousness works for a company called the and is delighted at the news and heads off to see her once there she asks him to go back to his old childhood house in a small town called shelter cove and destroy all of her notes and experiments especially the which has never heard of she also claims that he has a brother named anthony back at talks with a dr phillip lloyd rod steiger about his mother as they had both worked together before they had a falling out with each other and questions him about her research and if he knows of anyone called anthony he claims he knows nothing when amanda dies after a visit from the sinister dr lloyd decides to carry out his mothers request and try to find out who anthony is while paying his final respects at the funeral a woman named melissa amanda pays introduces herself to and says she was a big admirer of his mothers work and research after she helped her because melissa seems to know so much about his mothers work he invites her to the house as she may possibly be able to help find some answers to various questions he has sharon melissa and three lab assistants brad baxter peter frechette hart phillips timothy gibbs and cindy russell julia montgomery plus a girl with a watermelon named nell valentine z great name what were her parents thinking they get down to business straight away but find little of any interest for some reason no one at this point thinks to look in the basement which is just as well as there's something down there something large slimy and has lots of tentacles first it kills duke the dog then it moves on to larger prey when hart is attacked by something in a barn decides he must destroy all traces of his mothers work and whatever anthony is jointly co written and directed by stepehn carpenter and jeffery obrow carpenter also acted as cinematographer and obrow as producer this is a pretty poor film in my opinion the script is credited to five writers carpenter obrow earl john penny and joseph stefano and with five people working on it i'd like to think they could come up with something a little bit better and more coherent than this nothing is explained that well why did amanda create these monstrous sea creature human hybrids what is dr lloyd's interest and his motives why does he steal bodies from the back of why does he have a basement full of mutants why do none of these so called genetic scientists think to check the basement out could melissa act more suspiciously even if she tried why are none of the characters given any background why do people keep mentioning a substance found in sea creatures called when 99 9 of the audience isn't going to have clue what their on about there is also a serious lack of blood and gore only one person dies on screen just one and all the scientists survive in a vomit mushy 'happy ending' this is a horror film guys all we want to see is the slimy monsters kill and eat people in various gory ways the one on screen death is actually quite cool someone has slimy tentacles inserted under their skin in their ear and up their nose in the films only decent horror sequence to try and up the gore there is a scene where dr lloyd is experimenting on a skinned animal but it only lasts for a few seconds and in the context of the rest of the film doesn't mean a thing melissa also turns into a fish don't ask there's no nudity either which isn't a surprise the film looks professional enough with decent production values but is just so dull and plods along at a snails pace we don't even get to see the giant monster in the basement until 15 odd minutes before the end which is far too little far too late when it does make an appearance the effects are ok and that makes it even more of a shame that it wasn't used more overall i was very disappointed and i was expecting a lot better a horror film with only one on screen death and only three in total what's the world coming too
