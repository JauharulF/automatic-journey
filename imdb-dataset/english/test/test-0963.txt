<START> one of the first things i noticed that allowed this culture to stand out among the rest was during the wake at place an aerial shot is used to show sole being flowered with kisses by a sea of women i believed this was a commentary on the closeness that women had for each other of this who stuck together across the generations and misunderstandings and still being able to bond and rely on each other also the film seemed to glorify women as almost flawless individuals what i mean by flawless is that they did not suffer the consequences for their actions and were treated as if they had no imperfections an example of this is shortly after paula accidentally killed her father her mother immediately comes to her rescue and takes full responsibility for the act while paula seems to suffer almost no remorse for what she has done again another example of this is when each daughter or granddaughter has had an opportunity to reunite with their supposed dead mother grandmother knowing the stresses that this has most likely caused in their family each one of them still embraces the mother without care for what she has is killing her husband and his lover in this light women are portrayed as ones who not only love each other independent of character acts but also ones who don't seem bothered in the least by the acts in which their friends family members perform br br another idea that i thought was intriguing of this culture was in regards to their idea of the supernatural with the death of and mother and her inexplicable return the director builds the audience's emotions to believe that this film is going to embody the supernatural the people depicted in this culture seem very supernatural that is to say very eager to believe that life exists beyond the grave their aunt long time friend the prostitute and other people living in the city of la mancha all believe the rumors of the dead coming back to family members to finish the unfinished business i believed this was a mixed reflection of the culture's religious faith predominantly catholic as well as their need to make amends with those who had no chance to be forgiven during mortality the belief they held in regards to the dead being alive was also to give hope to the destitute circumstances they suffered in mortality when the viewer is exposed to the fact that this film isn't supernatural at all it's interesting to observe the role the mother continues to play she's treated as if she still is a ghost i e hiding in small crevices underneath the bed or inside a car trunk i believe the director portrayed the mother this way to heighten the already existent supernatural beliefs the city had adopted the mother's character seemed to be a metaphor for the city's long held belief in life after death
<START> only if you are crazy about amber smith should you see this besides her body there is pretty much nothing in terms of cinematic value she even has a lesbian scene in this one my guess is she is trying to into those late night scream queens ala shannon tweed and julie strain
<START> i don't know whether this film hits my heart the way it does because of the feelings of friendship love closeness to others or the warmth of that transformation babette's cooking creates but when the feast starts and for the rest of the movie i choke up often br br yes this is a feel good movie but without a speck of or facile sentimentality please note that elements of the plot are discussed babette's feast tells its story with restraint and care and it lets us discover for ourselves the values of grace and love all we need to know is that babette stephane was a french refugee who was given shelter by two aging sisters in a tiny community on the coast of jutland the sisters lead what remains of their father's flock he was a pastor of conviction who taught that salvation comes through self denial the sisters made their sacrifices to duty and faith those who still remain honor the now long dead pastor's teachings and his spiritual guidance still as they have grown older the tiny community has become querulous and argumentative the sisters do what they can for the pastor's 100th birthday babette wishes to cook the dinner for the small group the sisters will invite the sisters reluctantly agree but when they see the supplies babette has ordered they and their guests become uneasy they are used to the community's usual fare of dried cod boiled and a soup made of bread water and a little ale even though babette over time has made improvements what they are seeing now seems close to at the dinner also will be a visitor general lorens who years earlier had chosen ambition over his love for one of the sisters br br what do we experience there is the austerity of the aging community's faith and the stone wind swept cottages they live in there is the warmth by candlelight of the sisters' small crowded dining room and then there is the transforming power of babette's artistry as we watch her cook watch erik a young boy helping her serve and pour and watch the old parishioners with the help of fine wine and exquisite cooking gradually rediscover their community and love and friendship the general serves as our unexpected guide because he is the only one who knows what extraordinary dishes they are eating the general tells a story to his uncomprehending dinner companions a story about a famed woman who was the exemplary chef at the famed cafÃ© in paris this woman this head chef had the ability to transform a dinner into a kind of love affair a love affair that made no distinction between bodily appetite and spiritual appetite he too is being transformed into a man who will accept what he has become and yet will always know the value and the love of what long ago he chose not to accept an old couple kiss two old men remember past friendships and babette who spent all that she had won in a lottery on this dinner has had an opportunity to be the artist she once was in france an opportunity she accepted with love and friendship br br babette now as poor as she was when she arrived penniless years earlier will continue with the sisters the general in a carriage with his aunt returns to her estate and the elderly guests leave the sisters' home to return to their own cottages they pause and look at the clear night sky and the stars overhead they spontaneously hold hands in a circle and dance and sing this hymn br br the clock strikes and time goes by eternity is nigh let us use this time to try to serve the lord with heart and mind so that our true home we shall find so that our true home we shall find br br they smile at each other all has been reconciled br br babette's feast is a wonderful movie full of restrained emotion unspoken understandings wisdom and of course a meal that will leave you with a growling stomach as you exit the theater if you win a lottery so you could afford what babette created and have her skill and artistry here's what she served br br a la a rich turtle soup served with amontillado sherry au caviar small buckwheat pancakes with sour cream and caviar served with champagne en with sauce boned stuffed with gras and truffle in puff pastry with truffle sauce enriched with madeira served with de a fine burgundy cheese and fresh fruit baba au with fruit and fresh coffee and a fine brandy
<START> in retrospect the 1970s was a golden era for the american cinema as demonstrated and explored by this documentary directed by ted demme and richard lagravenese this ifc effort serves to illustrate and clarify the main idea of what that time meant for the careers of these illustrious people seen in the documentary br br the amazing body of work that remains is a legacy to all the people involved in the art of making movies in that period the decade was marked by the end of the viet nam war and the turbulent finale of those years of jimmy carter's presidency br br one thing comes out clear films today don't measure against the movies that came out during that creative decade because the industry as a whole has changed dramatically the big studios nowadays want to go to tame pictures that will be instant hits without any consideration to content or integrity as long as the bottom line shows millions of dollars in revenues br br the other thing that emerges after hearing some of america's best creative minds speak is the importance of the independent film spirit because it is about the only thing that afford its creators great moral and artistic rewards br br this documentary is a must see for all movie fans
<START> this movie is not the scariest of all time but it is a great example of a campy eighties horror flick low budget no stars lots of inventive death scenes and enough nudity to keep the teenagers in their seats the premise is interesting and fun and the three evil kids play their parts well a nice starting point for just say julie brown exposing her talents early in her career this film won't be seen by many but for fans of 80's horror it's a must
<START> it is a very great film documentary about istanbul and their people and it's music of every kind editing and the success of the director is very impressive i've been interested with faith akin since i saw the gegen die wand head on 305 and i admired his work very much but this one has been the most touching one for me so i'm here writing this it is not just about turks or something like that it is a very good biography of a city and how music stay alive in it we can say there are views of many people and so very variant ideas about even life and love i liked it very much and i thing anyone and everyone should see it not only but especially the ones anyhow related with turkey
<START> possible spoilers br br no one is likely to pick up a dvd of red dust without knowing that it is about south africa's truth and reconciliation commission hilary swank stars as a south african exile who returns to her home town as a lawyer representing alex a member of the south african parliament who was tortured by a prison guard pete muller ian roberts who is seeking to escape prison by testifying before the truth and reconciliation commission they could certainly have found an actress who has or could imitate a south african accent ms swank makes no attempt whatsoever to cover her unmistakably american accent nevertheless she is the only well known actor in the movie and it would probably not have been made without her or someone equally well known she does a passable job however and muller pronounced in the german way with an over the u are outstanding as is jamie as the chief of police responsible for murdering comrade and fellow prisoner the torture scenes are shown in brief flashes but they are vivid and believable what is not believable is the truth and reconciliation process except that it actually happened red dust should be seen for that reason alone because it was and is unbelievable that the anc prisoners could actually forgive the torturers and this is as close as we are likely to get to seeing the process in action
<START> i agree with vince this movie paved the way for goodfellas the scene where pesci was throwing peanuts at the piano player reminded me of his how am i funny routine in goodfellas this is a highly underrated film and deserves some attention as with many other mob films the theme of the death collector rings true always respect the don
<START> i'm from phoenix city and the first time i saw this movie and read the book it only confirmed the stories i had heard all of my life i asked my grandfather about the mob and he told me that when he got back from fighting in the pacific theatre he started up a firm that is know the largest in the columbus area when he was just starting out he was asked by the mob to do financial work for them but he said that he gently declined even when the fbi and army came through phoenix city and cleaned it up my grandfather wouldn't take it lightly when my mom aunt or uncle went across the river but i assure you all of that is over now the downtown area of phoenix city is in need of restoration and it has slums by the courthouse where all of the shooting still occasionally takes place over angry uneducated low socio economic people and the 14th street phoenix eagle bridge has been shut down for a solid 15 years and replaced by a newer 13th street bridge but on the more fair side of phoenix city on summerville rd it is very quaint and the scenery depressing br br another incident was told to me by my best friend's family from high school that lives in a nothing spot on hwy 165 called holy trinity alabama which is about 28 minutes outside of columbus ga my best friend in high school's uncle was a man that went by the name of old man davis regardless of how the movie goes that fact is that there were 3 bosses and old man davis was one of them you can even read about him in the original book legend has it that he was so cold blooded that he went to downtown phoenix city to make a deal with a man but apparently the man backed out on the deal right in front of old man davis so the old man davis proceeded to take a sawed off shotgun out of his coat and shoot the man in the chest in the middle of town by the courthouse they say he even walked off nonchalantly because the mob had paid off every law enforcement official in town so he had nothing to worry about br br another incident is about a bridge that another one of my friends owns a rental house next to in downtown phoenix city it is the same bridge that the mob killed and threw a black man off of and you can even read that part in the book i also would like to as that in many columbus and phoenix city civilians were asked to be extras in the movie when the friend is murdered and brought to trial and proved guilty in front of the judge but still set free well the judge is my fathers partner in his law firm in columbus who is deceased
<START> this is the first american film i have seen at this year and i think it will be the greatest one because of the feeling as a teenage singer in america aaron is not as pop as before most americans i met said his song is fake and that he even didn't know how to rap but attention everyone he is a kid how many people can understand him being a pop fan is difficult and being a pop star is more difficult i think this time aaron jd has shows something real to us and i think people should learn to understand each other at another hand i like the music in the film very much i remember the first song appeared in the film is saturday night and it also include some aaron's real live show and the second one is one better so i think if you enjoy this film maybe you'll be a pop fan too at last i hope you will have a great time a voice from a chinese boy
<START> this film is the most traumatising and painful horror film i have ever seen in my life to know that this film is based on a true story and watching jeffrey dahmer carl crew brutally murder his victims is enough to bring a tear to my eye i admit this was a low budget film with not the best dialogue however it explained why jeffrey dahmer was a maniac as he was so selfishly inwardly emotional his emotions and selfishness went so far deep into his brain that it resulted into him becoming a murderer every person that he lured back to his apartment he was attracted to and had feelings for and the reasons why he murdered them wasn't only for the thrill of killing them but because he couldn't cope with the fact of them leaving him in the scene when he killed his first victim by bashing an object at the back of the guys head from what i noticed wasn't because he wanted to kill him but because he was devastated with the idea of the guy leaving him it was from thereafter that he got use to the homicidal behaviour and made killing his hobby for both evil and emotional reasons br br the scene when he was talking while crying on the phone with his mother and telling her how much he loved her and the love he showed to his grandmother and how he didn't want to move out of her house did show that he did have love in his heart one scene that i found quite spooky and strange was when a priest overheard jeffrey in a pub inviting a guy back to his apartment and then phoned jeffrey up in a phone booth within the pub so that the guy would lose patience and change his mind on going home with jeffrey when the guy left the pub the priest then hung up the phone and was was laughing at jeffrey i also found that carl crew played a remarkable acting performance as the role of jeffrey dahmer his evil and cold blooded facial expressions before he massacred his victims were so real i was shivering in my seat his facial expressions reminded me of the way vincent d'onofrio private pyle leonard in the film 'full metal jacket' looked just before he gunned down the general in the toilet barracks br br if your an emotional person i wouldn't recommend you to watch this film but if your not than go ahead and watch it
<START> what a movie it has undeniably entertaining subject matter unless you're a prude and a mature funny and complex script from paul thomas anderson magnolia hard eight pt anderson will undoubtably be around for some time the evidence is here in this epic and ambitious masterpiece every character is expertly played and touching and fully shaped from burt reynolds as jack horner the director to julianne moore his movie star and mark whalberg as dirk diggler they all are fabulous and the story wow honest look at business and failure and consequences and family one of the best movies of all time i give it a a
<START> the best batman movie of the 90's no doubt about it this movie takes place in a city filled with insecurity and nightmares br br although the villains are somewhat cheesy they fit perfect for the movie's tone of colorful but nightmarish cinematography br br the performances are really great and the comic tone behind them really delivers expectations br br don't get fooled by the cheesy outfits this is a movie in the pure style of burton that can't be described burton is a sui generis director that took the batman franchise to another obscure level but not forgetting about it's comic style past br br recommended for fans of action cinema and best of all if it deals with super heroes
<START> awwww i just love this movie to bits me and my cousins enjoy this movie a lot and i am just such a huge fan i hope they bring the tv series out on dvd soon come to mention it i have not see the tv show in a long time such times where i come from australia the chipmunk adventure is only known by people in their late teens and adult years which is kinda sad because the young kids don't know what there missing br br the songs in this film are ace the ones i love the most boys girls of rock n'roll diamond dolls and the song that ls sure to make you want to cry my mother br br this film is sure to excite both young and old get the chipmunk adventure today 10 out of 10 such an excellent movie
<START> it's the single unfunniest thing i ever watched it's sad how he tries so hard to come up with a good joke and all he does is curse and thinks his disgusting vulgarity is funny he is the most bitter person i ever saw his whole act he is trying to show how much he doesn't care and by that only showing how much he's angry at the critics and the people with any taste and sense of humor who'd rather go through immense torture than go watch his show there are good comedians there are bad ones and there are horrible ones but this guy is in a league of his own i feel sorry for him and even more for the people who find him funny
