<START> ok so i'm not usually one that runs out and rents foreign movies especially foreign dark comedies i think i can count on one hand the number of films that i found genuinely hilarious from beginning to end this movie will be added to the short list even dark comedies right out of hollywood sometimes turn me off because they require an incredibly dry sense of humor but this one had my eyes welling up with tears my sides hurt i haven't laughed that hard in a long time this movie was recommended by my mother and i don't think i would have even dreamed of watching it had she not raved about it don't be afraid of having to read during your movie you'll miss out on a hilariously well acted flick
<START> the prior comments are way to generous this movie is a waste of electricity and plastic on the other hand i have had a great deal of fun giving it to friends to watch and describing it beforehand as beyond belief no words can express how i feel about this this movie will move you as expected the friends took these nondescript comments as enthusiastic endorsements they were wrong the sadistic pleasure i had foisting this on people was well worth the 5 i paid for the movie on the other hand one former friend says i owe him 90 minutes of his life back i particularly enjoyed the gun's eye view of parts of the movie truly awesome in it's absurdity
<START> i must have seen this on the television when it was first broadcast some decades ago i thought it was brilliant then and as i remember so much of it now i may have been right while i have lived in and around london i cannot call myself a londoner and do not know it at all well who does other than taxi drivers once the viewer understands the premise that here is a group of men trying to learn the seemingly unlearn able and rise to the status of demigods then the rest is sheer joy the characters are well contrasted their family relationships are equally diverse and so differently affected by the events of the film don't think this is a documentary it is pure drama and the knowledge is one of the characters i have never seen anything like this film before or since watch it
<START> more and more french cinema demonstrates that's the only one able to confront hollywood's and to spend high amounts on money in their movies if bon voyage had been made in the usa no one would be surprised perfectly set in france in the 40's when the nazi invasion technically irreproachable and with some of the most international french actors depardieu adjani ledoyen bon voyage centerers on two parallel stories an scientific and his disciple ledoyen who tries to hide one of his discoveries a kind of water that may work as an atomic bomb from the nazis and a poor guy in love with a well known actress adjani which ends up in prison accused of a crime he's not committed in order to protect her br br bon voyage seems to have been made in the old style without unnecessary camera movements and effects without big turns in the plot as i said before regarding to the production itself they've made a great job but the main problem with this movie is about the script is it a spy movie a romantic comedy a spy comedy a comedy of intrigue it's not clear that makes bon voyage a little unbalanced when you think you're watching a comedy suddenly changes to another story line a more dramatic one more slow i think they should've focused in one of the lines of argument the one about the spy plot and left the romantic parts in the background br br my rate 6 5 10
<START> ok i would give this a 1 but i'm gonna give it a two because i laughed while watching this film first of all i can make a much better movie than this one in a week the special effects made this film look like a joke one shouldn't make such films with horrible special effects because then people won't take it seriously the acting and direction was also horrible the screenplay had many plot holes and the whole film wasn't believable at all this has to be the worst indian film ever the songs were also bad the acting was bad and artificial need i say more don't watch this movie unless you are curious to see how bad it is that's why i watched it i am going into film and i wanted to see how bad a bad film can get trust me i watched one of the worst films in history if not the worst film
<START> this little flick is reminiscent of several other movies but manages to keep its own style mood troll don't be afraid of the dark come to mind the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg i especially liked the non cliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections if you want a movie that's not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice
<START> this movie has been done before it is basically a unoriginal combo of napoleon dynamite and sordid lives there are some funny bits but otherwise it is a clichÃ© bore it is a good first film attempt and the director who also stars in and wrote the feature shows a lot of promise but the writing was kind of choppy and the story was not very original i swear i had heard some of the lines in other films however the acting was very good and the film was shot in an interesting way it is also refreshing to see gay themed movies not be so bogged down with political correctness and tired stories of angst the main character seemed fairly well adjusted for a gay teen in rural texas so no saccharine coming out drama here
<START> this horror tale takes place in the desert of africa a canadian systems analyst zach scott is sent on an assignment for a diamond mining company although he hates field work he finds himself in a truck with a rescue unit in the open desert fighting sand flies and whipping blowing sand four diamond prospectors are found well whats left of their scattered bones are discovered during a long cold desert night a shape shifting monster makes its appearance zach and his colleagues are terrified when their truck is stranded and members of the unit are dying horribly one by one there is no character development let alone dialogue to speak of the desert set in its own way is beautiful and without giving anything away the creature is as old as the desert sands also in the cast are rachel shelley warrick grier and patrick
<START> what attracts a man to military service what prepares a man to survive brutal torture as a prisoner of war what desperation leads to the planning and execution of an escape into the jungles of southeast asia how does he cope with the ghosts and memories he returns home with herzog tries to answer these questions in his documentary of dieter german and u s navy pilot shot down over in 1966 who was taken prisoner tortured and starved but ultimately escaped to be haunted by the experience for the rest of his life a powerful and personal first hand account of the man his life and experience recounted through the integration of interviews archival footage and new footage you will never forget this story or this man
<START> i didn't have very high expectations about just before dawn i don't know why i keep buying these slasher movies when i know it's all the same every time maybe i'm a bit masochistic anyway i'm glad i bought this one yes it's all the same no it has nothing original yes it's about a little group of teenagers going in the woods to camp drink and have sex yes they get killed one by one by a maniac and you know what it's just magic it's one of the best experiences i had watching a slasher movie the places where it's shot are so wonderful you see mountains waterfalls rockies it's just amazing it takes a very long time except for the opening scene before the killer starts killing but i didn't care it was enjoyable to watch enough not to care what i mean is you won't be sitting there waiting for the murders to start because every thing that happens is enjoyable because of the beauty of the film itself the ending is a bit weird but i won't tell you anything more about it you'll know what i mean another thing i enjoyed you care about the characters they're not just a bunch of jerks who spend their time bitching each other sure they are pure stereotypes of usual slasher characters but there's something special about them anyway it's a great horror movie and i hope you have a pretty good time watching it because i really did
<START> with what they had john and carolyn were very private so the writers had to put together what they could i really liked de rossi as carolyn but jacqueline voice grated on my nerves she should have used her regular voice i would have preferred that the whole movie focus on john and carolyn instead of rehashing stuff we already know about john
<START> if you have not seen this late 80s film about the the washington bureau of a network news station than i highly recommend it it is a sad commentary on the direction of news reporting in this country but tells the story with wit the characters are well developed and albert brooks performance is fabulous he delivers all his lines with entertaining understated comedy i am not an albert brooks fan at all so this was a welcome surprise i have a friend who works as a producer for a local news station and he advised that this is close to reality so kudos to the films writer and director for doing their research br br fun movie with a lot of insight into the world of network news it is not nearly as dark as another movie i also recommend in the same genre
<START> first of all no one with any law enforcement experience not er or but real law enforcement takes this show seriously walker would be drummed out of any police force in the us for his illegal and totally unprofessional tactics on top of that he is a comic book character no acting ability incredibly trite lines no character development the fact that alex cahill loves him shows just how dumb blondes really are and is the ultimate clown in black face come on if you think walker is a heartfelt show without bias then explain why jt is treated as a dolt always is the subject of walker's jokes never is allowed to be the one to solve the crime and never rescues walker who should be dead 50 times over for the stupid things he does while it may be true that many criminals are even dumber than the detectives who go after them and believe me most cops are dumber than dirt the smart ones walker comes up against never seem to get the point that once walker is captured the jerk needs to be put of his misery but then again norris produced the show as well as starred in it so how could he willingly get rid of himself or even show how stupid his tactics are as if six guys are going to wait around to take him one at a time what a terrible series it is more demeaning than any of the hokey westerns like the lone ranger roy rogers the cisco kid and wild bill hickock though i would imagine that most of you on here are far too young to remember those shows but like those shows in the same way as those shows walker tr is just as insulting and just plain silly
<START> i'd never heard of this film before i caught it on the telly last night i do hope it was never given a cinema release as this would be an insult to the silver screen and movie goers alike br br was it supposed to be serious was it supposed to be funny why the outrageously basic plot does anyone actually care br br awful film br br 2 10
<START> very enjoyable 50's western i have it in my collection and recommend it to western fans br br mostly victor mature's movie and quite well done in my estimation br br he's a trapper who joins a frontier post as a scout red cloud caught three of them on their land and took their possessions they all joined as scouts after their loss br br victor has set his eye's on the colonel's wife and lives life on the post without much regards to regulations br br action done quite convincingly but no great depth or much feeling to other characters br br 50's westerns are my favorites and this slides easily to a satisfaction a western of this kind is in the pages of the past and perhaps never to be made much again one to enjoy gave it a 7 rating likely 6 8 worthy but films like these become more precious over time br br for film noir fans the big steal they live by night side street are most wonderful movies to be enjoyed bought and viewed noir seems to resemble westerns in a way some long ago and never forever
