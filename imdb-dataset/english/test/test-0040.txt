<START> terrible absolutely terrible long confusing and unrewarding after about three hours of this painful mess the ending truly is the final nail in the coffin not even the magnificent sexy beautiful goddess francesca annis can save this poor adaptation of agatha christie's work the plot drags and drags and time goes by slowly and suddenly you realize that you don't even have any idea of what's going on anymore by the end even with the usual explanation by the villain there's still a lot that's left unexplained and thenÂ it's over a complete waste of time and without a doubt one of the worst to bear the name of agatha christie
<START> where to start with the true story of richard speck a killer of eight nurses in the 1960s director keith has worked on a few of the extremely low budget full moon releasing movies such as birth rite and here works from a script by at the time full moon regular don adams whilst the film seems like a accurate portrayal of the horrendous crime the script isn't great perhaps because the real ramblings were not terribly interesting despite the care that has been taken to make this authentic it wreaks of a cheap cash in of the acclaimed cinematic serial killer movies of the same period such as 'ed filmed in a dirty brown not quite sepia for the most part and narrated by star doug cole the film fails to present the horror of the crime because the narration is irritating the colouring distracting from the story and the crime though gruesome and upsetting to watch is merely that and no editorial work seems to have occurred on what is pretty much a very poor quality camcorder viewing on the events there is no examination of the motivation or of life really just a cheap shot at a gruesome crime released by full moon there is little evidence of full moon's better output here charles band ignoring his own rule that his films feature fantasy killings e g dolls monsters and so on and not quite knowing what to do with this new reality incidentally band introduced a special label for these films called entertainment' band has said that he regrets the period of full moon output alongside tempe entertainment whose creator j r and regular danny also speak very badly of charles band the tempe era features uniform apple mac editing and brutal hand held camera filming very much like a home movie speck retains these qualities and whereas 3 for example managed to use these well speck is merely boring and gross
<START> what a sad surprise br br being a die hard fan of the original series starring don adams i was really looking forward to this poor fool me this is sillier and more brain dead than a monkey's bottom br br to say it was bad would be a severe understatement it is was the worst movie well first 30 minutes of one i have seen for a long time i couldn't stand more than the first half hour preferring to watch my hard drive de fragment br br i can tolerate bad bad is o k sometimes even cute but up with contrived hollywood crap and this has to be the worst in many years i will not put this movie is a gross insult to the collective intelligence of humanity my five year old daughter could have written better and she is not even i'm really tempted to try watching the rest of it but i'm afraid i have better things to do like making pizza dough and watching it rise br br what a sad disappointment no i'm off what a swindle as mel once said piece of shirt
<START> chick flick of course been done before many times predictable yes worth watching you bet i was delighted with sarandon and portman's portrayals of otherwise stock characters in a familiar story line i am a great fan of mother daughter stories what makes the difference between the good ones and the weak ones are the performances and the character development although this is not the best of its genre i will buy it and watch it again i felt the characters were believable and the acting was superior
<START> milla stands out in this movie because of her personal sense of style and the way the clothes hang on her i have learned to hate that crumpled little three year old face she makes whenever she pretends to cry it makes any points she is trying to make as a serious actress drop off quickly of course in a movie with a baldwin and denise she still shines as a mature actor person david seemed to be doing woody allen by way of howdy doody not a single word or gesture in the entire movie seemed sincere or even sincerely acted how harry met sally and two weddings and funeral even sleepless in seattle had scripts locations and actors the script seemed to be a string of bad and crude gags separated by a lot of talking the locations seemed to be within a few blocks of each other there are only two actors in this of an indie flick milla and the lady who played the chick who was into the stars i watched most of this through the first time with the sound off just watching milla that gag was old the first time i saw it and it's a silly rip off of a song in how to succeed in business without really trying
<START> a very bad film an amalgam of clichÃ©s and historical inaccuracies a few examples in an early scene soviet infantry are attacked by the germans instead of staying in their trenches to shoot at them they advance into open ground to fight them contrary to all infantry tactics kate one of the central characters is supposedly the daughter of a white russian and obsessed with her russianness yet she does not speak russian a guilt stricken german airman attacks an anti aircraft gun the gun however does not fire shells but scores a direct hit on his which doesn't look much like a german of wwii in fairness when they could escape the preposterous plot and the consequent absurdities there are some genuinely powerful moments the depiction of people slowly starving to death is convincingly done and moving but these only show up the rest of it even more a film to be avoided
<START> this is the absolutely worst show in the history of nickelodeon first of all no boarding school has a sushi bar flat screen tvs and gives every student a laptop this makes the show so unrealistic and boring the plots are pointless and incredibly boring the actors are so bad it makes me want to take my own life i really hate the fact that in the show zoey is the most popular girl in school and the prettiest and smartest and gets the best grades without doing any work she never has any real problems and every guy wants to date her she is so perfect there isn't anyone like that also i hate that everyone would do anything for her and everyone picks her for every team or club it is so annoying quinn is so obnoxious her experiments are pathetic pointless and fake chase is such a wimp he says he loves zoey but if he told her it would ruin their friendship how pathetic michael tries to be funny but he never accomplishes anything nichole is so perky and screams a lot she is never seen doing any work or studying but she is a straight a student lola thinks she is an actress but she sucks excuse my language need i say more i think no for your own good stay away from this show at all costs
<START> i feel terribly sorry where the lubitsch pic was enchanting marvelous full of spirit and elegance this one here is only colored lana looks like 51 in fact she was 31 at that time but obviously depressive and tries to play a shy and dull girlie think of jeanette mcdonald who gave the role of the widow a double faced depth by playing with count that lana had to play an operetta although unable to sing crazy she only sings one song the title role of an lehar operetta that is really funny the only really good thing is the great waltz scene at the end glamorous and after watching this scene have a look at the introducing waltz scene in gentlemen prefer blondes any similarities
<START> the cell 2000 rating 8 10 br br the cell like antz must be watched twice to be appreciated the first time i saw this film i thought it was mediocre but the film had such a lasting impression on me after viewing i decided i had to rent it again i did and i found the film to be much more likeable the cell is not for everyone but it divides its stories up with quality and is a visually intelligent film that dreams up images and plot ideas that could not be matched the film's script can be clunky at times as can the acting but the visuals are ingenious and bring the engaging story to an exotic and intriguing life the oscar nominated makeup is also daring and careful while the beautiful costumes and utterly brilliant set decoration went unnoticed singh who has also directed music videos goes totally crazy with his direction and it results well he has major talent and this film has a lot of potential if you give it a chance overall the cell is a powerful disturbing and avoids being too tacky which makes it a great pleasurable watch
<START> the entire series not just the blue planet is nothing short of amazing the best nature series we have ever seen the episode on the deep is like traveling to outer space we have watched this with our 10 and 7 year old boys and all four of us have not been able to pull away we read a negative comment on this and could not believe it there is so much new information that we never learned in school its also the best view we have seen from any television or movie into the delicate balance of our earth's eco system the amount of time and effort put into capturing these shots is very much apparent when you sit down and watch this series br br a must see for everyone
<START> brilliant biographic br br well this certainly is one of my very fav biographic movie this movie came as a total surprise to me i had been avoiding this movie for a very very long time now that was because i am not a fan of jamie foxx i still am not a big fan of him but i sure am a fan now br br well he deserved every bit of that oscar his performance is one of the best performances i have seen in a long long time he is truly sensational br br well the narration or the flow of the story is brilliant for a biographical movie i am a drama fan so i wasn't bored at all br br i was way too much surprised to have being liking the movie so much that i did not see any flaws in the movie i think there isn't any flaw in the movie maybe some events errors but hey who cares br br the performance by the woman who plays ray's mother was also really good and well kerry washington Â she has so much potential if given the right role she might just be the next oscar winner br br well the story of them movie was so emotional so touching i i cried very br br i don't give a damn if the things were mad up or not cuz this movie mad me and that's a lot for me br br all in all a superb one of the very best of this century br br 10 10
<START> small spoilers i just bought the dvd of this movie yesterday i saw it with my friends and i couldn't believe what had happened br br in the first 3 movies the critters at least had a sense of humor especially the 3rd movie but not only did the critters barely ever make an appearance they weren't funny they never made me laugh i must admit that the story did start off nicely after an hour had gone by i remembered that the critters movies were always very short so i thought to myself where the are the critters they were barely in this movie if that didn't make me mad enough the boy named ethan was sitting on his bed after charlie had murdered the ship and he knew that the critters were still on board in the first movie the brown family was scared out of their minds but here ethan didn't even care it was as if the critters weren't even a threat br br now what i'm about to say next may ruin the ending but i'm going to say it anyways in the first movie at the end they had to face the giant critter for a final battle in the second one there was the great ball of critter in the third movie the critter with his fave burned did a from sonic the hedgehog and was going to attack the little kid but at the end of the fourth one which is what made me the the bald critter charges toward ethan and ethan kills it as if it were nothing br br now something that i really don't understand was what happened to ug he was one of my favorite characters in the first two then after 50 years he's evil that was very disappointing not only that but wasn't he a faceless bounty hunter why was he still johnny steele plus he seemed to have a different personality he seemed much smarter and not as monotone like in the first two br br being someone who actually enjoyed the first two critters movies and loved the third one i give critters 4 a 2 10
<START> i was actually looking forward to this movie the commercials made it look real cool and action packed and i heard that claire character was arrested for assault so i thought that maybe she would kick a lot of ass and that would be cool but their was hardly any action at all and the character were all kinda bland the only saving grace was omar epps and even he didn't help this movie much
<START> i love watching steven seagal movies not because of the action of the great plot holes but just because it makes me laugh br br oh it makes me laugh so hard this movie totally got no point and is ridiculous compared to this movie pearl harbor rocks and ben affleck need no acting school at all just to give a impression how bad it is br br first off all there so many goofs and bad acting its just getting worse like when steven is try to get out of jail a chopper lands at first the security notice and they led them land when they fly away all of the sudden a guard start shooting br br or when he killed that guy in the car he and both walk away you can't see no oil on the ground behind him steven notice that there is oil without even watching a lighter and the car blows up br br and there are plenty of more goofs steven uses his basic action when someone is pointing a gun at him he grabs it and shoot him totally bullshit like some gangster would let that ever happen br br the acting is also very worse at the fight scene in the jail outdoor place you can see steven clearly wait to come in action just rewind it a couple of time and you notice the bad acting br br its just makes me laugh i hope one day it comes to the cinema's here in holland then i'll go there with as many friends as possible just to laugh my self to death
<START> this was the next to last film appearance by jill ireland who died of cancer in 1990 after four decades as a well known actress and producer ireland made quite a few waves in the press when she dropped her then husband david mccallum in 1967 beginning her long relationship with charles bronson it is a great irony that bronson probably the all time leader in number of deaths rendered on screen had one of the most enduring marriages in film history br br seems to be a movie that was tucked into cannon's production schedule for the sake of bronson and ireland ireland was already suffering from cancer related illnesses in 1987 and you can almost picture the two actors wanting to do 'just one more for old times' sake ' is carelessly done as a whole showing the lack of polish and dwindling funds that would tank cannon by 1990 but there's a kind of nostalgia value in seeing the couple together one last time and the film makes you wonder what exactly helps a relationship to survive in the chaos that is hollywood br br bronson plays jay killian a high ranking secret service agent who is assigned to protect the first lady lara craig ireland the president's wife has a reputation for being difficult bossing service agents around and wanting to do things her own way that all changes however when attempts are made on her life and she must journey with killian by car train motorbike and believe it or not dune buggy to escape would be assassins there is little surprise here as killian believes the murderers are part of an inside job perhaps arranged by the president himself on the way killian and mrs craig develop an unspoken affection for one another in scenes between bronson and ireland that are actually very funny br br what really gets me is how this film was promoted upon its release and how it's still made to look as a dvd the original trailer gives you the feeling that is another cold hearted bronson shoot 'em up but a lot of this movie which was rated pg 13 by the way is in a comic vein putting it along the lines of a romantic thriller like bronson and ireland's western 'from noon till three ' even the dvd case shows bronson with a rocket launcher ready to blow things up which he does but to a lesser degree than his other '80s potboilers br br on the whole is late cannon slop work and doesn't really know what kind of film it wants to be besides drifting from actioner to romantic thriller and back again there are serious mistakes in continuity property values are bottom of the barrel cheap and the effects are dreadful many of the explosions seem like matte work rather than being done on location robert ragland who had shown good composing skills in earlier films teamed up with valentine mccallum on a score that is mostly synthesized and better fit for television br br richard sale's script has real of dialogue with the conversations between bronson and ireland the only bright spot there is no explanation as to why the first lady is called 'one all of a sudden nor as to why ireland is left with her british accent when the character is a wyoming native jan boyd playing main assistant has a kitten like personality and is badly miscast as a federal agent stephen elliott a former tony award nominee who died in may 2005 randy brooks erik stern as assassin bracken and michael senator bunsen are acceptable in their supporting roles br br incidentally this was the last film directing gig for peter hunt who broke onto the scene with 'on her majesty's secret service' in 1969 and collaborated with bronson and lee marvin on 'death hunt' in 1981 is available on dvd through mgm home entertainment it is presented in dual widescreen and standard format with three language subtitles and theatrical trailer br br out of 4
