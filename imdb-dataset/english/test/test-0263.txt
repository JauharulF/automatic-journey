<START> what a gas of a movie film noir has always been one of my favorite genres but this one stands apart from the rest only the big sleep out of the past murder my sweet and the killers can come close to this caper classic i know these four american films i mentioned are not caper movies per se but rather detective stories with complicated story lines which still exude a gritty quality about them similar to rififi br br what is different here is the way jules dassin sets into motion the total ambiance of the film not only in the gritty realism of the principals but also in the usage of the streets of paris as a subliminal character and co conspirator unto itself the movie centers around le a dark moody and complicated ex con getting pulled into one last shot at the hefty payoff even though he is an unsmiling and hard nosed tough guy one still senses in him a yearning for some kind of redemption by himself from the demons of his past hey he saved little toni dassin picked the right guy jean for that role br br that aside the rest of the story development kind of falls into place as we journey through the famous silent caper scene to the the eventual demise of the principal perps only their women survive except for ida mario's honey they seemed to best understand the underlying futility of it all
<START> i went to see with high expectations which might have influence on my opinion on it i have seen all of the dogme films and this is by far the worst the story intertwines with themes from shakespeare's play king lear but never succeeds in capturing the audience and making them care the directing of the actors is very loose even for dogme style movies and results in poor undefinable acting the story lacks any dynamics whatsoever and i lost interest very shortly there are some scenes in the film which are there to shock the viewer but i don't think they enhanced the story at all sang and are both that proved to be well directed and had good storylines so i shall look forward to better in the future perhaps an invisible man dogme 6 will prove to lift the quality again for he is like and s k a skilled and educated director
<START> therefore it is important to talk about the dvd release instead of just the film tales from the crapper is a film that only one studio in the world could deliver the one that has brought us innovative and original real independent films for 30 plus years now troma this is truly a very special film because it manages to be certainly not my favorite of the troma productions but released on a disc that because of what i just said is one of my most valued and favorite dvd's not only counting the countless troma discs i own but counting my entire collection of films the film itself is the result of an ill fated plan to produce a television series to be directed by a director who was trusted with a substantial amount of money especially for troma to make something wonderful and delivered a lot of unfinished and incomprehensible material before quitting or being fired i am not sure which at this moment in order to prevent having to shove a vast investment down the toilet lloyd kaufman and michael herz decided to get together a team of directors and actors and use the material as the backbone of one movie one movie that really consists of two in the nice old tales from the crypt anthology fashion hosted by the played by mr kaufman himself but as i said not quite my own favorite of all their movies that is greatly due to a weird sense of discipline at the various sets forgetting about the hard troma rule of no booze on the set which was discovered by a furious lloyd and other less respectable employees that troma had at the time of the filming of the added scenes all this made it all but impossible for mr kaufman to make a worthwhile product in the editing room but lloyd kaufman is a genius and with the troubled added scenes to an already misshapen start product he crafted not much less of a masterpiece the film itself is as good as circumstances would allow the most brilliant filmmaker to slice together and it is certainly highly entertaining totally confusing loaded with those elements that made troma great and certainly unique and one of a kind as a film itself though not as brilliant as many other troma productions the genius of independent cinema however made the dvd of this film so much more than a release of a film with some extra's the film is when push comes to shove actually only a part of the entire dvd that in its whole is a document of the difficult situation serious filmmakers find themselves in having to survive in a world that is monopolized by the few very big ones who don't really allow any other players on their market turf a document of the problems one has when trusting people to be on the level only to find out that freedom sometimes is something that is hard to live up to and realization that access to a movie budget when the boss is not around can corrupt even those who should really know better the brilliance of this dvd is that the film is not perfect and that lloyd knows it and doesn't want to make anyone think he believes it is the full length commentary is a show in itself as is often the case with mr audio commentaries mixing humor sneers at those who deserve it and highly interesting information for anyone interested in independent film making in such a fashion that watching the film again with this commentary straight after viewing it on its own merits is so interesting it is hard to stop the feature length documentary the thick brown line takes us behind the scenes at the various locations where lloyd visits the sets only to sometimes take over and make the most of what he finds there we see him somewhat disillusioned sometimes different from his appearances in other making of documents such as fart of darkness and apocalypse soon both to be found in the must own make your own damn movie box set br br the added scenes with james gunn who started his career at troma only to find success as a writer an now a director in hollywood and trey parker again someone to start out with a troma released work to later be a national hero with his south park series are entertaining and probably as is much else on this release a reason for obtaining this disc alone for anyone remotely interested in the work of these two characters loaded with much more than i could mention here including a second audio commentary this is one of the best troma dvd releases
<START> i was a schoolboy when i watched this film for the first time the next day i knew that all pupils of our form watched it and all were fascinated by the film as i was i think the same situation was in all forms of our school and in the whole soviet union later i watched it every time it was shown on tv and want to watch more i think that comparison with back to the future or other sci fi films is not appropriate is unique in many ways once you have watched it you never forget it br br this film is full of belief in peaceful science achievements full of belief in the beautiful future of our world it's not only the film but also a forecast of many scientific inventions and achievements the time shown in the film is the year 1984 the year of its creation and the year where a schoolboy kolya has traveled for some time and where his friend was from the year now is 2005 many inventions and achievements predicted in the film are not realized yet such as a device which can read thoughts of any animal and human to venus and mars as easy as going for a picnic in the weekend creating and launching of the satellites as a homework for pupils easy to drive flying machines which completely replaced automobiles historical identification of any kind of material or creature performed in a couple of minutes and many others meanwhile some of them nowadays became much more realistic than they seemed in 1984 just wait for br br the film also depicts typical russian schoolboys and schoolgirls and does it so naturally with their inventiveness curiosity humour look for example at you could find such character in nearly all forms of every school of the soviet union similar character was in my form too i myself as well as many my classmates fell in love at first sight with her by the way later an actress who played became a scientist i think she was as much influenced by the film as people who watched it on tv br br beautiful idea beautiful realization beautiful actors beautiful music beautiful song the wonderful far away beautiful beautiful beautiful br br the last thing i want to say is that different remakes and new versions of the song from the film and even the film itself were made later and spread on tv and in the internet all they are not even comparable with the original i should not even comment them my comment is only about the original so request the original and enjoy it
<START> i have never seen a more unrealistic movie than this foul piece of dung the acting was over the top the direction was tacky and amateurish the script was just a joke the story looked penned by a person that has never been around a high school football game much less a professional game and why why did oliver stone feel the need to place himself in this movie as an actor he was terrible playing the most unrealistic announcer ever he could not even get hired to do professional wrestling contests then you have jamie foxx who throws like a girl but he is a tad more athletic than the aged dennis quaid seriously stone wanted to direct this film at 16 year old males with add that is why we hear the loud music the quick cuts and numerous edits it just became a bad mtv video shame on al pacino for doing this crap cameron diaz heck that no talent takes any role that comes down the pike when lawrence taylor is the best actor you got going well your movie sucks and this one does
<START> the movie is a starter to what really happened in city i'm a grandchild of the people who really lived the story the truth never has come out to my knowledge i have tried to find the whole story out but the people who lived it are still scared to tell it city is still run by crooked people albert patterson was not quite the saint the story wants you to believe the story was filmed in city it still has some of the famous sites in it that you see in the movie the funeral home still looks exactly the same but if you are wanting the real history of sin city you have to visit us and find people willing to tell you about ma and her kindness she didn't get the name ma for nothing
<START> the makers ask for a huge suspension of disbelief you grant them it in the hope that given a little time they'll convince you it's possible alas with tv movies it seems as though they specifically set out to make cheap cosmo questionnaire films with a small budget and big claims you should spend every penny on the details to convince the audience not here though the film gets a few points for the good performance the two leading ladies give against the odds but unfortunately it's not enough to save the day oh and the less said about the ending the better happy film viewing everyone
<START> i actually caught an ad for japan sinks in a japanese magazine last year and wondered what the heck it was until i saw the trailer for the film it was then i remembered that i had seen the english translation of novel some years back i got it and it was quite good as well as chillingly realistic it's enough to make the reader dread hearing any news about earthquakes in japan br br now i've read the book and seen this 2006 movie version the first movie came out in 1973 and you know what i thought the movie was quite good even if there are major changes from novel to film but that's understandable the story is simple a major shift will cause japan to sink within a year massive earthquakes volcanic eruptions and rock the country as frantic efforts are made to evacuate as many people as possible one scientist has a plan that could stop the sinking of the country and save what's left of the landmass but can it be implemented in time i saw japan sinks at otakon 2007 and while there were a couple of problems i had with it it does run a bit too long and a couple of the character moments were a little too sappy i was nonetheless blown away the sheer concept of an entire nation sinking into the sea was made terrifyingly real and the effects were some of the best i've ever seen rivaling anything that hollywood has done the film also plays no favorites with the main characters with some not making it to the closing credits br br frankly i've been surprised by some of the negative comments made about this film difference of opinions i guess personally i enjoyed it and i've read the original book
<START> aya if you are looking for special effects that are 10 20 years before its time this is it the glowing lightning bolts fireballs etc look like they came from a cheesy 70's sci fi flick and yes hercules really grows he's not being pushed on a cart closer to the camera
<START> otto preminger's and bess stands to date as a great american musical i believe it is time bring this film out onto vhs and dvd for countless generations to view admire and absorb its wonderful music
<START> carole lombard and james stewart gamely try to inject some life and meaning into this bizarrely constructed film about the tribulations of a newlywed couple the scenes play as if they were parceled out among various directors each with a different goal some are capra cute some screwball some melodramatic and some surprisingly noir there's even an extended adventure sequence when the plot suddenly focuses on a small plane flying through a blizzard it's hard to say which scenes are the most incongruous when the film as a whole is so erratic in tone and the storyline not exactly believable only worth watching for film students or fans of the actors some smaller parts such as judge doolittle and the intrepid pilot are also very well played
<START> somehow this film burrowed it's way into the soft spot of my heart don't ask me how it happened but i suppose having the film feature ed i'll sponsor anything mcmahon as a tail chasing crack hustler had a bit to do with it br br frankly i was disappointed with first outing in 1972 nothing more than a quick throw together to follow shaft mania how does the sequel get away from this big jim brown seems stronger as slaughter here than in the first perhaps this is due to the fact that one year later he had something to work from instead of his simple be like shaft motivation before br br the most outstanding part about the film is the soundtrack provided by pimp daddy number one james brown almost every scene is graced with a touch of funk by the godfather an excellent period film for the music wardrobe vehicles lingo and hair i should also point out this film is also an excellent period film to represent a time in motion picture history when jim brown and ed mcmahon could actually grow hair br br double the chicks double the blow triple the body count and factor in ed mcmahon and james brown you'll be in for one hell of a 70s action flick and one that outshines it's predecessor no less for my money big rip off can play ball with any blaxploitation film ever made even shaft chances are you'll disagree but big rip off has it's own distinct feel something the original was lacking
<START> another masterpiece that needs a dvd release but some libraries have the vhs and well worth seeking out just a brilliant play about many things foremost being euthanasia respectability religion and fundamental human relationships the script effectively uses intelligent humor not only to cope with an issue like a severely disabled child but to bind the parents in their love for jo and each other as the couple alan bates and janet are perfectly matched both in acting virtuosity and in bringing their deep intelligent characters to life br br i've recently seen bates' brilliant performance in which was released as a film a couple years after joe egg and he plays a teacher in both cynical intellectual and funny although is much darker than his character of here if you throw in such great performances in the go between women in love whistle down the wind the caretaker and georgy girl not to mention the more obvious king of hearts and zorba the greek and i'd say that alan bates had a career comparable to peter o'toole albert finney and the other great british actors of his era br br director peter medak also had one of my all time favorites the ruling class released the same year 1972 as joe egg which comprises a career year in anybody's book he's had kind of a spotty filmography the was another highlight but these two gems will mark him as a great director
<START> i was never all that impressed by night gallery but this one episode stands out br br a tv network executive auditions an odd act a young nerdy boy who proceeds to make the exec dismisses the whole thing as a flaky waste of time until both predictions come true the next morning br br what first seemed a parlor act becomes a hit show as the kid's predictions prove consistently accurate br br then one day he refuses to do the show facing imminent showtime everyone's at wit's end even threatening him with legal action if he doesn't fulfill his contract and make his daily predictions br br the young boy relents and foretells a seemingly utopian tomorrow br br after the show the befuddled executive asks for an explanation only to learn why the complete truth is too terrifying to reveal
<START> after 15 minutes watching the movie i was asking myself what to do leave the theater sleep or try to keep watching the movie to see if there was anything worth i finally watched the movie what a waste of time maybe i am not a 5 years old kid anymore
