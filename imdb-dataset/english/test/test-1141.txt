<START> skip all the subjective this is a great film reviews and read the imdb trailer or the back the kino which includes both versions of this flick which i'll paraphrase to the tune of sci fi score by george antheil the camera goes on a sleepwalk through b movie hell all photographed by will thompson who did 'plan 9 from outer space' 'maniac' you don't know whether to laugh at the film or with it so if you like self produced b or c grade noir wannabe actors and effects with pretensions of surrealism this could be for you otherwise get a copy of a modern low budget expressionist masterpiece
<START> this movie is an evolutionary piece from terminator to robocop br br stan winston did the br br in this film a scientist working in a sinister robotics company with a really creepy boss they always are gets is killed by them in a horrible lab explosion and has his brain placed inside an indestructible robot body br br the rest of this movie goes on with a romance angle as this cyborg man regains consciousness and wreaks havoc while trying to communicate with his wife played by the gorgeous back then in 1986 terri austin he tries to reconnect with his old life like in that scene in robocop br br the rest of this movie is about breaking things while trying to defeat the evil his evil boss from recapturing him for some ill defined humans into project br br this film pays homage to previous movies like the day the earth stood still as the cyborg breaks free like the giant robot does br br except for the 'frankenstein designed by stan winston this movie's production values are typically canadian sleazy br br pam grier stars in this film as an hired killer commando a cheap role of the likes she was doing so much of during the 80's br br as for a sci fi horror b movie out of 4 stars this film ranks about a 3
<START> the thing is a milestone in movie making and remains one of my favourite films of all time despite the film's roots in science fiction it is ultimately a horror film that brilliantly balances splatter with psychological trauma today over twenty five years after its release the special effects stand up as an example of sheer brilliance and effects man rob bottin suffered a complete physical breakdown for his art it would be impossible to make the same movie today as the studio would most certainly insist on casting a female character or a paul walker type br br an all male american science team in antarctica are thrown into turmoil when an alien able to perfectly absorb and imitate other lifeforms infiltrates their camp their trust in each other steadily crumbles as they become increasingly unsure who is real and who is an imitation and this 'body scenario sees their numbers steadily dwindle as one by one they fall victim to the thing when cornered it manifests itself as a different nightmarish creature the metamorphosis always horrific and compelling br br the helplessness isolation and claustrophobia of a team of desperate men with no way out of their situation and no way of help reaching them is expertly sustained the long hours of darkness and the mounting provide a bleak backdrop to the terror that unfolds director john carpenter selected with great care a team of brilliant character actors and each member of the team fits perfectly into the part they play whether it be the young and street wise chef the elderly and wise doctor or the bitter and cynical helicopter pilot the point is that no one here comes close to being an all american badass superhero with blonde locks and a six pack and the film's real strength is thanks in no small part to this stark realism the people suffering on screen are recognisable in our daily lives br br the thing remains consistently enjoyable and affecting even after repeated viewings i have now seen the film on more than twenty separate occasions and my amazement at the quality of the direction the acting and the special effects is unwavering my girlfriend prefers the high school spin off of the film the faculty which is good and solid entertainment but far more light hearted and she still loves and acknowledges the brilliance of the thing however and thank goodness for that because i could not remain in the company of someone who didn't love this movie br br a classic and then some
<START> the kinks warned about media heroes outside the movies most heroes are also ordinary people society demands some role playing but what happens when that extends to the parent child relationship do some parents try to improve themselves through their children rather than vice versa how do you provide a role model but not a role a brilliant swimmer who hates to swim a brilliant musician who won't play offbeat funny despite depiction of serious problems very good multi dimensional acting by everyone lots of plot twists complement the emotional tension celluloid heroes never feel any pain i don't recall ever being disappointed in a sigourney weaver film i even liked the village
<START> this show came to canada via pbs in the mid 90s and i really really loved it then even 10 yrs later watching the various news networks i cant help but think of the cynical manipulation that goes on in the name of ratings and the various show ponies we all see on tv as depicted in various frontline episodes the scripts are tightly written and the actors all have impeccable comic timing and none of it is encumbered by an idiotic laugh track there is a lot of funny material here really well executed and we don't need to be told when to laugh and what to laugh at i don't understand why this show never took off in north america as its truly a gem i was really excited to see the dvds available even though they are pal format i figured i would rip them to my computer and then watch the converted files i took a chance and ordered it from 6 to 8 weeks later i had all 3 seasons even better it worked on my ntsc dvd player i suspect any player bought in the past 2 yrs that does xvid divx will play them great stuff 10 yrs later the episodes all hold up really well you don't need to know anything about australian politics to get the humor as it will all be familiar to western audiences my wife and i had a 10 day frontline fest and are still chuckling weeks later after watching all 39 episodes
<START> the beginning was decent the ending was alright br br sadly this movie suffers from complete and utter shallowness of the characters unrealistic confrontations fight scenes lack of anyone intelligent outside of the shuttle this makes for an awful middle screenplay br br stuff to look for overly obvious foreshadowing fast healing cuts overly smoky fires fun delayed reactions br br i did give it a 4 not a 0 because the start of the movie had some nice elements of happiness and basic character development the relationship between the main dark haired girl and her fiancÃ©e is touched upon briefly and the placement of the blond friend's impact on that relationship is present though awkwardly so the business discovered at the end is becoming more mainstream and decently done though as another commenter pointed out not unexpected br br viper
<START> not to be confused with michael ritchie's nasty 1975 beauty pageant spoof this smile is a down turned example of those good intentions paving the road to hell br br the film parallels two stories an impoverished chinese father sacrifices his wife and son to raise a facially deformed orphan named ling yi ding and a tv spawned malibu family act out gidget get birth control katie the third olsen twin plays a spoiled self absorbed high schooler distanced from reality her teacher sean astin paves the way for a school trip to china aimed at showing students how to work with deformed children br br the film uses deformity as a means of suspense by treating ling like the frankenstein monster kramer continually masks her deformity through hats hoods and camera placement this approach exploits the freak show quality inherent in the material she may be uncomfortable with the way society views her and kramer's answer is to cover her up until the big reveal why disturb your audience with such unpleasantness we see her face briefly at the end and only minutes before closing credit snapshots of her after surgery disclose a swan beneath the it is not good enough to give the girl a reason to live what is imperative is ling being equally as hot and popular as katie br br funding for the film came from a trust established by the late roy rogers and dale evans they envisioned a heritage of quality family films give me son of paleface any day
<START> this is the movie that finally pushed me over the line into registering with imdb so that i could vote for and comment on it i've only recently come to appreciate well produced war movies and this is one of the most thoughtful i've seen br br stunning is the word that comes to mind when i think of this viewing experience my husband and i watched this film last night for the first time it is gently moving yet exciting at the same time not a contradiction this story in the hands of hollywood could have become just another smarmy action packed top gun time waster br br the two lead actors playing frantisek and karel played off of each other marvelously well and is a very pretty boy without seeming to exaggerate or exploit that fact in terms of acting ability and appearance my husband said tongue in cheek well he's no tom cruise i replied thank god if you appreciate beautiful and understated acting see this one
<START> crossfire 1947 br br great message great symbolism very good movie br br it's hard to go totally wrong with robert mitchum robert young and robert ryan all together as the three male leads and with director edward pulling together a complicated murder and detective yarn that's reason enough to watch it once and even twice br br you might need a second look to fully catch the plot as it is explained too much or shown in flashback also too much because it's a little complicated without good reason but it makes sense overall and we see early on too early probably who the culprit is and even why br br besides the drama well done in typical noir lighting and filled with those short quips that make post war films dramatic there is the social message the anti anti semitic point of it all it only borders on preachy once or twice and it's such an obviously good point to make we watch it being made and wait for the plot and the dramatic acting to take front row which they do especially young who is a brilliantly laconic and patient detective and ryan who is mean in a believably crude and angry way ryan is good at that his typecasting reasonable mitchum mostly plays a watered down version of what he is famous for and the fourth known acting force gloria grahame is a great brief presence even if slightly dispensable br br though the movie is dominated by the sequence of events and by the message both of which grow in force as we go it is really easy to watch just for the lighting camera work and acting including the classic fight scene that opens the first few seconds of the film all done with shadows br br the archetypes of soldiers presented is very deliberate and this might be something people at the time were very familiar with and could relate to as much as the anti semitism thread the shell shocked soldier rendered helpless but still intrinsically capable the modest youngster without confidence but capable too and the weary but outwardly able veteran are all there and of course the angry violent soldier who is a product of the war too this last is also a responsibility of society even the army goes all out to make good on the injustices here not just because they are criminal but because they stem from the wear and tear of a long awful war br br the audience then more than now could really get but it's there to appreciate still
<START> star rating saturday night friday night friday morning sunday night monday morning br br mr bean rowan atkinson is in this world but not of this world his mind simply doesn't seem to comprehend things the way an average person would and his life is one long disaster because of this getting himself into constant mishaps and far out zany situations which he is left to sort out on his own as he doesn't seem to mix with anyone and he rarely speaks but he never gives up and despite the simplest of tasks being a constant struggle for him applying his own zany methods of solving the problem always pays off for him in the end br br to look at the sorry state of modern british humour with all it's focus of sex and general vulgarity you'd be forgiven for forgetting that a show like mr bean was made at one time there's nothing unsuitable going on here just good clean u rated humour of the type tommy cooper and the like made in the 50s and i find it just as laugh out loud funny now in my early 20s as i did when i was a young boy in the early 90s br br although i can look at it a little deeper now and see there must be more to this character than than meets the eye there must be a reason why he does things the way he does and things seem to keep going wrong for him as others have noted it looks like he may have a type of autism in fact i'm so convinced about it that i really think were a professional psychologist to analyse him i think mr bean could be the first famous fictional character to be diagnosed with something like syndrome br br if you'd like to see some truly hilarious british humour at it's very best before it all became obsessed with sex and vulgarity then this would come highly recommended shows like little britain do work because it's well realised but it's really just as vulgar as the rest shows like this show we were more restrained and civilised once and hopefully we might start putting out this type of humour more again sometime soon
<START> the one and the only br br the only really good description of the punk movement in the la in the early 80's also the definitive documentary about legendary bands like the black flag and the x mainstream americans' repugnant views about this film are absolutely hilarious how can music be so in a country of supposed liberty even 20 years after find out br br
<START> keys to the vip is bs br br rob vs justin in season two br br i went to school with rob and adriana you may remember her as the last girl he was picking up this was when the angry girlfriend came by they made out and left the club together they were good friends at father in br br whether or not rob planned it or they asked him to do it men should know that what they are seeing is not real and the guys on here are douche bags especially that episode br br one more line to fill space
<START> i was at wrestlemania vi in toronto as a 10 year old and the event i saw then was pretty different from what i saw on the wrestlemania collection dvd i just watched i don't understand how the wwe doesn't have the rights to some of the old music since most of those songs were created by the wwf they shouldn't have to worry about the licensing and royalty fees that prevent shows like snl from releasing season sets its pretty stupid to whine about but for me hearing demolition come out to their theme music at a wrestlemania in person was a memory that i never forgot and it didn't exist on this dvd what is the point of them even owning the rights to this huge library of video if they have to edit it so drastically to use it
<START> my take routine political thriller with mediocre action scenes and predictable twists br br a rarely seen political thriller which made a very poor box office response i managed to catch the shadow conspiracy on tv just now and while i was glad that i satisfied my curiosity to see this rare film i didn't exactly feel this film was all special considering the box office response to it shadow conspiracy is not all quite as bad as critics and the public reacted to it but still ain't very good to begin with and everything from script to direction is pretty predictable charlie sheen plays the presidential assistant who finds himself caught up with assassins and chases a lot of them when he discovers a deadly conspiracy which lurks amongst the white house staff after a professor is murdered sheen aids the help of ex flame reporter amanda givens linda hamilton to uncover the traitor and unlock the conspiracy of the title br br but this script written by adi ric gibbs are pedestrian as they come not much differing from other white house conspiracy thrillers as in absolute power and murder at 1600 some considerable talents donald sutherland ben gazzara and stephen lang try their best on a routine script but rarely saves it from predictability of the script not to mention a ludicrous scene which involves a toy helicopter which seems far too silly and out of place in this serious political thriller the shadow conspiracy has its moments i'm sure some of which are much to under appreciated director george pan cosmatos serves up some decent chase scenes but none of which lifts this routine thriller of which there's not much payoff or surprises br br rating out of 5
<START> whoa terrible terrible terrible terrible did i mention terrible you can tell just by the dvd cover not to get this movie but unfortunately that wasn't the case for me well someone brought this home for me to watch and when i looked at it i just wanted to strangle the person because they used my money i will certainly be taking it back soon but i might as well tell you about it while i have it in memory for i definitely want to forget it this movie doesn't deserve to even be called horrible it's beyond horrible quite possibly the worst film ever the acting was so so so so horrifically disgusting as well as the deaths being so entirely lame and predictable i didn't even laugh at how bad this movie was which kind of frightens me a little don't see this film shame on you if you're even looking at this movie page and i have extreme pity for you if you're looking at this movie page because you think this will be decent final word yuck
