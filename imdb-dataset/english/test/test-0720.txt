<START> awful waste of time there is no camp or trash value in this one seen better amateur movies done by 10 to 12 years old kids in movie clubs br br how on earth someone can spoil movie about vampires and lesbians br br it's not a movie to put together a few vampire sadomasochism enthusiast in a same room and just shoot it br br could not find anything good about the film there was no plot no real actors no real special effects no humor a few overweight touching each other cannot be called a sex scene nothing at all br br well cemetery was nice but one should shot a vampire movie during dark br br purpose was probably good make a trash movie in a spirit of ed wood problem is that one cannot make a bad movie intentionally it takes talent and an effort to make a real movie ed wood might have lacked money but he sure had effort these guys lacked everything ed wood was a genius compared to these guys
<START> i guess the previous house movie was a hit prompting universal to wring a few more drops from the monster cash cow the creative team must've been in a recycling mood starting with the opening theme lifted from 'son of frankenstein' and some of the stock footage dispersed through the film like one unintentionally funny bit of business where footage of glenn strange as the monster is mixed with clips of karloff from 1935's bride and compared to how robotic strange moved karloff seems to move like a cheetah in comparison br br previous film continuity is thrown by the wayside concerning the miraculous death cheating abilities of the wolf man and dracula but when dr larry talbot discover frankenstein's monster with the skeleton representing boris karloff edward t lowe does at least acknowledge some of the past movie history though talbot curiously never mentions having met karloff's dr niemann br br since this was to be the last of universal's horror cycle the supernatural elements of the wolf man and drac get unconvincingly morphed into medical ailments drac is told he suffers from a blood disease a very rare sickness that allows him to transform into a bat or evaporate if sunlight touches him and larry talbot just has a little pressure on the brain of course all of this is painstakingly explained with a of medical jargon being related in many scenes throughout this proves to be the biggest hindrance as somewhere along the way the filmmakers seem to forget about actual horror or entertainment in favor of giving the monsters conditions that seem as as a flu br br as a huge fan of the old universal horrors it's rare that i feel so bored while watching one the whole thing just feels like a movie that was made just because it could be but if this mess hadn't been slapped together the monsters might never have met abbott and costello so i guess some good came of this
<START> my wife wanted to see this movie and i grudgingly went along i have never been a big fan of the biopic believing that cinema is more exciting when it isn't structured in non fiction beyond that although i like ray charles' music just fine i don't consider myself a fan of him or his music br br i expected to either suffer or coast through this movie br br i was wrong br br this is an engaging story told in a classic cinematic style the realism is in the nuances the tilt of a character's head after a dramatic moment or the look in their eyes while they sing i literally discovered myself involved in this movie during the course of viewing it br br jaime foxx of which much has been said heads a cast of immaculate re creators of not just a time but an era a life that never really existed to those of us under forty this movie sinks the audience into time without the gimmicks and grand sweeping panoramas of titanic or other period pieces of that ilk this movie doesn't present you with the 50's and 60's music scene it takes you there br br this is a movie about ray charles but your appreciate of it should not be limited to the story of his life this is the kind of movie like saving private ryan or schindler's list that does what a movie should do bring you to another place another time
<START> as an adult i am grateful to have caught this movie by chance when i was a teen during the time i was experiencing familial problems this particular movie managed to capture what i was seeing from a closeted world how much peer pressure is too much i actually had to purchase this movie because it reached me on a level unlike most films try to reach an audience how far might an individual go for social acceptance who is the bad crowd teenagers do struggle trying to find out the answers to these questions but ultimately who is the pack leader if there must be one is it the strong the beautiful perhaps the person we just all seem to like could it be the moral character as far as the movie goes the cast worked together as if it were predestined i only hope that more directors and producers try to create a piece of work that reaches all of us like this particular movie reached me i wish i could vote higher than ten because this particular title deserves much more
<START> i watched this movie for the first time a few weeks ago and it was quite possibly one of the most boring unfunny films i ever had the misfortune of seeing first of all matthew modine is a terrible actor and ruined most of the movie on top of that the plot is just way too silly the only reason a checked into this film was because of alec baldwin and his character was eliminated pretty quickly unless you are a fan of michelle you should probably avoid this movie like the plague many people can't praise this film enough but i just cannot figure out what people find so terrific about it if its supposed to be the black humor that makes this film so terrific then i guess anything can pass for comedy these days
<START> one of the few reasons to make these films is to give some actors a chance to hopefully star in better films if they're acting is any good the only good thing in this movie is the acting the three female leads are better than most horror films like this there's 2 scenes that may cause an unexpected jump br br young small children are use to crawl through holes and lay dynamite to explode mines when one does collapse causing a cave in all the children die becoming zombies the adults in the mine stay dead no reasons are given as why the children become flesh eaters when still alive they looked terrified before the cave in innocent so they must become enraged at any adult which exploited them int he mines only reason that come to mind br br a mother and her 2 daughters move into a house near the mine along with a land who wants to build a resort and another of those creepy people who seem to know exactly what's going on yet no one believes him br br nothing new here you're usual clichÃ©s predictable a lot of negatives for this film very few positives
<START> there are one or two other shemp era shorts i like more i e scrambled brains but i think one can say without much argument that in this particular episode shemp gives his greatest comedic performance as a stooge after the team in 1946 br br scene for scene this episode hardly lets up from professor shemp howard's voice lessons with the glass shattering dee green to his futile attempts to win a hand in marriage this is your little will you marry me click to the uproarious finish it never fails to keep me in stitches br br i would be remiss not mention that immortal scene with miss hopkins the always lovely christine mcintyre btw isn't she rather under dressed and over amorous in greeting the man she thinks is her basil who knows maybe the actual basil was a very distant cousin which makes it legal in some states as far as i know
<START> i just finished watching disappearances at afi fest 2006 with about 30 other people in a mostly vacant 1000 seat auditorium the festival programmer after seeing the lack of audience started his opening comments with well at least a few of those attending the festival have good taste in film well mr programmer after watching this film i must answer back no we don't and either do you this back woods period piece follows young not so wild bill as he and his mystic family dangerously run illegal canadian whiskey across the border during america's prohibition the old time outlaws kris kristofferson and company not only need the money to save their ramshackle vermont farm but want to introduce little wild bill to the virtues of manhood br br although handsomely photographed this adventure story lacks what makes films of this sort good tension and believability kristofferson's lackluster performance and dry monologue reminds me of a dream i once had where al gore was playing the role of willy wonka i just didn't care and when wild bills mystic grandmother appears out of thin air to give him advice it just didn't fit yes i almost fell asleep more than once br br gary farmer does do a good job as the cameron frye in ferris bueller character brother in law of big bill while the teenage chris mcdermott does uses those piercing blue eyes to his acting benefit br br but overall expect to see jay cravens disappearances playing at a block buster 2 bin near you
<START> you know i really have a problem with movie lists i was reading maxim magazine a while ago and they had a list of the 50 greatest b movies of all time and knowing me i of course have to go through and watch them all and write reviews of all of them this is why you see reviews of movies like gator bait and barb wire and coffy on my list so i noticed h o t s at the video store the other day and recognized it from list of the 50 greatest b movies and i decided to rent it and check it out my only consolation is that i rented it because i recognized it from a list of b movies so i already knew it was going to suck br br given the type of movie that it is i can't say that h o t s is a total failure since it is nothing more than a late 70s t a film and it never pretends to by anything else the only place where it strays widely from its objective is in a ragged subplot involving a couple of ex cons who have stashed a lot of stolen money in the house that the self named h o t s move in to because this subplot has absolutely no place in the movie despite the fact that the rest of the movie is as well this subplot is completely superfluous and unnecessary br br the story is based on a couple of rival sororities at the beloved f u which exists as one of those universities that contains a grand total of one sorority until the rejects form their own in order to get back at the snobs in the other one this new sorority help out the seals h o t s is a sorority supposedly based on helping seals the seal subplot is another one that doesn't really belong in the movie and little attention is paid to the meaning of that name beyond having a seal running around here and there throughout the movie br br this is going to sound weird but there was actually one scene that i was pretty impressed with in this movie one shot that i was impressed with i should say about midway through the movie one of the girls in pi the rival sorority is pouring alcohol into the punch and she pours some for herself in a glass and drinks it oddly enough what she does as she drinks that alcohol reminds me of something that charlie chaplin would do which really brightened up the movie obviously nothing in this movie comes close to anything that chaplin ever did but that shot alone raised my score for the movie from a 2 to a 4 br br as a whole however the movie is exactly what you would expect it to be a lot of people running around looking for excuses to take off their clothes i liked how the remove one piece of clothing for every score in the football game at the end was one of the girls' ideas and not much thought is put into much of anything else there is for example a scene early in the film when a couple of the pi girls pour hot sauce into the refreshments at a h o t s party accidentally getting caught in an incriminating photograph the girl taking the picture didn't realize that she photographed them at the time although the photograph never comes up for any reason later in the film br br i've seen movies like this before it's kind of like gator bait but without the violence and the rednecks and coffy wasn't far off even barb wire is much the same just with a bigger budget and more silicon thankfully 50 b movie list contains only a few more comedies because while these cheesy teen t a films are entertaining every once in a while as bad movies with the occasional semi nude scene after watching h o t s i think i've decided that i like the bad horror movies better than the bad comedies i'd rather watch a lot of terrible actors pretend to be scared than pretend to be funny
<START> it's not difficult after watching this film to see why post silent soviet cinema is held in such little critical esteem don't get me wrong the cranes are flying is for the first half at least supremely entertaining boasting a lightness of touch completely unexpected from its country of origin a fresh brisk spacious technique that eventually irritates as much as it initially charms two stunning subjective set pieces and a romantic verve that flirts with but never quite topples into lelouch territory it's just that in its subsuming of vast social national and world events to a love affair it is essentially no different from a conventional hollywood movie br br of course in a soviet union that emphasised the state above all else and in an era world war two that suppressed individualism and liberty to uphold murderous symbolism this of two appealing young lovers is a relief and the thematic similarities all consuming love rent apart by war with two of the most wonderful of all films seventh heaven les parapluies de cherbourg also adds to its potential loveability br br the story is simple enough boris a young factory worker from a bright medical and artistic family and veronika a student conduct a breezy relationship at night their only free time cousin mark a composer also has eyes on veronika when the nazis invade russia boris secretly volunteers to the chagrin of his family and lover he promises to write to veronika but never does thinking maybe she hasn't bothered to see him off or perhaps the mail is simply unreliable parents die during an air raid and she moves in with family helping out at the hospital where his father tends wounded soldiers br br distressed by silence veronika is also by the attentions of mark who has gained from military duty by bribing a local official she is eventually worn down and marries him to the disapproval of her adopted family boris meanwhile is killed in action veronika disgusted with herself and an adulterous mark refuses to believe this and awaits his return fostering a young orphan bearing his name br br the title refers to the birds the couple see at the height of their love symbolic perhaps of its transcendant power but this is illusory the cranes fly in a v formation and this shape pervades the entire film through the geometric shapes of buildings interiors exteriors of people composition camera angles the heroine's name or by editing in which feet walking southwest in one story are met by feet walking southeast in another br br this serves to fatally trap the lovers who have no control over their destinies and also suggest the stalinist power that is never specifically mentioned in the film although the pair seem to be free in space whether literally in an environment or privileged in generous close ups they are always torn apart by circumstances families by crowds see the brilliant if obvious sequences where veronika is engulfed by tanks or the pair fail to meet in a huge crowd or simply by the film's structure which is constantly distancing through their closeness although at the beginning the lightness and brightness of style suggest a beautiful romantic idyll it is constantly being broken by strange edits or camera angles of distracting snatches of music br br what is most remarkable is how these blocks to romance are achieved by rather than emphasising historical forces the whole film but especially the war itself is strangely unreal and dreamlike we are never shown its harsh brutal actuality just its effects on the lovers in fact it is transformed into a majestic spectacle devoid of nasty germans br br on the home front the air raids create delicious effects of light and shade or ruins of almost gothic decadence in the bunker the threat to the soviet empire is less important than perceived indifference the empty moscow spaces the lovers initially than veronika with her mother walk though are less actual locations than emotional spaces br br when mark tries to force himself on veronika the air raid is less a destructive reality than a symbolic release of sexual and emotional frustrations this is a brilliant sequence filmed with silent expressionistic terror in which the screen seems to burst with hysteria and violence all the more compelling for the earlier scenes' wistful gentleness br br it's not much different at the front either where fights over girls' honour are more urgent than tactics nazis or despair the movement of boris and his wounded comrade into a final space is a further of the experience of war its setting in a forest giving it a sexual dynamic and boris' final pre death flashback is an extraordinary mixture of dream wish fulfillment and heightened anxiety in which what is wished for becomes menacing and grotesque br br from this point on the film becomes a little less interesting slightly more obvious one more grasp for expressionist overload attempted suicide and her rescuing the infant is clumsily handled and her sombre guilt casts a paralysing shadow over the whole film the use of deep focus at first ravishing soon becomes wearing devoid as it is of any of the moral force or meaning welles brought to its use in citizen kane after what seems a quietly sly critique of totalitarianism in favour of the individual is cruelly betrayed at the end when individual suffering as so often in russian art transmutes into symbolic i e sexless hope a pity
<START> i was given a dvd of public enemies and was expecting it to be the 2009 version but it wasn't it was this sure it wasn't the greatest movie i have ever seen not by any means but heck folks it was worth more that 2 8 out of 10 when i saw that abysmal rating on imdb i wondered what i was going to get but since the disc was in the player i settled down to watch it as other commentators have pointed out public enemies is not a historical movie per se and i noted that unlike the 2009 version which i haven't seen yet imdb doesn't categorise it as such br br come on people it's a story based on some real people that's all if i wanted a history lesson i'd sit at this computer and read wikipedia or something ma barker actual name arizona or barker was never even charged with any crime and as other commentators have already pointed out she probably never even took part in her sons' activities they sent her to the movies when they were working i hope she wasn't as critical as some of those who watched this movie br br theresa russell had the never too easy task of portraying a woman from the age of 17 right through to her death at the age of 52 from a young girl running from home to the hardened mother of four hoodlum sons i think she did it pretty well the cheeky little smile she used in more than one scene was classical ok i will agree with some of the critics that the direction of this film was below par and i sympathise with the actors over that theresa should have told the director to forget the topless shots they didn't contribute to the story maybe some bigger name stars would have managed to inject some of their own expertise into overriding the poor direction whereas the second graders weren't quite that brave who knows br br but whilst this was certainly no block buster it was worth more than 2 8 i have all my dvds on a personal database where i score them before looking at the imdb score although that sometimes influences slight changes later i take what i get on it's own merits rather than holding one movie up against others of the same genre and this one i felt was entertaining enough to get 6 8 yep i'll accept that such a practice does tend to depend on my mood at the time but then isn't that also true of those who vote on imdb however you may imagine my surprise when i looked at imdb and saw the pitiful score it got here br br given the surprise i decided to read a few of the other comments in the hopes of understanding the low rating and i noticed that they are quite polarised i agreed with those who said the movie was worth watching and came to the conclusion that some people are just hard to please well since some were absolutely scathing why don't they get out there and make some better movies i will look forward to the gems they must be able to turn out on the other hand if they can't do that then why don't they just shut up
<START> is a film of superlatives it has an exceptionally well thought out cast with being the crowning jewel a superb production and possibly pre production with at the helm a fantastic journey of rural southern india through the eyes of a 15 year old a remarkable mixture of song and dance traditional and modern blended perfectly and a beautiful backdrop of lush color of the flora and fauna that make up the magnificent experience what a towering achievement for a debut director the casting was absolutely dead on i wish india would come out with more of such films this film will remain as one of my top favorites for my entire life 9 10
<START> this movie made by the was made in honor of the montreal canadians dynasty years in the 50's 60's and 70's my 5th grade teacher played this in class in honor of my 11th birthday in 1987 and also to celebrate my return from a serious facial injury in 1986 i have been a canadians fan for 29 of my 30 years of life on a scale of 1 10 i give this film a 117 all hockey fans should see this as i hope it will be placed in the hockey hall of fame in toronto and shown at the bell centre in montreal or here in edmonton at place watch this film with your family it is a great movie i also recommend the book in both french and english go go
<START> this is a film that i keep coming back to for a variety of reasons as a testament to the suffering of the ordinary soldier on the eastern front in the second world war it is a powerful one there are a number of very powerful scenes in the film which help to capture the horror of war such as the tank battle for instance furthermore from what i can see the experiences documented in the film are by and large 'true' if you read a book you will know what i mean the film is also successful in the sense that it doesn't allow character or plot to dominate it it is simply a tale of survival that attempts to depict the battle mainly from the ordinary german soldier's point of view i've read somewhere that the original screenplay had to be toned down which doesn't surprise me at all if they tried to really show what the battle was like it would have been almost impossible to make i'm sure even so there are still some moments that are difficult to watch this was made before private ryan but is possibly even harder hitting in places just one word of caution don't buy the dubbed 'english' version it's pretty awful and spoils the film try to get a copy in the original german version with english subtitles it's far more powerful you may need to buy a region 1 dvd of the film in this case as i did
<START> jesus christ what the hell happened here this is one of the most boring movies i have ever seen how is it possible that they screwed up such a nice idea for a movie to tell you the truth i was so hyped for this i though it was like blair witch but with actual alien creatures chasing the camera guy goddamn it i have been reduced to fast forwarding this pile of sh t and i never do that while seeing movies the high rating here on imdb makes me believe that actual aliens are giving 10's for this piece of crap br br invasion is about well an invasion the movie starts by saying that everything you're about to see is real then they go and tell me about a special camera system used in cars as if i need to believe their bullsh t to enjoy this movie next thing you know i'm seeing the most boring car driving ever filmed in a forest at night mind you is this a movie or a disney theme park ride the first 20 minutes is all boring dialog between cops while seeing grass and one straight road with a flashlight where the hell were the aliens they were sleeping of course then we learn that bad acting is not only reduced to high school plays as the cop behind the camera goes out of his car to look for a missing man who was and had stumbled upon a mysterious meteorite i wonder what happens to him out of nowhere we see the guy walking like a zombie the cop is apparently too dumb to notice that something is wrong with this man apparently he was indeed dumb as the zombie alien guy injects in the cop's ear some sort of alien parasite thus changing him into an alien then the cop alien goes back into his car looks for a young couple that were having sex a while back in the forest gets to them changes the guy into an alien and then the girl runs to the cop's car and escapes if this quick plot introduction didn't get it in your head that this movie was bad then the following 40 minutes will watching this movie is as painful as stabbing yourself repeatedly with a plastic fork the script while it may sound interesting on the back of the dvd box is badly directed and sadly we are left with another boring straight to dvd atrocity br br the only thing that kept me awake were the constant flashing and loud sound effects lamentably if seeing the same forest trail for 63 minutes is not enough we must endure crappy flashing techniques to scare the viewer and constant wailing of a bad actress that gets old and annoying pretty quick br br if you feel you must rent this i say to you why there are better scifi horror films out there even the dreaded remake of the invasion of the body snatchers is more entertaining than this for the love of all things good don't bother with his crap my eyes bled and for the first time i wanted suicide a 1 10 avoid this like a disease
