<START> born in 1946 i was about eight years old when first viewing this movie and it left a deep impression not only scary for lack of a better word this movie haunted me for more than 50 years the mob goon played by john was terrifying the only scene that stuck out in my mind during those 50 years was the killing of the little girl and the uncaring policeman referring to her as a little n kid those words were replaced when the movie was shown recently on tv maybe there are two versions of the movie or someone felt compelled to alter a little bit this heart breaking scene accurate or not the film went a long way in my opinion of the south and still till today the closest i've come to visiting a southern city is el paso that stand may seem extreme but there is a little bit more to the story when the movie was shown recently it became clearer why it haunted me for years with the newsreel like beginning this movie gives the impression that what is being shown is fact the film is made supposedly only one or two years after the depicted incidents adding to its realistic credibility the terror in the movie isn't provided by creatures or space aliens but by persons living in our society at the time re killing of little girl the recent viewing helped make clearer the impact it had on my 8 year old mind when this movie came out the only school i had ever gone to was attended by mostly african americans the victim looked like a girl in my class it was like seeing an actual killing it made a horrible scene that much worse maybe no one will find this review helpful but it helped me
<START> stay away from this movie far away phil stars as the demented ringleader of a freakshow every performance is flat and unfeeling except the plot is a simple one and follows almost every horror movie cliche possible a group of high school kids go to a carnival see a side show and get in over their heads br br fans of fred olen ray should be warned this is not like any of his other films this one is lacking in all departments humor sex horror etc other f o ray movies excell in br br the version i saw also contained a making of documentry in which the director makes comments like we had a limited budget and with our limited timeline which speaks volumes about how much charles band cared about this film go rent droid runner fred olen ray or the dead hate the living full moon instead full moon should be ashamed of themselves and that's saying a lot after seeing killer eye br br grade d
<START> i didn't catch gilmore girls when it first came out so still doing some catch up on the first season i read through most of the users comments and for the negative ones i have to ask what show are you watching br br this show is a classic great lines characters and good acting and best of all not your standard formula show always with an occasional twist to the story there are probably more women who see themselves reflected in the emily relationship then in the rory relationship the people and storylines are not pc but they are real br br if you find the dialogue annoying i suggest you tape the show so you can rewatch the parts don't understand
<START> meek and mild edward g robinson as winkle decides to quit his bank job and do what he wants open a fix it repair shop behind his house mr robinson is married but childless he has befriended local orphanage resident ted donaldson as barry young donaldson is an eager workshop assistant and sees robinson as a father figure robinson's nagging wife ruth warwick as amy is unhappy with robinson's job choice and to return matters to her idea of normalcy their lives are further disrupted when robinson is drafted br br the war also disrupts what might have been an interesting story as robinson's character struggles against a domineering unsympathetic wife possibly filmmakers are showing how war can save marriages and positively redirect lives robinson and donaldson are a likable team robert mitchum has an inauspicious bit part the ending trick played by ms warwick and donaldson is predictably staged
<START> this film was really a breath of fresh air from the load of hollywood crap i've seen recently the acting is superb and the characters are engaging and oddly endearing there really isn't much to the story it's simple and it works well an easy film to just sit down and enjoy the mood was fantastic and the sets really helped push the movie along and offered some nice visuals the film obviously has aspects of horror yet is geared a little more towards the humorous side of things you won't be laughing out loud hysterically with this one but you'll be smiling the whole way through the humor works very well with the characters and the superb acting doesn't hurt i really watched this movie based on the fact that ron perlman was in it his role is a bit smaller than i expected but it doesn't matter the rest of the cast does more than enough to keep you engaged if you like horror watch this if you like comedies watch this just go ahead and watch this anyway it's really quite excellent
<START> bach did it better much of bach 's speaking part is letters written to various patrons complaining about the amount and speed of his payment anna diary mostly about the death of children and sundry other family matters is an iota more engaging the music is disconcerting 17th century sized chapel orchestras and choirs producing 20th century concert hall sound the overall production quality reminded me of a junior high slide show j s bach was a brilliant man whose music speaks for itself this film adds nothing netflix sent me 2 discs that wouldn't play so i streamed the movie clearly netflix was trying to tell me something
<START> i hate movies that end like this br br this 16mm disaster is full of clichÃ©s stereotypical characters a generic over done plot and terrible dialog br br in this movie we have the aggressive black guy the black guys girlfriend the blonde bitch the possible lesbian hacker chick the teacher blah blah blah and then the pumpkin man br br do you think someone is taking the legend too far this question is asked towards the end of the film taking the tagline of scream 2 too far br br spoilers typically i don't go into spoilers but i have to rant br br a dream the whole thing was a dream this is the most way to end a movie i don't know how to explain all of this and we don't have any more money let's make the whole thing a dream this is what the director producer actor fx guy must have been thinking yes the director is the character of mr e he did almost everything on this garbage movie this is such a cope out ending and what of the principal okay so he has been doing all the kidnapping what did that have to do with the movie of course the black people are killed the bitchy girl is killed the teacher that has a past of sexual harassment with students gets killed he is main suspect yuck yuck yuck this movie gave me heart burn br br pointless senseless and made with parents visa and which tells me it is probably still being paid off this movie is dumb boring and just plain stupid br br the only thing i liked was the credits the way they presented the names etc in the beginning and at the end it had a creepy feel to it too bad the movie didn't br br 1 out of 10
<START> i hate guns and have never murdered anyone but when even half of the events that take place in happen to you or close ones and you find a gun you shoot your attacker three times five times whatever makes the pulse stop on them and increase on you i think even god would say good call in a very 'hostel' type film but more realistic Â as this really could happen to anyone well if you're a pretty young woman that is Â was a decent film though on the long side a few good shocks always call aaa even just to change a tire basically just one surprise but for the most part you could see things coming and aside from the typical tie him up instead of the previously mentioned shooting him the most annoying part was the revelation towards the closing from one best friend to the other getting past those it's enjoyable for what it is basically we have two unsuspecting females traveling alone from mexico home wow that's original and one lost her luggage preventing them from leaving the airport until late and after an obvious foreshadowed sign language scene they enter a too good to be true half price shuttle ride clichÃ©d jocks previously introduced con their way on the shuttle to join what appears to be alan stunt double from 'speed ' from here it's obvious what happens i did mention it was a 'hostel' knock off but still i didn't find too much horrible yet nothing spectacular though it would've served the audience better with roughly 15 20 minutes deleted i would recommend if you have almost 2 hours to kill and are into sick horror
<START> i feel very fortunate to have the chance to not only watch this film but also learn more about this fascinating person and time is an outstanding portrayal giving a full sense of the story without falling into the usual hollywood trappings yes he is shown with his wife and children but the essence of the story is his politics and those of the still emerging independent congo the film is brilliantly made moving along at a pace that is consistently engaging i look forward to seeing other raoul peck films as well as more from eric
<START> terrible the only way i could even begin to consider it funny is if it made fun of itself amazing it's about an ass that fights crime and he drinks smokes how very funny it's funny because where most people put things in their mouth he puts them in himself and now he's getting sexual service from some lady this show is so great that is what i would have to say if i liked the show though i'm sure you can see the obvious sarcasm i've noticed some people have been comparing this show to 12 oz mouse and squid billies why would you even try there's nothing to compare the other two shows actually have some decent character development in conclusion i hate mcgee i twinge at the name of it
<START> the influences of other science fiction and thriller movies and stories are evident throughout this film the movies that come to mind immediately are alien aliens and starship troopers the story itself is fairly straightforward and not all that original traveling through space crash landing on planet with no apparent life and a deserted geological expedition except when the lights go out forcing different types of people to work together toward their mutual survival while the body count mounts this kind of movie always tends to be fun as long as it's done well i believe that pitch black was done well the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesn't make it br br vin diesel plays riddick the stereotypical convicted criminal who has a murderous past physically prowess high tolerance for pain and conveniently can see in the dark you know he is going to end up doing the right thing at some point in the movie because it's hinted throughout the movie that he actually may have a conscience about things br br cole house plays the drug addicted bounty hunter who's probably in many ways a real bad guy compared to riddick as his character reveals itself throughout the movie it is most likely that he is most courageous when the odds and firepower are in his favor a very self serving character that in the end gets what he deserves br br radha mitchell plays the co pilot on the doomed vessel who is jolted out of deep sleep because the ship ran through a meteor swarm or the tail end of a comment finding the pilot dead in his sleeping chamber she attempts to land the ship which leads to our discovery of that's character's potentially fatal flaw fear of responsibility accountability and being a leader her character in the short span of the story probably grows the most in that she actually grows some conviction takes charge and doesn't sit around waiting to be gobbled up by night stalking aliens she in some strange way connects with the ever distant human side of riddick who in turn in the end respects her for her choices and her sticking with them br br the story in some cases plays out as you would expect it but i think you'll be mildly surprised by which characters survive this harrowing experience this movie is an entertaining train wreck in progress to watch go watch it br br
<START> maybe it is unfair for me to review this movie because i walked out well before the end that's odd because i usually like shakespeare on the screen and i enjoyed night's dream once many years ago when i saw it on the stage br br i think that two things did me in that squeaky twerp with the shakespearian name calista and michelle sitting in a giant clamshell well i suppose you could say it supposed to be a comedy but when the scenery is funny and the actors aren't i'd say we have a bad movie on our hands
<START> this could quite possibly be the worst movie ever made up there in a league with movies like howard the duck plan 9 from outer space and ishtar i don't understand why i decided to see this movie as it was a waste of my life i also do not understand why one would like this movie regardless of their sense of humor the acting is among the worst i've ever seen as is the writing the characters are all stupid and there is not one funny scene in the entire movie tom arnold is quite possibly the worst actor ever this movie proves it there is nothing worthy about this movie don't rent it don't watch it don't even say that it looks interesting it's bad enough i saw it
<START> emraan hashmi post murder did some good roles in bhatt films but other director just made use of his kissing and naughty image br br is one of them and it came after aaa jawani diwani in a row and i was already fed up of him and such roles br br the film has a nice twist at the start i felt like an abbas mustan film but then it turns into a routine film with sudden love sudden jealousy and a bad climax br br makes a terrible film music is saving grace camera work is fabulous br br emraan hashmi just repeats his act of his earlier films and has 2 expressions throughout dino looks stiff talks as if he is practicing hindi and does okay in some scenes is expressionless and irritates
<START> crackerjack is a simple but feelgood movie where the good guys are very good and the bad guys are very bad and the central character is tempted by both sides br br the combination of the central character being played by mick malloy and the central setting being the local lawn bowls clubs drew an unusually broad crowd ranging from large numbers of teenagers to large numbers of senior citizens and all laughed at the comedy br br as would be expected of a movie with mick malloy and judith lucy there was quite a bit of swearing but it was not overdone and the audience i sat with certainly enjoyed it br br mick malloy did a good job as the lazy bloke who joined the bowls club three times simply to get parking spaces one for himself and two for to others at a premium but who has everything fall down on him when he is required to play or lose his membership br br judith lucy does a fine job as his local journalist love interest and there are fabulous performances from bill hunter frank wilson monica maughan lois ramsey and many others br br john clarke's dour role as the bad guy is not one of his funniest but he gives a solid performance br br the not so subtle swipes at provide a bit of a serious note to this otherwise light comedy br br i'm sure that those who enjoyed the castle and the dish would also enjoy this movie
