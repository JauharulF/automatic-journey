<START> best robot romantic comedy ever using the robots as the romantic characters which leaves short circuit out of this category this was andy kaufman's best effort bernadette peters shows her versatility here with an amazing performance while not a great movie in many areas i'll award it a 9 on guts and quirkiness
<START> huge waddling grimacing tree trunk menaces fake natives on a pacific atoll looking suspiciously like southern ca reaking and revenge unlike the silly stumps in navy vs the night monsters the is actually a full grown man tree well grown in 2 days moost have od'ed on those miracle grow spikes it comes not from hell but from the grave of a fake native greg palmer the zombies of mora tau murdered by the native elders for hanging out with those awful american scientists the scientists include dr william arnold tod andrews hang 'em high beneath the planet of the apes and professor clark john mcnamara war of the colossal beast rounding out the cast is linda the parent trap as the obnoxious mrs the obvious comic relief spurting out an obvious fake cockney accent a stellar cast indeed because his vacant wife korey played amateurishly by suzanne love's a helps set him up declares his revenge on her and all of the elders then the dopey american scientists the tree bring it back to life in the name of science allows it to slowly amble about the island killing off everyone who has done him wrong of course we all know that evil monsters carry off fair maidens so the grabs plucky female scientist dr terry mason tina carver hell on frisco bay waddles off with her vine ally a good shot with a hits a knife lodged in the and it falls over dead into the quicksand this laughably foolish is one of the all time cheesy howlers the is arguably the slowest monster in moovie history right up there with the clanky over built robot from robot monster vs the aztec mummy and the slow carpet monster from creeping terror try not to laugh as you watch the toss fake natives down hills into quicksand dodge spears and lumber slowly about the island shady writing wooden performances and sappy direction all point that this pulpy fertilizer has far bark than bite this tepid pile of wood chips was the last hurrah from long time editor turned director dan milner who quickly vanished into well deserved obscurity following this film you herd it through the grapevine from the moocow first from hell it came is a compost classic Â
<START> as you might not know de is one of most rightfully celebrated writers he was witty he spared no one in his critics and must now be rolling in his tomb and that's not due to this movie being bad which it is but as a result of the treatment dispensed to one of his masterworks o crime do padre it's treated like cheap throwaway trash br br when it was publicized that this was to be a modern and urban take on the book i feared for the worst normally modern in these contexts means taking the liberty to take the p when doing an adaptation to half arse it in the shoddiest possible way and so the moral and social dilemma of a priest having a secret forbidden affair are substituted by extra long passages of people dealing drugs and singing hip hop for no particular or pertinent reason to the plot it's just there like it might very well not have been br br oh and there's lots of sex so you can at least be counting on that when you put this on remember how every movie in the 80's no matter the genre or the tone always found a way to sneak in some nudity if it was a thriller and they had no need for it they simply found a way that when they were capturing a felon he happened to be in bed with a woman that would prance around screaming naked of course when the cops in ahem gratuitous is the word i think not that there's anything wrong with nude scenes but here they make the creators of this movie look desperate simply because there's nothing else to the movie it's totally devoid of what do you call it dramatic content
<START> i have seen a few of fred carpenter's movies on showtime pay per view and video dvd and i enjoyed most of these films especially with a few beers carpenter knows how to entertain eddie monroe and murdered innocence are my favorites i recently viewed a promo dvd of eddie monroe and everything from the cast to the storyline and directing all worked smoothly doug brown's music score was sensational i enjoyed seeing frank goodfellas new york new york and the wedding singer he is an amazing and very underrated actor but i especially liked the performance of paul who played uncle benny i looked up his acting credits on the imdb and i found out this was his first starring role where has this guy been give fred carpenter credit for discovering great new talent it's only a matter of time you'll be seeing this guy costarring with pacino and deniro as i mentioned carpenter knows how to entertain and when your working with a limited budget it is amazing what carpenter can produce i read the vent magazine interview and carpenter has never made a movie for more than 400 000 00 dollars before i watched eddie monroe i saw rocky balboa and the good shepherd both great films eddie monroe took me on a ride to a surprised ending because of a very good script good performances from the entire cast craig morris is a movie star waiting to happen and the lead actress jessica was hot great cinematography direction and doug brown's music score as i stated i recently seen rocky balboa and the good shepherd if i were to write a comment about those two movies i would be saying some of the same things i have stated about eddie monroe the only thing those two very good films don't have in common with eddie monroe they didn't cost a few hundred grand great movie and i didn't even drink a beer
<START> a modern scare film yep it is br br the hippies and environmentalists got together to deliver us a fear film i didn't recognize it when watching it only 2 years ago that it was a fear film but that's exactly what it is br br there's no difference between this film and films the nazi made about us in ww2 and the same films we made about them this is pure propaganda and speaks only to those that believe in aliens 9 11 conspiracy plots faked moon landings peak oil and major environmentalism what i can say is this film does push buttons make you ask questions and ultimately just forget about it it's a scare film so if your scarred get in your houses lock your doors and stock up for that nuclear winter we all know is coming when bush provokes the chinese into nuclear war
<START> i starred as eugene morris jerome in my high school adaptation of the play and this film definitely doesn't live up to the script or the imagination of neil simon i know this play backwards and forwards and i can honestly tell you that the acting was off the production was cheesy the changes in the play's script were poorly done if you want to really enjoy this play you should see the actual play not a hollywood movie adaptation the eugene character lacked soul and was overly sarcastic in all he said the other characters were off key as well a general disappointment messy disloyal to the play amateurishly executed
<START> this exploration of a unique decade in us cinema begins with the fall of one ailing out of touch empire and culminates with the unstoppable rise of another equally associated with escapism and box office receipts meet the new boss same as the old boss or as peter fonda observed in easy rider we blew it in between from bonnie and clyde to star wars the young turks some under the guerrilla tutelage of roger corman were creeping under the wires to produce some of the greatest artworks of the 20th century while the story is already familiar from peter easy riders raging bulls directors demme and lagravenese are less concerned with than in providing a platform for the filmmakers and stars themselves br br everyone from martin scorsese to francis ford coppola and julie christie is interviewed and a roster of well edited clips places the decade in a socio cultural and economic context if their responses are self congratulatory to say the least they're also highly quotable funny and revealing making this something of a wet dream director william friedkin reveals how the original the exorcist poster was to feature a little girl's hand holding a bloodied crucifix and the legend 'for god's sake help her before he complained former warner bros ' head john recalls that when he first saw robert de niro in mean streets he assumed scorsese had secured a day release for the shoot br br happily a certain amount of hard perspective has crept into the mix as might be hoped from a politically motivated consciousness expanded generation hopper stresses there's a lot of real crap in there too julie christie observes that 1970s us cinema was not a good time for women but if demme responds with a spoonful of to women's movies brief clips of alice doesn't live here anymore they shoot horses don't they and klute we're soon dragged back to the usual male wall pissing contests br br the shift from tough socially conscious film making to no risk crowd pleasers like jaws for 'nam weary fantasy craving audiences is also documented though a little rushed but kudos too for the inclusion of lesser sung but equally relevant films like panic in needle park and joe we weren't handsome muses bruce dern on his contemporaries but we were f interesting
<START> the core issues at play god satan good evil can be should be tremendously compelling as demonstrated through thousands of works of art music literature film end of days unfortunately is nothing but a cartoon byrne's acting ability stands so obviously in sharp contrast to arnold's corresponding lack of ability and is further underlined by a plot filled with nothing but stereotypes br br the single compelling scene occurs at the very beginning with the transformation of the gabriel byrne character and his subsequent interaction with his wife girlfriend it is both erotically charged repellent modernizing the themes the seductive power of evil
<START> i cant explain what a load of rubbish this film is like really i cant its just that bad br br plot crap acting crap budget so low its laughable br br jesus its like the only good thing in this movie is the fact the main character was fairly hot br br the only people i feel that think this movie is good are the ones who took part in the film i'm sure they are not the ones who funded it because there was no money put into this hahahaha to the bit where there heads get shaved br br this movie has already wasted too much of my life so i am not going to waste anymore time writing my review for it
<START> the story of pre unified china must be a popular one jet li's hero made the assassination of the king popular br br this is another story made a few years earlier it stars the incredibly beautiful li memoirs of a geisha 2046 miami vice as the king's lover who was sent to recruit an assassin so that the king could defeat him she recruits zhang but falls in love with him br br no matter he is not able to complete the mission anyway as the king knew about him beforehand i suspected he also knew but went anyway br br it was a beautiful story with massive military operations and of course another chance to see li gong
<START> i know it's rather unfair to comment on a movie without seeing the complete piece but i am going to anyway i waited for a laugh i tried to give it time i think 20 minutes is long enough to wait in a comedy for a laugh my laugh never came so i gave up br br it's stupid humour not so stupid that you have to laugh though it isn't anywhere near that high grade let me correct that it's just stupid not stupid humour they may have intended for certain scenes to be funny but they weren't i suppose if you were really bored you could somehow blend the movie with a hallucination and end up with a mildly entertaining experience br br a very pathetic effort
<START> while i rather enjoyed this movie i'll tell you right now that my mother wouldn't it's out there really warped little dark comedy that reads like a fairy tale gone awry br br neat treat with all the cameos too if you want something different look no further
<START> would it surprise you that my ears and eyes almost bled from watching and listening to this awful movie my eyes almost bled from watching the awful animation and insipid plotless empty story my ears almost bled from listening to the songs that sounded like they were sung by a chorus of howler monkeys then my brain almost melted because of this film's complete lack of intelligence it's formulaic every step of the way talking animals are one thing but a penguin who can fly just to keep with the dreams can come true schtick show some more faith in the children's intelligence please next to rock a doodle this is one of bluth's worst
<START> it's hard to tell the actors from the non actors bad american movies can be spotted by all the youngsters every single line of dialog with you know what bad canadian movies can be spotted by all the youngsters ending every single line of dialog with eh have we learned nothing in a century of filmmaking cannot the entire weight of millions of wannabes descending on hollywood with scripts and reels in hand rescue us from these horrible tv movies made to order
<START> the french either make pro marxist films or anti marxist films with a few in between pour le chocolat is the latter of this genre from the opening credits telling the viewer what music is going to be played and by whom it was who composed you know that you are going to be swathed in middle class pretension it is an old man's film with an excess of 40's plus people it is also directed by an old man along with an old crew who have nothing to say about life to the viewer the plot is not only banal but preposterous how many films reveal the plot through dialogue only to repeat the same message via flashback some five minutes later maybe the director and actors had a low retentive capacity in truth their is no tenable plot at all it is riddle with holes like a good piece of french cheese br br whether intentional or not it is a film about the bourgeoisie at least a third of the film focuses on the piano and the pretentious twaddle espoused in each scene i concede it has some well framed shots though they couldn't have used a steady cam in this film it would have woke them all up other than it being a nonsense story the film allows the upper middle class to parade their values and vanity in a very comfortable swiss location a telling line of the film is when rodolphe pauly tells anna that she need not lock her car while in the resort oh dear me br br on the dvd miss huppert makes a comment about shedding a false tear for a scene smirking she says like they do in the american actor's studio i think miss huppert and the rest of the cast could learn well from the actor's studio br br if there is one statement that stand out in my mind it is when huppert remarks 'we are having friends for the weekend and all the servants are away' no doubt they had all escaped from the mind numbing set lest they be associated with such an appalling film br br safety medical note in the film they show a hot water being covered with ointment and a bandage this should never be done only cold water should be used br br minus 10 marks
