<START> if you're familiar with the work of auteur johnny to and his band of filmmaking cronies over at milky way you know what to expect with this latest production all the familiar elements are in place the strong camaraderie between two characters usually a cop and a baddie the coincidences and chances that turn on a dime and pay off handsomely in the end and the humor that arises even in the most dire of situations br br andy lau plays a man who has 72 hours to live and decides to rob an insurance company lau ching wan also brilliant in other milky way films like longest nite a hero never dies and where a good man goes portrays a hostage negotiator cop who is on the robber's tail even as the robber sets up a series of tricks and clues that he must follow in order to get his man br br funny poignant and cool while being subtle running is actually one of the most entertaining milky way films to date don't miss the performances by the two leads esp andy lau usually considered an average actor who has rarely been this natural and fun to watch this film is one to go out of your way to see
<START> a very disappointing film from oliver stone which unlike his recent epic j f k fails to stimulate any sort of real emotion talk radio is about talk back host 'barry a very loud opinionated man who manages to upset a lot of people and yet still draw an audience most of whom mind you just want to ring up and abuse him his boss in the movie alec baldwin sums up his character very well by saying he's just a shoe salesman with a big mouth and as barry eric bogosian gets death threat upon death threat the final outcome is almost inevitable br br this is the sort of movie that usually has something very powerful to say however talk radio fails to make a serious comment and remains a frustrating pointless film br br thursday september 17 1992 video
<START> stupid horror film about five 20 somethings 3 guys 2 girls going to this place in the middle of nowhere what they don't know is dr chopper and his female assistants attack and kill anybody who ventures in their woods they use their body parts for some experiments or something also five college girls and two lesbians are thrown in to be killed off and show some cleavage br br pretty desperate the story is confusing and boring the gore is laughably fake dr chopper and his assistants overact terribly there's some dreadful black humor in here and people just stand around while their friends are being attacked or just stand there and let the people kill them br br this was pretty insulting there are a few pluses a twist an hour in was pretty good and the five young actors are actually good chase hoyt is great as reese butch hansen is ok as jimmy ashley mccarthy is also good as tamara and robert adamson has his moments as nicholas best of all is chesley crisp as jessica she was excellent some of the dramatic scenes between these five were well acted and interesting unfortunately the dialogue wasn't really there for them i'm giving it a 4 for their performances but nothing else here is worth mentioning hopefully these actors will get roles worthy of them
<START> having loved stephen king's novels and short stories for many years i like most reviewers have been consistently disappointed in the adaptations to film from his printed works a few notable exceptions are stand by me from the body carrie from the novel of the same name and the shawshank redemption from rita and shawshank redemption this movie is by far the worst thing that has ever been produced with stephen king's name attached to it in any way it is no surprise that mr king has pretty much disavowed any connection with it i feel the thing that most offended me about this poorly acted cheaply filmed hideously directed piece of garbage is that they had the audacity to completely change the ending don't waste your time or money on this amazing bow wow of a movie
<START> the subject of this movie is disturbing how could some otherwise intelligent religious hard working and sincere white treat the native blacks so cruelly for so long br br the movie answers this question and also explains how some are changing in a positive way
<START> if you want to see a great little horror comedy with an eerie feel to it this is the one if you are expecting a blood and guts gore flick thats going to scare your pants off then this isn't the one for you br br for the budget that this movie was filmed on the music was particularly amazing even though the film was filmed on a bargain budget the music and audio was definitely better than most movies with a huge budget br br the story was truly well done and the director is to be commended there is an almost perfect blend of comedy to horror in this movie the acting is top notch and leaves room to make a sequel which i am definitely holding out for i have no doubt that this movie will become an instant cult classic br br in a nutshell this movie chronicles the life story of a boy who enters into the career of becoming a grave robber it tells the story in flashback of each of the more fantastic experiences that the robber duo encounters vampires to zombies and even aliens our stars start out as simple grave robbers stealing for jewellery but quickly become body snatchers for a mad doctor angus who requires bodies for his medical practise when the duo find a way to have a vampire dispatch their cruel employer the grave robbers discover that trafficking in undead corpses is much more profitable than just stealing regular dead bodies the only problem is that there is another gang called the house of murphy that is competing for the same undead corpses and thats where both grave robbing gangs clash head to head with dire consequences br br this movie is one of the most refreshing and exciting horror comedies that i have seen in years and reminds me of the evil dead don't miss this one you will regret it
<START> the female hot numbers on this show are breathtaking they can also talk like there's no tomorrow otherwise this show would go into the toilet quickly how much money do they make on all the people who text in with that hope to be called back to win 100 oo or whatever boy now that's a scam can i buy stocks in this money maker let's face it with the technology of now thousands of people could be calling every minute and with ten thousand channels and nothing worth a crap on thousands of people watch this show oh i know this answer is probably a super common line among the listeners with these super hotties constantly saying the needs callers i think it's a bunch of b s frequently someone who does get through sounds amazed that they're actually talking to the host many of them sound depressed and worn out by probably waiting so long and trying so many times to get on and score some pocket change wow the producers must be just raking it in no wonder there are so few commercials commercials are only on to give time for more primarily losers to text in and wait and hope and dream and fantasize about what winning enough money for a tank of gas and a dinner at mc something i only watch it now then on my brothers tv because he likes to watch it when he's on the computer i'll sit there for 15 to 20 minutes and look at mel one of the looking women on tv and laugh at the scam that's in front of me then i have to leave even if i don't people who have an active life can only take this show in extreme moderation mel get yourself into the movies or tv sitcoms or something many of us are infatuated with you even with the super cu ties i'm amazed this show is still on
<START> this film was amazing it was extremely funny and moving damien o'donnell and jeffrey caine have put together a great movie which will appeal to all ages james mcavoy and steven robertson made this film brilliant their acting was excellent there was this real lifelike feeling between them that made you really believe they were the characters they were acting out romola garai is amazingly gorgeous and brilliant in her role the story of these two physically challenged people and their carer is well put over and you really start to grow to know and feel for the characters as the movie goes on it was especially upsetting at the end i would recommend this movie to anyone that loves a truly heart felt movie warning to the more sensitive viewer make sure you have tissues you will need them br br again amazing film
<START> or should i say unintentionally hilarious either way this is one of the best comedies i've seen in a long time i was laughing throughout at the antics of some of the dumbest fictional characters this side of homer simpson it's just one forehead slapping painfully stupid scene after another as the clownish dim witted cardboard cutouts substituting for actual humanoid characters push pull and drag the plot to its inevitable and obvious conclusion br br if i had to describe this movie to someone i'd call it a mutated hybrid of fatal attraction dumb and dumber and the three stooges with a climax uncannily similar to the episode of family guy in which the whole family gets into a knock down fistfight in the living room br br advice to benson family next time you get a new pet do the poor animal a favor and don't name it fred
<START> sorry i couldn't be more expressive in my summary but those two words seemed to describe the movie perfectly this is not only a bad film but a bad film with bad acting and a plot that will be inconsequential to most watchers br br see it only for a naked rebecca de tied to a chain link fence and moaning with supposedly but actually hilarious br br
<START> starting where the last left off an alien chestburster emerges from a dead predator on a predator spaceship and causes the predator space ship to crash into modern day colorado where it breeds several more aliens which start to cause havoc the predator race sends down a lone highly experienced and armed predator to clean up the mess our human characters are caught in the middle of the intergalactic battle br br the biggest problem with this movie is the pacing this movie moves along way too fast the opening credits have only just rolled and already the predator ship crashes into the earth after the alien grows to full hight a hunter and son character are introduced but before we even get to learn their names they are both killed then we see the predator home world and the lead predator flies off to fight the alien infestation and all this happens within the first five minutes this unnatural pace does not let up for the entire movie the national guard comes into town but within two minutes are all killed without even getting a good look at a single ones face the manager of a pizza store gets one scene of character development only to be killed off the very next time we see him once again without even learning his name random hobos a coffee shop waitress and chef are killed again without learning their names one moment our main characters are at home the next running around town the next in a gun store the next in an and this random set jumping over and over just doesn't ever let up leaving the audience no time to settle in leaving them grasping for straws br br another problem is the settings and time frame the movie is set in modern day colorado every other alien and predator movie was shot in enthralling settings such as industrial space ships guerrilla war zone alien planets and underground labyrinths now comes along r set in a small modern day american town with set highlights including a sporting goods store parking lots pizza shops and little girl's bedrooms i mean were they actually trying to make the movie look as dull drab and uninteresting as possible it's hard to perceive these monsters as frightening creatures when they are standing next to a shelf full of or hiding in the bushes outside little girls bedrooms br br continuity is a big issue with this film the alien series was set in the future no human had even heard of an alien before the first film and the aliens not only had never been to earth but if they ever did reach earth humanity would be destroyed this movie ruins that entire concept by being set in modern day with average joes seeing the aliens all over the place and by the end of the movie humanity is not destroyed not even suffering what could be considered minor losses it pisses all over that entire concept of the other movies attempts to maintain continuity are made with massive deus ex the predator just happens to carry around a bottle of unlimited magic blue liquid that's just to melt away any bodies with just a single drop the army at the end of the movie just happens to go to overly drastic measures and drop a nuclear warhead that just conveniently erases all evidence of the aliens existence despite the fact there were many survivors of the incident who are witnesses and many more bad attempts are made at filling up impossible to cover plot holes br br also for a verses movie it has unrelenting bias in favor of the predators for the majority of the film a lone predator manages to kill dozens if not tens of dozens of aliens all at mÃªlÃ©e range while barely gaining a single scratch while the aliens just get slaughtered left right and center like clay pigeons merely waiting their turn to be killed by the predator without putting forth any effort to defend their selves this movie should not be called alien vs predator as much as it should be predator massacres aliens i mean how can you have two species battle it out with suspense and tension when one is portrayed as being vastly superior to the other br br the characters in this film are amongst the biggest flaws not only do they pale in comparison to the characters from the previous alien and predator movies but even as a stand alone movie they are bland dreary and even at times cringe worthy the characters in this movie consist of i kid you not horny couples wanting to get laid pizza delivery boys blonde bimbos high school bullies children and a blatant copy and paste job ripping off ripley and newt the worst and most clichÃ© possible ideas for characters not only that but all of the aforementioned characters are acted by teenagers while the casting of teenagers is an obvious attempt to pull in younger audiences its only effect is to make the movie look and feel like a typical teenybopper slasher porn movie with actors who are too young to have learned how to give a convincing performance with them mostly having completely blank facial expressions delivering monotone dialog not only this but these characters do some of the most cinematically retarded things ever such as using predator guns commenting the powers out when it has been for hours following dumb plans to get out of town rather than just walking out of town somewhat quickly and just so many other idiocies that the movie actually had the audience in my theater sighing out of frustration br br in the end this movie is just a horrible b movie something deserving of the direct to dvd category the fact this movie was a theatrical release me as every part of the movie just ranks of amateur work
<START> michael caine usually appears in either very good blame it on rio sleuth without a clue gambit dirty rotten scoundrels or truly bad comedies noises off death becomes her harry walter go to ny this falls into the latter category br br ta is a comedy that succeeds in only two things managing to waste a cast that includes caine and richardson all of which have comedic abilities and succeeding in its mission not to make the viewer laugh there isn't a single truly funny moment here the main reason is the lousy script there was so much futile effort put into writing a pointlessly convoluted story which is simply too bothersome to follow considering it's only a comedy that the writer s forgot to make the damn thing funny which as far as i can recall is what the whole point of a comedy is supposed to be br br i've never seen this moron before some people even say if you're a moron fan you'll love this bla bla bla a moron fan does this non descript person really have fans a comedy as badly written as this requires a mega talent to eke out a laugh or two out of it someone like steve coogan and not your average moron br br if you're going to make a comedy about actors then at least make them out to be the utter morons that they usually are the characters of caine and moron are insufficiently dumb br br the single most annoying thing about this unfunny collection of scenes is the little girl only a truly horrible writer would think that to spice up a lousy script it's wise to include a super intelligent wise ass kid smart a kids aren't even funny to bill cosby fans any more in little miss sunshine we had a totally normal kid and she was very funny this stupid ol' the kid is smarter than the adults shtick belongs to a century old marx brothers film
<START> alas another costner movie that was an hour too long credible performances but the script had no where to go and was in no hurry to get there first we are offered an unrelated string of events few of which further the story will the script center on randall and his wife randall and fischer how about fischer and thomas in the end no real front story ever develops and the characters themselves are artificially propped up by monologues from third parties the singer explains randall randall explains fischer on and on finally long after you don't care anymore you will learn something about the script meetings three endings were no doubt proffered and no one could make a decision the end result all three were used one after another after another if you can hang in past the 100th yawn you'll be able to pick them out despite the transparent attempt to gain points with a dedication to the coast guard this one should have washed out the very first day
<START> oh my god obviously when you rent or buy this you're not expecting to see a documentary on the mating habits of small rodents in their natural habitats you're expecting a visual feast of blood and gore and and maybe even a scare or two well for those who are as sick and twisted as myself you won't find many scares but you'll come very close to urinating all over yourself in laughter the catch phrases in this movie will stay with you and your friends forever the first time i showed this to my friends and colleagues was over 3 years ago but still we laugh our asses off and use the catch phrases it's as addictive and funny as sam raimi's the evil dead ii dead by dawn and peter jackson's dead alive braindead from the opening scene's absolutely ridiculous dialog to the splatter and gore department's finest works to the wondrous abilities of ed the film cutter you will laugh and laugh again as far as the visual feast of blood and gore oh yeah they've got it and they're pretty damn good at it the neck bone's connected to the head bone this film also may have done the best nightmare hallucination totally effing nuts scene i have ever seen and that one's not mean to be funny but man is it well done and creepy overall to anyone who is not against a bunch of blood and a damn good time if you ever see this movie get it it's on netflix i know that for sure
<START> had the pleasure to see this film at the big bear film festival where it won the audience award and i have to say it was well deserved because boy next door is a very funny short film the script is well written and keeps things escalating it also has a great current of suspense coursing through it you don't know what's going to happen next as the main character tries to deal with the realization that his new neighbor might not be the most ideal person to be living across from him the jokes are quick and unexpected the plot keeps us guessing the dialog feels very real i thought the direction was first rate and the director travis davis shows a lot of potential for making it big in the world of studio comedies not small praise considering he also is the lead actor of the film so he had to do triple duty on this writing directing and starring if you get a chance to see this film on itunes it's worth the download it'll make you laugh out loud a few times and that's more than most shorts offer these days
