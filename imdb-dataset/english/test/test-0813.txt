<START> breaking dawn starts in a californian college as professor simon associate producer joe morton tells his students that they have to perform an intensive six week study of a mental patient in cape state hospital as a crucial part of their education fail they will never become qualified doctors a bright young attractive intelligent student named eve kelly is given a particularly difficult patient to study his name is don wake james haven is a convicted killer he was found covered in blood besides the dead body of a woman diane verona her young daughter mccurdy at first don won't even look at eve much less talk to her but like the trooper she is eve persists in trying to figure him out eventually don begins to talk but what he says frightens eve he says that someone is watching her mentions the name eve then begins to see a dark shadowy figure at her every turn as don churns out the conspiracy theories bizarre statements eve slowly begins to lose her mind as the line between fantasy reality becomes more more blurred is there something more to the supposed nonsense that don talks other than being the insane ravings of a psychiatric patient br br written directed by mark edwin robinson i have nothing but negative feelings towards breaking dawn now we all like a good twist ending the sort of ending which catches us unawares surprises us works well with the rest of the film stays in our memory like the cool twist endings to the sixth sense 1999 fight club 1999 to name just two good examples to a lesser extent the endings to films such as scream 1996 where the identity of the killer comes a nice surprise isn't that obvious then of course there are films whose endings spoil everything that has gone before as an example lets take oh i don't know lets say breaking dawn because i have never seen such an awful ending to a film never breaking dawn starts out as a decent psychological horror thriller with spooky things starting to happen to eve it's not the most action packed film ever by any stretch of the imagination but it holds ones interest it's not the most absorbing film ever either but it is more than watchable it's not that bad a film until the twist ending i have to keep mentioning it because everything else up to that point which was ok to be fair to it suddenly becomes irrelevant i am sure there are people out there who think they have this muddled mess of an ending figured out down to the last detail all i can say is that no one will be able to explain this thing in a satisfactory way to me as far as i'm concerned it doesn't make a bit of sense never will breaking dawn is crap it's a waste of time watching it to be rewarded with the lamest ending in film history it's as simple straight forward as that br br director robinson doesn't half make a mess of what could have been a decent thriller maybe he thought what he had shot would play out ok or maybe it was ruined in the editing room but i'd imagine it was more likely down to a rubbish script as he tries to tie all the absurdities together within the space of a few muddled minutes give us all a happier than happy final shot he builds the tension quite well during the first 80 odd minutes but it's all for nought at the end of the day br br technically breaking dawn is fine it is generally well made throughout the acting is pretty good is nice easy on the eyes puts in a decent performance was it just me or did the guy who played don look like john star of such italian sleaze classics as cannibal apocalypse 1980 city of the living dead 1980 the house on the edge of the park 1980 cannibal ferox 1981 1987 the church 1989 ok maybe it was just me br br breaking dawn is rubbish i hated it all because of the final few minutes don't get me wrong it wasn't exactly getting me excited up to that point but it was ok definitely one to avoid as far as i'm concerned although it seems to have it's fair share of positive comments on the imdb
<START> i collect films on super 8 and managed to snag a full length print of this one last week on e bay it looks like at least for the moment this is the only way to see this film in a country having ntsc video i have seen it available on region 2 dvd many times but never region 1 br br i just finished watching it a few minutes ago and i am amazed by it it's a powerful testament to freedom and finding your own place in the world the photography and music were wonderful and i really felt empathy for some of the characters br br i kind of like the idea that i was probably the only one in the usa watching when the north wind blows tonight br br long live
<START> this movie is really sick and funny i have made my friends cringe describing it to them i saw it about 8 months ago and i still have the song 'shall we gather at the river' echoing through my head br br so basically it is a romeo and juliet but it goes beyond what you would expect let's just say incest references to child molestation gore of course but unfortunately has a sort of happy ending sort of it's more weird than happy cappy capulet was brilliant he has this sort of intellectual snobbish tone he's abusive but civilised he quotes more shakespeare than anyone else in the film all while engaging in his sadistic role as a husband and father br br the meat guy was pretty cool too he was fiancÃ© deeply infatuated with her and soon to be heartbroken because of tromeo and tromeo a true romantic he's a handsome really sweet guy desperate to find true love 'she doth make torches to burn brightly ' unfortunately troma just had to resort to that awful fake green vomit and their other antics they really get carried away with that stuff sometimes but hey this film made a great impression on me how often do i refer to it in real life situations wow that's pathetic br br anyway enjoy
<START> it is disappointing to see as talented an actor as amitabh bachchan in such a weak role especially when he was beyond sensational in black which i highly recommend one line in the film states is not a mere man he is a thought and a philosophy director ram gopal varma credits the godfather as an inspiration for this movie and perhaps that is the problem it seems like a badly mangled american movie set in india the left elbow index considers seven elements of film making acting continuity plot character development dialogue artistry and production sets on a scale from a high of 10 to a low of 1 with 5 given as a average score the film continuity seems high an 8 by maintaining a violent tone infused with drama in places and using justice outside the legal system as motivation however there seems to be a lack of emotion connected with the evil of organized crime the acting rates a 4 it appears too weak even when someone is being beaten or murdered it seems for example when one character is shot in the forehead i found myself wondering if or when he was going to fall he does not and ala ronald reagan he is placed in an automobile with his bleeding face cradled ala john f kennedy the plot rates a 5 as an example of american style gangsterism with a family oriented at its head character development appears static and the characters seem like chess pieces on an abandoned chess board thereby earning a rank of 3 the dialogue seems stilted and appears to be forced to fit some bowery pattern of speech a 4 for dialogue production sets look to be below average a 4 and artistry is puzzling with far too many close ups too rapid panning and too many group scenes where the actors seem over rehearsed a 3 to me too much camera movement is disruptive the average of the left elbow index is 4 4 and with a slight deduction based on poor it moves down to a 4 two questions continually arise in the film one why are so many people eating so often and two does not india have its own brand of organized crime do films like this have to be so dependent on western cultural examples as much as i like amitabh bachchan i cannot recommend this film
<START> i loved so much last movie the masterpiece di it had a great screenplay great actors well have to say castellitto is so much greater than others a brillant use of lights for a great cinematography br br well notte is a different story ridiculous screenplay erupting tons of morals and we could speak weeks about politics you know we are italians poor cinematography it's too simple representing '70s dark years with dark colors and dark lights do some efforts more peoples bad use of music what's the point of using psychedelia to represent the tragic rationality of br br and to all the people who claimed the main prize in venice i answer are you nuts maybe the russian film was bad but not as bad as this br br i'm down with the p e don't believe the hype
<START> hey there army sgt i'm sorry dude but being a sgt in the army and being in the army national guard does not make you qualified to comment on a marine movie you are not a marine and just because you wear a uniform doesn't mean you can relate to being a marine we simply are the best we have the hardest training yes we have big heads about ourselves but hey when you are the best you like to strut your stuff i was in the iraq invasion and in i fought next to soldiers you are not qualified to say anything about my marine corps i hate to be the one that starts the whole which branch is better but you have no right to say you are qualified to judge a marine movie oh yeah we are drill instructors not drill that's the biggest clue you have no idea about what you are talking about yeah we do not curse at recruits anymore tell me how is cussing at someone going to make them a better marine how will me hitting someone make a marine a better marine yes it is a kinder boot camp from what i went through but we are dealing with different times and people we are training people who are over all smarter than our generations recruits we want smarter recruits not meaner and anyone who signs up to be a marine in the first place has a dedication to be the best his country has to offer we don't have to reinforce that in marines come to wanting to be killers we don't need to teach them that by them by swearing at them and beating them at least that is how i feel and yes i am qualified to say that i have been on the battlefield numerous times and i have trained marines and recruits who eventually ended up on the battlefield but then again what do i know i was just there done that got the t shirt sgt of the army get a clue
<START> some would argue that argentinean director esteban la is an exercise in anachronistic futility that while the silent films to which pays homage were at the cutting edge of cinema when they were made they are outdated today leaving la a meaningless oddity br br i would disagree fervently la melds the conventions of the silent film with 21st century technology making it the ultimate exercise in post modern film making br br the film is set in the timeless the city without a voice so called because the citizens have been rendered speechless by mr tv a dictator media mogul with his hair painted on the city resembles the titular one in fritz lang's seminal metropolis 1927 perhaps 100 years before that film it is all expressionist skyscrapers tv and animated billboards br br the citizens of the city are mollified by la the voice the only person with the gift of speech her face perpetually shrouded by a hood kept on even when she is naked la is forced to sing on mr tv's television network but when mr tv concocts a plan to steal the written word as well la and her eyeless son join forces with a renegade family in an attempt to return the freedom of speech to the people br br la is nothing but pure cinema burdening himself with the conventions of the silent film has to rely upon images to tell his story there is sound most notably in the almost continuous score by leo it evokes the best of silent movie music as well as working itself into the film's such as the beeping of car horns or the rhythmic ra ta tat tat of gunfire and underlying the whole film is a familiar as if it were being shown on an ancient projector br br there is a fair amount of dialogue as well but instead of using intertitles has the characters' words appear in the frame they are larger or smaller filling the screen or hovering meekly in the air depending on what is being said think a more imaginative version of the subtitles in night watch 2004 br br thankfully the words don't distract from the images which is very fortunate indeed because la boasts some of the most creative and original images we've seen in a long time all captured by cristian sumptuous black and white photography there are the expressionist cityscapes the hooded singer and her eyeless son there is the city's abandoned aerial which looks like the decayed remains of some colossal spider and there's the sinister dr y whose jabbering mouth is displayed on a television screen attached to his face br br la has been criticised for relying too much on its imagery while skimping on the allegorical depth but again i would disagree it is true that the sudden appearance of a mind control machine shaped like a swastika or the eyeless boy seemingly crucified on a star of david feels out of place a tad over the top in what is otherwise merely a well crafted fairy tale br br but the lack of overt symbols the two previous examples aside works in the film's favour it allows us to make up our own minds to decide whether to infer political meaning to see la as an allegory for fascism the danger of capitalist monopolies and the power and responsibility of the media or to just take the film at face value as a visually stunning adventure through a world simultaneously unique and familiar br br the sacrifice of explicit depth in favour of unique imagery may seem like a compromise but really when a film looks as good as this it's hard to care there is more imagination and artistry in every frame of la than hollywood can shake a derivative stick at evoking films almost 100 years old might be futile but in doing so may be showing us what is lacking in the films of today he may be telling us that it is time for another artistic revolution and he may be right
<START> my take steven seagal is obviously too boring to be a lead in an action thriller even a totally dull one br br remember steven seagal you don't don't worry there's not much to catch up on after starring in admittedly enjoyable crowd pleasing films like under siege and executive decision seagal hits the low grounds of the bad movie abyss now he stars in low budgeted b level action vehicles some of which are made for tv movie of the week entries that lost their way to the big screen half past dead is among these shall we say dead action movies a loud and lousy action film sloppily directed and lazily written and worse badly acted this is one of those bad movies that i don't need to watch until the ending to know it's bad i didn't have the guts to have all my braincells die while wasting my time with this it it this kind of bad films in which you realize those other films you hate are not bad after all br br the plot and the locale is completely lifted from a similar picture michael bay's the rock although similar may not be the word to describe it both movies are summer movies and not meant to be taken so seriously but in comparison even the rock which isn't much in the writing department as much as the lights and sounds has better characters a more compelling plot better action sequences and overall a more entertaining atmosphere although there are action scenes in half past dead none of them are exciting all of which are sometimes tedious and predictable br br although predictability seemed to be a welcome asset in summer action films predictability has never tasted more sour in ones that aren't fun and half past dead is never really fun a lot of times it's just a pain in the head hearing the bad rap music repeat over and over again throughout this film makes me yearn for an aspirin every second i hear them the acting is horrendously mediocre the plot is derivative with no compelling or appealing characters whatsoever seagal's character an undercover agent sent to alcatraz to stop a criminal mastermind morris chestnut a very boring villain is nothing to get excited about seagal's character is also provided with a sidekick played by rap star ja rule and a bunch of amigo inmates and there's no chemistry going on here br br if starring in a series of other forgotten action vehicles what were those films again killed of seagal's career for good half past dead is overkill and audiences be warned you're invited to feel the pain advice avoid it at all costs br br rating 0 out of 5
<START> american movie is a wonderful documentary it follows the trials and tribulations of a very determined independent filmmaker as he struggles to finish his first film br br the raw footage and insightful content of this film is an excellent example of how documentaries should be produced i also feel that the film can very inspirational to those of us that want to be filmmakers ourselves
<START> wow there's a lot of venom directed at this movie and a lot of it is deserved but it's not the worst movie of all time that's probably zoolander br br anyway if you're high on something really drunk or just in the mood for a b minus minus movie that you can make fun of this may be your cup of tea br br yes as others said the first part of the movie makes you think you're watching an updating of the bram stoker novel two of the main characters are named van helsing and mina the ship is the and they're in the carpathian galaxy you later find that van helsing is a descendant of the original and he just happens to be on a ship in the 30th century with dracula br br oh yeah and to add to the originality this spooky ghost ship movie has another character named ash sound familiar br br there's paper thin character development and anachronisms like the aforementioned manual wheelchair and coolio and tom lister talking 20th century black slang but what really makes the movie ridiculous is the ending if that's what happens to the characters then the previous two hours have been a waste br br like i said it you want a dumb movie to play mystery science theater with and your mind is in approximately the same mode required for viewing the great vegetable rebellion episode of lost in space then you may find this diverting otherwise put a stake in it it's done
<START> this film is a great comedy drama christopher walken is tremendous in his supporting role as manager and his commentary will keep you laughing robin williams plays a great role as a quick wit jon stewart and will amuse you if you are fans of comedy central the show is good because if the viewer has half a brain they will see it as a very needed sub cultural attack on the policies of the current republican government and a criticism on the american democratic process not to mention the means by which most politicians get elected br br i was amused at the sub plots and found the film to be very fast paced and entertaining without any of the usual oh brother's i would agree the film is less comedy than marketed however without question better than 90 of the garbage in theatres at present just my thoughts don
<START> oz is the tv show which is intensive non stop adrenaline its a show which is not aimed at a large audience but a specific one as its themes are very adult orientated it obviously did not achieve mainstream success as this was an impossibility but had much fame with its audience and many famous actors either guest starred or became part of the show br br oz is a series of fictional stories based on a prison located somewhere in the new york state there are many different ethnic groups which play a somewhat equal role in being represented these groups are the muslims homeboys aryans bikers italians latinos irish christians gays and others some have some form of affiliation with each other such as the bikers and aryans whilst the aryans are the enemy's of numerous groups such as the muslims and the homeboys br br in oswald its official name there is a policy that not too many members from any one ethnic group may be allowed it is the maximum security prison and the regular prison where sometimes prisoners are sent to or from in the show is called general population or gen pop the main character of the show is augustus hill who also narrates the story before and after the main segments crossed between a documentary type and a biographical one hill is bound to wheelchair usage as a consequence of his unknown past he is part of the others group which features individuals which don't fit into the other prison gangs br br of the many groups it is the smaller ones which are able to keep themselves avoided by trouble most of the times as the larger ones are busy in conflict with one another are few of the most noteworthy characters are as follows 1 ryan o'reilly is in charge of his fellow irishmen and somehow always voluntarily gets himself involved in lethal activity for the weakest link 2 miguel alvarez is the watched latino who has constant struggles with coping with his popularity within his own gang and with others 3 simon is the who was the former leader of the homeboys gang hes also very physically quite large and solid these two reasons are why he is one of the most powerful inmates inside of oz 4 said is the muslim and black nationalist who is a very defined in his opinions and desires he fights for the rights of his people on many levels through the show from his own muslim group to his wider black group and even fighting for all the groups against the unjust rules of authority he character seems in some ways identical to malcom x the famous black rights fighter who was also muslim br br all in all for its genre oz is possibly the greatest fictional prison show or show based on ethnic relations if it doesn't sound as if your own type of series it probably shouldn't be tried out but if it does interest then it is definitely worth viewing the biggest problem with the show is how it is addictive some may feel wrong viewing a lot of this kind of material researchers argue on whether it is harmful or not but in the end it is just a reflection of the society of the world we live in today this means that it is as an informant and an indicator of the world than an aggressor
<START> friz freleng's 'all r r d' is one of the best sylvester and tweety cartoons unlike the many repetitive cartoons in the series which simply transplant the same tired gags to a new setting 'all r r d' makes the most of its concept tweety and sylvester are domestic pets who are being sent unattended across country by train with both a watchful official and a vicious bulldog to deal with sylvester has his work cut out the sylvester and tweety cartoons always benefited from some extra participants and 'all r r d' is a good example of how much these additional characters help although they are not especially memorable creations they throw some more obstacles in sylvester's path and make for a more interesting battle this early sylvester and tweety short presses many of the right buttons and while tweety is often particularly irritating with his forced cuteness there's some deliciously violent antics between sylvester and the dog culminating in a surprisingly brutal climax which is unfortunately marred by a final unfunny non quip by tweety
<START> normally i don't bother wasting my time writing comments for junk like this that i forget almost as soon as i see it but since i saw this movie just yesterday on one of the comcast showtime channels i think i decided to make an exception br br besides the fact that i enjoyed watching carol alt i can't give any rational reason why i watched this movie through to the end i'm always amazed that good looking women are willing to appear in awful movies like this but i suppose she thought this movie would lead to something better i hope she was right for her sake br br otherwise this is an all too typical straight to video laugh riot or just a piece of garbage depending on your point of view while there are a few decent moments of action in this movie they don't really connect well with the story such as it is br br the setup as i recall involved carol alt as a depressed housewife who believes her husband a cop is cheating on her there was also something about their child dying in an accident and she blaming him for it but before that storyline went anywhere she shot and killed him br br on the same fateful night a wounded stranger comes to her door and she tends to him and almost immediately her house is under siege by government stooges and mercenaries intent on capturing the stranger who appears to have almost superhuman fighting skills br br this same kind of material has yielded decent entertainment plenty of times before most notably in matt damon's the bourne identity and could have done so this time as well but this particular movie was let down by poor production values and a lousy script br br this movie really falls apart at the end when the mysterious stranger turns out to be a cyborg who was programmed to be a policeman and after discovering that carol alt killed her husband he tries to kill her the movie wasn't particularly good up until this point but the ending really ruins it by trying to turn a modest action thriller into a lumpy terminator robocop wannabe br br i also thought that the violence in the movie was a bit excessive at the end with the demented cyborg gouging out poor carol eye before it finally bit the dust what was the point of that for that matter what was the point of anything in this movie it held my attention and entertained me for about an hour until the end when it reminded me that i wasn't watching a first rate movie it wasn't even really a second rate movie for that matter br br the final scenes seem to hint at a sequel which i don't think ever happened although i haven't carefully checked the web for it needless to say that i'm not in any hurry to see any sequel to this movie
<START> in extramarital we see b actress traci lords at her very best she's all wrapped in horror suspense here a type of role that suits her very well br br this mainstream movie lends a lot of its atmosphere from paul verhoeven's 'basic instinct' 1992 by the way however there are differences between the main female characters of traci lords '99 and that of sharon stone '92 for instance in extramarital traci adds some tiny elements from her porn past we also shouldn't forget mentioning three main actors by putting down a convincing performance each of them greatly contributes to the overall quality of this movie br br all this makes extramarital into a very enjoyable b movie its storyline shows a good build up its tense being well spread from start to finish this movie keeps you at the edge of your seat until its unexpected end
