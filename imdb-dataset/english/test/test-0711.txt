<START> the bad news the canadian version of beast in the cellar released by maple pictures that i saw was of poor quality dark and washed out it appeared to be dubbed haphazardly from a vhs tape it even skips at one point due to some missing frames br br the good news this movie is so bad that the poor quality of the dvd detracted little from my viewing enjoyment this horror movie fails to build tension and lacks scares it is a horror film while most frightening films have limited dialog beast in the cellar is a so much so that a character will repeat something we have just heard said by two other characters presumably all the chit chat acts as filler for a very low budget unimaginative movie unfortunately the dialog isn't campy enough to make it worth a watch
<START> that snarl br br that scowl br br the acts of random violence br br the voice br br the fetish wear br br that shaven head br br it can mean only one thing br br grace jones is back br br actually my sources tell me that the title role in blade wasn't played by the 1980s diva but by wesley snipes br br all in all this is not an improvement br br blade is an adaptation of a comic character somehow in the transfer from the simplistic two dimensional world of the printed page it has become even more simplistic and lost a couple of dimensions br br the plot is hackneyed almost beyond belief and adds nothing to the vampire genre in fact much like nosferatu it seems to suck the life out of the audience in brief upwardly mobile vampire wants to become more powerful but is opposed by blade half human half vampire all annoying it all climaxes with blade being put in a vampire juice press some bad martial arts and the most pitiful cgi since 1968 br br blade has to be the least empathic character since dolph lundgren's punisher also a comic adaptation perhaps there is a trend here surely the audience is meant to be on the same side as the 'hero' and whilst a vampire can be a tragic character this is not true of blade he is relentlessly cruel scornful and not a whole lot better than the bad guys br br i assume that wesley snipes has an 'acting' career purely so that everyone else can be compared favourably as he snarls his way through his movie you find yourself looking for a stake even a pen anything to put blade in the grave br br as a piece of narcissism blade is pretty much unbeatable we are treated to endless lingering shots of a gym fresh snipes for no reason whatsoever likewise no other actor is allowed any chance to give a reasonable performance the likes of steven dorff can act but they have to play second fiddle to snipes' tedious performance br br kris kristofferson used to appear in good movies here he is reduced to a sidekick that you just know isn't going to make it through to the final reel and what happens when blade finds out yes you guessed it he rushes to the scene to wreak his revenge in the villain's giant underground lair br br why can't world domination take place in a quiet country house they always go ahead in underground cathedrals that would have had albert speer wondering if they were a little grandiose a lot of these plans could be stopped right now if local councils paid more attention to plans for extending sub basements br br the rest of the movie is just as dull and unimaginative with nothing new to add to the genre vampires have been done to undeath and perhaps they should be laid to rest for a while at least until someone can think of some way to make them interesting again br br to finish there is a grace jones vampire movie it's called vamp and it's about ten times better than this
<START> this is just another one of those american finds romance with charming foreigner in exotic european locale this genre has been cinematically bankrupt since the 1950s yet they continue to churn them out i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it if all you want to see is tuscany try watching stealing beauty with liv tyler a marginally better movie br br this types of genre movies are very hallmark greeting card ish
<START> if you want to see a brilliant performance of played to perfection with expert timing and panache don't watch this version if you want to see a hammy version with eric idle strutting around in 1930's english gentlemen's private club society this is the one to watch it's a lot of fun and a good intro to gilbert and sullivan but after this rush out and rent the canadian version you'll see the difference between good and great nobody does g s better than brian mcdonald and the group
<START> i am sorry to see that surface has not been picked up for the nbc 2006 2007 season i guess market demand for inane game and reality shows on broadcast television a reflection on our sense of culture has conquered a good story i hope and pray that some network picks it up so it will continue on as does stargate and it's spin offs br br i also hope the producers find a venue where they can produce the level of post production they wished for in a tv guide interview right now the reruns on sci fi marathons will have to do i for one would love to see where the story goes after the tsunami that ended episode 15 i would like to find out the mastermind of the efficient effort to the real identity of the creatures br br
<START> as an avid disney fan i was not totally impressed by this movie certainly not motivated enough to catch it in the theaters i am however so glad that i caught it on dvd and watched the special features br br you must check out the moose commentary the entire movie can be viewed with commentary from and the comic relief moose of the story who are voiced by rick moranis and dave thomas two veterans of the famous second city comedy troupe ad lib in character for an hour and a half about a movie that they are clearly fond of i laughed the whole time the enjoyment i got from this commentary completely made up for the tepid reaction i had to the film itself do yourself a favor and listen to it
<START> i came across this movie in an australian hotel room at 3 am my brother and i were channel surfing and who do we see but a young russel crowe but not the telephone throwing russel crowe we had come to know and quasi love back in the states this movie much to my surprise was amazingly creative and hilarious it stars a cast of awkward teens with hilarious stories of odd sexual experiences including a slick salesman prostitutes and an unusual sexy mother if you are lucky enough to come across this film i would strongly suggest picking it up i have to say this movie was amazingly entertaining and i thank the fine people of australia making it
<START> viewers should already by keen on other offbeat b grade desert based films such as bagdad cafe or repo man which more or less takes place in the desert it also models some of the bizarre humor and especially eccentric trail of characters of writer joseph comedy 'after hours ' in a sort of desert roadtrip fantasy a metaphor of temptation and redemption gus played well by jordan christopher michael a clever 10 year old boy cashes in his piggy bank steals a mustang and runs away from his grossly neglecting parents it begins as a trip through salvation which is apparent in the scenes with john diehl but once he becomes hooked on a scratch off game called he becomes easily tainted by temptation and looses his childish innocence he travels from one crazy fictional state to another concocting ways of getting cards from participating gas stations just enough so that he might spell out the prize winning word m o t o r a m a and be eligible for the 500 million cash prize br br along the way he is embattled with dozens of strange characters such as flea who plays a high strung busboy meatloaf who plays a crazy biker and mary woronov and sandy baron a seinfeld regular as two violent kidnappers br br the dvd can be very deceptive as have previous attempts to sell this film to the non cult market first with taglines comparing it to home alone and thelma louise the newest calling it a love story with the tagline implying that the film is about jordan michael christopher on an adventure to meet the girl of his dreams which despite the size of her picture on the dvd cover is actually only about a 1 second cameo by drew barrymore as the fantasy girl that gus dreams about why didn't they just market it for what it was thought it may seem totally bizarre on first viewing it is actually a well designed narrative br br is great material for fans of strange b grade comedies this was quite an interesting story and particularly because of the strength of its lead actor jordan michael christopher who unfortunately has few other screen credits of note and the clever metaphor inherent in the plot hopefully its re release on dvd will make it an easier find for cult fans
<START> compared to director kevin connor's later arabian adventure this is a masterpiece however that's not saying much in fact at the earth's core is a silly fantasy adventure in which peter cushing who appears to be on something strong and some other actor whom i don't know use a giant digging machine called the iron mole dig their way down to the earth's core only to find that the inside of the earth is pink and populated by ape like creatures who have enslaved the humans there's also a giant bird that controls the apes by means of telepathy and we get to see it blink its eyes in closeup throughout the film most importantly cushing and what's his name also encounter the lovely caroline munro in the subterranean caves and here's what i've really got against this little flick why oh why is it that whenever munro's in a movie she only gets approx 5 minutes of screen time in the spy who loved me maniac dracula ad 1972 golden voyage of sinbad always she's in the background how can kevin connor possibly think that we'd rather listen to peter cushing's fake accent and look at some ridiculous ape man whose voice sounds like a scratched cd than gaze at the beautiful munro i don't get it please somebody direct a movie where this english brunette is on screen all the time
<START> i just get exited when the movie start because i saw juliette lewis name on the screen the script seemed very complicated first but as the movie continued it became understandably clear i concentrated well on it but the result was disappointing because the object of sex used too much on the film unnecessarily and it seemed to me that the director ignore ones who has tendency upon opposite sex in my opinion the well prepared script couldn't be embodied as we look at the cast the movie promises something in the beginning or i just expected too much and finally the end the end is so so much mediocre that i wouldn't expect the main character cassandra wants to give message about having baby and how a baby can change a life in my opinion that scene is the real disaster for the film all in all the characters are funny and acted beautifully but only cast can't save a movie
<START> disappointing comedy drama with sentimental coating has michael j fox ideally cast as a former child star who now runs a talent agency for thespian tots nathan lane and cyndi lauper are his assistants this all sounds as if it can't miss however too much of the scenario is given over to strident christina vidal as a streetwise tyke whom fox believes will be the next big thing they lock quickly lock heads and the bantering dialogue takes them back and forth to an uninteresting formula finish fox and lane are both appealing but the energy of the early scenes gives way to treacle slickly produced but ultimately stale 1 2 from
<START> the kissing bandit was the third and final film that frank sinatra and kathryn grayson co starred at mgm with the first two were anchors aweigh and it happened in brooklyn and in both sinatra wooed and lost grayson i guess the third time's the charm br br for romance maybe but definitely not for screen image sinatra in his forty's films once again plays the nice little schnook only this time in pants on tyrone power's territory laid out in the mark of zorro sinatra plays the son of a man who was a hotel owner by day and the kissing bandit by night he's gone and left california for an education and has come back ready to take dad's place but in the hotel business only and where does he learn the hotel business boston br br of course some of dad's former gang members grown a little old and paunchy led by j carrol naish want him to lead the gang again but frank's just not cut out for the outlaw life but he does make a good impression on the governor's daughter kathryn grayson br br somebody must have had it in for sinatra at mgm to cast him in this after the bad reviews he got in miracle of the bells frank's in a part that was more suitable for red skelton but since this was a musical i guess the brain trust at mgm figured kathryn grayson had to have a singing co star br br in fact the best number in the film are for her love is where you find it also ricardo montalban ann miller and cyd charisse do a dance specialty that is nice frank's songs are nice but nothing spectacular br br in later years sinatra would wince at the mention of the kissing bandit and with good reason
<START> a tight knit musical family cranky benevolent father and four vivacious adolescent daughters is up rooted by first the appearance of felix a dashing young composer and secondly and most profoundly mickey his attractive friend br br it takes a while for michael curtiz to get this piece of americana floating the first part looks almost like a paraphrasing of a cereal commercial not without a certain quaint highly bourgeois charm and then john garfield enters the scene as the doomed mickey making his first appearance in motion pictures with mussed up black curls sleepy hung over eyes rude and disheveled the absolute opposite to jeffrey lynn's smoothly persuasive madly charming felix garfield is in complete and direly needed counterpoint to the rest of the household nothing i would do would surprise me he muses and suddenly the movie becomes interesting although i agree with critics that find the plot turns insufficiently motivated br br the four sisters are rather blandly played and seriously underwritten but claude rains as the has his moments br br watch it for garfield though he is the only really lasting thing about it
<START> i am still waiting for years a new dvd issue of this marvelous film i own a beta max recording with french language unfortunately mgm omits the french track on his recent dvd just english spoken an french subtitles i don't know how make mgm to be advised i wrote emails to them but of course no answer if i insist it's because exceptionally the dubbing track in french was spectacular funny well written etc george c scott acting is always outstanding and for people born like me during the 50ies diana rigg represents something very different than madonna for example thanks for help kind regards
<START> the hand of death aka countdown in kung fu 1976 is a vastly underrated early work by director john woo the film stars dorian tan tan tao liang and features jackie chan sammo hung and james in significant supporting roles many people believe or have been lead to believe by deceptive advertising that this is a jackie chan film this is not a jackie chan film dorian tan is the star but jackie gives one of his best most serious early performances br br the hand of death is about a shaolin disciple named tan who is sent on a mission to assassinate a shaolin traitor named and protect a revolutionary named zhang yi woo along his journey meets up with a young named tan chan and a disgraced sword fighter chang chung known as the wanderer both men have suffered at the hands of and want to take revenge the three team up to defeat and his eight bodyguards and escort the revolutionary to safety br br the martial arts action is above average under the direction of sammo hung dorian tan uses his trademark high kicks very effectively as the northern eighteen styles kicks along with some southern five styles boxing sammo hung and jackie chan provide excellent martial arts performances as well james is not the greatest martial artist on the jade screen but does an acceptable job some of the early fights are a bit slow and seem over choreographed but the final showdowns featuring chan tan and hung are very good br br director john woo provides plenty of interesting character development in the film which is refreshing the cinematography by leung wing kat is very stylish unique and beautiful for a kung fu film of this era joseph music a combination of soft flutes and 70's shaft style orchestral pieces is kung fu cinema at its best hand of death is not jackie and sammo's usual kung fu comedy hand of death is a serious straightforward revenge driven story br br hand of death aka countdown in kung fu is an underrated classic in the old school kung fu genre the film is one of the best artistically of its time and a preview of the great things to come from jackie chan and sammo hung hung's great choreography is put on display here before his directorial debut and chan's early charisma and talent can be clearly seen br br hand of death is a solid stylish old school kung fu film and a brilliant early work of the legendary john woo br br kung fu genre rating 7 5 10 br br wanderer to tan referring to his new weapon the little eagle wing god lance br br tan just a
