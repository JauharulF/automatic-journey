<START> i just checked out northanger abbey from the local library and wasn't expecting much imagine my suprise at this gothic treat northanger abbey is one of the most eerie places that you have ever seen with empty passageways and ornate rooms full of hidden secrets the glory of the movie is that it never reveals all your imagination runs free running with the imagination of the main character one m she is a girl of wild imaginations a reader of gothic fantasy that she brings into her and our real world br br if i were to use one word to describe this excellent movie it would be surrealistic dreams are woven throughout the movie enhancing the mood sometimes it is hard to tell what is real and what is not this is intentional i believe br br atmosphere reigns supreme the music is not what you'd expect of a movie by jane austen it is eerie flute and drum based high and haunting with an undercurrent of fear if a soft pleasant tune were playing in northanger abbey it would be positively inviting now it is foreboding a grim and stark walled palace of madmen but the characters you shall have to see them for yourself br br if you are looking for a most enjoyable evening look no further than northanger abbey
<START> tyra banks needs to teach these girls that it's not all about being beautiful on the outside the inside counts for something too a lot of the past winners have looked semi decent but are horribly cruel and starting trouble for the other girls i see tyra less involved with the girls in every season about the only thing worth watching top model for is mr jay manuel recently tyra had a contestant who was a pre op transsexual i felt that she should have done more to encourage her it was obvious that she had insecurities about her original anatomy showing through her feminine look tyra should have given her tips or perhaps she could have sent resident ms jay to help the girl out instead the contestant was met with harsh criticism and not enough positive criticism it's a shame because i truly enjoyed the first 3 seasons there's a reason why project runway has all 4 seasons out on dvd and top model only has 1 season on dvd it's called taste top model seriously needs a lot of an some more humanity
<START> despite a few acceptable adaptations of the books' main themes queen of the damned the vampire lestat did not stay true to anne complicated story telling the deep layers that build up all the characters were shredded apart to only their surface if not a completely different identity the chronological order of the major events in the movie seemed warped and uneven br br however there were quite a few things the movie did to deserve my rating of 7 one was that the film strongly captured the affect that lestat among other vampires had to the public especially young girls the movie also did a fairly good job focusing on the importance of heredity and history that the vampires took pride in the scenes of sensuality were also atmospherically satisfying br br the acting in queen of the damned was moderate if disappointing stuart townsend and aaliyah have a surprising chemistry though it only shows when the acting is at its best not very often the characters are nothing compared to the ones established in interview with a vampire it also lacks the emotional intelligence of the feast of all saints which is a shame because rice's queen of the damned book had that and more br br this movie doesn't give all that it appears to be the effects are dull and very disappointing the extravagance needed in many scenes is not given and the dialog is tiring the settings for many scenes are not how i pictured them in the book and i think that many of them weren't even taken from the story there are only a few areas of incoherence near the beginning and middle of the movie but it wraps itself up fairly neatly giving the viewer a full story if they had not read the book br br somethings that i feel the movie needed include a good original score howard shore or elmer bernstein instead of the mix of rock music though i had no problem with some of the songs another thing that would have made the movie better is better set direction the scenery was boring as well as unclear which is important in a story that moves around quite frequently br br overall queen of the damned was an unevenly disappointing yet somewhat satisfying adaption of the important novel with a few simple changes it may have been a very successful piece of film work i'd recommend this movie for people who has seen interview or have read the books so that they can make their own opinion on the adaption
<START> joseph conrad's timeless novel heart of darkness was depicted in the 1994 movie i have read conrad's novel and i must say even though i prefer the novel itself the movie was a great depiction the set and costume designs brought conrad's novel to life on the screen as we followed marlow's journey the acting also brought the characters to life through the mannerisms voices and personalities if you have read the novel i recommend that you also view this movie if you have not read the novel however the movie may be harder to follow conrad's heart of darkness is too full of action emotion and information to be made into a movie that is a little over an hour and a half long therefore if you have not read the novel the plot in the movie may seem too cluttered to follow overall i gave this movie a seven out of ten the basic plot of the novel was brought forth to the screen with great sets costumes and acting nothing can replace joseph conrad's original work however
<START> i had a hard time staying awake for the two hour opening episode it was dumbed down to such an extent i doubt if i learned a single thing the graphics were rudimentary any small idea was repeated ad nauseum contrast this to the cosmos series hosted by carl sagan that had a good musical theme there was no music coming from these infernal 10 dimensional strings
<START> i never saw the other two ninja movies and for all i know there are known but for some reason i watched this one this one starts out rather fast as this one ninja goes on a super killing spree he is almost unstoppable as it takes quite a number of bullets to take him down he is not out for the count though as he ends up possessing a woman and he then continues his killing ways by using her as his tool another ninja enters the fray and apparently the only way you kill a ninja is with another ninja so he volunteers this leads up to a big battle at the end as the dead ninja goes back into his body and they have it out in an all out war sounds better than it actually turned out being but at least it was not boring
<START> while trying to build a major mall or complex or something like that a wealthy landowner ignores ancient native american artifacts buried on the land and unleashes the bone eater a creature who goes around and kills people in search of his fallen friends or something like that br br indeed this movie had to be a sci fi channel original if it wasn't then the director should never direct anything again the effects in the film is laughable at best and the bone eater monster is nothing but a cgi animated being added into the frames at a later date the actors don't even look all that frightened when they see the thing probably because they really don't and they're just terrible actors it's a great comedy though even if it's supposed to be pure horror
<START> i saw this movie last night and thought it was decent it has it's moments i guess you would say some of the scenes with the special ops forces were cool and some of the location shots were very authentic i won't be putting this movie in my dvd collection but it is fair enough to recommend for renting i guess nothing set the movie at another level compared to others of the same genre the action is good the acting is decent the women are extremely seductive and exotic in my opinion and the story is pretty interesting 7 out of ten
<START> a lot about usa the movie can be summed up in its title it draws parallels between the attitudes of this country in the face of war and a kind of hollywood like falseness that glorifies things that shouldn't be glorified i'm not sure i agree with the filmmaker's take on recent events although truthfully i can't always tell exactly where he stands but i admire the unusual and artistic way of getting the point across audio tracks of speeches radio interviews poetry etc play as large a role here as visuals most of the time the visuals of the story are accompanied by these audio elements to good effect i'm kind of a radio buff so it was satisfying to hear the way that radio was integrated into the pace of the movie in fact most of the dialog takes place over the story rather than having characters talk to one another that's not to say that there aren't characters real people but except for jim the protagonist a kind of '60's drop out with an erratic state of mind the others come and go pretty quickly a few make a very powerful impression especially a guru like taxi driver who seems to be the voice of wisdom itself when he breaks out into a spontaneous song of prayer while driving jim to the subway it is a very powerful moment on the cover of the dvd is the quote the danger is clear which is taken from president bush's speech that paved the way to our incursion into iraq in retrospect hearing that speech at a climactic moment in the film brought home how we are living in a historically charged moment which will always be remembered
<START> well it certainly stunned me i can not believe that someone made another australian film that's even more boring than somersault the story is implausible the characters with the exception of and characters are unlikeable and wooden tom long possesses a vast array of facial expressions happy and not happy and the sex scenes which could have been very confronting and disturbingly erotic would have been at home in a low budget porno flick br br this is the first movie i have seen in 30 years of cinema going that has had me on the edge of my seat ready to get up and leave br br the best thing about this movie is the promotional poster
<START> if you are looking for a movie with beautiful shots of mount everest then you may enjoy this movie just skip ahead to the views of the mountain br br spoiler alert however if you like me believe that lives are precious and not to be wasted then this movie will leave a bad taste in your mouth 6 people died 5 and a member of the japanese party just so that one man could attempt to ski down mount everest br br the question is raised in the movie about whether the continuation of the expedition to meet his personal goal was still worth the cost in lives and he answers an emphatic yes br br the part about skiing is in the last 15 minutes he skis for a short time then falls the rest of the way until he comes to a stop in the snow
<START> this movie was quite a pleasant surprise i had anticipated it for a long time and was afraid going in that it couldn't possibly live up to my expectations br br it exceeded them br br i adored this movie br br hilarious from start to finish stay until after the end credits it is absolutely remarkable how a movie about dumb and annoying characters can be so intelligent witty and engaging br br with it's obvious matte paintings the movie's future earth recalls the planet of the apes series and other sci fi movies of that era br br in fact this movie is essentially planet of the apes but with people who are the mental equivalent of apes br br it moves at a fairly brisk pace and luke wilson carries the movie quite well with a character that recalls the one he played in bottle rocket there's even a not so subtle nod to bottle rocket in an early scene br br maya is also surprisingly good as a former painter who was frozen as well br br despite all its strengths idiocracy has the distinct feel of a movie that was taken away from the director editor before it could be fine tuned br br i cannot for the life of me understand why a movie this funny would just be dumped into a few theaters with no advanced screenings no trailers no marketing whatsoever br br it's as if the studio decided they were not going to spend any more on it and just walked away br br or maybe they thought the movie had the makings of a cult classic and the only way for it to become a true cult classic was to set it up to fail br br whatever the case it is a shame because mike judge and this film in particular deserve better br br i predict this movie will have real legs on dvd and word of mouth will propel it to the success it deserves br br perhaps the fox executives saw themselves in the characters were confused and thought it was a documentary
<START> it's been 3 months and you know what that means a new seagal movie seagal has really been on role making horrible film after horrible film each time every movie getting worse and worse he's really amazing i don't really know what to say about first it's a piece of crap the story makes no sense at all secondly he uses stunt men in all his fight scenes and last but not least a lot of the footage is taken from other movies it amazes how this guy continues to find work he comes to the set late and leaves early and because of that his films are full of plot holes and stunt men why do we continue to buy his movies why do we continue to have hope that maybe just maybe he will make a great movie
<START> oh man this series has to be the worst possible anime i've ever seen in a while br br it started out new exciting and fresh and i really liked it then was a good female role model for the show and inu yasha was funny and hot headed br br then it just kept falling more and more downhill as the series progressed and i'll tell y'all the reasons why warning spoiler alert br br okay they basically destroy inu relationship with early on by reviving his 50 year old dead girlfriend who's drippy sappy and a total waste of time br br they introduce a pervert named who's supposed to be a sort of religious figure for the show which really bugged me 'cause it was out of place and stupid then they introduce a demon slayer named whose only purpose in life is to try and fail to save her brainwashed brother br br the big bad of the show while starting out as a really good bad guy lost his touch after a while he got pretty old pretty fast and it bothered me that he was the only baddie in the show who did anything br br the characters all became wooden and unemotional and then the ending of this terrible series was a disappointment to any anime fan out there nothing happened never got killed or defeated and inu yasha never fully fell in love 'cause he was still all in love with his 50 year old dead chick plot holes were left open the animation got worse and worse as the series progressed and nothing changed in the plot i mean they dragged it out to over 150 episodes and nothing changed in the plot at all and they expected me as well as other fans of the show to be satisfied i was disenchanted disgusted and annoyed as crap i at least had high hopes that there'd be a good ending to the series instead all i got was a dragged out commercial for the manga br br seriously if you wanna see a good anime about swords and stuff like that i strongly recommend that show progresses and goes somewhere plus it has really good animation too br br but stay far away from this bland excuse for anime as best as you can
<START> the film has weird annoying characters strange unexplainable slapstick and an insurmountable amount of dialogue about smoking the movie has a contrived plot of a bitchy empty headed woman's jeanne tripplehorn search for love although who would ever like character personality or reading of the dialogue i really cannot say except that she likes to smoke br br sarah jessica parker gives an interesting character performance who likes to smoke dylan mcdermott does his best to look pretty and soulful as he smokes and hey what is jennifer aniston doing there oh she's not really in it enough for anyone to care about her but she likes to smoke br br this is a waste of anyone's time i don't even know how i was able to sit through as much of the movie as i did i can't even believe i spent the time to write this except to warn others of its banality anyone need a cigarette
