<START> i had the pleasure of witnessing this brilliant film at a preview screening in sydney although it was a pleasure to see it pleasure is not the emotion you are left with as the credits roll br br 2 37 is a film that tackles not just one stigma felt by young individuals but all of them chief of which is isolation it is not just to place the films final scene on a pedestal above the others but rather it is important to see it as the culmination and from that it is important to realise what it represents to both you as the viewer and to the people directly effected by it br br 2 37 is not a soft picture but the manner in which mr handles it's subject matter with a profound dignity and it's no holds barred approach acts as credit to it's message br br i do not believe films such as 2 37 should be scaled by votes of favour rather it should be recommended to those looking for purpose in their viewing br br a brilliantly crafted portrait of innocence lost and a master stroke for a as of yet talent br br not to be missed
<START> this nifty little movie demonstrates the rock solid virtues of a time place and kind of masculine strength that we no longer have or even aspire to have the saint is a with only the best motives to say nothing of a polished vocabulary and diction no need to turn up the volume or read the dialog george sanders is so charming and yes low key that all that talent smarts physical presence and above all masculinity seem well almost normal some normal george clooney can not begin to master the scene as mr sanders does and does without mr clooney's mugging he could play a witness the ghost and mrs muir and rebecca but when he was good he was very very good truly a man for all reasons and seasons
<START> this is a movie that i watched when i was a young girl and never forgot it is certainly not the best movie ever made but there is something very special about it that i can't quite put my finger on i love it i am the kind of person who likes everything explained to me though and for that reason alone this movie drives me crazy br br exactly what who is that mysterious witch lady and what is her relationship with tom why and how did he become a water baby why was he raised on the earth it is questions like these that are just eating at me i thought if i read the book i would get answers but i just read an article that the book from which this story is based is a lot different so i guess i'll never know what the writer was thinking br br i still love this movie though and i recently watched it with my two year old niece she loves it too although she insists on calling it baby water for reasons unknown to me she loves the part where he jumps in the water and then declares i'm all clean you have to understand that my niece is the cleanest 2 year old in the world we watched that scene over and over br br i am so glad that we can enjoy this film together there should be more films like this but what is up with the gay
<START> it was only the second year of the academy but already they were voting politically jeanne brilliant performance in this creaky early talkie had to make do with an oscar nom and the statuette went to the worst performance ever to win mary pickford's in coquette the only existing print was a work print without music or final editing but wherever it's shown stuns and captivates with her beguiling powerful performance she is so convincing on the witness stand that while we know she is lying through her teeth we did after all see her kill the man we in the audience find ourselves like the jurors believing in her innocence before we suddenly catch ourselves that is great acting the film needs to be made available on video so that the world can enjoy this terrific performance again one silent of exists in archive print man woman and sin and her only other talkie jealousy is lost so this is the only document we have of her run to see it when it first came out of the archives to be shown in nyc in the early 70s the village voice printed a full page review worshipping the performance
<START> when i first watched i was amazed it had all the necessary features of a good movie the cast was superb the plot was superb and in the case of thrillers there was genuine thrills throughout br br keifer sutherland offered a marvelous performance as the male lead in the piece portraying a scientist who believes he can find the answers to life and death by killing himself and then coming back to life essentially stealing death's secrets away kevin bacon offers an excellent performance as the more morally decent counterpart to keifer while julia roberts offers her most convincing role william baldwin portrays a student who excels in class and apparently intercourse and oliver platt in another outstanding performance portrays the voice of reason for the group and the most innocent br br the story is relatively simple yet original and the acting is refreshing definitely a stand out film for the genre and one that has set the standard for measuring other thrillers for me br br 8 10
<START> franÃ§ois was a real life poet and rogue who lived in paris in the 15th century however most of what is portrayed in this historical film is actually fiction from a play created at the beginning of the 20th century whereas in the film he met and became friends with louis xi in reality he died in his 30s and was never involved in all the intrigues like he was in this film in reality he wrote some lovely verse and was frequently on the wrong side of the law not the combination of a patriot and robin hood like character like he is in the film provided you know that the film is nearly 100 fiction then it's well worth seeing just don't assume it's a good history lesson br br in the beloved rogue is played with wild abandon by john barrymore i was also pretty excited to see that his three friends were all played by very familiar faces angelo rossitto who was the plucky dwarf played in tons of films over the years and had a very long career slim summerville was a character actor known for adding a touch of comedy to films mack swain is best known as the silent film foil in many of chaplin's short films and played his partner in the gold rush all four of these men did a nice job and have no complaints even with barrymore's rather over the top treatment that was rather reminiscent of a douglas fairbanks performance however the performance i had a serious problem with was conrad veidt as king louis xi to call this unsubtle would be a gross understatement he played the role like a high schooler who thought he was supposed to be the stereotypical richard iii skulking about and acting like a caricature while veidt was wonderful in many many films both silent and sound but here he is just ridiculous br br as for the story it's full of lusty adventure and action like a swashbuckling film minus the sailing ships the sets worked out well for all this as they'd been used the previous year for the hunchback of notre dame both films were set around the same time period br br overall it's one of the last great silent films there's a lot to like and the film is a lovely combination of romance comedy and action well worth seeing though it loses a couple of points for veidt's overacting as well as the way the film plays fast and loose with history br br by the way this film was also made twice as if i were king 1920 and 1938 and apparently these two films are closest to the original play however in total six films have been about and tell more or less variations on the same tale
<START> one of my all time favourite movies nothing can beat watching this movie for the first time if i could go back in time and erase my memory or suffer from momentary amnesia i would so i could enjoy this movie as much as i did that very first time it's still enjoyable second and third times round but i found myself appreciating the humour more as the shocks and thrills weren't unexpected if you want a see a film that you truly won't be able to predict the ending of then i highly recommend this film its chilling shocking full of suspense and there's also loads of humour to help you through it too if you watch this film and don't love it i truly question your sanity
<START> i liked this movie br br no one i know likes it but i do br br i didn't like it as much as the first one but it was still good the script and plot may not have changed at all but the story was better than caddyshack 1 br br the only reason i didn't like caddyshack 2 is br br no rodney dangerfield br br i think the movie would be better if rodney dangerfield had jackie mason's part although i did like jackie mason in the movie it would be alot better if they kept rodney dangerfield br br another flaw in the movie that i didn't hate as much was dan akroyd the movie was done 8 years after the first one bill murray carl could've quit his job as an assistant and joined the military you know if warner bros had thought of that it could've made the movie better also br br this was my comment for caddyshack ii br br i give it 8 2 out of 10 br br it could've been better but good nonetheless br br if you've seen caddyshack 1 and are debating on whether or not to see caddyshack 2 i say give it a try
<START> barry is a radio phone in talk show host in dallas whose no holds barred ideas on a plethora of social issues disturb and offend many of his callers and listeners is barry a media messiah in search of truth or a social misfit out to assault his audience br br this is an intense provocative character piece about a man with almost no redeeming features who at the same time seems to be onto some really profound philosophy though co written and directed by stone this is really piece all the way and he gives an astonishingly hard edged and penetrating performance from which there is no escape barry is at times one of the most loathsome characters imaginable spewing bilious misanthropy at everyone around him particularly those who care about him but at the same time he is also strangely empathetic hypnotic sage even lovable features burn into the frame with his green eyes constantly darting around as if permanently seeking an answer to some riddle the movie is essentially an angry self righteous rant against all the bigotry injustice and banality in the world culminating in a wild three and a half minute rotating single shot of barry delivering the ultimate i hate everything speech but boy does it pack a punch the support cast are great particularly greene as the ex wife and baldwin as the boss robert richardson's keen photography manages to keep the single radio studio set looking interesting and there's a tense score by stewart copeland with a moving coda featuring that endearing phone music piece telephone and rubber band by the penguin cafe orchestra if you're unfamiliar with bogosian check out his amazing talent in this flick like his contemporaries bill hicks and denis leary he's someone who rarely appears in the mainstream media purely because his writing is so out there i find stone's movies variable i don't much care for his big successes but when he is more ordered and objective as with this or salvador and nixon he is much more incisive and arresting a great primal scream of a picture based on a play by bogosian inspired by the true story of alan berg a denver radio talk show host who was murdered by neo nazis in 1984
<START> and i do peter falk has created a role that will live on forever in tv land and i'm grateful for that this isn't one of his finest hours though columbo goes to college and basically teaches how he solves a crime and yet there are bad guys who go ahead and think they're smarter than he is what all us fans know is that columbo needs a worthy opponent without a great enemy how can he be the hero in the wrinkled coat still it's better than no columbo and i'll wait and watch the next one as well
<START> i am sorry folks but i have to say i really cannot understand the overwhelming feelings everybody gets by seeing this movie br br when i saw it i looked at my watch to know how much more time i had to spend with this kindergarten nonsense br br so why this verdict br br first of all the movie tells a story that doesn't deliver any excitement it is not even the amusingly distorted reality of a quentin tarantino we used to know this story could have come out of every little kid's head it doesn't have anything intelligent in it neither anything inventive and it goes on for hours the story has appropriate content for about 30 min the rest is just awfully enhanced scenes that are supposed to leave a somewhat cool image doesn't work even the previously seen cutbacks that tarantino often uses just confuse and are not in any way cool br br second some guys go to germany and kill nazis ah really do they the only nazis they killed were a handful of guys one of them being man enough to rather die than betray his companions is this the ugly face tarantino wanted to give the nazis a brave soldier that is more valiant than any of the basterds certainly not fail and what happens to the terrible nazi killing basterds well they all get killed by nazis except two who are taken hostages wow what terrible monsters they are br br third any characters yes one the only role and the only gleam of hope for the entire movie is waltz who is building a truly deep and very detailed character here great acting brad pitt really sucks and is completely out acted by waltz never seen a such a weak performance by pitt and the rest well some germans you've never seen before and will never see after when the movie started and i saw the group of the seven basterds i hoped to see something like the magnificent seven a group of extraordinary guys each one with a distinct character making their way to their destiny fearless and knowing i was then very disappointed when i saw the basterds no details at all no characters no real men just some random guys you won't remember who were not given any chance to differentiate themselves but in fact you don't even need to differentiate cause the basterds except pitt hardly play any role in this movie br br so i was really disappointed and seeing this movie on place 40 of the greatest movies of all time is the only thing about this that leaves me with my mouth opened
<START> zero stars out of br br endless descent has absolutely no redeeming values whether it's the ridiculously bad acting the laughably awful special effects the incompetent direction the stupid script or the gratingly annoying musical score it's the kind of pitiful production that makes me wonder how a movie like this could even have the slightest consideration for being greenlighted by a studio in the first place br br i don't think i'm going to delve into the plot other than to say it's about a bunch of people who are trapped under the water and have to kill a lot of fake looking creatures br br let me go more into detail as to what is so awful about this flick first of all the acting is simply horrendous jack scalia is ten times worse than sylvester stallone a feat that is hard enough to accomplish as it is the supporting performances aren't really any better and what is with actor luis lorenzo the guy who plays the cook francisco he has a high pitched voice and an accent that sounds appropriate for a comedy not a sci fi horror film br br the special effects are even worse the creatures range from weird looking eels to giant starfish and the effects look like something you would see in a muppet movie and i don't believe i need to delve further in this issue br br director j p simon has slight cult status because of all the terrible films he's made i'm sure some will enjoy endless descent in an ed wood type of way but i don't even think it's that good everything he does is shoddy especially the camerawork the man cannot direct a movie that's all there is to it br br this was the last of four films that took place underwater and it sure does make leviathan and deep star six both bad films in their own right start to look masterful in comparison either way just stick with the abyss
<START> i'm a huge lover of really bad b movies and i especially love alien scifi movies i say the cheaper cheesier and campier the better a low budget and a hokey idea are fun enough for most bad b movies but this movie is so bad that i really felt embarrassed for the people who made the movie and for the schlocky ad lib actors first off there's no real plot it's all sort of situation comedy if it can be called that the comedy in this movie is more about characters saying in essence look at me i'm in this crazy situation isn't this funny but it's only pathetic because nothing anyone's doing is that funny there's no comedic acting skill nor any kooky plot to carry all the very un imaginative scenarios through this dreary turd br br the bad comedy and lack of anything remotely comical is only worsened by the bad ad lib acting actors saying really stupid things over and over again perhaps trying to ape for catch phrases perhaps just b c everyone in this is so bad really unattractive women being played off as hot chicks and people barfing and passing out in bathrooms br br there was one middle aged actor toward the end of the movie who i could tell had some acting chops and was kinda' convincing in his role he was as out of place as a solid in a weekend detox unit's bathroom corey feldman was filmed for about 3 minutes in total thankfully we didn't have to put up with him any longer and he was filmed off site probably outside his apartment on the way out somewhere he said a few really un funny things about aliens and having sex with aliens and that was the extent of his appearance br br if you value your life and the 90 minutes and years of pain in remembering you'll lose by watching this garbage avoid it if you do a lot of drugs like adam sandler's comedy stylings and thus have no standards whatsoever and are considered mentally slow you might like this movie br br p s i think the people who raved about this must work for troma or something b c i can't believe people can be so lame as to actually enjoy this movie do drugs really ruin your judgment that much
<START> if you know anything about the manhattan project you will find fat man and little boy at least an interesting depiction of the events surrounding that story the film is in all ways a very realistic portrayal of these events and in many ways it is almost too real such as some scenes involving radiation poisoning paul newman as usual is brilliant in his role and always manages to come off like a real person on the screen the supporting cast such as john cusack laura dern bonnie bedelia and natasha richardson is fairly good as well this film is not however one of the best examples of turning a true story into a movie great films are able to take a true story and use just enough artistic license to keep its audience engaged for the entire movie this one however tends to drag a bit throughout and some scenes such as john cusack and natasha richardson's love story could have been eliminated entirely without causing the film to lose much nevertheless there are enough interesting facts and tiny humorous bits to at least keep the audience interested enough to see the entire film it does not always entertain but as far as great depictions go this is very accurate fascinating and will leave the audience with something to think about br br out of
<START> for those with access to the bbc or the cbc this has proved to be spectacular like battlestar gallactica this is a show rebuilt from the ground up but in the case of dr who they saved the best parts i can't believe i am saying this but this is by far the best dr who this has none of the cheap production values and sometimes slow plodding of the old show the acting is quite good and there is a real sense of continuity and history the new doctor is easily the equal of the great tom baker and the writer former lead seems to have made even the minor characters come alive br br i know i'm gushing but this should be on everyone sci fi geeks list i just don't know why it hasn't made its way here whatever you do if you ever loved dr who or sci fi see this
