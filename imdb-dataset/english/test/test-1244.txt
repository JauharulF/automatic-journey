<START> i was fortunate to attend the london premier of this film while i am not at all a fan of british drama i did find myself deeply moved by the characters and the bad choices they made i was in tears by the end of the film every scene was mesmerizing the attention to detail and the excellent acting was quite impressive br br i would have to agree with some of the other comments here which question why all these women were throwing themselves at such a despicable character br br alert i was also hoping that dylan would have been killed by william when he had the chance end spoiler br br keira knightley did a great job and radiate beauty and innocence from the screen but it was sienna miller's performance that was truly oscar worthy br br i am sure this production will be nominated for other awards
<START> this movie would have been alright indeed probably excellent if the directors would have left the interviews and the concert footage separate into the void is a great song and i hate how it is cut off at the best part to go to an mumbling interview with ozzy osbourne that should have been at the end of the film or located in a special feature the best part of concert dvds is to put them on and let the music play but black sabbath the last supper is hard to put and and simply let play because the music is continually interrupted nevertheless there are a few strengths to this film the concert footage when it does play it excellent black sabbath returns to the stage after a long hiatus without osbourne and this film captures that well sabbath basically rocks the fans the fans of course have a sweet advantage in the film because they are seeing the band live of course but also they do not have to put up with the incessant interviews that the dvd viewers are burdened with shame on jeb and monica hardiman the directors for doing this to the film also shame on wyatt smith for editing the film in such a way
<START> i love this movie and all aspects of it well directed as a comedy and as a drama the acting is tremendous performed by an all star cast who play the high society new york perfectly the scenery is incredible totally breathtaking i also love the story a successful nyc architect who is going through a midlife crisis leaves his cheating wife and runs off to a greek island to hide out with his daughter who chooses to go with him br br i just cannot express my love affair enough regarding this movie show me the magic
<START> this movie reminded me a lot of a song by the dead kennedys called straight a's however unlike this film the hero of the song turns to suicide you'll wish this bozo had resorted to killing himself instead of doing the crime he did the whole thing was convoluted and in the beginning you sympathize with the hero of the film then he quickly betrays your sympathies the long sequences of just showing the hero's face while he delivers a monologue drag the film down quite a bit avoid this if possible
<START> this is a lame comedy br br here's why a man and wife sitcom okay br br the husband is a douche bag the wife is the einstein br br how original is that br br jerry stiller is just the same guy on seinfeld br br the gags are lame no witty one liners br br i have had enough stop this now br br the last word stupid the destruction of the average white guy continues on abc the worst part kevin james is actually a funny comedian he just isn't here leah is great eye candy but is unlikeable wasted talent is the word bad sitcom
<START> ok so this film is not very well known and wasn't very well publicised i discovered this fairly brutal gangster gone good movie by complete accident on one of millions of movie channels late on some boring evening but i'm glad i did the opening sequence to this film is fantastically comical in a very dark way this in fact sets what i think is the general tone for the movie i think a lot of critics and movie fans that have actually seen this film have been a bit unfair to just write it off as a lower budget gangster movie in the reservoir dogs vein ok so there are undeniable similarities between thursday and some other crime genre films that it has been compared to but in all fairness i think this film takes a much more darkly comic look at this type of film and the end result is a engrossing well made funny if not totally original film tom jane is good in this and deserves the recognition he will now hopefully get thanks to the the punisher his performance as the bad guy gone good is realistic funny and just cold enough to make you believe casey really was a bad ass before he reformed thats another thing that makes this film stand out for me the characters in nicks gang you get the strangest trio of criminals ever assembled a smooth charismatic but very cold leader nick a trigger happy blood loving sexually predatory bitch of a woman dallas and a psychotic hill billy with brains with a penchant for torture billy hill throw in the most bizarre police detective ever seen on screen beautifully over played by mickey rourke and you've got a recipe for well for thursday really its at times darkly comic sometimes brutal sometimes unoriginal but always engrossing and worth watching 8 10
<START> the next karate kid is a thoroughly predictable movie just like its predecessors its predictability often results in a feeling of impatience on the viewer's part who often wishes the story could move a little faster despite its lulls and its extreme familiarity however this fourth entry in the series is painless almost exclusively because of the presence of morita he doesn't seem tired of his role and he does inject some life and humor into the film becoming the best reason for you to see it not awful but nothing much either
<START> this is the movie that pretty much sounded the death knell for the auteur in hollywood at over 40 million bucks heaven's gate is so poorly conceived and executed it would take a lifetime to break down every area of failure what really me the most about it is that technically it's very bad an unforgivable sin for the money that went into it john hurt's commencement speech at harvard is inaudible as is a conversation between kris kristofferson and richard at the train station some people seem to think cimino intended this as a style he didn't it's just bad sound recording the characters are not particularly well drawn except for the four or five leads in the climactic battle scene it's difficult to tell who's the bad guys and who's the good guys even on that level it's impossible to enjoy the movie the casting of isabelle huppert as the town madam is a joke her french accent renders the whole character a fraud the acting is generally stiff without any range or depth of feeling even christopher walken is bad john hurt's character is the only one with any swagger or vitality although hurt in his 40s playing a fresh faced harvard grad with bags under his eyes is patently ridiculous br br i guess to say that it's overlong is overkill the roller skating sequence could have been easily cut the cockfight scene is rapidly becoming a movie cliche and the final scene on board the ocean liner is right out the twilight zone having rod serling appear before the camera at the end to explain what we just watched would have been the perfect finale actually those scenes in and of themselves are not bad but cimino has not earned the right to include them because what he's given us as the meat of the picture is so incompetently bad the editing is poor especially in the grand battle climax at one point the same explosion with the same wagon wheel flying from the blast is used three different times i wish could i say something anything nice about this movie a great scene a great performance even one memorable line of dialogue but i can't it is all just one big unholy mess about the only thing i did like was the cinematography and the montana locations which are stunning even cimino couldn't screw that up this is a long boring bad movie by all standards and the people who say that it gets bashed only because of the cost are just kidding themselves 1 2 out of 4
<START> i love john's work as a singer but the movie was dull and 'no worth the time' to view br br i thought he did an 'ok' job at acting his part when he says your having an affair with the ol' man to his co star i kinda chuckled at his facial movements or lack thereof br br i would suggest the movie if you like john's music but not as a saturday night video br br if you love his music then the video has a little music from him in it but not much br br so so at best
<START> this feels like a feature lenght treatment of a comedy routine that could have also been told in a ten minute short also technical credits are par the film really feels like a film school diploma project br br the cast is a mix of seasoned stage pros and talented newcomers but the problems is the superficial scrip their lines feel constructed exactly like cued tv show material br br the director fails to take his protagonists seriously therefore we are not touched by their problems and conflicts br br the film has been cleverly marketed and offers a unique selling point but in the end the film disappoints on all levels
<START> the material is poor the script's dreadful the acting mediocre at best and the music telegraphs what the scene is supposed to be communicating like a kick in the head br br give this one a miss even yancy butlers not hot enough even in the semi nude scenes to save this tripe br br i'm amazed people rave about yancy butler given what i've seen here and in the couple of other things i've seen her in she hasn't got the depth or presence to be a star and her off screen behaviour would tend to indicate she knows that as well br br last thing is where was this shot i don't recognise the externals
<START> this movie was so poorly acted what was with jeff bridges accent horrible and unbelievable was it supposed to be french scandinavian the script was lame to have the heroine trip over the grave of her boyfriend while running from the jeff bridges character are you kidding me how convenient that jeff brings his dirty shovel in the house after he disposes of bodies in his lawn do these people just not believe in calling the cops okay i'll get into the car with you why not duh why was daughter obsessed with making her dad have an affair is her mother that evil or just plain dull i did not see the original it would be hard to make myself after seeing this movie
<START> i picked this dvd up for 3 99 at rogers video in order to get enough points to get a better movie for free i never actually was planning on watching this but it started poking at my curiosity and i finally decided to pop in it the dvd player the effects in this movie are horrible and cheap some of the dialog in this movie sounds like it was written by a swear happy 12 year old boy the acting is really cheesy in some parts and the action scenes are completely laughable you'll burst out laughing at some parts which was a positive for me because it kept me mildly entertained the plot is some girl has a curse on her which causes her to vomit snakes so some shaman has to get her to los angeles there are also two girls trying to smuggle drugs there and a few other people that are unimportant to the plot not that there really is a plot at all don't expect anything from this movie and don't listen to the cover there are not 100 passengers and 3 000 vipers there are 10 passengers and 20 random snakes br br as for the dvd there is a trailer which is almost as laughable as the film a blooper reel which is just one shot over and over of one actor trying to say train and the deleted scenes are really pointless if they weren't good enough to stay in this movie they must be pretty bad there is also a really bad making of featurette which doesn't really show much at all except that the people involved with this movie were kind of idiots i can't recommend it unless you want a really bad movie that you can laugh at with friends i give it 2 kitty cats out of 5
<START> something not so great silence of the lambs remains demme's only good film and i'm of course including all the overrated left wing exercises in big screen indulgence some of which i haven't seen and never will br br this is a light comedy that takes a thriller turn somewhere half way the first half is a little hard to sit through it's neither funny nor particularly interesting daniels plays an over the top dumb as dirt naive moron who is so gullible and trusting that it defies belief his animated acting is often annoying and barely funny he actually lies to griffith at the outset and tells her that he is married with children when in fact he is divorced in all the history of mankind and movies any man who is married and meets a woman he likes will lie if he lies and say that he isn't married later on the not at all credible or believable rationale behind this was revealed he wanted to protect himself what a load of crap the fact that his character makes all the wrong decisions and does all the dumb things in the movie made me actually look forward to liotta pounding on him when he caught up with him in the former's apartment br br what then happens in daniels's apartment is the classic end of movie fight to the death which the good guy albeit the very dumb good guy predictably wins still at least the last half hour has some action something going on and daniels isn't given any more the opportunity to be animated the film lacks credible characters whether main or marginal and the feel of it is too 80s which means the movie has a rather bland look visually ugly sayles yet again makes a cameo as a policeman the film is also perhaps a bit too heavy on the coincidences side griffith once again plays a soft talking dumb sounding bimbo but as usual she is convincing because she is a soft talking dumb sounding bimbo this was an earlier film before her lip enlargement and breast enlargement surgery compare the natural breasts she exposes in this film to the ready to explode balloons she briefly flashes years later in nobody's fool br br if you're interested in reading my biographies of griffith and other hollywood intellectuals contact me by e mail
<START> i first watched this in black and white circa christmas in the early sixties when it was shown on british television i was absolutely hooked and watched it over again whenever it was repeated on tv possibly two or three times only as it happens if only we'd had video recorders then br br as outlined by other contributors the plot describes the return of the grasshopper after a period spent away to a forties american city he finds that all is not as he left it and his good insect friends who live in the just outside the garden which belongs to a songwriter and his wife are now under threat from the ones' who are trampling through the broken down fence which the property using it as a shortcut br br insect houses are being flattened by their feet and are also often burned by cast away cigar butts and matches old mr bumble and his beautiful daughter honey childhood sweetheart are in grave danger of losing their honey shop to this threat br br to compound their problems devious insect c bagley beetle has romantic designs on honey bee himself and hopes with the help of his henchmen swat the fly and smack the mosquito to force bumble to give him her hand in marriage br br will the heroic and fearless win the day and manage to save the community of bugs from their dastardly fate and especially his precious honey from hers enjoy the classic songs katy did katy didn't is a superb swinging upbeat example and the colourful visuals as the tale unfolds br br time has not blunted my fascination for this masterpiece of animation and story telling and i was much pleased to find that it had been released to video although i later found out that it was in ntsc pal format never mind i sent off for the video immediately and only then bought a portable tv video combination complete with ntsc playback br br i have enjoyed many nostalgic viewings since then and have even discovered that the tv rights have switched from bbc who informed me they were unlikely to ever show the film on any of their stations to filmfour who have at last been showing it on their digital stations in early 2007 br br my granddaughter aged three was absolutely entranced while we watched it together and this is a child who has been influenced by the digital age and the resulting computer generated productions br br i would thoroughly recommend this film for any age and especially the youngest of viewers br br give max fleischer a posthumous oscar
