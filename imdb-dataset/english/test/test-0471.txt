<START> i really wanted to like this film the second film in the series had this silly drive in movie feel to it that was fun of course i was also drunk i watched this film with the highest expectation of a similar experience of high cinematic hilarity a la mystery science theater 3000 i was wrong this movie is a god awful waste of film and i liked the second one from the effeminate villain with the david bowie fright wig to the tacky obnoxious female villains with laughs that could strip the paint off a garage door this whole thing was just a painful mess i actually felt bad for sue price because the material was beneath an actress of her stature that pretty much says it all an awful awful film that's not a recommendation
<START> here is one of jane austen's movies that i found very delightful i read the book first then listened to it on cd and was captivated by how a young victorian girl could be persuaded against marrying the man she loved due to his lack of a fortune or education the joy of knowing that anne is evidently reunited with a lost love the fact that her godmother tries to marry her off to a good for nothing cousin who's only out for money looking at the snobbery that comes from the upper classes and how class distinctions can divide couples from following their hearts captain wentworth realization that he still loves anne after seven years his final understanding that anne's love was constant all that time and they she wasn't going to let her family interfere with her true happiness and eventual marriage to one she truly loved
<START> director fabio got a strange academy for his last movie o is a bad movie but in bella donna did one of the worst movies of all time his adaptation of the novel is ridiculous think with me how poor brazilians fishermen speak a perfect english in the film they do there isn't a screenplay it's only a very long with a beautiful places and many sex scenes with and henstridge
<START> i haven't written a review on here in ages but rewatching all of bottom tv show live shows and this i felt i had to make my views on this movie known it is i feel the perfect comedy movie it lacks the lovey dovey story lines i wouldn't really call with gina love would you or him and eddie going up there naked not love that make the rest of comedys go from good to crap it lacks the usual dilemmas that one must overcome in most other comedy movies unless you count the fact that they poisoned the guests and must escape from the guests green vomit as a dilemma thats similar to other comedy movies no this movie just sets out and succeeds in doing one thing and one thing only making one laugh what does one require from comedy movies laughter this movie just piles on laugh after laugh without stuffing up the laughs with serious crap like other comedy movies thus i call it the so far only perfect comedy movie ever made and i will never ever stop watching this beautiful movie i rick and on such fantastic genius
<START> this was just telecast here in the u s others have commented on the faithfulness or lack of same to the novel the 1983 bbc version is far superior on this and all other counts given the scope of the novel it should not have been condensed to 85 minutes key sections have to be rushed or alluded to or omitted there barely enough time just to get in the chronology of events so character development has to be sacrificed we cannot get much of a sense of who the people are which robs us of what makes austen so great br br one major negative for me was the cinematography which i thought was just awful and quite literally sickening the camera is constantly doing ultra closeups and swirling around and around in circles maybe on a small tv box this is ok but on our 40 hi def screen it was so literally dizzying that both my wife and i had to look away from the set repeatedly my dramamine supply had run out of course this did distract from the rather lackluster i'm just reading what's in the script acting isolated scenes are nicely done but not enough to save things br br adding up the score so far in the complete j a sweepstakes i'd rate northanger abbey a success because of superior direction and production values and the story lends itself better to short treatment persuasion ok though not the equal of other versions with again being at fault both far ahead of this attempt i will hope for better in the two remaining novels in this tv reader's digest jane austen like others i am thankful they left p p alone
<START> dark harvest is about a group of friends that go to a farm it belongs to one of the friends relatives or something for a getaway but there are killer scarecrows lurking there there was something about a curse in there too but i forgot what that was about br br the acting in this movie is awful i don't know what the director was thinking when he was casting actors and actresses the script is the same story as the acting awful this statement coming up is very obvious but if there was better acting and a better script this could have turned out okay br br the directing stunk too i see no potential in this guy's future after all these negatives this movie still maintains a fun factor that bumps it up to a two the last plus is they don't use cgi my overall thoughts on this film are it's bad real bad but so bad it's fun so it gets a 2 10
<START> i will admit i had the opportunity in the past to watch this film and after about 5 10 minutes into it i felt like many did i was expecting a monkey movie that was similar to the television show but instead i was given well i didn't know what i was given to be honest br br however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again it's the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher it's meanings and just when i think i've figured out something in the film it's answer is destroyed once i watch the film again brilliance indeed br br it seems that most people who disliked this film are wanting to watch a film with primarily a clear plot they want everything explained and all questions answered in the finale well sorry if that's what you're wanting this is not the movie for you but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think you'll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you br br think of the film being like a dream in our dreams things make no sense things we expect to happen don't people places and things don't speak act or function in the same way they do in reality to complain about head is like complaining about a dream you've had that you felt you could not understand the mind is a complex system and being that a film titled head is just as complex is it that difficult to relate the two br br the music and musical numbers really stand out especially peter two compositions which remain the best tracks in the film can you dig it and long title do i have to do this all over again br br this film proves that the monkees were much more than just four guys in a 'pre group as their critics called them on a television show but that they are actually much more intelligent and talented than the world would give them credit for there's so many messages that can be derived from the film both in regards to the monkees and to the industry' in general that it stands as a masterpiece of film making that was far ahead of it's time br br i feel had this film been released as an independent piece at this point and time it would actually garner the respect and admiration it deserves br br and one finale note br br one could compare this to the beatles magical mystery tour film since the beatles film appeared to be just as strange and bizarre however in my opinion head stands far above anything the beatles put on celluloid
<START> i have a question for the writers and producers of prozac nation what is the root cause and what is the solution to the widespread problem of personal depression in america in the moving performance of christina ricci as liz the film portrays a young woman with unlimited potential as a harvard student and as a writer but this is not a story of success only one of self destruction as we watch liz bring misery into the lives everyone who comes in contact with her the film examines divorce family dysfunction drugs alcohol and prescription medication as possible reasons for liz's unhappiness but none of those superficial explanations are satisfactory br br at some point in the film it would have been helpful to suggest that liz needs to take responsibility for her life and her problems no light was shed on what the film alleged to be a runaway problem in the united states of depression in the story liz had a caring therapist anne heche a caring roommate michele williams a caring boyfriend jason biggs and a troubled but caring parent jessica lange in a key scene in the film liz is lying in a hospital bed watching the break up of the space shuttle challenger instead of equating challenger with liz's life the film should have used the image as a starting point for her healing and recovery br br this film reminded me of a generic made for cable victim film on the lifetime network an excellent cast was wasted especially in the earnest performance of christina ricci the real life elizabeth obviously found within herself the resources to cope with her depression and become a successful author it is unfortunate that the film could not offer us even the slightest glimpse into her courageous spirit
<START> i saw this film at the 2006 palm springs international film festival and director aku introduced his film and was on hand for q a after for some reason this movie is titled frozen land in english so i don't know how the distributors got frozen out of this is a very good film it doesn't for me have enough that i would knock it up a notch to the excellent category but i did talk to some viewers who felt that it was an excellent film said that back in finland people either loved this movie or hated it and said a lot of people in theaters walked out on it i'm sure some objected to some of the violence swearing drug and alcohol abuse and sexual scenes it's a very clever story of how these different lives are woven together because of a trickle down effect this film has very interesting and strong characters i would rate it a 7 0 out of a possible 10 and would see it again and recommend it with caution
<START> any gun can play 2 outta 5 stars totally routine spaghetti western starring that guy who used to play on 77 sunset strip the plot is some convoluted nonsense about some stolen gold coins and various gunmen of dubious motivation trying to track it down this is one of those lighthearted westerns which means lots of labored attempts at comedy and some really atrocious music during most of the action sequences you can tell this isn't ennio morricone's work george hilton plays a bounty hunter called stranger but he doesn't leave much of an impression he just doesn't have the style of clint eastwood or franco nero who are able to do a lot with a sparsely written character the ending is a complete homage parody of the ending of the good the bad and the ugly though it's barely amusing enough to be considered a parody the highlight of the movie is the first 5 minutes which features actors patterned after clint eastwood lee van cleef and someone else is he supposed to be eli wallach franco nero it's not very clear who are confronted by stranger it's an amusing in joke for fans of sergio leone fans and spaghetti western aficionados but i imagine no one else would see the point
<START> oh god why is it that nickelodeon has such a hard time producing even a half decent movie i mean this movie might have been good but it was br br a too short b rather superficial stereotypical and insulting to some c ultimately pointless br br first of all the dress up the nerd to look cool thing was very consumerist very superficial very pointless and very insulting it has the stereotypical nerds stupid faces glasses never kissed vacations with his mom etc well maybe the reason that guy has never kissed a girl is because he's gay does that mean that all gays are nerds and what's wrong with being friends with your mother br br the worst part by far was the ending the whole drama of the movie revolved around zoey finding out chase loved her and blah blah blah and then when chase finally decided to tell her br br a he didn't tell her in person because right as he was about to the typical distraction came along b he tried to text message her but her fell into a fountain and died before she got the message br br the end br br how lame is that i mean why is it that cartoonists just can't change anything in the series so many of us would like to see these two get together why can't we see it i mean are the producers really that uncreative that they can't think up new problems to go with changes in the series so they have to stick with the same plot and outlines and make as many episodes as they can just using those after a while it gets dull and frustrating br br i wanted to see some actual romance in here darn it br br okay i'm done with my rant
<START> this movie is about a man who likes to blow himself up on gas containers br br he also loves his mommy so to keep the money coming in he takes his act to broadway br br see cody powers jarrett blow himself up on his biggest gas container yet tonight 7 30pm br br however one day his mommy dies and jarrett goes berserk he kidnaps the audience in the theatre and makes them all stand on top of a huge gas cylinder br br losing control further he makes them all scream made it ma top of the cylinder in unison br br the noise is so deafening that it bursts eardrums causing him to topple from the cylinder into a vat of acid br br this warner bros movie is not all it's cracked up to be
<START> very lovely love story between brenda blethyn and alfred molina the whole story is very bizarre and funny an undertaker a molina loves a married woman b blethyn they try to fake her death to escape her husband and the village a scenario of strange situations starts as good as saving grace and long live ned devine
<START> i enjoyed this film the way these mutants looked along with the tone of the film is very good plus david cronenberg as philip k decker was great it makes me wonder if his personality is exactly the same in real life except for the killings of course br br i was impressed with the creatures for this film although this movie probably had a somewhat low budget the mutants creatures monsters looked great especially from 1990 this is definitely a unique film and not crap it makes me want to go find a read the novella it's based off of this is an interesting film because it shows how humans can be monsters and the monsters are the one with humanity
<START> this movie and several other movies from the 1950s with a religious overtone such as the robe quo vadis and samson and delilah unfortunately depict all pagans or anybody who isn't a jew or christian as morally depraved and decadent the focus is only on biblical related stories that ignore the world outside the bible as far as they are concerned nothing good came from pagan egypt greece or rome br br any movie that preaches about the one true god gives a short shift to freedom of religion the movies ignore the fact that ancient lack of religious freedom made it a fertile ground for religious extremism most 1950s religious movies also overlook the loss of freedom the occurred after christians assumed political power in the 4th century
