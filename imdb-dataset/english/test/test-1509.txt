<START> the missing star who competed for the golden lion at 2006 venice film festival is a film that when you think about the first adjective that comes to your mind is intense intense looks intense sequences this movie's intensity captures the viewer since the very first scenes at the in italy i couldn't recognize the city maybe genoa or even naples although the pace is quite slow br br vincenzo the male lead and with him all the audience sees a completely different china than a normal westerner imagines horrible high rise building with about 8 hundred flat owners inside skyscrapers desolation fog and cranes everywhere but also the beauty of the river that will soon become a big lake because of the controversial dike that will wipe a lot of towns out china is a country under construction but under all these colossal public works there are still poverty and unfair laws br br we can relate more easily to this story because gianni the expert director chose two phenomenal leads sergio castellitto a well known actor in italy and the chinese surprise tai ling a total unknown girl that gives an as intense interpretation as br br the film is not perfect there are some flaws here and there but that doesn't mean it's a mediocre film try to see it
<START> are we serious i mean wow just wow i think i saw this flick in an old issue of war journal this is pathetic originality is completely dead instead of trying to formulate a new idea what we receive is a bland re do of an old plot line and to switch it up we just change the gender or race of the original character it's moronic and everyone should be sick and tired of seeing it but i guess this is just a rant and will most likely fall on deaf ears to engrossed with the sound of another turd hitting the toilet water like the best western since 3 10 to yuma wait for it 3 10 to yuma thank you hollywood for killing film as an art form and turning it into a commercial barrage of neo pop junk and blatant retardation wonderful
<START> i am a huge fan of harald and i just knew that i had to see this movie even though i can't say i'm a soccer fan but watching this just filled my heart with joy and i had a great time in the movies watching it br br bjÃ¸rn fast does a tremendous job directing this movie and even though you notice the main characters are new at acting they grow with the movie and makes it what it is even though it is supposed to be a soccer movie there is surprisingly little soccer in it the whole idea is to show the six guys making up the word n o r w a y on their trip to the world cup in soccer playing in germany this year br br if you're only gonna see one norwegian movie this year this is the one
<START> this delightful movie tells the story of buds and it's incredible you'll laugh and you'll smile and you'll laugh it's really all about the laughs when jon bon jovi is funny in a movie it's a heck of a movie 'nuff said now go watch it
<START> a post apocalyptic warrior goes off to save some kind of nun and on the way meets some cyber punks on skates who want to kick his ass this is one of the hardest to watch films ever there are scenes with silence that seems to last hours before somebody comes out with the next badly written badly acted line there are action sequences that keep repeating and we're not talking the 1 2 3 action repeat on a particularly good kick that was made popular by eastern directors we're talking many many repeats of long bad fight sequences this is incredibly confusing at first but then quickly becomes annoying as you're watching a 30 second sequence for the 2nd 3rd and 4th time any kind of plot or vision is lost within the confusing continuity the only thing thats keeps this film in the apart from the bet from a friend that i couldn't watch it all the way through without begging for it to be turned off and disposed off safely so it may harm no one else is the fact that although painful this film is unintentionally hilarious i'm not at all a fan of those so bad that it's funny type of films but at parts i was in tears other points to note are the quality of the sound and picture but this is forgiveable as it's obvious money was a major problem in the making of this film final verdict king of the so bad they're funny genre anybody having that kind of genre video night should get themselves a copy also lets not forget that it is actually the worst film i've ever seen
<START> i had to write a review for this film after i saw it last night and read some of the comments of people trying to classify the displeasure of this film go down to post i don't fit any any of those classification the other classification that needs to be on the list is 5 people didn't like this movie because it was not good i found the film to be and forced my wife picked it for us to see because she is a huge kidman fan and she also likes jude law br br speaking of law it took a long time and a huge amount of suspension of belief for me to believe his southern accent i can't help but wonder if they didn't make his character less talkative on purpose so we would't have to hear that tortured accent so much br br as far as the movie it took a long time for it to get interesting about 1 or 1 5 hours and then fell flat in it's ending what was interesting is that i did not know that this film was directed by about 40 minutes into the movie i asked my wife this isn't going to be another english patient is it it absolutely was br br as far as the battle scenes i'm trying to think of a word to describe the opening battle scene but i think the most descriptive word that accurately describes it is simply dumb it was forced it was unbelievable it was silly and it was dumb after the battle i looked at my wife and asked was that just dumb to which she vigorously nodded her head br br the only bright point in the film was the performance of zellweger the role was a bit over acted like any decent comedy relief role but it worked from her speech pattern her walk her mannerisms and esp her little quips my favorite if you want to get 3 feet up a bull's ass all you have to do is listen to sweethearts talk to each other she was able to create an almost cartoon like character who did her job extremely well br br i simply did not like this movie and i have to wonder about the kind of people who do say they like it or the english patient for that matter i suspect you could categorize them in one category 1 soap opera fans
<START> barricade finds alice faye without any songs as a refugee trying to flee china and without passport she's in a heap of trouble i won't say what exactly and even american won't help her out br br i mention that because one of the grievances that the chinese including the bandits who attack the american mission in this story set deep in the chinese interior was that particular institution whereby american citizens who committed crimes were tried by american courts set up by our we were far from the only country doing that however br br anyway the story opens with her on a train for shanghai trying to use a hokey russian accent the accent intrigues warner baxter who's pretty plastered br br bandits however interrupt the journey and the two of them seek refuge in the american consulate presided over by charles winninger he's the best one in the film and i only wish that a better story was given because i liked his character he's a widower and a proud member of the service appointed in 1900 by william mckinley he requested a transfer ten years later and that's the last he was heard from as assistant secretary of state jonathan hale aptly put it he's the real forgotten man br br baxter does all right in a role that someone like clark gable would have done in his sleep at mgm the heroics would have come more natural to gable than to baxter as the mission is barricaded and defended against the bandits br br alice faye did have one number to sing why alice's song was cut out god and zanuck only know one thing i'm still trying to figure out is when the mission inhabitants take final refuge in the cellar with a trap door just who was left upstairs to pull the rug over the cellar door br br barricade had the potential to be a lot better than it was but sloppy editing and lost faith in the project made 20th century fox release a project unfulfilled watching barricade is like eating a badly cooked meal
<START> what is there to say about an anti establishment film that was produced in a time of such colourless void social indifference and authoritarian contentment first major independent film was not an instant box office success and still has not received the critical attention it deserves i draw comparisons to this wave of american independent projects consisting of such filmmakers as robert frank and harry smith with the burgeoning scene emerging in paris in the late 1950's known as the french new wave br br they discussed poetry and philosophy and vulnerability at a time when the rest of the culture was obsessed with rediscovering american cultural supremacy even at this stage this peculiar highly spontaneous brand of filmmaking fought against the establishment of such political and bigots that held the development of the arts in check in the mid twentieth century br br film examines race relations and portrays man as weak in the face of love because we as a culture are blinded by our own race bias and prejudice the great element to most of work is that his films have almost a reversal minimalist effect a mental reaction is evoked through subtle character relations not so much imagery this is why his work seems to linger because he takes a more intimate approach to defining charcters that rely less heavily on explicit actions and more upon interpretation br br although my favourite film is 'husbands' this one is his most important
<START> as other reviews have said another of the countless number of alien clones this time with a great of the terminator thrown in add a bit of the classic sf story who goes there and a insanely stupid plot device lifted from the andromeda strain apparently flashing red lights make rampaging killer unable to detect scared people standing three inches away from them br br ok the story after a sequence of people running around in a space ship and killing each other we get a caption br br 25 years later br br the crew of a relay station orbiting mars due to be relieved in 48 hours detect a space ship on a collision course it's the siberia the ship we saw in the opening sequence not a good time to have taken everything useful off line on the relay station to do some repairs then the approaching ship doesn't deviate from its course and is broadcasting a do not under any circumstances enter this ship warning after a lot of shouting at each other the crew of the relay station patch something together and get the station out of the way just in the nick of time but the ship changes course and rams them any way impaling one of the crew on a stick pointy crew impaler thing the satellite starts to loose integrity bits de lots more shouting and running about in which only two crew people are sucked out into space backwards why are they always sucked out backwards br br after a few the wheelchair bound who is called the only only detectable joke in the whole movie deduces that the siberia is draining them of all their power and they need to go aboard her and switch off its engines they all go on board and take their helmets off do not enter this ship obviously means get on board the ship and expose yourself to possibly fatal infectious diseases one team head for the main computer room where they find a dead frozen guy clutching what looks like an american express card but turns out to be a the other team find some switches amazingly the dead bloke turns out to be the father of the attractive female crew member voted most likely to survive an encounter with a rampaging alien they switch the engines off but this means the ships reactor will explode a spooky point of view shot starts killing people there's some guff about the siberia having discovered an new ore a power source worth millions which mean the more venal members of the crew immediately thrust themselves into danger to get hold of it the pov shot returns with whoosh whoosh walking noises on the soundtrack unfortunately these give you the idea the killer is wearing trousers and the effect is wasted br br after that it's all just running around and getting killed in order of ugliness and acting ability until only the obvious survivors survive along with the cute dog which had managed to lead at least two crew members to their deaths just why space hardened veterans wander into the jaws of certain death looking for their pets cats and dogs has long been a mystery of this kind of movie other stupid highlights include everyone forgetting to act the falling levels of oxygen until reminded by the voice of the on board computer not that the low levels of oxygen in any way any of the impressive fires this load of idiots start if the killer droid id so clever it can steer the ship in a tight curve and have another go at ramming the relay station why didn't it turn off the do not under any circumstances enter this ship warning signal i'm sure if it was looking for more people to kill then yelling go away was not a good way of going about it br br vander is the only person who gets to do any acting everyone else just flares their nostrils all the time while baring their teeth and shouting and pointing guns at each other it that sort of script full of exclamation marks the only thing that kept me watching till the end was the hope that the script demand she take all her clothes off or get wet while not wearing a lot unfortunately it didn't one of the things wrong with this movie apart from it having more cyan put on screen than in any other movie ever is that there was no gratuitous nudity
<START> rich vs poor big city vs small town white collar vs blue collar these things are not original themes in movies so when one chooses to involve these themes the situational story line had better be very original or very good this one was neither i never believed in the romance of the two young lovers in this movie neither convincing nor compelling it just fell flat don't bother even with a video rental
<START> i am sick of series with young and clueless people talking about their problems all the time self centered boring and absolutely annoying popular dawson's creek beverly hills etc hack is a breath of fresh air with a great actor david morse a completely different plot credible people with real problems thank god and very very good histories i just love it i hope hack will go on for a long time because it is a great television series for grown up people for a change
<START> the stories were pretty weird not really funny and not really cunning i'm not sure what the point of the stories was the first story was actually mostly sick the second was just really really pathetic and the third was only weird the fake baby was actually quite badly made
<START> the is probably slim pickens best performance of all time when we were shooting everyone connected with the production figured that slim was academy award material unfortunately united artists had a james bond picture in release at the same time and did not devote much attention to the i personally feel this film was under rated by most critics sam junior bonner was out at the same time and seemed to impress the critics more than our film also cliff robertson had a rodeo film out a few months before our release and that might have hurt us too the picture is worth watching if just for the rodeo footage some of the best ever filmed shot by james crabbe the director and my co writer steve died a few weeks after the picture's release cutting short a promising career and leaving behind his lovely wife sally his daughter gaby and newborn son stefan please give this movie a shot i'm betting that you'll say it was well worth while i thank anyone who has taken the time to read this stephen lodge
<START> i own a copy of this film and have always loved it i comment here however because i saw the pbs presentation of a concert version of sweeney todd earlier this week that production was put on by the san francisco opera and starred george and patti in the early '80s replaced len as sweeney had won the tony for his performance i saw and angela lansbury who also won the tony for her performance as mrs lovett perform sweeney on broadway they must have made the film at about the time i saw the show to this day the most moving moment i can ever remember in the theatre occurred when sang these are my friends these are my friends see how they glisten my arm is complete again br br performance in the san francisco opera production convinced me that he has lost nothing in the nearly twenty years since i first saw him perform the piece on broadway and later in the film what a talent he is sympathetic funny and scary all at once and he can sing boy can he sing all of this reminded me of how terrific the film is highly recommended ten out of ten
<START> this movie contains the worst acting performance of all time lacks energy to say the least energy is what clayton moore gave us in spades i never felt once in this movie that was anxious for anything revenge love justice not in this guy's portrayal br br there is also no chemistry between tonto and if the plot did not force them to be friends you don't get the impression they want to hang out with each other plus the sidekick has the more interesting personality ewww br br the dialogue is predictable and boring br br the narration is stunningly bad and if you are familiar with the dukes of hazzard you can picture what this is like i cannot believe the director would agree to this it insulted me as a viewer by explaining every plot line i just witnessed br br hey at least the horses and locations looked good maybe that is what happens when you hire a cinematographer to be your director br br rating 2 you may be able to watch this one for laughs or to demonstrate to an alien what a bad movie is
