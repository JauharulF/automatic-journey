<START> i wish the series had not ended so soon although the acting may not be the greatest in the world it does end on a positive note and does teach morals and values to the viewers hilary swank did a good job of portraying a high school student who had lost her parents etc miyagi was great as in the previous 3 if you are not into the happy ending this movie like the previous 3 in the series is not for you this day in which we live you can not see enough about the bad guys getting what they deserve and the good guys coming out on top the bible teaches that good will always triumph over evil that is exactly what happens in this one it is a great family movie please see it if you have not already
<START> the visual effectiveness of this film is unmatched by anything i've seen and the work required to make achieve it must have been incredibly long and tedious you don't just stick kodak grainy film in your camera to get this look don't watch this film to be entertained watch it to be visually stimulated watch it to be challenged and provoked in your thoughts on film and any other topic that comes to mind religion will likely be one thought br br
<START> this movie is so awesome i loved it it was really scary i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there it probably helped that i watched it at midnight if you want a real scare rent this one 10 10
<START> should you wish to see the worst film ever made look no further some wretched movies are watchable because they are unintentionally funny alas american movie has no wit at all no unintentional humor just obscenities thought by its director to be laughable br br for those who liked this film i suggest you watch kevin smith's clerks similar in tone in clerks you will find creativity wit and enjoyment all on a shoestring budget it should make you forget this hideous effort
<START> this movie is about 3 stories put together revolving around 3 separate individuals one of the worst movie that is available and even better if it is not available br br the good 2 pretty lesbians actress 1 true and touching story about theresa chan br br the bad the main story that revolves around the blind and dear woman theresa chan does not need to be told in a movie format and more appropriate in a documentary format no linkage between the 3 story lines minimum dialogue in the film substituted by and chat programs on pc no cultural insight by the movie and it makes you forget even before you step out of the cinema
<START> john leguizamo's one man show is both funnier and more involving than most movies you'll see a number of devices such as slide projectors are used to enhance the story but this is essentially good old fashioned performance art in particular check out his hilarious rendition of i will survive highly recommended
<START> scary movie 1 4 epic movie date movie meet the spartans not another teen movie and another gay movie making superhero movie the eleventh in a series that single handily ruined the parody genre now i'll admit it i have a soft spot for classics such as airplane and the naked gun but you know you've milked a franchise so bad when you can see the gags a mile off in fact the only thing that might really temp you into going to see this disaster is the incredibly funny but massive sell out leslie neilson br br you can tell he needs the money wither that or he intends to go down with the ship like a good capitan would in no way is he bringing down this genre but hell he's not helping it but if i feel sorry for anybody in this film its decent actor drake bell who is put through an immense amount of embarrassment the people who are put through the largest amount of torture by far however is the audience forced to sit through 90 minutes of laughless bile no funnier than herpes br br after spoofing disaster films in airplane police shows in the naked gun and hollywood horrors in scary movie 3 and 4 producer david zucker sets his satirical sights on the superhero genre with this anarchic comedy lampooning everything from spider man to x men and superman returns br br shortly after being bitten by a genetically altered dragonfly high school outcast rick riker drake bell begins to experience a startling transformation now rick's skin is as strong as steel and he possesses the strength of ten men determined to use his newfound powers to fight crime rick creates a special costume and assumes the identity of the dragonfly a fearless crime fighter dedicated to keeping the streets safe for law abiding citizens br br but every superhero needs a nemesis and after lou landers christopher mcdonald is caught in the middle of an experiment gone horribly awry he develops the power to leech the life force out of anyone he meets and becomes the villainous hourglass intent on achieving immortality the hourglass attempts to gather as much life force as possible as the noble dragonfly sets out to take down his archenemy and realize his destiny as a true hero craig writes and directs this low flying spoof br br featuring tracy morgan pamela anderson leslie nielsen marion ross jeffrey tambor and regina hall br br hell superhero movie may earn some merit in the fact that it's a hell of a lot better than meet the spartans and epic movie but with great responsibility comes one of the worst outings of 2008 to date laughless but a little less irritating than meet the spartans and in the same sense much more forgettable than meet the spartans but maybe that's a good reason there are still some of us trying to scrape away the stain that was meet the spartans from our memory br br my final verdict avoid unless you're one of thoses people who enjoy such car crash cinema as bad as date movie and scary movie 2 but not quite as bad as meet the spartans or epic movie super villain
<START> van sant copies hitchcock's masterpiece shot for shot including some modern facets a walkman and nudity from anne heche unless you have a strong desire to see ms heche naked there is absolutely no reason to see this film instead of the original hitchcock's masterpiece is much better and van sant fails to realize that in hiding the nudity and the gore the original shower scene is all the more terrifying ask janet leigh about that one the acting is also much flatter and the technical aspects much less impressive
<START> great historical movie will not allow a viewer to leave once you begin to watch view is presented differently than displayed by most school books on this subject my only fault for this movie is it was photographed in black and white wished it had been in color wow
<START> as an ancient movie fan i had heard much about the controversial movie caligula assessed ambiguously as one of the most realistic epics by some and as one of the most disgusting porn movies by others i decided to see it in the entire uncut version to evaluate it myself hoping to find something positive that would make justice to the many accusations towards the film i sat down in my chair one autumn evening and started to watch the beginning quotation from the new testament shocked me a bit and raised the first controversy in me why to entail a sentence from the gospel by mark in the movie about pagan rome but the prelude pastoral scene with a young half naked couple caligula and drusilla running hopelessly through meadows seemed quite sentimental the music which sounded memorably whilst the credits also provoked me in the positive sense yet the negative feelings raised in me quite soon particularly at the death of the cruelty seemed very intense and sexuality exaggerated however it was not that horrific to the middle during the second half of the film i felt as if i watched no historical epic but an extremely disgusting porn in the end i said to myself this is one of the movies that one may really hate i am aware that a movie may be controversial but i had never expected that caligula would go that far in removing all limits of taste i hate this film due to many reasons but particularly one br br caligula does not serve a purpose of an ancient epic which it claims to be but bob the director and the founder of penthouse pornographic magazine aims at combining film art with porn that is i think the most serious matter the film may be accused of movie is an art that should be reigned by taste by message by some feeling of epic grandeur whereas this movie kills all limits of good taste caligula shows the most bestial side of human being in the most wicked decadent manner some scenes are so disgusting that i don't think there are any people whose psyches will not be affected by them some say that the rome under caligula's reign was so brutal yes it is true corruption bloomed at that time various sexual deviances were preferable to roman citizens yet i do not think that it is right to focus on these deviations so strictly and make it constitute an emphasis of an ancient epic i believe that it rather proves the bizarre psyches of the producers and their strange tendencies br br huge historical mistakes the screenplay by gore vidal is notorious for inaccuracies it is noticeable for instance with the figure of donato placido a historic roman senator yet the film shows him as a simple soldier on whom caligula forces his most decadent ways of tortures and rapes moreover livia was not wife raped by caesar on her wedding what lies behind changing the stories of historical characters into the stories filled with unbelievable vulgarity and violence another example of historical travesty is the figure of portrayed by helen mirren she is presented as caligula's wife together with drusilla his sister in fact caligula married long after the death of his sister the sexual abuse on his new wife in the temple is a hilarious scene with no historical bases i also hated the moment with the killing machine a pure imagination of the director that has nothing to do with historical facts br br technical aspect and cast from the technical point of view the film is nothing special the cinematography cannot boast to be exceptionally fine and the sets together with costumes are as well nothing outstanding yet the only strong point of the movie are the performances particularly the one by malcolm mcdowall as caligula he does a perfect job in the main role portraying madness and cruelty of the emperor mcdowall raises the value of the film if everything bothers you in caligula you may at least admire his performance i also fancied helen mirren as and teresa ann as drusilla yet the film is based on a gossip by that caligula made love to his sister sir john gielgud as and peter o'toole as old are also memorable o'toole does his finest piece of acting in the capri grotto sequence portraying the decadence and the exhaust of the old emperor yes i admit that the only thing i like about caligula are the performances therefore i don't rate the movie 1 10 br br lame continuity the historical inaccuracy of the film also goes in pairs with poor continuity let us analyze just the beginning caligula comes to capri grotto where he sees the awful pleasures of old then after about 15 minutes the action moves to rome where a black bird near drusilla and caligula's bed constitutes a bad omen and immediately the characters are again in capri where john gielgud is dying br br all in all i don't recommend to see caligula to anyone if you want to know the story read robert graves' gorgeous novel i claudius and claudius the god or watch herbert wise's mini series with the magnificent performance by derek jacobi caligula is a sick film the most serious crime of which is the destruction of art it is in its most part a porn movie that should never be called an epic br br there are movies that are truly artistic and sharpen people's taste of beauty br br there are movies that are average entertainment yet they have something to offer br br there are movies that show extreme violence yet they still convey some moral br br there are however movies that show sickness and decadence for their own sake and consequently harm people's minds br br caligula unfortunately belongs to the latest group
<START> as a fan of henriksen i liked him in the millennium series and of course lorenzo renegade lamas i had expected at least something from this film sadly the plot is predictable the acting is bad and the used for most stunts don't work out sometimes it even looks like they've captured some shots from microsoft flight simulator br br the cinematography sucks as well unnecessary funky camerawork in the beginning only detracts from the cheesy dialogue and gives the film a cheap made for video look it works in hiphop movies and jet li movies but seems out of place in this flick br br i would have liked this film 10 years ago i was 11 then
<START> this is by far probably the worst film al pacino could have starred in the movie had no real plot it kind of careens into 24 different directions it seems that the target audience for this film are people from anonymous mat mcconaughey's character is not believable enough to be pacino's so he won a few bets for some degenerate clients as a sideline to a shitty job recording on a 900 service does that automatically supposed to convince an audience of his skills it was just plain stupid to think of the trailer did promise to show us how he makes his sure shot picks but after going through the whole film i have yet to see what skill if any he ever had if you want skill try looking at robert de niro's character in casino now that is showmanship at some point in the film character picks his winning bets at a flip of a coin anybody could do that al pacino seems to talk a lot and i mean blabber mouth in your face dialog i think that style started with scent of a woman and worked for him because he finally won an oscar but now i think its just irritating he seems to be always sermonizing he does do a mean act of portraying a man having unstable that's an impending heart attack its typically reminiscent of his acting in part 3 which he plays the aging diabetic mafia don corleone but other than that pacino's talent is wasted on this film rene russo is just plain eye candy for this film she's kept in shape and shows it off in the tight clothes she wears throughout this film is plain crap do not waste your money on it it is much worse than the gambling picks of mats character in the film
<START> this for one has nothing to do with the absolutely fantastic first flick and of course us americans just have to remake everything successful into english because man reading subtitles is sooooo hard isn't it from what i've see in the new trailers with the adorable now pregnant jessica alba well that sure ruins every teenage boys fantasy everywhere doesn't it it looks exactly the same but probably w double the budget i thought the original was one of the best horror suspense mystery flicks i have seen in any language in quite a long while i would recommend watching that one and skipping this one all together there is no reason to watch this as there is no reason this even called the eye 2 except to capitalize on the excellence that was the first flick do yourself a favor watch the eye with the volume turned up and get ready for some probable jumping i watched it w headphones on and was pleasantly surprised on the excellence that was the direction of the pang brothers if the eye remake does well which i'm hoping it does for the sake of the pang brothers movie careers but at the same time it seems a shame that people won't can't see the original because very often almost always the remake isn't as good as the original watch this one if one wants to be mildly kinda of boring flick but the original is no comparison to this sequel in name only flick
<START> not knowing a great deal about the truth and reconciliation commission i can only look at this as a piece of entertainment i started watching it too late in the evening recorded from bbc2 earlier this year but once i'd started i had to watch to the end br br the down side is that it's effectively a courtroom drama never my favourite genre but it's stunningly photographed largely in super saturated and well acted like a good novel i couldn't put it down all the way through i wished i was watching it in a cinema to do the music and photography justice what happened to its release in theatres i'm an admirer of since i saw him in dirty pretty things and hilary swank looks terrific in this very female and sexy for a change possibly out of place but she adds to the visual attractiveness of the film br br this picture deserves a wider audience than it seems to be getting
