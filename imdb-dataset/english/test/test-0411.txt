<START> this movie really proves that the world is all too often an unfair place especially the world of motion pictures the assignment received barely any attention upon it's release and not surprisingly flopped at the box office but when history will be written this movie will most surely receive some long lost praise br br thank god i'm surrounded by friends who knows what's good for me being a movie buff like myself a pal highly recommended the assignment a movie i hadn't even heard about i decided to check out what leonard maltin gave it and not surprisingly he gave it 1 2 knowing that this is the same grade he gave classics like alien the usual suspects and the matrix i kid you not i knew his meaning didn't mean squat jack s so without hesitating i went out and bought it on dvd this was about 3 years ago and the movie is still one of my proudest belongings in my dvd collection despite a cover design that echoes a low budget stinker with casper van dien br br the assignment is expertly directed delivering some really intense moments that will hold you on the edge of your seat throughout the movie on top of that it boasts an at times brilliant story that you know will be riddled with unexpected twists and turns it stars aidan quinn in one of his best performances and serves him with great support by donald sutherland and ben kingsley who are both in great form br br something like 40 out of 42 user comments like this movie most of them can't seem to praise it enough so what are you waiting for if you call yourself a fan of action thrillers you should have bought it rented it seen it yesterday
<START> it's one of the of low budget independent film making that so many with so little in the way of real talent fancy themselves the paucity of talent evinced by these wonky wannabees is there for all the world to see case in point flight of the living dead or as i quickly came to know it shite of the living dead there's nothing wrong with paying homage to one's heroes i've done it many times over the years myself in many different ways in fact in the book the night riders co written with m kelley i dedicate it in part to the six writers whose work inspires me still richard matheson harlan ellison shirley jackson edgar allen poe h p lovecraft and robert e howard had it been a motion picture i would've dedicated it to the directors whose films have inspired me over the years very high up on that list would've been george romero it's nothing less than a crying shame that the makers of this film weren't truly as inspired by romero as their title suggests
<START> no shortage of female flesh but still not interesting at least is capable of so far greater probably peaking at spasmo and starting with kiss me kill me br br the hard gore r2 dvd release may be cut at 86 minutes but this movie contains one act of cannibalism and one victim a scene with a native girl who is brutalised and by the cannibal tribe we are warned of and who later set fire to some huts arsonist holocaust firestarter anyone br br certainly not a cannibal flick but was there ever a decent one made avoid
<START> this comment may technically contain spoilers but it sure doesn't contain surprises br br my cousin and i rented this the other day hoping to get a good laugh at a typical amateur crappy excuse for a horror movie unfortunately we didn't get too many laughs and we certainly didn't get too many scares either br br plot outline a plane containing a company head's daughter and some weird piece of technology crashes in an area where our furry friend lives so the company head assembles a team of personalities rather than skilled hunters to recover it br br for the first 3 4's of the movie things get pretty boring it mostly consists of shots of big foot lurking in the trees with the party members occasionally hearing him and passing it off as nothing we also see several shots of the party through big point of view and he apparently sees in thermal vision br br to set up the plot we have to watch sequences of the group sitting around the campfire talking about possibilities to justify the sasquatches existence and actions maybe he can dodge bullets if he sees them coming sure enough we later see he can there are many uncharted lands that the sasquatch may live in maybe this is one of them that was over looked and obviously it is maybe the sasquatch is angry because the plane hit one of his family members and sure enough thats the case along with those scenes there are a couple of oh my god its the sasquatch oh wait its just you scenes and sadly they are among the scariest br br then finally people start dying well 2 people at least plus the bodies of past victims are discovered the death scenes are pretty lame it mostly just leaves it to our imagination by showing the sasquatch grabbing them then cutting to a different scene but first we are treated to some horrible screams off camera br br then at last we get to see the protagonist's final showdown with the monster i gotta admit i found it pretty exciting while it lasted but alas it's pretty short lived and after we are treated to an ending that makes a half assed effort to seem cryptic then some closing text with a rather boring conclusion br br i can't say i recommend this movie it's not quite bad enough to give the mystery science theatre 3000 and its definitely not scary enough and boring to enjoy as a horror movie just don't bother with it
<START> it's just that chucky 1 was good chucky 2 was better chucky 3 sucked now the 4th in the series which is in my opinion the best out of the series jennifer tilly was just great in this movie for dolls they were better than a few actors that come to mind freddie prince jr for one and funnier than many comedies i've seen in the past br br the plot wasn't great but i really didn't care about it just to see chucky and tiffany bicker and fight each other and the ending leaves it wide open for a 5th sequel which i hear is in the works idle hands premiers next week and looks to be another horror comedy but i doubt it'll top this one
<START> 'the english patient' can rightly be compared to the films of david lean whose sweeping epics such as 'lawrence of arabia' and 'bridge on the river must have inspired the director anthony the film is beautifully photographed and like is set in northern africa but during the second world war the story is complex but it boils down to a forbidden love between an opinionated and often difficult archeologist played by ralph fiennes and a married woman played by kristin scott thomas br br the story based on a novel by michael is told in flashbacks by fiennes' count de the titular character the fact that his name does not sound like he's english plays a key role in what unfolds he has been badly burned in a plane crash occurring just as the film opens and is being cared for back in europe by hana an army nurse played by juliette binoche what makes this story epic is the vast sweep across place and time and the development of characters beyond that of the two ill fated lovers the film makes clear that true love and passion even with dreaded consequences can make life worth living or worth dying for if you're a romantic at heart and can appreciate a film without the standard happy endings and simple moral codes you may find that 'the english patient' speaks directly to you br br
<START> ok let's get this out of the way first as a piece of cinema lifeforce is rubbish as a bit of cheesy entertainment for sf buffs it's got a lot of merit if you enjoy watching those old black and white sf b movies giant mutated spiders ant or alien monsters wandering around the desert you really will get a kick out of lifeforce br br bad things the story makes little sense and the acting is pretty poor good things the special effects are halfway decent it has a different british centered story it's set in london which gives different feel to most sf movies and it has the well endowed mathilda may amusingly billed as space girl wandering around stark naked br br in short it's fun br br i've seen it half a dozen times now and every time it comes on tv i make time to watch it admittedly this is partly to do with the naked ms may but it's also to do with the enjoying a bit of unassuming and silly sf
<START> this fake documentary is flawed on a lot of points it's badly made has uninteresting characters but the biggest problem i have with it is the basic premise br br this film uses the idea that h p lovecraft has traveled to italy and that some of his work is based on real supernatural events that he witnessed i'm willing to go along with the notion that he traveled to italy only for suspension of disbelieve but that some of his work is based on reality and that exist is total nonsense br br first of all lovecraft didn't believe in the supernatural in his letters he clearly states that he considered himself a mechanical his monsters where there to show that humans weren't so special after all another myth used in this film is that lovecraft was an expert on the occult he wasn't all his knowledge on the subject came from the most basic sources br br so we end up with a film about people at each other a lot and when we finally see the monster it's so bad that you can't even laugh at it you just feel a pain in your love for horror br br after seeing the film frankenstein lovecraft said that he felt sorry for mary shelley because he felt that her work was butchered i feel sorry for lovecraft
<START> this production was quite good the usual fabulous scenery interesting quirky characters it was just so strange not to have captain hastings miss lemon and poirot's office residence so prominently featured in the original pbs bbc mysteries br br in the original series so much took place at the office hastings reading the paper while poirot exercises his little gray cells miss lemon pitching in whenever needed br br poirot without capt hastings would be like holmes without watson he can most certainly solve the crime but it is not as interesting br br and what would a poirot mystery be without hastings with his impeccable manners falling for some beautiful unattainable woman
<START> this very forced attempt to fuse robert altman and quentin tarantino who is wildly overrated himself is neither informative nor entertaining the character development is arbitrary and unbelievable especially in the final scene of the thugs and the little boy as other reviewers have noted also a couple of humorous moments aside the film is not as funny black humor or otherwise as the director seems to think it is
<START> bhagam bhag was a waste of money and time big time i wonder y govinda did this movie govinda dude m your big fan u have to make right decisions now in choosing movie i wonder he had any role in that movie govinda's role could be given to johnny lever akshay kumar steals the show here akshay dud u rock u have created space in everybody's heart all over the world lara dutta u guys deserve better paresh rawal is good at his witty overall there were few scene where i laughed otherwise i was just wondering y the hell did priyadarshan made such a stupid movie anyways lets wait and watch upcoming movie
<START> part of the movie's low rating is the emphasis on unemployment and the suffering we have to endure while this is good for drama in comedy we know the pains it need not be emphasized as a result fun with dick and jane is not an appropriate title and i was just plain disappointed failing to see any fun with dick and jane it is true that this is a copy from the movie of the same name but it fails on the execution and the title was not appropriate for the story line br br however if the movie was retitled to be the art of the steal and the emphasis on bungling slapstick comedy more takes on the robbery and the plans to steal stupidly of course would have given the movie a major boost while at the same time the movie should show the ceo at least in the beginning to be a crook so it will be easier to project the pains to someone responsible early on and just leave it at that the movie suffers a viewpoint issue and with that in mind a comedy cannot work if the viewpoint is not done properly a scheming husband character who is that of a wile e coyote on the road runner would be more funny including the slapstick comedy but in this case a steal instead of the capture of the bird with complicate contraptions would be extremely funny here i mean you can make many of these and put them in the movie but since the viewpoint was done wrongly the robbery part had to be limited br br you will enjoy the movie the first 15 minutes during jim carrey's great rise but to make the problems they had to faced to be more comical since it is a comedy that is the part that needs a major overhaul it can be funnier if problems were faced more like john travolta's civil action during the downfall that movie was a serious one but the problems they faced were somewhat comical
<START> this movie is the stupid comedy of the year and quite possibly the best thing from mike judge since office space if you are a mike judge fan or enjoy shows like futurama then you are doing yourself a grave disservice by skipping over this little known limited release although the dvd touts very few bonus features this film is certainly funny enough to make up for it's perceived lack of value br br this movie is about an army grunt by the name of joe bowers played by luke wilson who is part of a top secret army experiment designed to preserve army personnel in peace time so that they can be in war time to fight for our country however things take an interesting turn as the general in charge of the operation is busted in a prostitution ring and the experiment is all but forgotten bowers and his sidekick rita played by maya rudolph both find themselves awake in the year where through the course of natural selection the population of america has grown increasingly stupid now joe and rita have to find their way to a time machine to get back to the year 2005 with the help of played by dax shepard br br what i really enjoyed about this movie was mike judge's comedic satire on the course of us history over the last 50 years and how mankind progresses over the subsequent 500 years this is most evidenced by the advertising in the movie which has become a staple of the american culture with shows like south park in the mainstream media it's easy to see how conclusions could be drawn that in the future profanity has become a marketing tool this is portrayed in the film humorously with subtle things such as fudd changing their name to butt f ers and a billboard which displays the advertisement if you don't smoke f you i also cannot stop laughing at jr 's role in this future with their slogan f you i'm eating and their automated kiosks self advertising their extra big a with more molecules this film contained everything i go to the movies for excellent sharp witty comedy as well as an engrossing plot make this dvd one for the ages be warned however if you are not a fan of mike judge did not care for beavis and butthead or do not have a sense of humor then this movie probably isn't a good match for you otherwise i would say this is probably the funniest movie to come out of i mean 2006
<START> prior to airport these movies were rather good they had decent special effects all star cast and good acting this movie destroyed the franchise and there are many reasons for it lets talk about the special effects wow they are horrific what was the director thinking about i know it's only 1979 but lets look at other very good special effects movies such as star wars 1977 and moonraker 1979 i like the idea of the and this could of been the best airport movie but they did too much with it how about joe patroni george shooting a flare out of the cockpit window to prevent a heat seeking missile from hitting the also he is doing 90 degree dives and loops this completely far fetched and unrealistic wow believe me the special effects don't help this scene and really are beyond poor they almost look like a cartoon and this is how the whole movie is finally lets talk about the acting which in my opinion is extremely poor to fair at best over acting is a major issue in this movie especially george kennedy which i really like as an actor but just doesn't cut in this movie the full blame has to go on the director who did a very poor editing job and really whacked out the airport franchise too bad the isn't still used today it was a marvel of air travel
<START> not too long ago i bought a cheap vhs tape entitled just rambling along supposedly featuring laurel and hardy being somewhat familiar with their output and not recognizing this title i made the agonizing decision to part with a whole dollar and buy it upon playing it i identified the film as hop to it of course mr laurel was nowhere in the cast making the packaging of this product criminally deceptive even worse the quality is terrible it looks like it was duped from an 8mm film source it did have a somewhat appropriate musical score actually in all seriousness the tape is worth a buck if you just want to get an idea of what the movie is like in my opinion it is a decent but unexceptional short imdb should add just rambling along as an alternate title for this film which incidentally was the name of a 1918 stan laurel film
