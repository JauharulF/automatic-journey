<START> 1931 also presented an american tragedy the original tale of who will he take up with poor girl or rich girl this was a truly entertaining film babs stanwyck was a pretty as she could be ditto sally blane monroe unmemorably played husband i had never heard of him but i thought he bore a good physical resemblance to bing crosby of the big broadcast even a receding hairline and ears ricardo cortez the rich playboy with a heart of gold a true movie pioneer going back the dilemma is resolved at the end to the strains of the title and i believe annette had the hit recording although the off screen voice did very well i also enjoyed the dance hall scenes i'm sure they were authentic the band a leading one of the time was superb good job lionel barrymore
<START> i had to watch this movie for a film class i suffered the whole time through i am not asian but was still greatly offended by this film the film's basis is overall minorities rex harrison isn't even asian are depicted in narrow minded manner the banning of the film in thailand illustrates the degree inaccuracy and subjective portrayal of asians in addition there has been critical attention given to biography of anna many critics argue that anna added many fictitious events to her story to project herself in a good manner some critics of the film and biography have even stated that anna made up the whole story an awful film but good for discussion of biopics as form of meta narrative fiction rather than a work of non fiction
<START> the story is quite slow at the beginning except few interesting humour that come along the way but some of the plot still empty br br the science on how the kid entered the 21st century is still a mystery except at the end of the movie we have been shown of how br br other than that everything looks ok
<START> i thought i might be disappointed viewing this film again after so many years on the contrary i was more impressed now than in my callow youth with its honesty and brave humour in 1969 the transition among african american groups from a predominant policy of and integration to one of confrontation and self determination was still quite new and more than a little controversial it took courage and finesse to portray both the establishment and the anti establishment as the caricatures they often closely in real life special mention should be made of arnold johnson's performance he successfully avoided having his character lapse into either sociopathy or buffoonery i'd rather watch this than to sir with love any old day
<START> if there are people that don't like this movie i don't think they are human this film deploys all emotions and shows many sides of judith light's character made in 1997 this is one of the best movies i have seen and really the film that judith light has starred in to make me a huge fan of hers this movie although sometimes you want to rattle the son for trusting her so much is incredibly moving i cry at the end every time and it takes much to do that to me the plot doesn't have much to it but the acting provided by judith light is incredible she looks beautiful the whole time and by the end you don't want the fate imposed by the courts to happen to her overall a movie worth my highest praise thank you for making it and redefining my view on the death penalty i eagerly await this movie to come out on dvd or some other form of media since lifetime is starting to issue some movies to customers although i don't have high hopes for this one because this took place almost 9 years ago which is still hard to believe since this movie is still ingrained into my head after all this time
<START> the make or break of a love story for me is whether or not i like the characters and also if they click with each other matt is pretty unlikeable aloof braggart seemingly lazy and a misogynist he's been hurt badly by his dysfunctional mom and this makes him a little easier to take i guess i liked the details of his dysfunction he was believable he by bragging that nail amy he acts so cool around amy that he strikes out twice when they do talk he can't show her who he really is she and then him at just the right moments she seems so mature and strong that the traits of hers that come out later didn't seem to fit for me i found her to be incredibly sexy and pretty girl next door pretty i call it so i was going to like this movie unless it really screwed up br br funny things happen with the coach but matt's relationship with the other coach was inspiring the football scenes at the end were perplexing matt doesn't carry the ball but seems to be a blocking back folks he isn't the right size he's fifty pounds too light for that position but i thought his acting was skilled i measure that by the way i wanted to wring his neck a couple of times during his scenes with meredith monroe the film was all right meredith m was better than all right
<START> others have harped here about james stewart's age when playing he was 47 was twenty five but stewart does not look his age and the film for him was a dream come true an actual pilot and a retired air force reserve general at the end of his life stewart had the feel for the character and understanding of his passion which other actors could not bring to the role added to the cast was co star murray hamilton who was also to be featured in the f b i story with stewart and such other well known character actors as richard deacon of the later dick van dike show and robert of the thing from another world the 1951 sci fi classic br br billy wilder captures the flavor of the autobiography and the telling of what was to become a major event in the history of aviation this story and film are a testament to the soul of determination and perseverance to realize a dream a box office failure at the time of it's release it has since become one of the great classics of american film and another in a long line of outstanding performances by an actor that has been called america's everyman no student of film history should miss seeing this one there have been over 500 000 films since the beginning of motion pictures and this one belongs among the top 500
<START> this could have been the best game ever but the game makers just screwed up after 3 assassinations and the ending this is a combination of prince of persia hit man gta and age of empires ii br br yes these four games mentioned above are considered to be one of the greatest games ever made br br you combine the four and you get this game it has all the good aspects of the four games like acrobatic skills stealth assassinations open world and the history for the first 3 assassinations you feel this game is greatest but after the third things seem to get so repetitive that you only hope for the game to end br br i have played this on a pc and the pc version is horrible with glitches and the stupid side missions are senseless br br my advice to all this is a good game but get it either for the or ps3 don't get it for the pc br br lastly this game came from the creators of prince of persia surely the producer is hot but the game is not hot and it is not better than the four games mentioned above
<START> it's like someone took a fantasy type video game and put it in a blender and the resulting scene mishmash is what we have to sit through br br now let me go on record by saying how much i love chinese fantasy films from the fun and silly to those focusing on martial arts to the more dramatic and romantic a genre i very much enjoy films like a chinese odyssey pandora's box and a chinese odyssey cinderella both of which were written and or directed by jeffrey lau the bride with white hair butterfly sword green snake a chinese ghost story ii zu warriors from the magic mountain crouching tiger hidden dragon and others which is why i was looking forward to a chinese tall story one of the film's characters is the monkey king aka sun an extremely well known character in chinese mythology first told in the stories of the journey to the west the epic adventure written about 500 years ago the story of the monkey king and his disciples is also the focus of the chinese odyssey films amongst many others other familiar characters that appear in the film are zhu the pig character and sha br br so how does it all go wrong well let's take an example familiar to western audiences how about the robin hood mythology a well known story from ye olden days let's say that our robin hood film starred wesley snipes as robin hood and haley joel osment as friar tuck maid marian is none other than rosie perez let's give sir robin an uzi as well because you never know when you might have to waste the sheriff of nottingham they might need rocket packs also and while we're at it give them a tactical nuclear weapon because that sure could come in handy if you think this sounds like a really neat retelling of the robin hood tale then a chinese tall story is the movie for you as i indicated above this movie is a jumbled mess in the first 30 minutes we are introduced not only to sun zhu and sha but also to the monk who is actually the main protagonist kidnapped children a millennium bug demon which shoots laser beams an underground tree god a lizard imp tribe an angelic girl in an intergalactic egg the lord chancellor tortoise a sea dragon king a ever morphing magic golden staff a imp girl wormholes in space and the four heavenly knights all this wouldn't be too bad the tales and myths passed down over the years certainly do have all sorts of fantastical elements but i guarantee you the chinese mythology does not include much of the stuff we get subjected to in the last half of the film helpful advice to the filmmakers just because your computer effects guys can come up with cool looking spaceships and depictions of intergalactic war does not mean they should br br you know your chinese mythology movie is on the wrong track when the director asks and i am not making this a direct quote from the commentary i asked the composer whether or not we can have a more rock and roll type music when she transforms into some kind of android like thing is there a story hidden in here somewhere yes yes there is most of the adventure follows played by nicholas gen x cops time and tide my schoolmate the barbarian and the lizard imp girl played by charlene choi and a computer choi is the best thing going in this film you may know her as half of the canto pop group twins and from other films such as the twins effect a fun flick and just one look a surprisingly good drama romance comedy poor choi being a lizard imp and all is hardly recognizable with her warts snagged out teeth nose and hunched back that is until the computers get a hold of and beautify her which somehow makes it worse tse is passable but all of the supporting actors were abysmal a couple of recognizable faces in bit parts are wasted br br at one point i was debating with myself if a chinese tall story was a spoof i was almost able to convince myself that it was when the intergalactic egg girl played by a very pretty fan bing bing got out and lit up a marlboro while talking with who was practicing martial arts dressed in a spider man costume but it is not a spoof of course there is the typical hong kong silliness but the movie takes itself seriously enough with enough scenes of romance and pathos scored with a of violins and evocative and rousing action and adventure br br you might think that you could watch this on a netflix rental and it wouldn't cost you anything oh but it'll cost you all right br br is there anything good to say sure the colors are vibrant they are the best thing about this movie and the filmmakers certainly were trying very hard too bad all that effort went into a movie that is not much more than a bad video game
<START> i first saw this film on cable in the 80's and it rocked me to the core it showed up again on tv about six months ago br br filmed on location the black and white cinematography graphically portrays 1950's new york as the gritty urban jungle at a time when there was far more industry and port activity in the city particularly in manhattan br br john cassavetes always brought a special intensity to his acting and is magnificent in the role of the army dodger his brief 1959 tv series johnny staccato is also a joy to watch br br sidney poitier and later in the film ruby dee bring freshness and vitality to their roles but it is jack warden's superb acting as the vicious brutal shift boss that grabbed my attention to get an idea of warden's versatility watch this film then check out a 1962 episode of the tv series naked city entitled specter of the rose street gang available on video if you are a fan of film noir this is a must see enjoy
<START> no budget direct to video tale of aliens in arizona involving the military and escaped convicts br br not bad as such rather it suffers from the cast and crew sort of going through the paces instead of trying to sell it its as if they knew they were in a grade z movie and want you to know they know then again maybe they just couldn't get it together br br a misfire of a grade z movie that could have been something if some one cared and had skill why must low budget filmmakers insist on not actually trying to make a something good instead of just making a product br br 2 out of 10 because nothing comes together
<START> i work at a movie theater and every thursday night we have an employee screening of one movie that comes out the next day today it was the guardian i saw the trailers and the ads and never expected much from it and in no way really did i anticipate seeing this movie well turns out this movie was a lot more than i would have thought it was a great story first of all ashton kutcher and kevin costner did amazing acting work in this film being a big fan of that 70's show i always found it hard thinking of kutcher as anyone but kelso despite the great acting he did in the butterfly effect but after seeing this movie i think i might be able to finally look at him as a serious actor br br it was also a great tribute to the unsung heroes of the u s coast guard
<START> this is one of the better marion davies talkies and one of the few to allow her to exhibit her skill as a physical comedian which was so endearing in her silent films ok so she does a clunky tap number but even ruby keeler's dancing from the era does not hold up for younger generations the problem here is the script the story falls into unbelievable melodrama in the last reel it's quite stagey and is obviously adapted from a play but not well enough still there is some snappy dialogue and slapstick throughout worth a look
<START> yes this movie was just hilarious and the acting was top notch from the whole cast except shelley winters german accent wasn't that great but then that doesn't matter as she is hardly in the film so if you're a fan of hers beware the two main stars of this film are laurence harvey and julie harris now before this film i'd only see miss harris in east of eden with james dean and i own an audio tape of the glass menagerie that she did on stage with monty clift and jessica tandy so i wasn't sure how she'd be in this role and boy did she impress me how hammy was she i love ham mr harvey he tickled my fancy i am now a full time laurence harvey fan that hair cackles omg it's almost like burt that crazy messy look it doesn't get better than that he is young and so innocent in this film see it now it's definitely in my top ten i am so glad i found a copy that is all mine unfortunately this movie is out of print and very hard to find on video br br btw watch out for the hospital hotel room scene it's one of the best parts or when mr harvey has convinced himself he's ill and he's trying to get his knee to kick you know how doctors do with that little rubber hammer well he does it himself and his leg kicks and it kicks the table squeals check out the look on his face so innocent i can't describe it but to all those people who say he couldn't act very well and other cockamamie comments see this film and you will see what a great actor he really was you'll be bowled over if you aren't then i'm afraid there is nothing i can do for you you're hopeless
<START> national velvet 1944 the movie that put taylor on the map costarring the then number one box office champ mickey rooney taylor plays a girl in love with her horse and when jockey mickey rooney is unable to ride in the grand national race spunky liz cuts her hair pretends to be a boy and races the horse to well i won't spoil the end for you it's quality melodrama that mgm was famous for putting out and it's another early color picture to boot
