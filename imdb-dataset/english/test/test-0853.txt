<START> when i was told about this movie i wasn't too happy to see it although by the end credits turned out to be one of the best movies i have ever viewed br br the movie it self is quite graphic male to male scenes you don't see everything wouldn't be a gay themed movie if there wasn't br br the movie is very light hearted with humor and contains some very funny parts i highly recommend this movie about 3 quarters through you really feel for the main characters and this i think brings the whole flick together br br once again very nicely put together plus cute mormon
<START> the '70s were a great time for horror movies the brotherhood of satan is yet another overlooked gem it's full to the brim with great surreal unsettling scenes it's also great to see martin and l q jones who also produced in decent roles br br some of it is a little dated and cheesy but the brotherhood of satan kicks butt over race the devil and many other '70s satanism flicks
<START> i just finished a double feature night of an american werewolf in london paris let me start by saying london still holds up after all these years and the transformation sequence is by any standard quite impressive the film was funny and scary also a bit of gore now lets get to paris its enjoyable a few scars lots of gore not as exciting or eerie as original but it does have a few laughs in what has become quite the fashion these days in films so maybe in that sense it was ahead of it's time the transformations cgi while good for the technology of its time are nowhere near as impressive as the original i gave this movie a 7 because i have to admit it was enjoyable i laughed a lot and found tom everett scott to be so silly that at first i wanted to dislike his performance only to end up liking it go figure julie delpy was competent as was the direction it's the script that lacked a bit of shine finesse i read here that john landis was supposed to direct to bad he didn't i am quite sure it would have been a different movie altogether i also noticed some discussion of a sequel what if well no one has noted the obvious it should be in american and here is my title an american werewolf comes home or in dc that would be fun all those political dogs need a good scare you simply must see the original in it's new dvd transfer with dolby 5 1 sound and see both of these on an hdtv with turned on nice
<START> completely worth checking out saw it on birthday 2006 and it hit me big time sometimes it feels like we're all in a trap and are doomed to repeat the past no matter how much we try to change all we can do is to keep on going and speaking out just keep on going don't mean to be a downer because that's not the point but maybe we need to get down before we see how much we need to work on ourselves what happens when we keep being told by the best people like mlk what needs to happen to pull us out of our dead end road but we don't listen i know that some of us do listen but how do we get the rest of the world to see things as they really are just keep going i guess this movie got me thinking even more about all of this so i guess it has done what it set out to do that's what i consider to be a good movie or play or book or poem or speech or anything something that gets you thinking and keyed up to move in an active direction instead of sitting stuck and bored and hopeless
<START> an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nut bag side note i'd love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones the soundtrack wasn't terrible either br br but the acting even that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochon was terrible the directing worse perhaps to the former the dialog chimp like and the camera work barely tolerable still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oy vey scale i don't know where this was filmed but were i to hazard a guess it would be either an open air museum or one of those re enactment villages where everything is just a bit too well kept to do more than suggest the real old west okay so it was shot on a college kid's budget that said i could have forgiven one or two of the aforementioned faults but taken all together and being generous i could not see giving it more than three stars
<START> i was hoping that pulp would be a interesting movie but was profoundly disappointed br br pulp has very little storyline and what there is never holds your interest it was a real struggle to keep watching it when its over you say to you self huh that's it this is one where you think after watching it why did they ever bother br br its too bad since michael caine is a good actor i was also hoping to see the great lizabeth scott in this but she only appears on screen for a total of perhaps one minute scott is one of the all time great film noir femme fatale girls and this was her last film br br oh well
<START> wallace and gromit are the main characters in some of the best cartoons ever crafted the excellent mix of visual humor and claymation makes a grand day out the wrong trousers and also a close shave some of the best animated footage ever put on television winning several oscars and also countless other awards nick park became quite the popular man in the u k yet his impact on the united states has not been big after the third wallace and gromit short there was all this speculation about a full length wallace and gromit movie yet for years nothing had happened then in 2000 instead of a full length wallace and gromit film we get another brilliant claymation film from nick park which was chicken run which almost got nominated for best picture in the academy awards perhaps it was the success of this film that ultimately drove park to finally work on a wallace and gromit project br br 5 years later these kinds of films do take long you know and a lot of anticipation wallace and gromit finally hits the big screen despite the rather weak trailers and marketing campaign this movie delivers in so many ways this film will be a delight for both kids and parents with tons of adult humor hidden beneath the brilliant animation wallace and gromit curse of the were rabbit is one of the few films that perfectly manages to equally appeal to both kids and adults this rather difficult technique is one that only pixar has already perfected and dreamworks has had a lot of trouble doing lately despite the dreamworks logo slapped onto the poster this film is mainly from the very creative staff of aardman animations br br wallace and gromit are first seen running a business that protects the townspeople's crops from being ruined by rabbits which apparently had been running around wild and in great numbers lately their business has gotten them plenty of respect from the others living in the town because a gigantic vegetable contest was rapidly approaching and the crops needed protection complications arise when wallace attempts to manipulate the rabbits into not liking vegetables and then a great eating machine is unleashed on the area it is up to wallace and gromit to find the gigantic animal and stop it from eating away through gardens and also their approval from the townspeople to add to that wallace wants to impress lady which also captured the attention of a snobby suitor by the name of victor simple plot yes but there is more than meets the eye be prepared for a few fun surprises along the way kind of like in the other wallace and gromit cartoons br br in animated films with little dialogue it is the animation that has to set the pacing and the mood of the film despite requiring 5 years to produce only 85 minutes of footage the payoff is fantastic there is a massive amount of detail that requires more than one viewing to truly notice even more incredible than the detailed and nearly flawless animation is the truly unspeakable amount of visual humor put into the film whether it is a creatively placed shot or normal labels put into the funniest position possible or it is the oh so adorable rabbits that is constantly shown in the film most curse of the were humor comes strictly from just watching the movie itself and catching all the references before it is too late just picture the movie madagascar except funnier much fewer pop culture references and better animation br br casting was great even though in a film with not much dialogue it was not that important peter yet again does a wonderful job as wallace even though in this movie there was no stand out quote that can be used anytime the wrong trousers it's the wrong trousers gromit and they've gone wrong ralph fiennes does a superb job as the lead villain victor and also helena bonham carter known as the crazy female lead in the cult hit fight club lends her lovely voice as she plays wallace's love interest even though nothing could top the final chase in the wrong trousers curse of the ware rabbit did have plenty of action scenes including one fantastically done chase scene between gromit and victor's evil dog last but not least the rabbits really steal the show at some moments whether it is their cute expressions their funny movements or their howling the rabbits in the film even take some of the glory from the main stars the funniest rabbit in the movie is the cursed rabbit himself to the very end of the movie he had the audience rolling in laughter br br bottom line despite not being as memorable as the wrong trousers this film is just as good and entertaining as chicken run unlike almost every movie to come out this year the movie does not drag at all clocking in at a short 85 minutes yet containing so much joy and fun it will leave everyone watching it asking for more there is very little wrong with the film it was a pure delight to watch this film is a total contrast of the decent yet vulgar uncut raw movies that have made a surprising amount of money earlier this year 40 year old virgin wedding crashers and sin city and for families and those who want harmless entertainment that is a good thing highly recommend this is the top animated movie to come out this year and among the best we have seen this decade wallace and gromit curse of the were rabbit totally harmless fun from second 1 to second 5 100
<START> this movie bombed at the box office and in the voting here but i loved it one measure of a movie's worth is how much of it you can still remember after 25 years i won't bore you with a list but there are dozens of deeply comic scenes also a good story and great casting the inept robbers are a hoot see it and judge if it ever gets on tcm
<START> its no wonder this was free with the mail on sunday slow going poor acting and filming camera flare near start of movie is not even artistic straight to video but not in this case why not recoup some of your film production costs by releasing it free with a uk sunday newspaper at least this way you get a captive audience and recover some costs br br i have not given this film a 1 out of 10 due to the effort to pull some old actors out their shell it was nice to see some old faces vanessa redgrave this an't no blow but vinnie jones as a lead and i think he was better in gone in 60 seconds when he did not speak br br this film is dropping in ratings every day i think this will find its true mark at the 3 4 out of 10 in the very near future
<START> this bbc series is excellent i am no paleontologist but this series gives the best historical representation of dinosaurs i have ever seen the 3d animation and animatronics are very good and make you believe you have travelled back in time the bbc deserves a pat on the back for such a fine series as well as tim haines who must have spent a great deal of time getting this series to air
<START> watching alien express inspired feelings of awe shock pity and yes sheer terror to think that actors who have done good work in the past should come to something like this the horror the horror br br tell me if any of this sounds familiar br br a train especially built for a political campaign is on it's way to las vegas for a big rally for the candidate a senator from texas barry corbin the only actor with roles both alien express and no country for old men in the same decade at a railroad crossing in utah a meteor incinerates a car waiting for the train to pass br br the train stops local law enforcement is summoned oh can it be the senator has a lovely young lady amy from cry baby and melrose place who just happened to have once been married to one of the officers answering the 911 call lou diamond phillips stand and deliver la bamba is the ex husband br br meanwhile aliens have managed to stow away on the train br br the train leaves lou gets his buddy to pilot a helicopter so that lou can drop onto the moving train about 70 miles per hour so that he can save the day as the buddy's reward he crashes the helicopter into the mountain br br which is another example of how poorly written alien express is the cop hero's sidekick must die we all know that but he's supposed to die near the end of the third act usually while saving several lives br br once on the train lou manages to lose his shirt so that he can channel bruce willis in die hard by wearing a wife beater t shirt yeah lou is 46 years old but he hits the gym the part he's playing isn't worth bothering with but he's in good shape br br the senator is going to have an afternoon delight with miss utah but aliens intercede and both he and the woman young enough to be his granddaughter pay the ultimate price br br soon we have bomb threats multiplying aliens and of course the train goes out of control and speeds toward its date with destiny while lou and todd bridges diff'rent strokes try to save as many lives as they can br br there is exactly one surprise in the entire movie early in the story a couple lift wine glasses to their thirty fifth anniversary with hopes for thirty five more years together the dude gets banged up but he and the mrs both live maybe the writers just lost track of them br br this is the kind of movie that you'd love to be a fly on the wall these actors who have done better work and really deserve much better than this are probably just happy for the work did they actually think they were working on something worthwhile or did they cry and or drink themselves to sleep at night at the end of the story the fairly numerous all things considered survivors gather in the last car of the train which is the other cars go over a cliff but the one containing the protagonists stops just inches short of the cliff br br lou and his ex are reunited happiness reigns i'd have thought that the first thing they'd do was get off the train so they'd have solid ground under their feet but i digress br br someone looks out the window and sees a shooting star look make a wish then another then more and more the earth is being bombarded with meteors that will crack open and creepy crawly hand puppets with big teeth will be everywhere br br it's gotten to a point that seeing the words the sci fi channel presents on an original movie tells us that we'll be glad we have ti vo so that we can fast forward through the next two hours or better yet just go ahead and erase it two minutes into the story and spend that time more wisely
<START> this is a terrible movie that is barely recognizable from the book although they have sort of similar plots the time it takes to watch this movie which is only 1 5 hours would be much better spent doing anything else including watching grass grow the addition of poorly done fantasy scenes make catherine seem insufferably silly the actress who plays catherine also comes across ditzy as all goodness and looks constantly surprised even when she's supposed to be looking lovingly into her eyes honestly the movie ends with a catherine fantasy like scene where one can't help but wonder if it's happened or if she's merely delusional and not in the good way that makes you think but in a perfectly horrible way that basically sums up the terrible movie the only good thing about the movie is the title which was written by ms austen herself i generally love the bbc's productions but this one is horrid
<START> pacino and really hit the mark with this stinker i swear i am an avid movie goer and fan i have been a fan of most of the people in this abortion at one time or another until now the story crap the acting crap rene major league was good the plot crap the subplot garbage the teenage attempts to relate to sports betting junk br br i have vowed to watch romy and michelle's high school reunion 2 times a day for the next seven days as my punishment for not turning this bag of a movie off after 10 minutes i was out of town for a seminar and this pile of mung cost me 9 99 and 2 hours i have been cheated this director should be in jail for fraud br br get with me if you have other review questions i am always right
<START> try not to see this one i thought it was going to be good because i'm a fan of cheesy 80's films and i've enjoyed quite a bit of linnea quigley's work i was wrong i should have said no and watched gigli instead which is probably a far better film i guess my biggest problem with this film was its attempt at humor nothing about it was funny or even close to funny the acting is bad even for the queen of cheesy 80's films there is no story just random clips i guess i shouldn't hate it so much because it was just made as a fun and silly piece but i didn't have any fun and i wasn't entertained once i even had to fast forward to the ending to get through all of the crap i'm sorry but i don't find zombies doing aerobics funny
<START> terror in the jungle is a real find if you saw it you're one of the few lucky ones it's hilarious br br the story is about an airplane crashing in the middle of the south american jungle the crash scene has to be seen to be believed everyone dies in the crash or they're subsequently eaten alive by crocodiles only a young blonde boy survives a nearby tribes brings the kid to their village and they all males venerate him because of his golden hair i kid you not at the end there's a lot of wrestling between the natives and the man on the search for any survivors of the downed airplane all the while the kid sits on a throne and his blond hair is surrounded by a golden halo and he cries nonstop it's a hoot br br very obscure and contains very questionable subtexts a must if you're into obscure it's so bad it's good movies
