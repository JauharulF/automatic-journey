<START> directed by e elias begotten is an experiment with a few interesting ideas that don't quite succeed in what they were trying to do the film is a 76 minute ultra slow questionably effective irritating experience that tries to present an intriguing philosophy about the creation of the earth and human nature br br it opens with god presented as a chair bound psychopathic man who tears open his stomach using a knife from the guts blood and human waste mother nature emerges she proceeds to impregnate herself with the dead god's semen later she gives birth to the son of the earth a retard who is constantly abused a group of cannibalistic people whom i believe to be the representation of mankind br br begotten takes a twisted and disturbing look on the origin of life demonstrating the self destructive nature violence lust and greed that have become a trademark for mankind the problem in the movie come from two points one is that the film is just too slow in it's exhibition what we get is a good thirty minutes spent on showing how the son of the earth is constantly shaking naked on the ground while at the same time being molested and tortured by mankind such tasteless prolonging gets boring pretty fast and lacks the punch in delivering a blow to the viewer's senses br br another point is visual appearance and sound the grainy inverted black and white low frame cinematography enchants the disturbing factor of the plot but such novelties often work in only short periods of time then gradually begin to lose their effect as the audience becomes accustomed to the look the audio suffers from the same problems it's constant repetitive and similar sounds become annoying so fast i had an urge to turn off the volume begotten loses it's charm shortly after it begins it tries to be original and creative but it fails to expand on the ideas hinted by the vague plot instead it repeats the same scene again and again br br the conclusion is that begotten is stuck in one moment even though plot wise it tries to move forward the visuals and audio remain the same throughout showing the same action in a slightly different way with just slightly a different sound a gimmick cannot alone make a movie it also needs pace and variety something seems to have forgotten
<START> words alone cannot describe the sheer beauty and power of this film br br think toy story now think toy story circa 1934 now imagine the animation looks as lifelike as fluid think of the movie not as something adults and children can enjoy but imagine it as a noire br br imagine trying to do something like that back in 1934 somehow the mascot delivers in a story where toys come to life and one of them is trying to deliver an orange to his sick owner starewicz delivers a level of animation completely unexpected it's so fluid you will wonder for a long time whether what you see is really stop motion animation br br comparing toy story and the mascot is an excercise in futility plot wise while toy story is a children's story adults can enjoy the mascot is a dark chilling story aimed at adults meaning no your kids won't like it one bit br br still get it if you can you might be able to find it along vampyr in dvd and laserdisc and prepare to be stunned at what starewicz was able to do back in 1934 with a couple of puppets
<START> i like bad films but this thing is a steaming heap from the shaky cameramen to the horrible sound and devastating acting don't waste a second on this pile fifth graders could have made a better film and first graders could have written a better script want a real synopsis ugly chicks in neon bikinis dancing for way too long a disjointed plot made worse by hideous acting the on location sets weren't even passable the church scenes take place in a dance studio and oh yeah what's with the two tap dance numbers that come up out of the blue br br oh and the total number of naked breasts which couldn't have even saved this film 0 add this one to the trash heap
<START> there are interesting pieces here of and about bruce weber's likes and dislikes maybe if a professional editor had put it together for biography i would have felt more satisfied instead i spent 8 at a film festival on it for an autobiography almost nothing is revealed about bruce weber other than he likes to look at photographs shoot interesting people especially beautiful teenage boys and listen to jazz the director of would have made a much more interesting and cohesive film
<START> a good movie for horse enthusiasts and most others it's a horse racing movie and it's a little man gets his chance movie and it's a how far would you go movie walter once again proves his as an actor he fits right in as lloyd a louisiana cajun horse bum this movie gives you a rare screen glimpse of cajun horse drag racing he has a young quarter horse who is a top racing prospect had nothing but a filling station and a good horse the seize the opportunity to make it big by taking the horse shadow to new mexico to get ready to run in the all american but how far will lloyd go to win the fame and fortune also memorable from this movie are scenes of lloyd spitting tobacco juice and waiting for his truck to start
<START> this is one of those family movies that i can't imagine having much appeal to anyone over about 9 a group of siblings discovers a sand fairy yes really conveniently located at the end of a not so secret passage at the country home of their eccentric uncle to which they've been evacuated from the london blitz and there you have it all in one sentence the story is about the role of magic in childhood and the danger of getting wishes fulfilled but neither of these issues is examined in a way that would be interesting to adults or instructive to children or vice versa the only reason i can think of for watching this is to see how starkly freddie outstanding talent stands out from the rest of the mediocre performances
<START> this movie sets out to do something very particular it also sets out not to do certain things in short it has a definite premeditated trajectory to deal with the idea of facing death with very few choices and all of them bad as grave and real rather than something casual or amusing in search of that realism it has eschewed certain conventions such as obvious character arcs and hooks it not about the characters so much as about the human condition never mind what the actors would do what would you do in their situation br br open water may have been a starting notion for this movie but it goes a lot further unlike that film it doesn't cheat the audience in the end when you find out there aren't really any sharks to speak of at all this has a real monster not just the idea of a monster and not just an animated stand in it also has fine production values given what these very resourceful filmmakers had to work with and again in contrast to that other film it has some exhilarating and brilliantly rendered action at it's climax and let's not forget the shall we say 'dazzling' screen presence of its youngest star she may prove to be quite a discovery
<START> thankfully i watched this film alone enabling me to fast forward through the worst scenes aka most of the film actually ok some of it is not all bad with partially good photography even some of the under water scenes and at times not too bad directing but it still doesn't save the incredibly poor script and way worse acting additionally when i don't find the movies hottie to be all that even the wannabe sexy love making scenes get dull really dull and for the drama you know it's always a bad sign when you get to dislike all of the characters so much you really don't care who lives and who dies br br if you still haven't gotten tired of the reality series survivor you may find something to your liking in this movie if not stay well clear
<START> people who know me say i have a weakness for animated films br br to be fair those people are half right my actual weakness is for exceptionally well done animated films such as this vintage family flick from max and david fleischer br br you may be thinking to yourself well if it's so great why haven't i heard of it fair question this movie was released the same week as the attacks on pearl harbor the unavoidably bad timing caused the film to sink into relative obscurity things are looking up though because it has finally been released on dvd under the title br br it's funny that the film went through all this because it kind of mirrors the actual plot although some people claim that the movie is trying to send an environmental message ugh i personally think that the movie's main idea is perseverance through adversity and hard times after all the country had barely pulled out of the depression at the time br br our grasshopper hero desperately wants to help his endangered community problem each time he tries whether through the ill will of others or through simple bad luck he fails miserably and slowly begins to earn the disdain of the very people he's trying to save although he does his best to maintain a positive outlook he occasionally breaks down and it's only through the encouragement and support of his friends that he gets back on his feet and fights the good fight just a healthy reminder that when all is said and done no one is really self sufficient br br okay you're saying it has a good message two actually does that really make it exceptionally well done br br my answer partially br br it's not just the message that makes this movie special it's the characterization this is one of those films where you can just see the personality of each cast member in their animation you almost don't even need the spoken lines a good way to sum it all up is energetic or lively a lot of movies have used the selling point lovable cast of characters whenever i hear that line it always makes me think of this movie br br case in point the bad guys swat the fly and smack the mosquito many movies have lovable villains but i don't think you'll find any as entertaining or endearing as these fellows forget that 3 stooges cartoon from the 60s swat and smack are the closest thing to an animated version of moe and curly but sadly not larry that you'll ever find virtually all of the funniest moments somehow involve this gruesome twosome yeah they're rotten no but you still care about them that's the kind of power you only see from a really talented writer director and crew br br the movie has two brief jokes revolving around racial stereotypes native americans and chinese i don't think they were intended to be malicious but they're there regardless they didn't bother me but it'd be pretty unfair of me not to warn someone who potentially would be bothered by them br br so if you share my weakness and i think you do give this one a go
<START> what is he supposed to be he was a kid in the past and the future this movie had a lot of problems is he a ghost or just a strong kid man what a piece of crap i'm still confused also is he supposed to be an abortion strange very strange this movie will mess with your mind and it's not very scary just confusing why was he where did what was the oh who cares milo isn't worth it br br my score 10
<START> i don't understand why this movie has such a low rating it totally deserves more sure it's completely ridiculous but that's what it was supposed to be don't expect cinematic transcendence from a movie about beauty pageant contestants stranded on a caribbean island what you should expect is a huge spoof of pretty much every relevant sci fi fantasy and block buster movie in cinematic history and even references to other all completely exaggerated and sometimes totally unnecessary but that's exactly what makes this movie stand out if you like parodies and enjoy say leslie nielsen or mike myers you're gonna love this i sure did
<START> critters 4 ranks as one of the greatest films of the twentieth century the word classic has never been so aptly used as in describing this mind blowing epic i agree that the original critters is the best of the series but the claustrophobic tension of the space station in which critters 4 is set really must be seen to be believed i strongly recommend this to anyone interested in seeing one of twentieth century's major film landmarks
<START> i just watched this film at an advanced screening i had not read the book and knew nothing of the story but went because the book was voted book of the year by two local colleges so i cannot compare the book with the movie as others have done br br in short i thought this was an incredibly moving story the acting was believable and the insight into afghan culture and political history was both interesting and shocking my oldest friend is iranian american and so i felt an affinity for certain middle eastern values and traditions that were portrayed in the movie as they reminded me of the times i spent with his family br br the themes of friendship family human values and courage under fire are universal and are well developed in the film i won't list the plot details as these can be obtained elsewhere but based on the film's technical aspects the acting and above all its heart wrenching story i would definitely recommend this movie
<START> the child's play series isn't a favourite of mine but bride of chucky is actually an okay movie this time we have two dolls chucky and his former girlfriend when he was human tiffany together they go on a journey to find an object there are a few interesting scenes through the movie like the guy getting hit by the truck and literally exploding the sex scene between chucky and tiffany and the ending which allows for another sequel to take place wasn't really a straight forward horror it mixed a lot of comedy and was a sort of spoof of the horror genre this made the movie better like comedy does do with many horror movies all up even if your not a child's play fan give this one a go
<START> no i'm not kidding with this one he was a guest reviewer for entertainment weekly and gave this movie positive marks and who can blame him this is a charming upbeat and rather funny disney movie who doesn't love kittens the music in wants to be a cat is jamming it makes me want to snap my fingers or something only years later when cats don't dance came out have i seen a movie that was that musically fun what aristocats lacks in animation and story it makes up for in charm plus everything moves at a relaxed pace and even the villain isn't all that scary it's perfect for the younger set while not being so sappy that adults can't like it if snoop was here i'm sure he would say the same thing yeah dig those crazy cats man
