<START> in the first transformation scene what is the music i've heard it was the greeks don't get no is that right i really liked that sound i also liked the hyde's got nothing to hide in the final scenes truly a movie but with many laughs and puns sight gags and slapstick madam woo woo's place was reminiscent of some places i have visited myself ivy venus has appeared in some other stuff that is truly amazing she looks much different in the movie we're talking about but her maturity didn't hurt her a bit mark blankfield reminds one of gene wilder in some ways bess armstrong was beautiful and maintained her beauty for a long time
<START> the combination of amazing special effects and oscar worthy acting makes the one of the most important sci fi films of recent years for some reason still unknown to me this gem was found in a bargain bin why some worthless human thought it right to dirty a modern classic by to a bargain bin is beyond me i have never been so terrified by a man in tin foil and random bursts of fire forget terminator robocop aliens and other films that ripped off this masterpiece the is an unstoppable force

<START> this film was a mexican made horror film from the late 60s it's not that good but really not so bad either there is plenty of schlock and it is padded pretty heavily with nudity and violence but it had a plot and at least tried to keep to it even if the plot was the same damn frankenstein inspired don't tamper in god's domain b movie fare there was some padding mixed in with the female wrestling but it was made in mexico and wrestling does seem to be popular in mexico br br the plot is that a doctor wants to save his son who is dying from leukemia the other doctors have given no hope for the poor guy but dad has the idea of transplanting a gorilla's heart for his son's to save his life i don't know i'm a lawyer not a doctor the transplant works but sonny boy ends up becoming a man ape who terrorizes nude women and kills anyone who gets in his path there's also a subplot involving a cop and his girlfriend who is a wrestler this really didn't add too much but if they wanted to throw in some masked female wrestlers here's a good reason to do so br br the film was kind of cheap but not too bad for a b movie of the day the plot was basically just recycled and there were a few things that weren't tied in that well however this film is kind of fun in its own way i don't know why maybe because it's a mexican horror film and sticks out in my normal bad movie diet i guess it may be because it's a mix and mash of some very weird things br br watch it if you like cheesy foreign films nudity and female wrestlers
<START> this movie was so bad i thought i was going to scream in the middle of it it was all i could do to sit through it the beginning of the movie where they are at war was promising only it smacked of saving private ryan to me or at least an attempt at it only we don't care for these people there was no build up to the characters the kid that dies i guess was suppose to make us cry but for some reason it just irritated everyone then we have to listen to line after line of sappy dialog that tried desperately to mimic wuthering heights which of course was also quoted in the movie go figure there was nothing original about the movie at all it was like sitting through the most mundane parts of every war movie ever made with a little bit of humor thrown in to keep you hoping that it was going to get better sadly it doesn't 3 hours later i leave the theater feeling cheated anthony should be shot for trying to duplicate the english patient which for it's time was a good movie but now i wonder should i rent it and make sure i wasn't just caught up in the hype maybe i was but i definitely wasn't caught up in the hype of this film i really went to the theater wanting to like this movie i am a die hard nicole kidman fan save your money rent it on dvd and laugh through it as i did
<START> my ratings acting 3 10 suspense 2 10 character attachment 1 10 plot 2 10 character development 2 10 overall 2 10 br br this show sucks very much officially for me csi miami is the best csi ny 2nd and csi 100th i don't know in the other you get into the episode you're watching but in this one you just can't get into the episode no matter how much you try so in my opinion this show is not worth watching i know people have different opinions and i respect that but for me this csi ain't good enough so if you like suspense real acting performance good plot direction character development attachment and you an overall good show i suggest you to watch csi miami
<START> really enjoyed manna from heaven if you liked my big fat greek wedding you will like this too once the story line is set it begins to keep you guessing the outcome i think we'll be hearing more from five sisters productions i know i'll be watching for their next movie
<START> a great gangster flick with brilliant performances by well known actors with great action scenes well not this one br br it's rather amazing to see such a wide cast of well known actors that have many good movies in their filmographies in such a movie without doubt this may be one of the worst they could possibly appear in br br first of all the plot is as you'd expect it from your average gangster biography nothing new nothing fancy in it the way it is told makes the movie look a lot longer than it is when i thought the two hours should be almost over i was quite surprised that only 45 minutes had passed br br the action scenes look a lot like those from 80ies tv series the a team for example it's just that in the 80ies esp with the a team those scenes were far more sophisticated than those in el padrino it's especially fun to see the guys point their guns in the air and still hit something not to talk about people that take cover behind car doors which later look like they've been shot through br br the acting fits quite nicely to the action either you get the same reaction to everything that happens dolph lundgren style or it's so overacted that you may think it's a parody but unfortunately it's not br br my advise is to stay away from this movie any other gangster movie is better than this one
<START> portman and susan sarandon play off of each other like a symphony in this coming of age story about a young girl who is sentenced to life as the daughter of one of the women you will ever encounter sarandon has this ability call it talent if you will to play some of the most off beat characters and bring their humanity to forefront of any film she makes as the mother of this obviously brilliant and beyond her years young girl sarandon alternates between being the mom and being the child with the ease of a ballet dancer more importantly she does it with strength and flare without stomping all over portman's portrayal of the daughter the question is always asked when we deconstruct the film plot who changes this film is certainly about the daughter but if you look close at the dreams and sacrifices that mom makes you come to understand that she changes in step with her daughter i am willing to bet this makes all of us in the audience change also the hallmark of fine drama
<START> as a former erasmus student i enjoyed this film very much it was so realistic and funny it really picked up the spirit that exists among erasmus students i hope many other students will follow this experience too however i wonder if this movie is all that interesting to watch for people with no international experience but at least one of my friends who has never gone on erasmus also enjoyed it very much i give it 9 out of 10
<START> developing movies that are based on actual events involving cryptozoology or the supernatural has always been a challenge for directors and screenwriters you have to mainly reconcile reported testimonies conflicting info sources and hollywood creativity to produce something the audience can get into unfortunately for sasquatch none of these things seem to take place br br the movie starts out in typical film noir when a research team crash lands somewhere in the via airplane from there the research team disappears and despite attempts from law enforcement officials and local rescue parties they remain missing for some time while one of the passengers is walking infra red like images are splashed on the screen a la predator which subtly hint that the legendary sasquatch is the cause of the passengers' fates br br cue harlan knowles henriksen ceo of industries and father of one of the crash victims knowles puts together his own search rescue team with the explicit mission of finding his daughter and the rest of the research crew along with the invaluable technology lost during the crash br br after knowles' tailor made rescue team is put together the entire movie traverses down the path of characters dizzying cinematography and a totally unoriginal plot line i literally had to keep myself from falling asleep during this movie as it attempted to frighten me out of my wits the only member of the cast that held his own was henriksen which doesn't make up for the lack of depth presented in all of the other characters the over done sound effects were annoying as well basically i didn't know if i was watching a movie about bigfoot or grizzly bears br br neither was the plot line all that great it was too underdeveloped as the viewer is mainly subjected to typical fright music found in anything similar of the genre obviously you didn't have to be a genius to figure out who would be pulling off all their clothes by the middle of the movie or who'd be the first unlucky soul to get mauled by mr sasquatch as far as good points there are none and therefore i gave this movie a 2 out of 10
<START> if you are french native then you find this movie extremely funny it's good just good can though imagine that subtitles or translations don't mean much in english
<START> i just don't understand why anytime someone does a show about one of the largest metro areas in the country houston dallas austin san antonio etc they portray the average person as someone who wears wranglers cowboy hat talks with a drawl has zero fashion sense and drives a truck on his way to either the saloon or his next hunting trip rodeo skeet shooting or country music concert i have never even seen a small town cop driving a police truck anywhere in texas br br the funny thing is this is not done for artistic reasons or comedy they are actually serious and i guess believe the average person is too stupid to know the difference the bad scripts and equally bad acting give that away this show makes goofy shows in the past like knightrider look like high brow entertainment at least knightrider had the talking car
<START> a tale of two sisters is a brilliant south korean psychological horror that left me speechless the film offers some delicious moments of ghastly horror and is extremely creepy the small cast of actors is truly excellent with lead im soo jung being especially memorable in the lead role the direction by kim ji is well handled and the cinematography is absolutely gorgeous the plot is slightly confusing but some scenes are wonderfully eerie the action is rather slow but i was not bored in the slightest i was extremely curious and intrigued the house where the film takes place looks incredibly menacing and isolated a tale of two sisters is along with ringu and kairo one of the most original asian horror films i have ever seen watch this masterpiece as soon as possible my rating 10 out of 10
