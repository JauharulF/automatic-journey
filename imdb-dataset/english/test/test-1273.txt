<START> i don't go for that many heist comedies and i might not care for this one if it weren't for the actors when it was made and when i first saw it just a few years later it's almost too similar to the happening even though it's obviously a much less serious comedy than that one mafia figure takes over his own kidnapping or rather turns it in a different direction altogether of course raquel welch didn't play the kind of sharp character faye dunaway did in the happening but that doesn't make it a sexist film either she was practically playing a stock character almost her version of a moll but i'm completely biased it's among the first films i ever saw with her and at the time i saw it you couldn't turn around without seeing a poster of her luckily i think robert wagner was really just right as the neither thoroughly likable nor dis likable leader of the group as were edward g robinson naturally and de sica and godfrey cambridge an actor who always managed to be funny
<START> 11 years after this film was released only 5 people have reviewed it here on imdb there is a reason for this utter lack of interest in across the moon it is coherent but lacks all cinematic virtue see this film for examples of terrible production in all respects the opening credits for instance are white letters rising mechanically from a red background the ending features michael staring out a prison window saying there's lots of mysteries out there followed by a clip montage music video of all the uplifting moments in the tragically bad movie hatfield everything in between is awful i struggled to find any value in this movie and have come up empty though it is hard to believe even a cameo role from burgess always a crowd pleaser only disappointed me further this movie is like a mockery of what is special about movies on paper the movie is below average women living together in a trailer but what actually was produced was nearly unwatchable the movie attempts to branch off in many directions but never follows through on any the unappealing conflict of having their boyfriends in jail is never resolved no conflict is ever resolved there really is no conflict the women attempt to become hookers but that never happens instead they get jobs as a bartender and a shelf sound exciting it wasn't it was stupid and the bulk of the movie is the two women talking and generating contrived conflict the women are capable actresses but the script was beyond poor useless this was a terrible movie but it is even worst that they borough burgess out of his retirement home to make it bad from start to finish like the lion without teeth this film has no bite
<START> komodo vs cobra is not going to set the world on fire it's not a hallmark of cinema history what it is is a group of underfunded filmmakers trying to make another movie make another paycheck and continue to support themselves and their families as such i give these efforts a lot of slack i mean come on it has to be hard to be a russian special effects technician not a lot of big budget films getting made there but they are a dedicated bunch and more than willing to throw their all into whatever lame american monster flick needs affordable sfx and i get a kick out of looking for the same locations appear time and again in these flicks if for some reason you find yourself watching this again look at the sequence where pare and company are walking through a jungle look at their feet and you'll see paved walkways and if you happen to still have a copy of ai assault shown a week or two earlier also on scifi you'll see the folks in there through the same ersatz jungle come to think of it i think the helicopters land in the same clearing in both flicks i can admire the of these films every dollar really does show up on the screen too bad there just aren't enough dollars
<START> fires on the plain 1959 br br you don't see films like this anymore on the is an incredible depiction of the lives of the soldiers of the japanese imperial army kon masterpiece follows tamura a soldier with tuberculosis as he wanders around the philippine landscape in the last year of the war he is sent away to the hospital by his commanding officer only to be refused treatment and so he is sent back his co tells him to go back and if they refuse him again then his last order is to kill himself with his grenade he is refused again but meets up with a band of squatters sitting outside the hospital the next day they are shelled by american troops and tamura flees choosing not to kill himself and from there he wanders from place to place trying to get to he discovers that some men have been eating human flesh in order to survive while others trade as much tobacco as they can for whatever they can get back br br the film is filled with a quiet sense of desperation and desolation with a hint of insanity everyone we see is skin and bones covered in dirt wearing torn and tattered rags ichikawa uses his camera to catch some beautiful shots of the destructed landscape and the japanese soldiers who walk it kon ichikawa was famous in japan for making many comedies and satires and there are moments in fires on the plain that are bitingly hilarious take for example a shot of what appears to be a dead man lying face down in a pool of water a soldier walks but and asks himself aloud if that is how they will all end up to which the man lifts his head out of the water and replies what was that and then drops his face even deeper into the puddle than before another hilarious sequence involves one man finding a pair of boots along the trail he takes the boots replacing them with his old ones another man walks by and sees that pair of boots and switches up for his old boots the scene continues until finally tamura finds the exchange spot and examines the boots left without hardly any sole he looks carefully at his own and at ones on the ground and deciding that they're both he removes his own and goes barefoot the film is filled with incredible scenes one after another like and kurosawa ichikawa knew how to use his camera to paint beautiful and stunning pictures there are many stunning shots of men in barren empty plains surrounded by nothing but smoke in the air and dead or dying bodies on the broken earth there is another incredible scene where dozens of japanese soldiers attempt to cross a road guarded by yanks in the middle of the night all crawling on their hands and knees as the camera watches on from above br br the film gets its name from the columns of smoke rising up from fires on the plains seen throughout the film they represent to the soldiers life a little more ordinary the lives of japanese farmers back home burning husks of corn their of hope for the normal life however are in hostile hands br br the film caused a stir in its day with its graphic content much emphasis is placed on the horror of war not just with the enemy but within your ranks and yourself kon fires on the plains is an incredibly authentic and moving and somewhat disturbing portrait of the horror suffered by the men making up the lower ranks of the imperial army clint eastwood's letters from iwo jima while it is a very good film comes nowhere close to realizing the horror of war depicted in fires on the plain eastwood was no doubt influenced by the film seeing as he claims to be such a classic japanese film buff many war films show that war is hell through the eyes of the winners in fires on the plain we're shown that war is even more hellish when you're on the losing end br br 4 4
<START> i saw this on a boring sunday morning just this morning well i was drawn to the fact that it's an outdoor movie i was hoping to find some nice sceneries but it the views where just limited they just go back and forth in the same spot all over again i hate it when they're using this so called hi tech stuffs like the this motorola blue tooth headset they're using to eliminate the use of a walkie talkie it was just so funny they look like amateurs and they where like advertising those badly designed alien ware that could link up to a satellite to find people i couldn't say more about this tv movie the ending was bad that it looks like they cut it short eliminating the use of rescue helicopters and etc
<START> ewww a disney sequel that is rubbish who would have thought it actually quite a lot judging by the comments here and they aren't wrong i actually looked forward to seeing this awful film based on my liking of the original and therein lies disney's whole cash in mentality shovel out any old junk on the back of a success and people will go for it don't think they are that cynical ask yourself this then how many disney films have sequels and then how many of those sequels spawn a follow up a significantly lower number br br new groove is just another example of this the plot is laughably simplistic and drawn out even more annoying was the increased number of out of place items and scenes an old folks home for example and god forbid an aztec version of the boy scouts worse yet opposing leader has a completely bewildering over the top english accent for no reason whatsoever an accent that was after a very short while intensely grating on the nerves br br there are a couple of good things the animation is very nice and the voice talent do well with the sub standard dialogue they are given especially warburton in the lead role but other than this there really is nothing to recommend it sure little kids may like it but there is little to amuse mum and dad whilst they sit through this tortuous maiming of the original concept br br avoid this monstrosity with the same zeal you'd use in avoiding a pack of ravening man eating lions
<START> unbelievable philosophy depth genius masterpiece people must have seen another oldboy because the one i've seen was a badly written poorly conceived over the top acted sordid piece of which even ignoring for a moment the ludicrously violent scenes which makes it unsuitable for the eyes of a child could barely satisfy the imagination and the thirst for plot consistency of a seven years old br br the depth of this sorry concoction was exhausted in one little piece of wisdom laugh and the whole world will laugh with you weep and you'll find yourself alone the type of boring fortune cookie saying which a great author be him shakespeare or more to the point of imdb kurosawa would have thrown in the garbage can with no second thoughts where this movie should have landed too if we wouldn't live in an era in which the cheaply shocking and the perversely disgusting are confused with what used to be named once great art in short yuck br br 2 out of 100 it's not 1 out of 1000 only because of some occasionally expert camera work in no way enough to save this infantile failure from worthlessness though
<START> that's the only word i can think of to describe this movie not waste as in a waste of time any time spent with these characters is never wasted but waste as in a waste of opportunities br br when i see this movie i think of all the star trek novels that were written which would have made a much better film than the story shatner chose the setup was like an average television episode while the finish felt like the climax if you can call it that of the first movie br br nimoy in directing ii iv focused on the character of spock how he faced the kobayashi outside of the classroom and how he handled his emotional live now that he had a chance to start fresh shatner could have done the same with kirk here but he didn't we don't know much about kirk that we didn't know before again one of the novels would have been better try my enemy my ally for a very interesting character study of our friend james t the minor characters are used mostly for cute bits and the scotty uhura subplot seems way out of left field particularly since the subtext in the original series was sulu uhura br br even hardcore fans can't find much to enjoy here sorry but it's true
<START> when i heard they were making this i was happy considering the first film was pretty good if a little on the short side br br but then i remembered some of the disney sequel disasters i have previously watched im looking at you little mermaid 2 br br anyway i watched it and unfortunately i was very disappointed the best thing about it is the animation is superb it really has that special polish that the proper disney films have br br apart from that the rest is disappointing the storyline is seriously all over the place one moment its about something then completely changes to another storyline and then changes to another completely different storyline it reminded me of how the family guy movie was like 3 separate episodes turned into a film br br i laughed perhaps once at the most was very funny in the original film but in this he just isn't funny at all br br stay away from this film unless someone lends it to you for free br br 4 10
<START> i watched the this the other night on a local station because i didn't feel like watching tripe like 'american peter strauss gives a great performance as a convict named murphy who keeps to himself he admits to his crime and makes no bones that he feels no shame for it his cell is bare of any comforts that other inmates have like books and pictures the only time he feels in another zone is in running he does it often and can run a mile in under four minutes when a college coach hears about this he wants to prime him for a shot at the olympics at first wants no part of this but when his best friend is killed he shows interest br br this is a good movie period strauss is very good what did you expect anything less and michael mann shows hints of greatness that would come full bloom years later this movie had that bit of realism probably because it was filmed among convicts it almost feels like this was a true story the additional casting is good there is a lot of notable names like brian dennehy roger e mosley and richard moll as well br br my heart sank when some pompous board of directors wouldn't let him run because he didn't feel bad for his crime his final act made me stand up and cheer when they took his dreams away he took them back hard this was back when tv movies were actually good 'the jericho mile' is a gem of a film espn classic please show this film
<START> career criminal and crime boss abel lino ventura has been on the run for more than 10 years hiding out in milan italy in his absence he has been sentenced to death in his home country of france for his crimes disillusioned with his life in italy and with the police there closing in on him he decides to return to his old stomping ground in paris sending his wife therese and two young sons ahead to nice abel and his next in command raymond do one final heist to fund their new lives back in france the heist proffers a meagre half million francs way less than their sources had suggested despite this and with the police in chase they both make it to nice where they hideout briefly after stealing a pleasure boat from a local they aim to make it to san remo a tourist spot where they will blend in more readily but they are stopped by armed customs officers on a deserted beach a shoot out ensues and therese and are both killed a now wounded with two kids in tow is going to be easily spotted by police so he calls on his old friends in paris to send help but they have moved on since their old friend went into hiding and are not too inclined to take a risk themselves so they send small time thief eric stark jean paul belmondo to rescue him is disgusted that such a lowly thief is sent to his aid despite the fact he hits it off immediately with the charming stark he sets out to find out why he has been snubbed but their betrayal doesn't stop there br br tous aka the big risk was written for the screen by former death row inmate and crime writer jose giovanni le le clan des with ventura already on board for the project someone unique to direct the project ventura suggested an assistant director that had caught his attention on a previous project one claude sautet best known at the time for assisting georges on les yeux sans visage sautet immediately agreed and the rest as they say is history sautet crafted a fine gangster film that plays heavily on characters and relationships constantly in hiding has plenty of time to reflect on his life past present and future his friendships that no longer seem to be what he believed they were his now deceased wife and what will become of his two young sons ventura as a character actor has always amazed me being both comfortable and convincing in both the police and criminal fraternity here his world weary performance is sublime and powerful as his world crumbles all around him as the loneliness and solitude of a man on the run kicks in ventura's former profession as a pro wrestler gets plenty of use as he throws parisien hoodlums around with a consummate ease belmondo as stark enlivens the other storyline within the film that of his budding relationship with a girl he meets on the road trip with his forthright charm his coming clean to this woman in danger that he is but a and that the only good thing about me is my left as he knocks out her aggressor is also a joy to behold as she falls for him anyway belmondo's performance was overlooked at the time as godard's a bout de soufflÃ© was released only three weeks previous godard attaining the credit for discovering the new kid on the block his versatility within these two films being there for all to see and admire film is a classy affair using plenty of attractive locations the film also has very sparse dialogue sautet preferring to let the actors do the work with the merest of looks or glances to further the story needles to say this noir fan will be checking out more of work in the future
<START> when i saw the poster at the theater i thought that it is a new line of a horror story without a famous cast worth giving a try but after i went in i wanted to leave after 20 minutes there was a lot of non sense and logical flaws to me it is a movie that is not worth putting in theaters it is not even worth seeing
<START> i fail to understand why you would give this film anything over 4 fair enough it does take me back to the 80s and to the 'good old days of horror comedy' but that genre has not got any better since then it is still so low budget low tech bad acting bad story line not at all scary and not funny enough in fact there is not much good i could say about it the so called monsters are just hideously bad i mean we have gone back in time to when they used to make the monsters out of plasticine and shoot the scenes fame by frame i really fail to understand why someone would invest any money in order to make this script to a film but i guess it might have been almost ok if it had been a bigger budget film br br recommendation would be please do not make the mistake of wasting your time on this unless if you wish to get tips for a bad halloween make up personally i enjoy independent films and anything outside the box but this just did not do it for me in the least
<START> house calls was an amusing 1978 comedy about a widowed doctor walter matthau who now wants to play the field but can't help but be drawn to a patient of his glenda jackson who refuses to be just another notch on his bedpost matthau likes the woman but does not really want to make the commitment that she insists upon so he agrees to date her exclusively for two weeks and then make a decision as to whether or not he wants to commit however other complications make it difficult for matthau to make a decision when the two weeks are up even though he is clearly in love with the woman matthau and jackson have surprisingly effective chemistry as a screen couple and are given strong support from richard benjamin candice dick o'neill and especially art carney as the inept and senile chief of staff at the hospital where matthau is employed matthau even has a brief scene with his real life son charlie who appears as jackson's son this engaging comedy still holds up pretty well after all these years if you've never seen it it's worth the rental
<START> had i known to what i was submitting myself i would have fled from the theater the film is dreadful in the literal sense of the word despite striking images intriguing locales and a subject matter that might have been fascinating the film is dead br br i was unfamiliar with this period of greek history and prepared to experience a great film the hand is heavy it is not enough to see a train going by we must watch it from afar we must watch it car by car we must see the smoke we must see it slow down and we must see it stop the director's approach is didactic likewise the characters that he creates never develop they never change they are so stereotypic that we wonder are they meant to be everyman is there some point to this allegory it is the most pretentious film that i have seen in a long while
