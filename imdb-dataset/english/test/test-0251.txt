<START> dylan and bobby are boyhood friends and they are in love the way that young boys sometimes are but dylan has met a girl and is starting to put those boyhood things aside bobby knows that he's not interested in girls and misses what he had with dylan br br told as part cheesy 80's pop video part home movie part video recollection this film tells a confusing and sad but all too often true story that will hit home with many that see it br br this film brings back a lot of memories and struck a very true chord with me but i wish the film maker had gone a bit further and left it on a happier note yes we all love and lose even when we are young but there's always tomorrow especially when we are young
<START> three kids are born during a solar eclipse and turn into vile murderous little tykes who're above suspicion by everyone save for joyce lori and her younger brother timmy that's the story in a nutshell the acting in this one is tolerable for the most part notable for mtv j julie brown not the one showing some skin and a very early part albiet small for michael dudikoff not a great film by any stretch of the imagination but in the 'killer kids' sub genre it's a bit of a guilty pleasure br br eye candy julie brown shows t a the only film thus far to claim that honor sylvia wright gets topless br br dvd extras r1 16 minute interview with producer max rosenberg wherein he insults the director and canada great stuff biography of ed hunt and trailers for kiss of the don't open the door a red band one for homework which features nudity br br my grade b
<START> as a french i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of french like that at some defaults of westerners at spy movies etc and at a lot of other things too en route i already saw it 3 times and each time i discovered new things and laughed to tears jean the director and all the cast all the crew did a fantastic job this movie is funny but is although much more than that it's got plenty of levels to it you laugh because of simple gags because of some critics made with wit the movie's courageous enough to be critical because of physical comedy because you believe in the characters etc esthetically and musically it's a success too go see it if you can
<START> john cassavetes is on the run from the law he is at the bottom of the heap he sees negro sidney poitier as his equal and they quickly become friends forming a sort of alliance against a bully of a foreman played by jack warden br br as someone who has worked in a warehouse myself when i was younger i can tell you that the warehouse fights complete with tumbling packing cases and flailing grappling hooks are as realistic as it gets i've been in fights like these myself although no one got killed br br the introduction of sidney poitier's widow is a variation on shakespeare's shylock do i not bleed this is an anti racist film which at the time was much needed br br all the three principle characters warden cassavetes and poitier are superb with warden the most outstanding of the three
<START> ronald coleman had been a star of the screen for several years when talkies came in and what a boost it was to his career his oxford english accent is so enthralling i could listen to him recite the farmer's and not be bored br br coleman plays willie hale a 30ish playboy from a wealthy family who spends his time womanizing and gambling yet he's a likable rogue not only likable from the standpoint of the audience but by family and friends too he has yet again gone broke due to his constant gambling and sells off his possessions in a foreign location to settle his debts and provide passage back home to england when he gets there he at first is met by a father who insists he'll kick him out he's had it with willie and his layabout ways however five minutes alone in a room with willie and his charm and willie is not only forgiven by dad dad has given him one hundred pounds to boot br br willie then goes for a day's recreation with his sister and her friend dorothy hope loretta young dorothy is set to be engaged to the grand duke paul that very night mainly just because her dad wants royalty in the family and there is nobody else special in her life that changes after her day with willie and soon there is a scandal brewing as dorothy refuses to go through with the marriage as planned br br ronald coleman is always a delight to watch in these early talking films he did for sam goldwyn where he is playing the confident adventurer or cad or both he has a demeanor akin to errol flynn but he is unable to display flynn's physical agility due to a disabling wound he received during world war i however what he lacks in physical agility coleman always made up in agility of soul loretta young only 17 when this picture was made shows the beginning of her trademark sweet girl that can erupt into a ball of fire when the occasion calls for it myrna loy plays willie's girl from the past mary a showgirl here myrna is still playing a part similar to the exotic vamp parts she got stuck with so often over at warner brothers when she was a contract player from 1926 until shortly before this movie was made in 1930 br br this is pretty much a light and breezy romantic comedy from start to finish if you're in a mood for the kind of escapist entertainment that lightened the hearts of audiences during the great depression this little film fits the bill
<START> i have seen this movie only once several years ago but i remember liking it a lot br br spoilers ahead an old famous opera singer is retired and she decides to give all the money she has to her cats her butler hears this and plots to get rid of the cats so he can have the fortune he puts knockout drops in their milk when they wake up they find themselves miles away they must journey back to their house before it is too late with the help of an independent minded tomcat and other animal accomplices while evading the butler and foiling his plan br br could have been better but it also could have been a lot worse br br my score 7 10
<START> the only good thing about this movie is that i now have a movie on the worst ever list rest stop being on the end of the spectrum where i can compare all terrible movies to really this movie is the worst plot worst directed throughout the whole movie all i wanted to do is pull out my hair and kick the writer's and anybody who made this movie ass i am a deployed soldier and when i spend my precious downtime watching movies like this these people should feel terrible they had to of watch this before it came out and must have been to freaking lazy to redo after they noticed it freaking sucked i am so amazed that this great country of ours is letting them make another honestly this is the first time i have ever commented on a movie i had to let the world know not to waste their time delete this movie from the face of this planet it makes us humans look retarded
<START> it's showtime showtime is simply a bump in eddie murphy and robert deniro's careers it's an entertaining movie and a guilty pleasure but not quite up to the actors' standards especially not robert's showtime is directed by tom dey and features some small roles from guys like william shatner and mos def br br showtime is about two very different cops mitch preston deniro and trey sellars murphy one takes work seriously in a low profile quiet manner while the other is more easy going and wants to have more fun than felons in his back seat they are both after the same felons behind a huge caper of televisions vcrs etc they then cross paths and a tv station wants a new reality tv show so they fight crime while they are on tv mitch hates the publicity while trey loves it with his line it's showtime their tv antics and methods are shown on tv and they are the new cops show the fun begins br br overall showtime is a fun action comedy a good film but not quite up to the actors' expectations and standards however it's rolls along as it treads and parodies reality tv shows a good break from shows like cops truly at the end just a guilty pleasure br br my rating 7 10 br br eliason a
<START> i saw unfortunately the dubbed version on encore br br student paula franka potente who was also in the cult favorite run lola run stars as a serious medical student who gets into a prestigious school in germany but she soon discovers that some students go missing and the bodies they work on in the anatomy lab are incredibly fresh br br i was stuck seeing the dubbed version on encore it hurt a lot the words not matching the lips got annoying real quick but i still liked what i saw the acting was good it was beautifully photographed it wasn't too gruesome and i was never bored even more refreshing was a likable heroine who fights back when the bad guys go after her the mild nudity was in a refreshing twist male a previous poster mentions benno furmann who is excellent showed his butt but i don't remember seeing it regardless this is a well done scary and excellent thriller from all i've read the original german language version is the best i don't doubt that for one second but the dubbed version is watchable i give this a 7
<START> this film is really really bad it is not very well done and is a lack lustre attempt at something but i am not sure what i watched it and was very disappointed it promised a lot but delivered nothing at all the characters are shallow and wooden and the music if you can call it that is dreadful there are of course all the creatures and animated beings but they are so poorly done that it does not come across as anything other than a third rate movie it is a real shame that more attention could not have been spent to the special effects not the be all and end all of a movie i agree but in a movie that is based around them it's a very important factor for me a very sad attempt and should be avoided
<START> i've got to say it gary busey saved this film if it were not for his fine acting talents this film would have been sub par i recommend the film but just barely br br the biggest difficulty with the film is its broad disregard for historical geographical and physical accuracy for example why is green and hilly how come buddy's producer petty ignored where are the daily trips to the clovis new mexico studio why is nashville treated as a racist hate camp out to destroy the holly sound why was buddy's two week courtship to maria treated as a complex taboo race mixing stereotype why are buddy's tile boxes as light as feathers finally why are the crickets portrayed as trouble making to holly's talent br br taken on their face these inaccuracies should spell doom for any film proclaiming itself the buddy holly story however busey does deliver a stirring portrayal as the man whose death eventually led to the day the music died
<START> agreeable boy's own paper nonsense with a sprightly performance from cushing some amusing rubber monsters colourful jungle sets the ever welcome appearance of caroline munro in animal skins
<START> alexander nevsky is nothing short of a grand film on a grand scale the film opens a window to a world and culture most americans will never become acquainted with and much has been said and written regarding the film's thinly veiled patriotism in the face of imminent war with the german nazis br br by us standards the acting is a bit stilted the screenplay is short on words and big on visuals and action and while the action can become tiresome the visuals are often stunning direction is incredible br br on another note fans of ralph bakshi animation might notice that he stole a lot of his visuals for wizards directly from a copy of alexander nevsky
<START> this is an exceptional picture with so much to recommend it the acting and writing are terrific and there are lots of great twists and turns in the plot as a french noir film its language is certainly a lot earthier than its american counterparts but to me this just added to the realism additionally i liked how non glamorous everyone was particularly the husband and the lieutenant about the only negative and the reason the film gets a 9 and not a 10 is because there was a glaring plot hole like another famous french film drÃ´le de the confusion between the cops and the accused could easily have been settled in the beginning but the characters made rather stupid decisions for this you just need to suspend disbelief and keep watching the payoff is well worth the wait br br this is simply one of the finest french films i have seen period
<START> i'm not sure what version of the film i saw but it was very entertaining br br i did not know who the twins were gillian chung and charlene choi before seeing this movie and i think the english translation of the title is somewhat misleading br br the martial arts are very nicely done i especially liked them because there was a lot of judo grappling that was filmed very nicely donnie yen see him in hero great performance as a director is great as he knows how to shoot these scenes br br everything seemed to flow for me except there is one scene where the girls are on the rooftop fighting with bamboo poles it has really nothing to do with the plot but it's still entertaining br br overall this is one of the better modern hk action flicks i've seen in a while although cheesy in some respects it still pulls it off br br definitely a 9 10
