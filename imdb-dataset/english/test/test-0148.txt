<START> luchino visconti the artist with the sword courage should be the first word associated with his entire opus film theater music revolutions artistic cultural personal a legacy with powerful consequences and endless ramifications he introduced the neorealism through the work of an american novelist james cain in he gave anna magnani the most extraordinarily beautiful close ups of her career he gave us alain delon and maria but the last word about his life and work rests on the talents of a certain adam low and the voice of helmut berger what a terrible fate br br for those interested there is a 61 minute documentary by director carlo a man who really knew visconti titled luchino visconti a portrait it is out on dvd distributed by image entertainment
<START> as long as you keep in mind that the production of this movie was a copyright ploy and not intended as a serious release it is actually surprising how not absolutely horrible it is i even liked the theme music br br and if ever a flick cried out for a treatment by joel or mike and the mst3k bots this is it watch this with a bunch of smart ass wise crackers and you're in for a good time have a brew butter up some large pretzels and enjoy br br of course obtaining a copy requires buying a bootleg or downloading it as but if you're here on the imdb then you're most likely savvy enough to do so good luck br br and look for my favorite part where dr doom informs the ff that they have 12 hours to comply with his wishes and he actually gestures the number 12 with his finger while doing so it's like evil sesame street hoo boy br br and of course mrs storm declaring just look at you the four is just so heartwarming you'll laugh you'll cry br br so if you love schlocky sci fi this one's fantastic for you
<START> the critics were like a movie that will break your heart etc so a friend of mine and i had great expectations when we decided to watch this movie br br i'll make it short and leave it up to others to write about its content this movie tries to touch you to reach your heart but it fails at least for me and for my friend too br br everything that happened happened only on the screen it was always there not here where i am i thought most of the time hmm something's happening on the screen but it's only on the screen it's not real br br movies which succeeded much better in touching me east of eden 1955 terms of endearment 1983 jerry maguire 1996 babe 1995 mies 2002
<START> i rarely shut a movie off after the first 10 minutes but that is what i did with this one what turned me off was it was so obvious that the only purpose of this movie was to expose as much skin of as many b actresses as possible and nothing else really matters br br don't get me wrong i like pretty actresses and sex scenes and sexploitation movies have their own scale of merits but this director does nothing else right br br for example take the scene where the two cops of course one guy one gal and of course there is all this supposedly witty banter between them are talking over while standing over the first dead body the camera pans between them for each line there's more than one screen width between them and you end up wondering whether you're seasick from that or the clueless dialog br br well it might have gotten better after the first 10 minutes but i wouldn't know i declined the sucker bet and found something better to do
<START> imagine 24 completely uncensored given free license to explain the situation in any detail needed and showing how and why both protagonists do what they do to kill prevent and you have an idea of how good this tv series is people in the us have known for a long time that showtime is the new hbo they are making far better cutting edge powerful shows and this is no exception the show takes the viewer all the way through the creation of a sleeper cell to when an attack is attempted taking in important facets such as faith religion funding means and needs to the uninitiated there is much to be learnt about the muslim faith here unlike on mainstream shows like 24 where the terrorists are merely nutcases who the good guys shoot their purpose and reasonings here are fully examined what gives the show more credence is the latest technology the cell fbi uses and the authentic shots in europe the us and the middle east no expense is spared to tell the story accurately the cast are relatively unknowns but the acting is superb with the aid of a tautly written script that constantly keeps the viewer on edge with many unexpected twists and turns this show has not got the credit it deserves and ironically is a bit of a sleeper hit itself must see for anyone at all interested in this genre
<START> the fact that this cruddy series could elicit dozens of comments much less hundreds of speaks volumes as to the decline of western or at least american civilization br br read proust you morons or at least dave barry or calvin and anthologies br br chuck norris wrap your brains around the fact that in order to rate or write about this series you'd have to have spent minutes nay hours viewing this poor sod treading the boards and spewing lines with less emotional impact than the gal who used to call off the correct time on your local service br br please don't watch this show spare your few remaining brain cells
<START> a good idea let down by heavy handed production br br quite a bit of the dialogue was unintelligible because of the level of music background sound and this didn't help this reviewer nor did the welsh accents pretty impenetrable at times towards the end i lost the will to live trying to follow the dialogue br br this movie didn't know whether to be a farce or a black comedy and they require different approaches some of the incidents were laid on so thick that they only merited a groan some were so unbelievable even for this sort of plot that they made the story just not worth following br br the acting was in the main good although the american just came over as a clone of the back to the future mad scientist the little boy was very good br br i did watch it all the way through but god knows why i can't remember laughing once
<START> the things that i find irritating on screen the things i nitpick about and annoy the people who try to watch movies with me are those moment where the writer director set designer on screen caterer or whoever doesn't think it through to the end and by a single act of omission or commission undoes all the other work done by everyone else who has worked on the movie that moment of wait a bloody minute what just happened that stops the narrative dead in its tracks not that this film's narrative needed a lot of stopping because anyone who has ever seen it will know that narrative drive has pretty well frozen solid before the end of the opening shot there are several of those moments in this movie and you get so long to think about them too the film is two hours long and the scripted dialogue probably ran to five pages there's a lot of time to ponder its deficiencies br br the movie is set in a frozen earth another ice age has set in and the whole world is dying it's cold very cold it's actually very cold on the screen the movie was shot in canada in winter and there are icicles and real snow and people's breath misting from their mouths in every scene time and again we are reminded how cold it is people wear big hats and layers and layers of clothes and waddle around like over dressed people must have been a horrible shoot my nitpick comes in a sequence when our hero checks into a room of a hotel woken up in the middle of the night by voices coming from the room next door he overhears a conversation of vital importance to the meagre plot through an large grill in the wall dividing the two rooms i'm not questioning why there is a convenient grill in the wall between the two rooms what got me annoyed was the fact that the grill had not been blocked up by the long term tenant with the noisy visitor if you are trying to keep warm the last thing you need is a huge gaping hole in your wall that leads into an unoccupied unheated room trust me i live like this i watched this film sat on my living room sofa under a duvet with a hot water bottle my breath was misting as much as the actors' if that whacking great hole was in my wall i'd block it up with something maybe not the best choice of movie to watch in an unheated room in midwinter but boy did it make me notice the lousy insulation in the film
<START> j s cardone directed a little known 'video nasty' in 1982 called the slayer and since then has gone on to have a hand in a handful of feature films including the rubbish 2001 vampire movie the forsaken his latest feature film wicked little things boasts a plot that sounds decent as well as a creepy looking poster that i seem to remember surfacing a couple of years ago in relation to a film that tobe hooper was meant to direct well i guess he felt that this one was too similar to his silly zombie fungus movie and so turned this one down i don't blame him for it either the plot focuses on a mother and her two daughters that move to an old house in the mountains that once belonged to her late husband however what they don't realise is that around a hundred years earlier a group of children that were being used as miners were trapped down a mineshaft naturally that's not the end of them and they managed to survive their ordeal and now prowl the area in search of br br the film is essentially a collection of clichÃ©s from the youngest kid with an imaginary friend the mother who dismisses it and all the usual zombie rubbish j s cardone attempts to get the horror fans back on side with shocks and gory scenes mostly involving kids but its not enough the story doesn't play out very well at all either and really did remind me too much of the earlier mortuary and that's not a good thing although mortuary is actually a better film than this one the acting is nothing to write home about either lori is decent looking as is eldest daughter scout taylor compton but neither manages to provide an interesting performance chloe is slightly better than the usual child actor the plot is given hardly any credibility and indeed the screenplay can't even be bothered to explain the reasons why the kids attack the locals it all boils down to a typical and rather dull ending and overall i have to say that if you know your horror movies then you can feel free to skip this one
<START> catherine is a french director who loves to provoke her audience she takes us along to witness how a film is done on location the movie in production seems to be based on herself since the person at the center of the story is jeanne a woman director much like ms jeanne acts as the alter ego of the real director br br jeanne reaches an impasse at the start of filming not only has she picked the wrong time to photograph this movie during a cold spell as it involves beach locations that are obviously too cold for the actors and extras jeanne has problems with the two principal actors especially the male lead who has problems accepting the way the director has decided to show him in the movie the lead actress is no angel either br br movie making ms tells us is a process like no other in a creative work of art first there is the writing period in which in this case jeanne has written a screen play that when it goes into production reveals problems the writer director didn't think about there is the problem of how she wants to photograph a love scene in which the young woman of the story has her first sex contact what appeared clever in the written page doesn't necessarily translate into an easy time in front of the camera the actor is made to wear a false penis and has a lot of problems accepting the fact that a make up has to touch him in ways he never thought he would ever be touched by another man br br the luminous anne is marvelous as jeanne the director she makes observations about the production the actors and the crew that fit well into the story being told gregoire colin and play the lead actors with all the insecurity that some actors bring to a movie set jeanne has to massage their egos in order to get what she wants in the end ashley plays leo assistant br br sex is comedy allows ms to give us her own take on films in general this is a great look at the way movies are done in a typical style
<START> i recently purchased this on dvd as i hadn't heard of it and like robert carlyle br br obviously this movie is not going to have hollywood blockbuster special effects in saying that though the special effects were decent enough and the acting was fine also br br i found the movie to be enjoyable and do not regret buying it at all at almost 2 hours long it is just the right length for this type of movie br br do not expect thrilling explosive action from beginning to end though it is a fairly well balanced movie with a decent enough storyline
<START> this movie was one of the worst i have ever seen not including anything by or with pauly shore i couldn't believe that a film could actually be this bad br br coolio has to be the single worst actor again not including pauly shore to ever star in a movie the temptation to hit the stop button during this movie was huge in fact if there was a throw in the trash button on my vcr i would have been inclined to press that br br do yourself a favor and do something more interesting than watch this movie like watching the grass grow or watching golf on tv
<START> this is the fourth full length feature film by marc by the third 'les mans empty hands i promised myself not to cut my veins anymore but this time round the plot is completely different a kind of homage to ramon 1940 2001 a catalan journalist the visuals in the trailer are stunning a gleaming river bathed in sunlight and the promise that marc himself would be in front of the camera with his twin brother none of both professional actors convinced me at last six weeks after its release abandon yourself in this very unusual road river film learn almost nothing about ramon but his most poignant legacy his constant fight against amnesia of what we chose to forget 'la de look for battle of the at the wikipedia was lost not once but twice because after 40 years of silence and 25 years of half hearted democracy nobody has done much to remember the legitimate side of the spanish civil war and those who fought it this film is about the lonely people roaming the same places with very little conscience of what took place there 70 years ago this film is about the landscape
<START> i suggest that in the future any movie made by the sci fi channel and subsequently released on dvd must say that it was indeed made by such channel as i would not buy this stuff if i had known this fact not that this was all bad but when you have fade out for commercials in the middle of your movie it just ruins the flow of said film this in turn makes the movie rather more boring this one had an interesting story however the light hearted and extremely generic soundtrack distracted one from the film as did most of the bad actors with the exception of dien and linda carter the story vampires are on the attack in south america of course the rules of vampire movies are not in effect which the usually aren't in any of the movies about vampires i have seen lately with the exception of the blade trilogy group of soldiers are sent down to battle said squad another team is sent to meet up with the team and to track down the ex wife of one of the soldiers why she is not just his wife who knows as this part of the plot really goes no where still we get an interesting boat ride some nice jungle scenery and a lot of blood this fact however does not save the film from being way to jerky in its presentation and really dull seeming at times i don't know maybe it was the cgi blood and smoke and whatever they have to make cgi now even though old effects look better and don't cost that much more i mean cheap italian zombie movies could do a bullet hole without cgi why can't we now
<START> the story has little to do with jack london's original novel i thought the acting was very unnatural the dubbing was done very sloppily and the story itself contains a fairly large number of inconsistencies and loose ends apart from that the pace of the movie was horrendously slow at some parts
