<START> just got out of an advance screening and wow was this movie hilarious possibly better than the first one but at least its equal if you don't like jackass or really unnecessary amounts of male nudity way more than in the first then stay far far away but if you dig the whole jackass thing then this movie will not disappoint toro totter is the greatest invention ever ok so my review wasn't long enough all else i have to say is poor poor dunn they really kick the crap out of him in this so if you enjoy masochistic humor and prolific male nudity and by far the most disgusting female nudity ever john waters is involved need i say more then this movie will keep you in stitches for it entirety i never stopped laughing and actually came out drenched in sweat
<START> yes the video cover of this movie made me want to watch this film as a child it was called on this particular cover with the tagline men turned inside out it even featured this warped looking skeleton on the cover as well that made all sorts of cool gory images run through my mind perhaps some sort of movie about some strange virus that caused a person's flesh to burn off maybe a movie about undead zombies that are more bloody looking than what you usually get a science experiment gone incredibly wrong and now strange men with the flesh dripping off their bones go on the rampage yes all these thoughts ran through my mind one that did not was fish guys on some island with virtually no gore and all bore this movie is really more like the island of dr moreau than anything else and quite frankly that movie bored me too it is way to much scientist and not enough killing for my tastes these films are to much figure stuff out and not enough blood for my tastes yes i know i have strange tastes but i can not help it i like my horror movies either really bloody or fast moving and exciting this movie is really neither
<START> its difficult to be too tough on brad sykes a hard working guy doing what he loves there is an honesty about him that seems often lacking with other microbudget directors check out the minuscule crew credits on camp blood there is none of the usual thanking everyone down to the pizza joint they ate in its brad and his buddies and thats it no pretentious rubbish jennifer isn't your average horror flick heroine but does well enough for you to hardly notice bethany looks like a star and joseph haggerty is so funny it hurts the clown is hardly an original horror film bad guy but the design is good shemp moseley does a decent job of bringing him to life and the image clashes nicely with the rural backdrop camp blood is horror as blue collar and basic as it gets not a good thing not a bad thing just a thing
<START> and never ever see it now i've been watching bad scifi movies for years i love watching bad scifi movies i think that was the only reason i could watch this movie the whole way through i was toughened up by indian superman and that awful fantastic four movie just to name some examples usually i have to beat my head against the wall after i've seen a bad movie to make some of the pain go away no not with this one with i had to hit myself in the head with a shoe in the middle of the movie temporary fix i can't believe i wanted to see that i cried when it finished i cried it was horrible it was worse than when i saw shudders wil wheaton in his underwear in the curse which by the way never watch either aside from the fact that wesley in his tighty whiteys it's just sooo bad but this review is about the worst part about it is that someone wrote this movie and said this deserves to go on film it's great and wayne newton rob lowe and everyone else in the cast said oh this is what i want on my film history i'll watch indian superman until the cows come home but i am never going to see this steaming pile of dren again
<START> excellent and moving story of the end of a uniquely intimate affair then again the point of the film to paraphrase another comment is that every relationship can be unique and intimate a truly quality short film which caught me at my busiest yet had the power to pull me down onto the sofa and watch fixed and quiet for the duration bobby and tessa are powerfully moving characters and anyone who has suffered the end of a love affair will find this film to be a cathartic exercise beyond that the 'film within a film' idea plays out very well with this cast and is quite riveting though in a somewhat melancholic way
<START> after a meteorite lands in boston really somewhere in the isle of man a hideous fanged alien monster is released and is on the loose in a local girl's school causing mayhem and turning the students into zombie like creatures this film is apparently a loose and i stress loose remake of the 1986 film with the same name as it features the same monster but a different plot both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable this isn't let's start with all the acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad this film is supposed to take place in boston we know this because the film makers had the ingenious idea of putting boston police or boston gas company on everything yet everyone seems to have rather muddled british accents at least they didn't try using boston accents thank god the script is a big flawed mess the best example of how dumb the writing is when it's established that you can turn the zombie students back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite is that what our brave heroes do no they run around shooting the zombie students instead nice director paul matthews who also wrote directed the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesn't know how to pace his films the movie is terribly boring in places the lighting is awful the film looks cheap and bland one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 99 of the death scenes involve the creature popping out of a dark corner and dragging someone away while we hear they're horrified screams off in the distance this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesn't work here the visual effects were awful the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for god's sake the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so i'll give credit where credit's due the creature effects were actually pretty cool gotta love those close ups of slimy drooling teeth br br to sum the film up is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus not recommended br br 1 5 10
<START> 1st watched 7 19 2003 1 out of 10 dir brad sykes ridiculously lame 3d movie which pretty much follows the plots of many 80's teen slasher flicks stupid kids go to a known murderous camp site become hunted by an unknown masked man and then we try to figure out who if anyone is going to live we really don't care who's behind the mask but even that's not hard to figure out if you've seen any of these kinds of movies what a waste of a 3d viewer despite somewhat decent 3d effects
<START> to me anatomie is certainly one of the better movies i have seen i don't think anatomie was primarily intended to be a horror movie but a movie questioning the ethics of science if you watch it with that in mind it turns into a really good film the only annoying bit was the awful voice dubbing for the english version how can you expect any non german person to listen to these unbearable german accents for two hours let native english speakers do the talking or use subtitles instead
<START> well you know rutger hauer and robert patrick both are really good actors but wtf with this movie the story was lame and the script was just terrible the poor actors didn't have material to work with br br the dvd cover invited you to a flight action flick you would expect something like top gun huge disappointment the flight action in this movie is so cheap that makes you puke the aerial scenes are clearly taken from documentaries and some other footage sources not made for this movie and they didn't even care about the marks or the fighters models taking for granted the audience will not notice it br br as i said the story was lame with a little effort from the writer and director it could have been very interesting in short it seems a b movie made in the 70's br br i feel very sorry for these actors who put their names here they sure must be ashamed
<START> this is one of my favorite films ever the story is just so fantastic and the characters are so good unlike the other disney films of the age this film never bores the audience 101 dalmations peter pan robin hood they were all good but lack what we have here this is funny creative and always on target this movie just has an extra something that you can't learn in books however this is not the best animated film ever made that title belongs to the brilliant toy story but this is a respectable second immediately followed by the lady and the tramp just see it and enjoy what one of the cinema's greatest achievements and by the by i'm not a little kid this is for the older audiences wanting to recapture their childhood an absolute must
<START> while not as bad as some movies like the horrible atomic twister meltdown still relies upon common misconceptions and inaccuracies about the nuclear power industry to advance its plot i am currently studying nuclear engineering in the pursuit of a masters degree and it was easy to point out flaws that would be obvious to anyone involved with the industry br br riding the false fear that a style meltdown could happen in an american plant the movie states that any meltdown even partial according to one of the guest commentators in the movie would mean disaster for the area in fact a partial meltdown in an american plant while destroying the core would not pose any risk to the surrounding area three mile island experienced a partial meltdown and no radioactive material was released into the environment at all thanks to the natural stability of the fuel and core design used in this country paired with substantial containment br br the security steps shown in the movie were perhaps the part of the movie furthest from the truth at any important strategic location be it power plant chemical plant military base anything you will never see personnel responding to an alarm by milling around talking as if it were an unannounced drill this is especially true at a nuclear plant where upon the sounding of the alarm the reactors would be immediately shutting them off can be done with the push of a button in the control room you do not need to put the core in shutdown mode like depicted in the movie and the chemistry of nuclear fission prevents a core from being brought back up to power within about 9 hours of a so if this scenario played out in real life the assailants would not be able to cause a significant meltdown in theory they could still cause a partial one due to residual heat if they exposed the core immediately but that would be almost impossible given the numerous backup systems present in a plant there are many more than the single backup pumps they speak of in the movie br br as for the spent fuel pools it may be possible to turn the pools into a dirty bomb by blowing them up but this is far more difficult than simply parking a truck full of explosives near the pools the fuel is under approximately 18 feet of highly water the water cannot become radioactive no radioactive steam like they speak of in the movie particles dissolved in water can but the water itself cannot thus the reason for very thorough purification so the only way to turn a fuel pool into a dirty bomb is to get the fuel out of the water this is no easy task as water is very heavy and the pools are below ground with very thick concrete walls the explosives would have to be in the pool below the fuel which is securely fastened and there would have to be a heck of a lot of explosives as water is very hard to move through an explosion even if this were to occur spent fuel is not extremely radioactive and the explosion would not cause nearly as high a death toll as mentioned in the movie especially given the small amount of radioactive material that would be spread br br from a basic movie standpoint i grew somewhat tired of the style used the constant fading in and out use of gritty black and white and fast tracking and panning looked amateurish the characters were one dimensional especially those in the us government i have some problems with the twist thrown in the movie but will not discuss it as it would be a major spoiler br br overall 3 10
<START> fabulous cinematography from sergei help to make this a stunning piece of work the opening scenes are as if one is through some master photographer's album and as the story begins to unfold we are swept away with both the events depicted and the beautiful look all is well shot but there are several whole sequences that are simply breathtaking difficult to describe without 'spoiling' but suffice to say one is a very intense scene during an air raid and the lady left behind and her lover's brother are at odds as the sirens whine and the windows shatter another superimposes a swirling staircase and a spinning shot of tree tops and even develops into a fantasy sequence soviet film making of the highest order
<START> this movie should go down as one of the funniest movies in history its cousins a mighty wind spinal tap and waiting for guffman are terrific in their own right but best in show takes the cake br br a movie about the idiosyncrasies of dog owners that show their dogs it's the intricacies of the characters that make it so good after watching the movie about 75 times i have come to the conclusion that there is no weak character or actor in this film there is very little interaction between any of the groups of characters but that only seems to add to the beauty of the film br br if you watch this movie and don't find it as funny as i am billing it as watch it again the first time i saw it i thought it was serviceable but not overly hilarious it is a film that grows on you a movie that you will find yourself quoting frequently br br characters hamilton and meg swan a if you get the dvd check out how these characters were born amazing that these two could hit it so on the head and to find out that they really didn't go by a script and sort of made it up as they went br br gerry and cookie a cookie is especially funny and she does a fantastic job of selling the cookie character gerry eugene levy delivers his standard stellar performance of the hilarious discombobulated type weaker half br br stefan and scott a find me a funnier character than scott i dare you he will forever be typecast as this character to me as he was so natural and didn't seem forced at any point stefan micheal was very good as well and they interplay here and a brief appearance with the goes to show why he is always in these films a great actor with razor like wit br br harlan pepper b i don't want it to seem like he isn't funny he sure is but being the only solo act he can't be quite as funny as the others above he does use the dog more than others and has some other idiosyncrasies going for him br br the rest are all great as well there is no weak character see this film at least twice buy it you will not regret it
<START> i went to the movies to see claudine and loved every minute of it the cast and the soundtrack as well diahann carroll was never better than in this role we saw ms carroll downplayed her looks barely saw her naked smoked a cigarette drank beer and oh she cursed whenever this movie was shown on tv and finally cable i would call my friends to watch it just the soundtrack from the very beginning of the movie is awesome all thanks to gladys knight and the we saw a black woman struggling to raise her children dealing with teen pregnancy and everyday life meets a man whom she learns later on has issues himself finally this movie made it to dvd and well deserving
<START> there's something rotten about this film and basically the way it turns a sinister and twisted character into a hero by exploiting our sympathy with his admittedly horrible situation like many who have lost hope chooses suicide the fact that he has been contemplating it for more than 26 years probably makes his condition worse but the belief that we should do whatever anyone asks even if it means ending a life is in my opinion profoundly wrong what a contrast to the uplifting example of the scientist stephen who suffered a far worse condition for far longer yet with the morals upside down the film revels in hero worship and the people who disagree with are painted in simplistic idiotic terms there's little room for subtly especially in the encounter with the priest deliberately manipulating the real life encounter which was with a much younger priest in that way i suppose the film is on a par with triumph of the will the insidious idea is that everyone should have to right to take their life when they feel they cannot live it anymore it makes no difference whether you are physically or psychologically damaged there are people evidently who believe you have the right to choose the same people are likely to make a case for abortion its all part of the current trend to get the suffering or sufferers out of sight brush it under the carpet mammy will say its ok and we all feel very happy with ourselves so we go down the slippery path of believing that some lives just ain't worth living and then we'll decide that as some people can't really decide for themselves then we'll bring in the state to decide for them enter adolf hitler straight from that other oscar contender der untergang hitler of course believes that he carrying out exactly what nature does in disposing of the weak under his regime there were forced abortions among the weaker strains the mentally handicapped were quietly put away and the jews were humanely liquidated by using gas he would have applauded this film and why not for it is in line with his philosophy some lives are just not worth living i differ from ramon hitler and all the people involved with making this film human life is sacred it is not a right it is a gift and an obligation nobody chooses to be born then who can choose death its not about religion its about protecting the weak and helpless something this film does a lot to undermine
