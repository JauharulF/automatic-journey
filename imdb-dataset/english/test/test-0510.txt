<START> acolytes presents an interesting mix of original concepts in screaming teen clichÃ© horror with a more thriller like pacing in some ways acolytes is very successful but in many other ways the film fails miserably br br overall acolytes avoided the typical archetypes of the naivety and innocence of youth of endless horror films in the like of cabin fever texas chainsaw massacre and countless other films where unsuspecting and relatively naive and innocent teenagers have sex run around screaming and one by one are plucked off by some sort of monster instead this innocence is replaced with pride retaliation and arrogance the characters had several opportunities to save themselves from immanent death and despair but failed to do so due to their own personal demons in the end you were left with the feeling that there were no and perhaps are no innocent victims br br as the name implies the film also touches greatly on following a leader or authority this was used in a direct sense of if the main character would become like the serial killer and was also used less directly throughout the film following a central figure is a reoccurring theme throughout the film br br through all this the film makers also incorporated a lot of clichÃ© which i suspect was intentional and gave the film a unique mixture of depth as well as shallowness which i found intriguing this perhaps inadvertently plays well with the characters who are at first appearance very shallow but as the story unfolds it becomes obvious that they are at least the two main male characters quite complex br br technically the film has a lot of problems however the cinematography which is typically regarded highly i find rather sophomoric and over stylized utilizing formulaic 2 3 approaches far too many transitions i felt were also over stylized the use of symbolism was not only vague but also greatly over used br br the plot was poorly planned and relied exclusively on misinformation in order to achieve a rather hokey twist ending which was poorly resolved and leaves viewers confused methods used to resolve the climax are cheap and ill prepared motivations are routinely unclear and major plot points remain untied in the end br br overall the film's relative originality themes and thesis are lost in a maze of poor technical execution over stylized imagery unclear motives obtuse and unnecessary symbolism and cheap twists maintained only by a lack of or entirely incorrect information br br if the film were better executed it would have been excellent however acolytes receives only two stars in my opinion
<START> even sophie presence and the few very few good french gags are unable to save this otherwise slow and boring movie a disappointment the story is weak and so is acting this movie was advertised as the french version of the mummy but the mummy has at least spectacular and enjoyable effects
<START> i was a fan of the american werewolf in london movie and so was curious whether a 16 year later sequel could be done with french language and local re cast major supporting and minor characters tonight i watched the edited for fox network version that was some sort of curious hybrid of several hyperactive sequels the screenwriters and directors pay homage to certain of the key plot concepts tourist gets wolf bite full moon comes out boy meets girl boy becomes beast boy dies heroic death after help from ghost victim for me the oddest aspect of this formula teen horror special effect ride was the casting of the school teacher love interest of the tv comedy ed as one of the werewolf's clueless victims who is more or less totally unsympathetic in the scripted lines they handed her i haven't seen another horror flick that this movie is a vampire fighting flick titled blade but i guess that parts of its plotline must explain how villain werewolves they're are threatening the good werewolf pair during a long part of the movie there is also a final conflict in a paris subway train a la speed this 1997 studio product is an odd hybrid of a film since considerable technical effects are shown for scary purposes but the authentic terrors of the original have been completely undermined in my opinion such an odd re write of the werewolf legend and movie mythology my suggestion to those considering this at the video store go for a classic top of the line thriller instead alfred hitchcock's psycho
<START> this is probably the only film i've seen where the imdb reviews on both sides of the spectrum are 100 accurate the is an atrocious dim witted film with absolutely no artistic merit whatsoever and is a denigration to a director like john landis and that's what makes it great br br in order to appreciate the you have to keep in mind a little known but very true maxim spoken by director abo i urge you to learn to look at bad films they are so often sublime in order for any film to work the film must establish and follow it's own logic and if it does so convincingly and sincerely then it's actually possible for the film to work for example when you watch freddy got fingered as a traditional gross out comedy it's complete and utter garbage when you watch it with the understanding that it's actually a neo surrealist comedy it's brilliant br br it works with good movies too if jaws hadn't accepted the reality it created the air tank explosion ending wouldn't have worked but a lot of people think jaws is vastly overrated for this type of reason and they aren't wrong but it has it's strengths doesn't it the point being that a movie like this makes sense if you look at it with the right perspective some people like me get it right away while others never will no matter how often it's explained jim jarmusch made a compelling defense of showgirls once and even afterwards i still can't see it from his p o v doesn't mean he's wrong though if you have the right frame of mind when you watch this movie and no i do not mean stoned i'm gonna put that to bed right now you can actually enjoy the movie for the dumb cheap pointless slapstick late 80s early 90s style farce that it is br br the defenders and haters of this film are right it's stupid and that's the point the movie accepts the stupidity of the characters much in the same way the jerk accepted navin johnson's idiocy and because it takes that and runs with it the movie focuses exclusively on using that to forward the plot and to define the characters a bad movie would actually do this and fail to use that logic properly bad movie are bad because they make it up as they go along whereas movies like the knows where it's going what it's doing and why from the beginning br br i can't defend the film from an artistic standpoint which is why i give it such a low rating the acting is mostly bad the jokes very superficial and the live action quality probably ruins what would have worked as a cartoon but i can't deny that it is entertaining in its own way and that's why i defend it i got it right away and i pity those who don't br br i'll admit i was drawn to this movie because of christopher lee's delicious cameo appearance hearing him say release the drive bee would have been worth the rental price even if i hated this film but was amazed to find that aside from the tv studio applause sign segment with jenny mccarthy i was never bored and never disappointed in fact many of the jokes because of their cartoonish context were hilarious in particular the airbag cigarette explosion they were dumb but they were funny and the movie doesn't pretend to be anything else a stupid comedy about stupid characters and instead of apologizing for it it enjoys itself br br and that's exactly why it works
<START> as social satire idiocracy is just as good as office space but with a wider scope to criticize this film as too puerile due to potty humor is to kind of miss the point i think there are certainly fart jokes etc but they're not really intended to be funny to the audience they exist to define the state of culture in the world of 2500 ad visited by joe as a background to the bizarre state of affairs in which he awakes the real humor of the film lies in the many sight gags and attitudes present in this future society that are just a shade off of what we encounter in our daily lives and which should serve as a warning my personal favorite is the depiction of fox news the subtle brilliance in the film lies in the fact that it also digs at smart people and average joes like the protagonists note the times in the film when joe and rita almost subconsciously conform to the idiots around them and you realize that idiocracy is not created to pick on any group of people in particular but on the culture of idiocy in general i don't know what to say about the made for conspiracy theory behavior of fox in releasing this film but if it's not playing in your local theater demand it we all need to see this film if not for the social commentary at least for the fart jokes
<START> this is one of those movies that you watch because it's bad such a movie that you watch just to see it's shitty craftsmanship supposedly a horror i cannot imagine how anyone can be afraid of a claymation bug especially one that is translucent in nature where you can see the actor's legs behind it br br even with no budget a little bit of attention to detail and even an attempt at making this movie believable would have sucked the fun right out of it as they would have had to replace all of the actors and the entire story with it if i had nothing to make fun of while it was playing i would have stopped it after 10 minutes and put on some quality show like bob square pants har har har br br i strongly recommend that brett piper get with quintin and really pump out some feces br br
<START> i remember the events of this movie the ill fated cruise of donald in 1968 in the golden globe single handed around the world yacht race i was a 13 year old living in england the previous year francis later sir francis he was knighted for his exploits had completed the first solo of the globe i remember it mostly because we were given time off school to watch his return on a grainy black and white tv and then his by the queen it provoked a huge outpouring of patriotic fervor in the uk it all seems so quaint now became a national hero but he had stopped half way in australia to re fit his yacht so the next logical step for was to attempt the journey without stopping br br it's important to remember that this was a world pre gps when communications on land were still pretty erratic never mind in the middle of the ocean now with gps that fit on a key chain and calculate a position within a anywhere on earth it's hard to recall a time when you could go to sea and quite literally vanish as donald did br br a number of signed up all men back then including mystery man essentially a weekend sailor had not been a spectacular success in any previous enterprise including careers in the british army the air force and as an electronics entrepreneur selling navigation aids he wanted to do something big with his life and he saw the five thousand pound first prize well over 100 000 in today's money and the ensuing publicity as a means of kick starting his business he signed a deal with a sponsor that proved more watertight than his boat and which meant failure would bankrupt him and soon found himself a popular figure with journalists as he prepared for the race now the brits always love the idea of the gutsy amateur taking on the think eddie the eagle losing endless olympic ski jump competitions and the amateur riders who regularly start the grand national horse race the public up to see him set off but his boat wasn't really ready and even as he started the last competitor to leave the uk must have known he didn't seriously have a chance but too much was riding on him to quit br br in the wonderful archive footage we see doubt written all over his poor wife's face left behind with their 4 children she is interviewed movingly throughout the film together with one of sons she was in a no win situation had she attempted to stop him she would have been considered a spoiler but afterward she was with doubt as to whether she could have saved his life by stopping him faced with the certain truth that his boat was leaking and would never make it through the southern oceans and unable to turn around and face ridicule bankruptcy and ignominy devised a plan to cheat laid up offshore argentina and brazil out of radio contact he waited for the leaders to round cape horn and start back up the atlantic thinking he could sneak in at the end of the line and pretend he had sailed all the way around the globe he elaborately his logs and made 16mm films and audio recordings to back up his plan but as one after another the other competitors dropped out he realized that in fact he would come in 2nd and his logs would be scrutinized unable to face certain detection his journal suggests he lost his grip on reality and eventually committed suicide his yacht was found he never was br br this beautifully edited film also follows the journey of bernard an experienced and enigmatic french sailor who was in second place and certain of the fastest journey prize when he abruptly left the race unable to deal with the clamour and publicity he knew he would face and sailed into the wide blue yonder eventually pulling up some 10 months later in tahiti having spent some seven years working at sea myself albeit on very different ships to these i well understand the pull of the ocean standing on deck seeing water in every direction to the horizon knowing there's a couple of miles of water below you nothing between you and oblivion but a thin metal hull without easy access to tv or radio even nowadays on most working ships you feel pretty isolated it's possible to truly escape from the responsibilities of everyday life for a while there is some thoughtful analysis of what drives people to attempt this kind of very long lonely journey and the effect it has on the human mind most people would think that attempting to raise 4 children is adventure enough but much is made of the need for self discovery in the hardships at sea the search for self br br i strongly suspect that robin knox johnston the ex navy guy who won the race and many since probably knew pretty well who he was before he set off which was why he succeeded not just in winning the race but also retaining his sanity en route those who went searching for something profound within themselves may not have entirely liked what they found br br the marvelous archive footage of britain in the late 60s is almost reason enough to watch this did it really look quite that bad i don't remember it looking quite so dowdy but perhaps we blot out the worst aspects of the past but overall it is an excellently well made and engrossing movie highly recommended
<START> for once a story of hope highlighted over the tragic reality our youth face rising draws one into a scary unsafe and unfair world and shows through beautiful color and moving music how one man and his dedicated friends choose not to accept that world and change it through action and art an entertaining interesting emotional aesthetically beautiful film i showed this film to numerous high school students as well who all live in neighborhoods with poverty and and gun violence and they were enamored with anderson the protagonist i recommend this film to all ages over 13 due to subtitles and some images of death from all backgrounds
<START> tempest is based on the classic shakespearean work of the same name but bears little resemblance to its source material br br it masquerades as being as cerebral as its namesake but instead is a jumbled convoluted and hackneyed exercise in tedium the original the premise that people have an evil side which would be destructive if unchecked here you just get an uninteresting mid life crisis yawn goof ball who is having everything go wrong in his personal and professional life he becomes endowed with a supernatural power that he uses to try to control his environment in other words to get his own way br br every few minutes after something else in his pathetic life goes wrong he finds a secluded place and starts babbling show me the magic while waving his hands around and making a serious concentration expression from the way these scenes are shot it looks like he's trying to turn bugs into other kinds of bugs turning a spider into a cockroach maybe but by this time you really don't care br br the story has him bolt from his life with his daughter to a greek island somewhere then have a awkward relationship with some girl he meets one of the dullest romances ever committed to film the story just bogs down and moves at a slower and slower pace you are never given any reason to like or dislike anyone br br i'll give this a 2 because of the beautiful greek location shots and the semi optimistic conclusion although it isn't clear if the tempest power brought this ending about or not the spirit of shakespeare's work has been captured much better in other movies one notable example is forbidden planet which gave credence to how the power gets out of control br br as for this tempest its only magic is to cure insomnia
<START> is about a teenage girl named carly miranda cosgrove who lives with her artist brother spencer in a loft in seattle carly has a web show that gets millions of views and makes tons of money a year so much money she doesn't even know its a real number her best friend is sam janette who's as predictable as they come she says normal things and beats up neighbor freddie who is in charge of all the technical things for their web show carly shouts every word and looks like she doesn't have emotion sam chases freddie around and freddie screams in one episode carly and her friends shoot the doorman down in elevator and he survives br br i would not recommend this at all unless you like teenagers shouting hurting people and making fun of stuff
<START> if anything william was an opportunist who wanted a piece of the action in regards to whatever was popular during the time i mean a blaxploitation flick in louisville kentucky who would of thunk it i can just imagine the enthusiasm he must've had getting pam grier quite a hot item to star in his picture if you are pretty familiar with the genre sheba baby doesn't necessarily stray too far from formula despite a change of venue the film still deals with a ruthless businessman nicknamed shark who muscles in on loan companies using stooges to threaten them in order to get their signatures br br grier is sheba shayne a former louisville cop working in chicago who returns home at the request of her father's partner brick austin stoker assault on precinct 13 sheba's father despite shark's bullying tactics his man in town is pilot a wannabe gangster equipped with stooges who aren't that menacing rather buffoonish in nature so thin skinned they hire hit men outside of town to shoot up the shayne loan building won't give up his company and this eventually costs him his life when a warning through the use of brute force leads to his being killed sheba will get her revenge on all those responsible for his father's death in other words shark's ass is grass can you dig it br br seeing grier with a magnum is enough to sell this particular film the novelty of the setting being in louisville is part of the package you even get to see a speedboat chase grier in shootouts with gangsters not necessarily the most polished kind one might be accustomed to seeing in a chicago or new york during this period in blaxploitation lots of blood spurting from bullet riddled bodies torn apart by gun fire and colorful characters such as a wimpy loan shark in pimp dress named walker and pilot who is one of the least scary mobsters you are likely to see who show up during the film most having the misfortune of coming in contact with a very angry sheba the plot itself is nothing special but grier is always worth watching and orchestrates plenty of action sequences to keep his target audience entertained a modest success for and one of his more accomplished films
<START> the book gets 10 out of 10 stars br br probably contains spoilers of both the book and the movie br br if you've never read geoffrey household's rogue male the source material for man hunt you'll likely enjoy fritz lang's treatment of the story on the other hand if you're in my camp and have practically memorized the book the movie will be a crashing disappointment i'll assume you've already read a synopsis of the story and proceed to my complaints household's little novel is one of the all time great suspense classics taut and spare with only a bare handful of characters to propel the action fritz lang and his screen writer dudley nichols feel the need to throw in the protagonist's brother and a sympathetic floozy the latter of which reduces the depth of the story by injecting an motivation into the screenplay where the novel needed none in fact the true climax of the book was not the nameless narrator's escape from his underground lair but rather his self acceptance of his true motive for going on his hunt in the first place and that's another thing if david fincher and quentin tarantino can get us all the way through fight club and kill bill 1 without revealing the names of their respective protagonists why can't lang what hat did they pull that out of which brings me to my complaint household's hunter is so quintessentially british he would bleed a union jack if you cut him but walter pigeon who plays him is canadian he can barely sustain the accent which is only slightly deeper and more convincing that kevin costner's in robin hood he looked about right in the role and was a fine actor for the 1940s but as rogue male's reluctant hero let's look to the isle itself for a more convincing version remake soon with subtlety and with please i'll direct it for
<START> if you are interested in learning more about this sort of thing happening in modern civilization there is an excellent book called outlaw seas or the outlaw sea and it describes in story after story how these things do happen the lawlessness of the high seas is a reality for a number of reasons one many of the world's are of questionable registry nationality and it's difficult to impossible to enforce international laws when the ships owners don't have an office in a real country two many ship lines employ crews from dirt poor third world countries the crews are often like illegal immigrant workers threatened and bullied into complying with questionable or illegal practices three there is often a language barrier not only between the officers and the crew but also between the crew members themselves the crew are rewarded for their compliance and their silence four once committing an illegal act the ships are able to hide in plain sight with little more than a fresh coat of paint anyway it's fascinating reading br br horrifying story excellent movie does anyone else notice how hbo seems to make the best and most important movies hollywood has trouble releasing enough oscar worthy movies in any given year so that several of the top 5 contenders usually come from britain jerry bruckheimer the end of quality cinema br br i loved the thoroughly evil performance by sean pertwee i also as usual loved omar epps
<START> what was this a zucker brothers movie i don't mind a little humor in my holmes i'm a big fan of billy wilder's the private life of sh but this version of the sign of four feels like a grand guignol esque episode of murder she wrote right from the opening credits that are of the worst possible kind a montage of scenes from the movie as directed by mel brooks ian richardson is a fine actor and certainly looks the part he's a dead ringer to those drawings from the strand but his interpretation of the character is all wrong and overly humorous from the silly smile he frequently sports i thought the drug holmes was into was cocaine not weed to his expressions of comical stiffness in the carnival sequences not to mention that when he disguises himself as an old man he is so over the top that despite the fine makeup we instantly recognize him david healy is an unmemorable but given the circumstances acceptable watson and is not too much of a buffoon at least not more than the rest of characters cherie excalibur plays mary in an exaggerated ingenue fashion straight out of a 1930s vaudeville br br story wise there are some pointless additions like giving tonga vampire teeth an appetite for raw meat and a carnival pit as a place to live turning him into a reject from island of dr moreau and we are even denied the pleasure of discovering the mystery alongside holmes as we are well informed of everything way before holmes finds out and this is full of tired clichÃ©s not only we get the infamous catchphrase elementary my dear watson which as any will know conan doyle never ever wrote but we are exposed to such blatant commonplaces as having hindi music pop out of nowhere when holmes goes to see a white guy in hindi clothes br br bottom line in britain in the eighties two rival tv companies attempted to create a long running series of sherlock holmes adaptations and produced initial tv movies as potential pilots one of them starred ian richardson the other starred jeremy brett thankfully the one that got its way through multiple episodes was the good one br br 3 10 travesty
<START> one of the flat out movies of all time sim and rutherford are at their best matching wits over the predicament of an all boys and all girls school sharing the same quarters slapstick has never been this sophisticated
