<START> this film reminds me very much of the later rock hudson film man's favorite sport about a fishing writer who has never fished and is forced into entering a fishing tournament in this case barbara stanwyck is a martha stewart like writer who can't cook and doesn't really have the perfect family she describes in her articles in fact she has no family at all well like rock she is maneuvered into performing in this case creating a huge holiday dinner while vacationing in the countryside since there is no family she takes home a veteran and a few friends and tried desperately not to let the cat out of the bag that she can't do any of the things she is known for doing a cute little comedy and a welcome film to the annual holiday film lineup
<START> after attack of the fifty foot woman with alison hayes opened the doors for women to be just as dangerous as men there was obviously an open market for other movies to pick up and carry the torch and what more a lovely actress than dorothy from it's a mad mad mad mad world to play the role the is that cute and blonde may just be too sweet and innocent looking to step into allison size 50 shoes this role really needed someone with an amount of smoldering sex appeal is more the girl next door type she may have taken and done this role to prove she could be sexy but the material lets her down lou costello however proves he can do a movie without bud abbott feeding him lines and he even a dramatic role in some of his scenes when he not turning to gale gordon as his front man for gags gordon however establishes that all he can be is blustery perturbed and pushy much the same character he creates later on the lucy show charles lane also plays the same role in everything he does a straight man and his screen time is limited the special effects are convincing for the time but i would have liked dorothy to have been a little more than cheesecake and dressing and at least have been allowed to become dangerous as the movie's lead character she takes second billing to costello who is in all of the movie with dorothy several times vanishing like a sub plot the whole movie put together just can't decide if it's supposed to be science fiction a comedy or just a parody of the allison hayes classic there's a lot of good scenes some very funny humor and some very ridiculous camp that affects the rest of the film still i do like this movie for it's empowerment of women there's not enough movies out there like this one if this movie had a chance to be remade today i'd highly recommend courtney cox and jason alexander in the lead roles and allow me to completely re write the original script courtney tops my lists of actresses who i believe could and should adequately play gorgeous although i have to admit that if either of the titanic beauties allison or dorothy came after me i'd go quietly
<START> as a big fan of most modern fantasy movies i was really looking forward to this i was not familiar with the character although after hearing some general stories about the style of the comic and good reviews of the movie i thought i was in for a real treat br br from the moment that the lead character started to talk in his forced husky voice i could tell straight away that i was not going to enjoy this movie i found the story weak and predictable the acting poor the effects were very good for a small budget film but did nothing for the overall plot br br maybe as a fan of the comics you may get something more from this otherwise i would suggest that you skip it and not waste you cinema fare on this boring adventure
<START> 1 men over the age of 25 that refer to themselves without irony as having game or being either a player or a baller gentlemen from here on in it's a swift descent into starring in your own real life version of a night at the roxbury br br 2 saying the v i p the term v i p in and of itself isn't bad but when preceded by the it instantly becomes part of the douchebag dictionary this goes double for white people br br 3 people that make tv shows based on stuff that they don't know isn't cool and then go on imdb posing as fans right moreover one of whom is from the united states hey me too to bitterly insult members of their potential audience for inevitably thinking their show sucks minus 1 additional demerit point if they employ any variation on the oh snap nice one bro justification that if you don't like the show you obviously can't get laid br br 4 canadian hip hop r b sensation a random addition to the list at first glance but at the end of the day gets the gas face for the simple reason that his particular brand of low rent american aping uncool and general aqua velva dovetails with the overall sensibility of keys to the v i p br br 5 last but not least keys to the v i p for all the above reasons and more
<START> that's what i felt like yelling as well as stomping out of the theater but i restrained myself yes the acting was great no this wasn't the typical hollywood film but the dialogue just wouldn't end or get interesting and despite all the gabbing you never get to really know or care about any of the characters definitely the most boring film i've seen since sphere but i was expecting that one to be boring i had to sit through it but please spare yourself
<START> howard kevin kline teaches english at the high school in a small indiana city he is finally getting married to emily joan cusack much to his parents delight the town is abuzz too because one of its own cameron matt dillon has been nominated for an acting oscar everyone including howard and emily is watching the academy awards on television as cameron is declared the winner in his acceptance speech cameron announces that he was able to fulfill his role as a gay military man in part because of lessons he learned from a gay teacher he had in high school you guessed it its howard but howard has never come out in fact he believes he is straight with the whole town and members of the media waiting and observing the happenings will howard and emily go ahead and get married or is howard truly gay and realize he can not go through with the ceremony this is a wonderful funny and humane film about a gay man and his situation as the man who did not realize he was gay kline is excellent and touching the rest of the cast is equally fine with cusack a stitch as the mixed up fiancÃ© and dillon bob newhart debbie reynolds tom selleck and others on hand to delight the audience as well the costumes are very nice and the setting in the lovely indiana heartland is beautiful then too the script the direction and the production are very very nice but the insightful humorous and the thoughtful look at the gay population is the film's best asset no doubt for those who would be offended by a gay themed film yes just skip over this one but for everyone who wants to laugh heartily and gain a better understanding of the gay situation at the same time this is definitely the best film out there
<START> as much as i love the story of david copperfield i cannot claim to have enjoyed this movie it was probably the second worst movie i have ever seen one problem i see is that the magnitude of the novel asks for a miniseries of several hours rather than a regular movie it is just impossible to capture a significant amount of the events that take place in the story in two hours i dis not enjoy the brooding flashback format it was disjointed and would be impossible for someone who did not already know the story to fully grasp also i don't think the filmmakers interpreted personality correctly the idea of him strolling around on a beach moaning about his life seems inconsistent with the forward thinking nature dickens gave him in the novel agnes also bothered me she came across as a ditsy household decoration rather than a strong woman dora was perfect however this movie was fraught with problems and i wait eagerly for someone to make a decent screen version
<START> i wasn't planning on watching wasted when i saw the mtv preview but since i had nothing better to do or watch on a sunday night i watched it br br wasted was no requiem for a dream but it was a very good movie considering it was made by mtv one thing that drew me to watching it was summer pheonix the sister of the late and wonderful river pheonix stared i suppose talent runs in the pheonix family because she was good and so is though are river nick stahl also gives a great preformance as a junky jock there isn't much else to say about wasted it was a dark depressing and insightful look into the lives of three small town junkies i recomend it to those who like the subject 8 10
<START> american expatriate jules dassin makes an award winning french gangster film the plot involves tony the a hoodlum just out of prison who takes his band of thieves on a 240 million jewel heist unfortunately his ex wife's relationship with a notorious gangster named an italian safe cracker named cesar with a weakness for women and the missteps of his own friend jo cause the successful heist to turn into a bloody race against time as holds jo's son hostage for the cash in typical crime never pays tragedy fashion br br the rififi in the title is explained in a song to mean slang for basically violence and sex and the full title du rififi chez les means roughly some naughty in the house of men which is pretty much where the fatal flaw of the characters take place leave it to a gangster film to place most of the emphasis on the missteps on the women but this time jo's wife gets the last laugh if you could call it a laugh when she predicts all of you are just going to kill each other the characters aren't the most sympathetic and the women are mostly weak but dassin still builds an extremely well crafted suspense film out of them as they pull off a heist that requires the utmost quiet hide the goods and then attempt to survive what basically becomes a cross country cat and mouse game in the mix are some very amazing photography and a fine attention to detail in editing leading to a pacing and visual experience that well overstates the otherwise generic plot it's not only easy to see why this is held as a classic it's also easy to see why it's among the top 250 on the imdb it's suspenseful visually magnificent full of sex and violence and maintains that classy gangster attitude we film buffs like so much
<START> after i first saw this i thought wow this is the most spectacular movie visually speaking i've ever seen since that time i've seen some that topped it but it still ranks as one of the best in that department i'm just disgusted the long awaited dvd was so poorly done the quality of this transfer hardly better than the vhs tape br br the jungle scenes are filmed in cameroon and lush is the best adjective to describe what you see except for jungle sounds seeing is certainly almost everything in the beginning as there is almost no hearing no dialog until tarzan christopher lambert befriends ian holm and vice versa so be ready for that if you haven't watched this film br br story wise all i'll say is this is not the tarzan many of us came to know in johnny weismuller films but that's not a complaint for those craving action and don't care about cinematography as i do you just have to get past that silent introduction period br br in this tarzan version our hero goes back to scotland his roots adapts to that environment for the most part and a little too quickly for credibility frankly and then returns to the jungle without jane this is supposedly more true to the tarzan books written by edgar rice burroughs br br the special effects in here were done by rick baker one of the best in the business sharp dvd or not this is still a stunning film to view and very interesting throughout its 2 hours and 15 minutes
<START> actor turned director liev schreiber the sum of all fears does an above average screen version of the novel everything is illuminated by author jonathan safran foer this tale of journey and self discovery is highlighted by strong ensemble performances and sharp direction with a storyline that enriches and enlightens the soul br br jonathan foer elijah wood is a young man who has seen his grandfather safran pass away jonathan has a peculiar habit of taking small objects and life's little memorabilia and sealing them in plastic bags to display them on his wall safran gives jonathan an old picture showing a young safran standing next to a beautiful girl who saved his life many years ago thus jonathan commences on a long journey to locate this mystery woman in the ukraine not knowing if she is still alive he enlists the help of a brash young tour guide named alex eugene and his grandfather boris to drive him to his goal at first the trip hits dead ends and false leads but as the group nears its target the men find themselves amid the ruins of a dark chapter in history with the memories of war and the past ghosts of a nonexistent town there they find their own respective destinies and will be forever changed by what they learn br br this film feels like it was directed by someone who knew how to get the most from his actors at times the film is spoken in russian and seems like a foreign film the title itself is a play on self discovery this is a thoughtful trek of one man into his past and his past ironically involves his companions jonathan's obsessive journey becomes an emotional journey for alex and his grandfather as well it's a tale of bonding over the long haul and the guilt one must carry for a lifetime by the end of the film these characters have all experienced life altering events that will permanently intertwine their lives it proves that memories can be powerful in traumatizing and also cleansing the soul it's also about one's legacy and how others view an event or a person in the past alex eventually sees his grandfather in a completely different light even our perception of these individuals will have changed by film's end which is a tribute to a story that is well told br br the story is deceptively simple it functions as a road trip movie like the straight story combined with an interesting mystery story it really involves a great many layers of emotions and subplots that range from the past to the present the ending is a bit surreal with its dÃ©jÃ  vu feeling br br elijah wood sin city the eternal sunshine of the spotless mind has chosen a wide range of roles ever since his splash in the lord of the rings trilogy here he does a fine job with what is essentially a minimalist role with not much to show eugene and boris fare better as alex and his grandfather respectively even the grandfather's dog named sammy davis jr jr that's right is funny as a fiercely loyal companion br br the spare music score by paul is a moody compliment to the thoughtful nature of the film the editing is effective as imagery from past and present are linked and transitioned effortlessly the cinematography by matthew gothika requiem for a dream is appropriately stark and lifeless with some impressive images of war and its aftermath br br the coincidences that emerge during the last half of the film make for good drama but are a little too coincidental we never fully understand the whole background story of alex's grandfather and what his motivations are likewise jonathan's blank stares and lack of apparent substance and depth do not give us much more than a sketch of a quirky man at times the film feels a little downbeat and depressing as more horrific revelations are exposed but these are minor criticisms of what is a good introspective story with good performances and interesting themes of remembrance and closure that schreiber not only directed but adapted the screenplay to this worthwhile slice of history is a tribute to his talents and promising potential in the future
<START> this is a classic animated film from the cartoon series most of the major characters get alot of screen time plus do extra characters aswell the film s focus is on the superstar characters vacation and each one has his her very unique summer fun its very funny from beginning to end it has excellent color great music and believe it or not i have seen this more than any movie its that great and in my opinion its perfect
<START> this movie is about the crew of a spaceship who crash land onto a strange bright planet with three suns among the passengers is convicted serial killer richard riddick vin diesel and his nemesis johns cole hauser while the survivors of the wreck are getting their bearings an eclipse of all three suns happens shortly afterwards scary creatures begin to appear and start to pick off the crew members one by one during the eclipse riddick comes into his own as his eyeballs have been surgically shined giving him night vision the crew have to rely on him to try to get them to safety br br this is a very stylish film with the colour of the sky changing scene by scene giving it a very strange look vin diesel is brilliant as riddick truly menacing but forced to help people who otherwise would only see him as a threat there is also an underlying humour in his performance as well which adds another dimension to the character this is the sort of role that vin excels in the anti hero whos character is not as one dimensional as first appears i can imagine no one else in this role it could have been written specifically for him br br roll on chronicles of riddick
<START> i'm sure all of the canadians on imdb are all too familiar with canadian content and how much of it is well shall we say lackluster there are a select few canadian shows that are actually worth watching however this is definitely one of them br br simple premise two guys picking up girls in a bar with certain guidelines and rules add in some witty and clever commentary from a group of surprisingly likable self proclaimed alpha males and you have yourself some very entertaining programming each episode is solid if the players are sub par there are some awkward moments to be had and there is some gentle fun poked at them if the players are good it leads to moments that you just have to stand up and applaud and some comical praise lavished at them br br the premise is kind of trashy i know and as a guy who usually takes pride in the fact that i'm elevated himself above typical terrible reality television it takes a lot for me to admit that this show is actually funny and enjoyable br br one thing that must be pointed out is how the comedy network did a terrible job marketing this show for the longest time i didn't even know the premise and all i knew was that there was somehow a shirtless guy who loves involved however after actually watching the show i was surprised by how surprisingly slick it looks for canadian content despite a pretty lame opening credits sequence so give it a chance i have yet to find someone in the target demographic 18 30 year old males who have actually watched the show and not just the annoying commercials who hasn't liked it br br bring it back for a third season comedy network it actually has a good premise as opposed to some other canadian shows you've had cough girls will be girls cough i usually reserve 10 10 ratings for works of art but i just have so much fun watching this show and i think that it has been unfairly judged my many that i just had to
<START> while i score the movie a 7 i also should point out that it is both interesting historically as it stars mae marsh lillian gish and lionel barrymore when they were all younger and less well known and features pretty exciting action for its day br br the plot is odd for a western in that all the trouble with the indians begins for the weirdest reason i have ever seen the indians decide to have a giant dog banquet no they are not feeding dogs but feeding on dogs and when two indians arrive late there are not left so they steal two dogs belonging to two orphans from the nearby white settlement and this actually touches off an all out war not only is this silly but seems to play on the prejudices of audiences i don't know if american indians actually ate dog but it sounds like the sort of stereotype that later was applied to other ethnic groups all this over dogs the movie has some excellent battle scenes and exciting moments such as when ms marsh crawls across the battlefield to save a baby exciting stuff but strange too
