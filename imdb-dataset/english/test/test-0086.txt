<START> ok with coolio in it i should have known better but br br within 3 mins you've encountered 5 bites from other movies and tv shows br br 8 mins casper van dien should have learnt by now br br 10 mins you're feeling sorry for tom 'tiny' lister jr that he has been reduced to doing movies like this br br 15 mins erika eleniak shows up looking like zena br br 20 mins you're ready to shoot you're self br br how these movies receive funding is beyond me and yes i watched the whole thing the ending is priceless just stay away
<START> i can't help but notice the negative reviews this movie has gotten to be honest i saw the preview for this movie and the premise looked intrigued me yes i rented it after reading others' comments they are correct in that some of the acting leaves a lot to be desired they are also correct that one of the best performances of this movie was that of dr graves br br also interesting is scott clark who plays grant the kid in the wheelchair i identify with the character he played perhaps because i am in a wheelchair br br this movie is certainly worth your looking at
<START> gritty drama emotionally powerful blah the bbc has lost out big time to masterful productions such as the wire sopranos and carnivale from hbo okay so the budget may be a lot smaller but 'the street' last night was badly acted predictable unrealistic stereotypical insensitive and a big fat waste of time tv british tv is not as good as it used to be and is falling further and further behind the american productions br br there was no sense of brutal violence from the there was no indication that this man was enough to beat up a man he has respected for such a long time there was no remorse when he did it and this shouldn't be the sort of character that would back down when bob hoskins called his son a pansy in a display of 'bravery' br br i wish i was more eloquent to express my disdain for this show but i am not and although i can't prove my point well enough believe me when i say that this was rubbish shock tv that provides no real inward looking perspective on life br br 1 5 stars
<START> this movie was sweet the main character lady was sensitive to 2 different men who wanted her she seemed not a character at all but a real person who had made some mistakes but was trying to set things right i liked the movie a lot even the older ladies who were lesbian didn't irritate me too much
<START> i as a christian am outraged after seeing just the first half of this picture the film's website says they researched the movie before writing but i believe they forgot to consult the ultimate source the bible i sat with two different versions of the bible and could not find half of what happened or was said in this picture it was like they made up what was not in the bible and changed what was in the bible to what they thought modern film viewers would want to see instead of the truth i personally am too young to remember the 1950's ten commandments but it can't be any worse than this i have written to the network and can only hope they publicly apologize for this travesty
<START> i can't help but be completely annoyed by this sitcom it's like they didn't even bothered trying ro write good comedy just rehash third rate jokes and hope it sticks the worst of all this is that it's all so damm uninteresting and lacking in every way br br to make things worse leading man kevin james has a permanent i'm so funny smug grin on his face that would be tolerable if only he once delivered in the comedy department which he doesn't he just lies there doing nothing like a big unfunny baby which takes me to the relationship between the easily the most insincere and poor representation of a married couple on any tv show really headache obnoxious spends the whole show as if it where a violent chore to even be around her own husband jerry stiller yanking the few laughs on the show is doing a 100 repetition of his role as frank costanza in seinfeld only this time his hints mostly tread on water due to the inability of the central duo in recognizing a joke even if it flew by them the episodes just drift along in a stream of nothingness their jobs add nothing and their interaction is even worse br br this is not even a waste of talent there is no talent here this is a laughless creative desert
<START> this show should be titled when bad writing happens to good actors considering most of the players have demonstrated immense talent in other venues e g andre braugher in homicide life on the street and david morse in st elsewhere i'm hoping that the frenetic pacing of the show is adjusted as the series develops along with the obvious cliches and dialogue so absurd i wondered just how stupid the writers imagined the core audience to be we're beat over the head with the main points of this show instead of being left to gradually figure it out almost as if the writers feel that they must spell out that the main character is some sort of avenging angel sentenced to redeem himself from sins both and mortal via butting into his cab fares many affairs watching the premiere required much suspension of disbelief that mike fares would so rapidly spill their guts and he would feel driven to intervene in the lives of utter strangers that he possesses those super cop abilities to be all things to all people weapons expert martial arts master psychologist father confessor and so on ad infinitum pure fantasy what is it about recent televisions shows based in philidelphia that they all seem to be imbued with a nasty ex wife and a very bratty child overdone i wanted to like this show really i did because it had the virtue of having a premise slightly different than many of the clones appearing in this season's fare and it stars some of my preferred actors but i'm afraid this is just another possibly good idea ruined by careless execution
<START> the theme is controversial and the depiction of the hypocritical and sexually starved india is excellent nothing more to this film there is a lack of good dialogues why was the movie in english there was lack of continuity and lack of passion emotion in the acting
<START> no one would ever question that director leos carax is a genius but what we wonder about is is he an insane genius so many people hated this film i am normally the first person to accuse many french directors of making offensive boring disgusting and pretentious films such as the horrible recent film and the pointless and offensive rouges' but strangely enough i actually think that x' is an amazing film made with great skill and passion by a master of his craft and containing remarkable performances the film does carry melodrama to more extreme lengths than i believe i have ever seen on screen before but then carax is extreme that we know the film also contains what i consider way over the top or anarchist fantasies and wet dreams what with a mysterious group of young men training to fire machine guns at the bourgeoisie in between playing scott walker's rather fascinating music in a band which has its recording sessions in an abandoned warehouse filled with squatters and fires burning in old steel barrels guillaume depardieu plays a rich young man in a chÃ¢teau whose step mother is catherine deneuve and he wanders into her bathroom while she is naked in the bath by the way but he suddenly completely when he discovers that his deceased father a famous diplomat had fathered an illegitimate daughter who had been effectively disposed of by deneuve as an inconvenience this is because the sister suddenly turns up as a kind of romanian refugee with wild dishevelled hair expressionless face and little ability to speak french coherently depardieu then transforms himself into a hero' of the far left and wants to kill or destroy his family for their hypocrisy and corruption and lives in squalor and extreme poverty while scorning a vast inheritance he then commences an incestuous sexual relationship with his half sister which is shown in an explicit sex scene which has offended many people though i have no objection to it as i think people are far too hysterical about sex especially in america where apparently it never happens the intensity of the acting and the filming make this unlikely scenario come off as an experience of powerful if depressing hyper melodrama the differences between carax making an extreme film like this and the numerous extreme french films which i think are pretentious and disgusting are 1 that carax is an excellent filmmaker and 2 he is seriously attempting to explore a meaningful if harrowing extreme emotional condition whereby a human being disintegrates and turns against his background many would say that the extreme elements in this film were gratuitous but i don't agree i believe carax was genuine and was not making an exploitation picture at all it is very difficult to defend a man who goes that far and who for all i know may be a complete madman but i believe he deserves defending for this remarkable cinematic achievement
<START> i watched the minute version and have to say that dollar for dollar it it probably one of the worst films ever now i am not saying it's the worst film ever but if you look at a ratio of cost over how much an average person would enjoy it this is a very very bad film br br i would say that the single biggest factor making this a bad film is the writer director michael cimino rarely can so much blame be placed on a single person had he not been so self indulgent a film just as bad could have easily been made at about 90 minutes saving the studio millions br br the film begins with a completely unnecessary prologue that's supposed to be set at harvard the scene is huge but completely without context you have no idea exactly what is occurring nor do you know why the students in particular john hurt are behaving so i find it very hard to imagine a commencement going like this in 1870 and it looks a lot more like 1970 this is a half hour where you have no idea what is happening who the characters are or their motivations br br the next scene is 20 years later inexplicably the two harvard grads hurt and kris kristofferson are in wyoming so they went to the best school in america and now one is only a law man in the middle of no where and the other is well what is john hurt in the film he just appears here and there and seems to be either a jerk the prologue or a pathetic and pointless drunk who hangs out with murderers even though he is apparently against them his entire character made no sense they never explained why he was a brit living in the middle of nowhere it was impossible to hide his accent why he bothered to come along with the hired army if he was so against their wicked plan nor why he would risk his life for a cause he didn't believe in at all as for kristofferson his excellent acting and better defined character made his character more believable though having him move to wyoming and risk his life for a prostitute made no sense at all br br this brings up the worst aspect of heaven's gate while the scenes are way too long and needed trimming the worst part of the film is that the characters were like cardboard john hurt a wonderful actor with nothing to do in the film jeff bridges and many other big names are there but you have no idea why in fact other than kristofferson isabelle huppert as a hooker with a heart of gold quite the clichÃ© and perhaps christopher walken everyone is completely one dimensional it's hard to imagine a movie this long where you don't know or understand the characters br br much of the film also seems anachronistic who would have thought to have a giant roller rink constructed in the middle of no where in 1890 i am sure that just getting the basic supplies in this region in the west would have been very very difficult and yet we are expected to believe that trains filled with roller skates and lumber arrived instead of food maybe if they hadn't spent a bazillion dollars building and the roller rink the farmers could have afforded to buy food and avoided this war over cattle and what's with the guy on roller skates with the fiddle what did this have to do with a land war br br the most obvious problem you are left with is that it's a film where very very little actually happens until the big battle late in the film there are lots of scenes of filth and flat nothingness so much nothingness that by the time the battle occurs many audience members would have left or are now so hostile to the film that it's inevitable that nothing could salvage the film br br as for the final battle it was done reasonably well but had problems first this minor skirmish on the prairie lasted longer than the d day invasion second while details of the actual events of the so called johnson county war are a tad sketchy we do know that the characters played by huppert and kristofferson never actually were there as they'd both been hung before the battle third i can't believe that cimino actually killed animals throughout the film especially during the final battle while i am far from a bleeding heart about animal rights his need to use animal guts and actually kill some of the horses is a low point in cinematic history watching and knowing that some of the horses died to achieve cimino's vision for the film is very sad br br finally after the big battle we have an epilogue while it is blessedly short it also seemed completely unnecessary and vague we see kristofferson on a fancy yacht so we can assume that he's finally putting some of that harvard education to work for himself we also see a woman who appears to be one that kris looked at a couple times during the prologue most importantly nothing is said and you have no idea what the final outcome i read up on it myself and found that the film often got the facts wrong br br overall to say the film is long and needed tons more editing was like saying wwii was a minor tiff well i've certainly seen a lot worse but if you factor in the cost of production i truly think it might just be one of the worst films in history br br finally when a film has this much explicit nudity i warn parents however as no child could sit through this film even with a promise of sex the warning is not necessary
<START> first of all the entire script is mostly improv adding to the fantastic illusion that what we are watching is an actual documentary secondly the actors hired by were purposefully chosen to represent their true political alliances and backgrounds the hippies portrayed are actual hippies the government officials though not necessarily in the government themselves are at least actually hearty conservatives within the system and several of the cops are actual policemen the interactions of these actors given the textual freedoms alloted by eventually come to a violent head where even himself is convinced that a cast member had actually been shot we hear him screaming cut cut in the background br br an amazing film though american critics were quite harsh in their reviews one actually reporting that it was the most offensive film she had ever seen this not entirely unexpected as the unveiling of this oppressive communist like mentality of america during this era would certainly rattle some cages this pseudo documentary definitely requires an open mind though if you are seriously looking for an intensely accurate portrayal of 60s culture this would be the film to watch
<START> emma thompson alan rickman carla and gil bellows are a delight in this sexy caper this film is smart edge of your seat entertainment for adults and what a relief that is in these days of big concept predictable cartoons great music and camera work add to the fun that is this new orleans set puzzle highly recommended ten stars
<START> i love this film it is excellent and so funny ben is fit and i wouldn't mind meeting him on holiday i rate this film a 10 because its gr8 and i hope they never re make it because it would never be the same funny bit is wen andre is looking at the moon and he shouts at nicole to 'come outside and look at the moon' that bit always makes me laugh and never gets old another thing is nicole looks a lot older then 14 but shes a gr8 actress but i need help with something does n e 1 no the name of the song played at the end wen nicole and andre are dancing its really bugging me because i want 2 no what it is because its a nice song
<START> excellence seems to come rare in hollwood today many consider just two out of the year's best picture nominees to display sense to the movie industry and in 'everything is illuminated ' the mark is hit directly br br the film initiates its brilliance with the beautiful setting the scene entry from the beginning you receive a sense of warmth and true family connections and relations between one and another and also the cast is introduced perfectly for elijah wood's character jonathon his sensibility is expressed through holding his dying grandmother's hand and for the character entitled alex it is easy to see his life in his perspective the true ukrainian rock star with the cast illuminated at first the story slowly eases into our minds as jonathon decides to venture to ukraine to meet the woman believed to save his grandfather thus the entire family and from there the story movies slowly yet kept at a fast pace from the contrast of tear dripping drama and laugh out loud humor included in scene by scene every scene br br although the movie itself is rather awarding there are several complaints from other sources commenting about liev schrieber's inaccurate adaptation of the jonathon foer novel personally i have never read the novel but any movie especially this movie in particular should not be graded on whether the storyboard of the film matches the storyline of the book but rather how the major concepts from the novel were expressed and exploited through the film just because it may be far fetched from the novel does not mean that this film is no longer a must see it still is br br throughout the film new information the audience's mind very slowly some of these thoughts are never answered and in fact the second half of the movie its entire topic and reason of travel through ukraine onto something different yet rather similar to the original intentions of this film the film does however leave you on a satisfied note yet to the weak hearted souls a tear may be dropped and throughout the film to the people with common sense of humor may just have to laugh from alex and john's fun and ongoing conversations br br i would recommend this film to several different types of people to those whom enjoy movies that share the genre drama comedy for those who have an interest in family connections and to those whom have an interest in subjects and to those insane people who find slapstick as hilarious comedy this movie is not for you and for you whom think that this is a seriously funny and absolutely ingeniously funny film you are wrong this film shares comedic moments and dramatic sequences and to those whom judge a movie based on their likeliness with its corresponding novel you may or may not enjoy this film but this film should be taken for much more than whether or not it was close to the book br br all in all 'everything is is an ingenious piece of work that will enlighten anyones' hearts
<START> early in the movie cagney's johnny cave character tells his gumshoes in the office of weights and measures that in the previous year unscrupulous shop owners had cheated the american consumer out of more money than the national war debt then he goes out and tickets a particularly greasy green grocer for short selling him a bag of sugar that is four ounces off oh the horrors and one skinny chicken that his butcher's scale has rather generously proclaimed to be six lbs after which the fur or in this case feathers flies er fly when a racketeer in politician's clothing attempts to derail an investigation into the paltry poultry practices our hero becomes a lone wolf waging the war of the weights on behalf of housewives across america after all four cents here and a quarter there add up and before we know it we have anarchy word of his intransigence soon reaches both the mayor and the governor's offices and cagney becomes a marked man if it sounds silly it's not the dishonest practices are only a plot tool or as hitchcock would say the mcguffin and while unfamiliar it works every bit as well here as any treasury agent or g man anthology in which the fight is taken to shady crooks who are operating outside the interests of the country's common good the production standards are decidedly grade b but it is cagney who makes this movie the delight that it is this was his first film away from warner brothers after seeking release in court from his unreasonable contract and he seems to be at ease and enjoying himself tremendously the performance turned in here is intelligent and crackles with his unique energy and surefire charisma mae clarke's presence lends a definite warner's feel to the overall production the supporting players turn in solid performances and the story moves along smartly after a rocky introduction that seems to begin three or four reels into the story but sit back and enjoy it for the cagney showcase and engaging depression era time capsule that it is
