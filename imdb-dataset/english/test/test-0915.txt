<START> this film captures the short moments between a mother and son in rural russia as she lays dying br br i am so torn between being nice to the film or declaring it a test of patience on one hand the film is beautiful with the sparse dialog capturing the essence of their feelings there is really nothing to say because everything that needs to be said is conveyed beyond words the son shows so much care love and patience towards his mother that i think it is a celebration of unconditional love towards one's family it also cruelly reminds me that i could be in a situation like this stuck in a joyless place having to take care of a very ill person mat i is cruel reality br br on the other hand mat i moves really too slowly do i really need to watch a train passing by the horizon for over 1 minute with my previous experience of and i am so tempted to put mat i among them as a total bore br br i guess one has to be in the right state of mind to appreciate this film i surely see the beauty of it but maybe i am not in the right state of mind
<START> the last american virgin along with fast times at ridgemont high is one the last great teen films ever made it is tender tale of envy and unrequited love set in the early eighties much maligned by critics that it was a sophomoric banal attempt to recreate the magic of fast times at ridgemont high these same critics fail to recognize that the two films were actually filmed concurrently during late 1981 and released at only slight intervals from one another either way the studios would never allow such a bold and uncompromising portrayal of the issues many male teenagers are confronted with as they reach their sexual maturity especially considering the heart wrenching discovery the protagonist gary is confronted with in the end american pie this is not the story revolves around a trio of male teenagers and their mostly unsuccessful sexual pursuits gary is the least successful of the group hence the tagline last american virgin secretly gary lusts after karen who is involved with rick his best friend rick and karen begin having sex and karen gets pregnant only to be dumped by rick who is not interested in the obvious responsibility which lies before him gary glides into help karen which leads to the aforementioned unexpected conclusion overall as a film i find it was very successful as a comedy as a commentary on the sexual dilemmas of young men and a remarkable coming of age tale dealing with issues such as envy unrequited love and abortion which are just as pertinent today as they were over twenty years ago also it has one of the soundtracks ever made
<START> hitchcock is a great director ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch i admire hitchcok on a purely visual and technical level br br first the positives hitchcock invented the notion of the probing camera the curious eye that is able to withhold or search for information it isn't exactly a new visual grammar but it was revolutionary then br br secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie he has an economical style and is always thinking of the audience he gives them regular thrills regular jolts of humour and regular shocks in short he anticipates the audience's base needs and plays them like a fiddle br br unfortunately the base needs of a human being are mostly stupid food sex the thrill of danger and a little comedy caters for all these needs on screen with the exception of food which judging from his size he catered to off screen br br it's this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films a second downside is that most of hitchcock's camera work and visual grammar are now common place what keeps his films watchable are the simple economy of his tales the intelligence of his camera work and his skill at crafting tense action set pieces br br so on to saboteur this is a light hearted romp in the vein of the 39 steps it jumps from sequence to sequence until it concludes at the typical hitchcock final act set piece br br on an emotional level the relationship between the leads is not up to par with robert and madeleine caroll in the 39 steps hence the whole story lacks a certain energy the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes and new scenes only bring us nearer the end since it's not clear if the hook is the hero's escape from the police from the villains or his action to stop the plotted sabotages br br there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws for example a guy with handcuffs frees himself using a car fan belt etc why doesn't he just drive away in the car surely handcuffs aren't that restrictive he's able to swim in them after all br br if you want a better hitchcock wartime propaganda flick from the 40's i would advise you watch foreign they are both silly chase movies with a catchy finale but foreign makes great use of umbrellas and tulips something spielberg rips off nicely in minority report br br 7 5 10 some good set pieces beyond that however there's nothing much to sink your teeth into
<START> strained and humorless especially in light of its rather dubious psychology but well paced and comfortably lurid this genteel body count movie highlights the unusually hypnotic presence of angharad rees as a young woman periodically possessed by jack the ripper thus allowing for some nasty gore effects amidst the edwardian propriety it's all pretty standard stuff for hammer but is handled with a good deal of visual elan even if the central relationship between psychoanalyst porter and rees drives the narrative without ever being satisfactorily explained
<START> so many people have taken shots at platoon and born on the fourth of july among other calling them leftist propaganda film now its my turn to take a political shot at a movie to me this movie is very imposing on certain religious beliefs and on its political views br br the acting and writing was a little to clichÃ©d for my liking mel gibson seems to like to play in these unnecessary violent films and proves it once again by teaming up with his partner randall wallace for yet another one throughout this movie there was this garbage prototypical just tell my family i love them or tell ronny to pray before hoe goes to bed lines the was so overloaded with this garbage retread lines that i felt like i had to vomit how about that scene were gibson's wife goes to do her laundry and this no colors applies to what to put in the washing machine its in the mid sixties was she some how stuck under a rock not noticing the racism around her another scene is were gibson's daughter asks him what war is and the scene is shot in such a trivial matter br br the directing displayed this all perfectly the countless scenes of gibson and his family or soldiers praying i'm fine with showing that once or twice but after a while i wonder if the movie is trying to shove something into my head how many scenes with the american flag at its finest hour were shot with the melodramatic music on the director also makes it seem like we won some sort of victory in vietnam what exactly was won their the cinematography was the worst of it with the slowed down scenes see the american flag in the distance scenes spread throughout i love america but movies like this seem to glorify every little thing we do br br this may seem like a rant and maybe it is but i cannot stand it when a movie like this makes people who are not religious are not so patriotic that they will agree with anything their country does look bad this movie to me is narrow minded and limited in so many aspects to me it says if your not christian your wrong would god or jesus want people to kill i don't think so to me this movie was offensive at first this movie was funny with the countless clichÃ©s and overacted scenes but then when i looked at what this movie was trying to say or not say it was really frustrating to watch i guess though it is my fault that i chose to watch this movie i hope no one takes this comment offensively because i am not criticizing religion or patriotism but some of the narrow minded people who are so into both and discount everyone else br br if you want a real depiction of the vietnam war watch platoon born on the fourth of july apocalypse now the deer hunter or the killing fields even full metal jacket which i absolutely hated was a better depiction i have read a quote that in context says a true patriot does not go with everything the government or country does but questions it when its wrong a real patriot loves their country too much to see it do bad things
<START> crimson begins with some cool jazzy music so i liked it immediately but as the film wore on i began to wonder if the music wasn't the best part we have some thieves pulling a jewel heist and when one does something wrong the alarm is triggered and the cops chase them and when the car turns around at a road block one of the thieves paul nash jacinto molina whoever he is here gets shot now it seems like he might die but with the help of a drunken doctor and his mad scientist friend and wife he is saved with a part of the brain of some nightclub owner called the sadist the sadist is unfortunate in that the gentlemen that kidnapped him lost their knife to remove is head so to add insult to injury or in this case death they remove his head using a train leaving the body for the authorities to find oops once the brain transplant is complete naschy wants to ravage any woman that comes near him because he now has the mindset of his donor well of course this is all pretty improbable and features medical equipment that looks to have been purchased at radio shack and overall it's pretty cheesy and sleazy but it has a good early 70's look and feel to it and the music is cool this isn't so much a horror movie but more a thriller with lots of thugs battling it out over turf and babes and other thug type things but it's strangely entertaining in ways i can't begin to describe 7 out of 10
<START> is it a perfect movie no it is a weird adaptation from a sci fi book and it features vampires from space naked beauties and the british army efficiency br br when i first saw this movie i was rather young and all i can remember is the feeling of awe for the movie and mathilda may actually if it weren't for this gorgeous lady being naked the whole movie i probably wouldn't have rated it so high but given her sheer magnificence i am now actually considering voting it up br br lucky for me i got reminded of the movie and watched it again now imagine raiders of the lost ark or poltergeist special effects splattered unto a rather decent sci fi story but with completely over the top performances i still enjoyed the movie tremendously as well as mathilda may but it was a mixture of nostalgia comparing with the crap movies they make today and actually wanting more when it ended br br bottom line if you are a sci fi fan you are not allowed to miss this movie oh and did i mention mathilda may is young beautiful and naked
<START> a horrible mish mash of predictable story lines and toe bendingly poor delivered pc clichÃ©s ad nauseam races working together the heroine being smart as well pretty a guy sacrificing himself to save another life a father daughter relationship etc etc etc the movie looks like something created for network television and should have probably stayed there even the gifted tommy lee jones does not manage to salvage this bomb i urge you not to waste money or time on this cinematic ruin from the time when disaster movies roamed hollywood br br the two stars are given solely to the cgi people and the pr peoples' ability to get even one movie goer to sit through it
<START> like many situation comedies the war at home is getting better with each episode the characters are starting to become real and i believe them as a family i agree with many that the first few episodes were not that funny i thought the show would be canceled for sure but with the absences of malcolm in the middle and arrested development war provides much needed live action comedy for fox on sunday nights and when compared with the rest of the sitcoms airing right now war is an even better choice br br its appeal at least for me lies in its real situations teenagers have sex not every parent likes how their kids are turning out parents fight and call each other names but rather than relying on being mean like many shows everything is nice in the end which is the number one rule of a good sitcom br br one detraction from the show is the narration during in between scenes the arrested development family guy style of flashbacks work well enough but the narration can be too much br br so anyone who needs something to watch on sunday nights should check out the war at home especially considering what is on the other major networks at that time
<START> after 30 minutes mostly fast forwarding deleted it off my recorder the first critters movie was self consciously fun the conversation between the critters just before granny blows them away off the porch for example this film just limps along waiting for someone to shoot it and put it out of your misery br br i can't imagine anyone who worked on this turkey being proud of it br br one was fun four just was awful don't bother even if the alternative is watching reruns of a tbs 700 club fund raiser you'll at least get some good laughs there and the alien makeup is more believable grin
<START> this movie has one or two slightly interesting gags but they are not worth the wait after an unexplained argument between two guys picking up litter in a drive in movie theatre we cut to a family leaving hollywood and driving driving driving driving their camper van across the screen again and again as inane dialogue is voiced over at least i think it's inane the terrible song that accompanies this montage is mixed so loud it renders the dialogue at times almost inaudible br br finally the camper van arrives at night at a gas station where the family get out have another inane conversation before driving off the camera then pans across to reveal the actor we have just seen drive away he talks straight to camera and we realise he is the director of the movie we are watching which is about him and how he came to make the movie br br a nice idea which almost but not quite makes the previous sequences worth the pain br br as the movie unfolds he encounters the two characters we met picking litter at the start of the movie and they all form a motion picture company br br all sorts of not very funny and clumsy comedy ensues as they put together a crew and attempt to raise the cash needed to start filming br br this movie was obviously put together on a shoe string and a promise and there is a nice little idea in here struggling to get out but the execution is so inept that the idea gets lost comedy is more than things just falling over and everyone talking or shouting at once so much of the dialogue here is shouted by several actors simultaneously robert altman can do this sort of thing well because he has a script rehearsals decent sound techies and editing facilities everyone shouting at the one mike which by the sound of it was hidden in a dustbin in the next room does not make for clarity
<START> this is a forgotten classic of a film and harmony karin borrowed a ton from it for gummo gummo is good river's edge is way way better its no secret that keanu reeves isn't the best actor whoever walked the earth no in fact he's a horrendous actor but he was born for some roles ted preston esquire from bill and ted and his role in this film he is perfect as a sort of good natured but very apathetic and confused teenager then there's crispin glover i think his performance in this film is the best of his career he is phenomenal as the drugged out character then there's dennis hopper who is perfect as well this movie is simply amazing and if you haven't seen it run out and watch it today its brilliant one of the best portrayals of modern america i've seen
<START> i had seen this movie before but i could not remember it was this fantastic it has a fun plot madonna fumbles around the city with etc causing a commotion and the music is just perfect and the happy ending that girl is a great choice for a like me in my opinion this could be even the best madonna movie i have ever seen 10 10
<START> an american boy goes to paris after his mother commits suicide becomes and artist and then discovers himself and returns to the states so he can make things right with his former friends br br i have to think that the people who are rating this movie so highly are all x files fans even though there are no aliens or serial killers in it don't be fooled this movie blows chunks br br the story is incoherent with little or no explanation of what people are doing or why when you do get an explanation it doesn't fit the story that went before it what it does is bore you for all the acting talent in the film it just isn't interesting i spent the whole movie wondering when sex addict duchovny was going to bang someone maybe he was doing it behind the scenes they should have filmed that instead br br what comes across is a story of a self obsessed artist worrying about minor incidents in his life and wanting to make them right somehow even though they didn't seem that wrong to begin with there aren't any particularly interesting or shocking revelations despite the mention of a big secret in the first few minutes it's just a guy thinking that his life is as interesting to you as it is to him it's not br br i saw in the trivia that duchovny claims he wrote the script in a week that's entirely believable the guy can act there's no doubt but writing and directing are obviously beyond his talents br br why hollywood keeps these self discovery stories is beyond me i discover myself in the shower every morning but i don't bother making a movie about it mine would probably be better than this one though at least there would be some nudity
<START> where would hollywood have been without march as robert browning or dennis price as lord byron famous lovers in their day even an actor as normally as michael redgrave once brought some moody charm to a portrayal of w b yeats writers' lives are an endless source of inspiration br br but of all poets it was dylan thomas the free loving welshman who enjoyed a pint or two and drank himself to death in new york at the age of 39 who was closest in spirit to the film industry during world war ii he produced scripts for british propaganda documentaries he even wrote the screenplay of a vapid melodrama called the three weird sisters in which three old maids in a welsh village plot the murder of their rich half brother all that is now forgiven br br in john the edge of love thomas is played by the welsh actor matthew rhys it's not a full scale biopic the film covers four years in the poet's life during world war ii when he lived with two women his wife caitlin sienna miller and a former lover vera phillips keira knightley whom he met again by chance during the war it seems he loved them both the relationship of these extraordinary women to thomas and to each other is at the heart of absorbing film br br how it came to be made is a story almost as remarkable as that of the lovers themselves the film's producer is the granddaughter of vera phillips and william william a war hero played in the film by cillian murphy married vera while she was still in love with the poet was inspired to make the film when she discovered a book about her grandparents dylan thomas a farm two mansions and bungalow by david thomas describing their tangled lives sharman macdonald who wrote the screenplay is the mother of knightley the part requires knightley to sing and her mother included songs especially for her surely no film with such family connections deserves to do other than succeed br br we begin in london during the blitz bombs are falling sirens are wailing and phillips is singing to crowds in an underground tube station in a pub by chance she meets thomas and discovers after all these years that he has a wife and child phillips and caitlin form a friendship untroubled by jealousy or rancour and are soon sharing beds and bathtubs listening to thomas read his poems exchanging intimate secrets and smoking their heads off as everyone did in wartime caitlin turns out to be more experienced in the ways of the world my first was augustus john he seduced me when i was 15 but it's the refined and soulful phillips who stirs thomas's deepest responses and eventually succumbs to his charms in the meantime she has reluctantly married who has seen her in the tube station and been instantly captivated by her beauty if not her singing br br it is an intense and strangely beautiful film though thomas himself may be its least impressive character he is best remembered for under milk wood his verse radio play about a day in the life of the mythical welsh village of whose name spelt backwards was not something polite english teachers drew attention to i once had a vinyl recording of richard burton reading the poem he appeared in a film of under milk wood in 1971 and i've never forgotten the creamy seductive quality of his voice the legendary charisma the magnetism of the man is something i missed in performance thomas comes across as a strangely pallid even secondary figure compared with the women in his life br br in his previous film love is the devil explored the turbulent life of painter francis bacon and his sadomasochistic relationship with his lover and model george dyer the edge of love seems to me a richer and more satisfying film if you ask what insights it offers into the springs of thomas's creative inspiration i would have to say but as an insight into his egotism his smouldering moods and his general indifference to the feelings of others it is wonderfully sad and revealing br br thomas had a good war boozing and writing while other men including were being traumatised by the horrors of battle in one scene near the end thomas's behaviour towards his friends seems unforgivably callous but this is not after all thomas's film murphy gives us a magnificent study in doomed passion and the emotional of war miller is charming and pathetic as the wife and knightley looks almost too exquisitely delicate to be real as she did in pride and prejudice but this is probably her finest performance and in every respect the film is worthy of her
