<START> this is probably one of the best thrillers i have ever seen it has action but not this bullet flying good guys bad guys van damme stallone action but quick realistic and nervous action it has a plot cause till the very end of the movie you don't know how this is gonna end it has characters aidan quinn donald sutherland and ben kingsley are just perfect and it has suspense this movie just won't let you go away before you've seen the end of it br br though there are only a few characters i didn't find it difficult to keep my attention the the story and as for the story it's basic not too tom clancy difficult but simple and raw and realistic br br if you're in for a movie with a good story some action and great acting watch this and i promise you won't go away till you've seen the end of it the very end of it
<START> so madonna isn't meryl streep still this is one of her first films and a comedy at that give her a break sure the movie is mediocre at best and pales in comparison to its earlier counterpart w katherine hepburn bringing up baby for what it is though a piece of fluff it's quite a bit of fun to watch i've yet to hear anyone that slams madonna's acting skills back it up w evidence or even adjectives other than awful bad or other such vague descriptive words if you wanna see bad acting or justify the argument that singers should stick to singing how about whitney houston she's had the most undeserved commercial success of any actress in history and couldn't act her way out of a the american public obviously cannot discern the difference between a credible performance in a movie and star power i think madonna has always been at least credible in her movies get real people madonna bashing is so 90's
<START> i am very diplomatic in my reviews and as an academic writer try to give creative license to tv writers trying to a true story this story about karen carpenter could have helped so many yet due to the directing and editing does not br br the story in this case is not fully addressed unless one reads psychological journals while cynthia portrays a realistic karen it is sad that so much has been edited louise fletcher portrays her mother and does an excellent job with limited material and dialogue in this case i give the actors credit for surviving this project br br why is the audience not permitted to see factors american audiences are quite savvy and if they have cable usually educated br br i sincerely feel that i could have written a better story would not have edited out the truth and allowed the actors to project the reality br br richard carpenter as director has seriously underestimated and insulted american audiences karen's story is important and it is sad we will never hear it
<START> this show is absolutely fantastic it provides all the great drama and romance of teen shows like the oc and dawsons but it's a whole lot funnier it's a show with morals and values without everything being sugar coated and sanitised ala 7th heaven we don't have sororities or fraternities in australia and our university system is completely different so i have no idea how accurately greek life is portrayed but i don't care because this show is my new favourite any writer that can make me love a racist confederate flag waving bible basher must be genius br br and is my new pacey sorry josh jackson you've been
<START> watching this movie really surprised me i have never found myself to stop watching a movie in its entirety because 3 dollars to rent a movie is a good amount of money and darn it i should at least watch the whole thing and get my moneys worth i made it through about 30 minutes of this absolutely crappy movie when i thought to myself i am now a little more dumber after watching this movie i can't believe that the director and actors in this movie actually had that low of respect for themselves to allow this to be released br br there's nothing i can say that hasn't been said by the other reviewers but even in the worst of films there are usually one or two decent performances not in this piece of pathetic garbage i've seen better acting in high school plays every and i mean every 'actor' is bad beyond belief and what's truly amazing is the uniformity of the badness gosh it must have been the director where did they get these people br br this is possibly one of the worst horror movies i have ever seen although entertaining in places due to its laughable script and even weaker acting and i use that term very loosely it is unfortunate that this film was not consigned to b movie hell for all eternity what could have been a good idea has been ruined by an ultra low budget poor sound and effects and actors who probably earned their wings in children's television and poor children's television at that br br please stay away from this movie not even worth a minute of your time
<START> joan fontaine is swept off her feet by the suave cary grant after their marriage she realizes that her husband is very irresponsible and owes a major gambling debt it appears that grant tries to scheme his best friend nigel bruce out of part of his life savings bruce ends up murdered and fontaine suspects that her husband will try to kill her for the insurance money this drama drags on to an abrupt and flat finale
<START> ok this is one strange film fans of ed wood jr will appreciate the inventive techniques director george barry utilizes like stock footage and cheesy voice overs he can make a crack in the wall into a plot device there is more humor than horror here but i found it an uneven blend you will be laughing and crying and probably wondering why you got your hands on this barry explains in the introduction that filming began on this movie in 1972 and was completed in 1977 at a cost of 10 000 that's 59 months and 9 900 too much if you like your cheese on the campy side with vintage '70s gore you might find this an irresistible and freaky snack
<START> next stop on our journey through the calender slasher scene is oh yes graduation day all of those seniors just brimming with possibility and ready to venture out into the real world and become adults that is however if they can make it to graduation without having to tangle with the campus lunatic who's running around gouging the life out of students with his fencing sword yeah it all stems from a the high school track star who drops dead from a blood clot during a race and a year later her older sister returns home from the navy for graduation the track coach holds the blame and broods in his position in shop class while the girl's boyfriend still mourns her death a year later all of these characters are prime candidates for serial slasher of the year and you just have to sit through this movie until the end to find out who done it graduation day is fun though it isn't spell original by any means and there aren't a whole lot of memorable demises but there is enough going on to keep you mildly entertained like linnea quigley screwing the music teacher and getting busted with a joint 30 year old actors playing teenagers and of course gotta love that crap you can do a lot worse than graduation day kiddies
<START> sharky's machine is a crime drama set in early 80's atlanta it stars burt reynolds as a renegade cop who is hellbent on stopping crime and corruption in his city the story is about a dirty politician who is at the top of a crime ring that has been brining the city to it's knees sharky's link to bringing down this syndicate is a high priced hooker that he falls for during the course of the movie the action sequences are well done for the early 80's and the soundtrack score are pretty good the acting is b level but this is a pretty decent film to have in your dvd collection br br overall 7 10 br br peace br br
<START> this is the kind of movie that you rent when you are incredibly tired or impaired in some other way the acting in this movie is so bad it seems intentional and to let you know how bad the special effects are there is one scene when the puppets are coming alive where you can see most of a hand holding the puppet moving it about the movie looked as if it was filmed with a camcorder when i saw this movie for the first time a fistfight nearly erupted when my friends and i were calling each other names from this flick that's how terrible it was if you enjoy getting mad at movies i recommend this to you otherwise flee as though your very life depended on it
<START> maybe it gets better i wouldn't know i made it through the first twenty minutes or so before cutting it off and entering a period of mourning it was obvious that the plot itself was a familiar one a man paul a professor of at columbia drives with his dog to a small town in ohio in search of his ex wife diana scarwid there he encounters people who either ignore him or are hostile oh they may smile but there's something going on underneath br br that sort of arrangement is home turf for movie makers and viewers alike and it's pregnant with possibilities you can turn out a neatly drawn commercial success like bad day at black rock or it would have made and probably did make a nice twilight zone episode br br the cast includes some seasoned performers too as well as some formerly prominent names kenneth toby a veteran of science fiction is the superficially amiable motel manager diana scarwid can give an impressive performance as she did in say for some of the others their range is limited br br but it's poorly directed and shabbily written br br example of shabby direction that dog of is disliked by kenneth toby right off the bat so when walks out to the street toby sneaks up to the window of his room peers in at the dog and something zaps cut to in the street he hears his dog howling away then a pov shot of presumably the dog zipping along towards then past him while the wind blows and at the camera cut to an identical shot coming from the other direction whatever the camera represents whatever is staring at is never shown maybe it was nothing because suddenly the wind stops and is alone in the street looking a little bit puzzled you should never have brought that dog in the first place remarks a smiling toby from the porch question what the hell is that scene all about br br example of shabby writing well two examples 1 if you were to sit down and write a stereotypical waitress in a small town diner without the exercise of any craft whatever you'd come up with an expressionless babe with her hair piled on top of her head chewing gum sauntering among the tables right 2 anything resembling believability is thrown out the window in favor of special effects car chugs to a halt then explodes while it is waiting to be fixed at the garage to a halt believable exploding supernatural not even edgar allan poe would endorse such an event br br and the invaders themselves think of a modest masterpiece like invasion of the body snatchers something is going wrong in dr kevin mccarthy's small town and it takes half the movie for the mystery to be unraveled and all the time suspense is building and doubt is growing here twenty minutes into the movie a stranger walks into a motel room and tears off his plastic face revealing a pulsing light emitting naked brain the pregnancy is aborted br br i won't tell you the ending because i don't know what it is nor do i care i suppose it had something to do with insects because why else would paul be an by the way who's handling his classes but i'm not even sure bugs were involved it's entirely possible that the bug business was the writers may have made him a specialist in insects and then forgot all about it it wouldn't surprise me
<START> the strong points in the film were clear for the beginning and middle part of the film it showed how a very violent reactive authority might react to resistance filmed in the fashion of a documentary the director captures what would have happened if the united states enacted martial law volunteering for punishment park a training ground for cops where you're bullied and harassed would offer you an out to this dire scenario it switches between the court trials for those facing accusations those who are in the park escaping police attention the training of officers preparing to handle these prisoners the judges in their leisure time among many other things it was a very strong deeply moving film br br the only fault i had with this was its realism officers are often seen holding their pistols like they were seven years old with a plastic toy i e a 90 degree bent elbow when pointing a gun in someone's face or the way one cop just makes it look like it's hard to kick someone when they're down etc etc it starts out as an honest and interesting attempt to capture a very critical state of political affairs by the end of the film the viewer is slowly reminded again and again of the prejudices of the director and the producers the antagonist characters in the story start out as genuine real human beings and then slowly progress into stereotypical forces of evil by the very end the mistakes they make are stupid the force they demonstrate is unreal and unlike the way real police act the judges during this court hearing are shown making stupid and unreal mistakes among many other things br br the realness of the movie started to fall apart when it became evident that this was just another blank check attempt to make government look bad and that's coming from an anarchist the scenes at the end started to get hokey unreal and a thousand times over dramatic still for the earlier part of it it promises some very moving storyline
<START> i first saw this movie in the theater i was 10 i just watched it a second time and i must say it was amazing the music the dancing the acting it is a great story and told extremely well i fell absolutely in love with treat williams when i was a kid after seeing him in this movie one of my favorite parts was when his mom kept yelling at him to give her his pants and then finally said how much do you need money that was classic br br moms are the best if you haven't seen this movie since it came out i say see it again it's timeless it will do what all great movies do make you laugh cry and think
<START> never ever have i been as impressed by a film as this little piece about four groups of people that faces a crisis or many in some ways a little like short cuts but totally different at the same time br br there are a heap of lead characters whom we all learn to know very well as their stories unfold and they are as persons show their good and their bad sides their weaknesses and their strengths with lots of drama and laughter br br the closest equivalent in a us movie i can think of which then is far weaker in every respect is the royal tenenbaums br br four shades of brown as the title would be in english tells the story about a stressed out and his wife and his elderly parents who are traveling magicians about the receptionist at an animal and his family misadventures about the members of a cooking course who mostly talk about their sorry lives and fourthly about the funeral for a womanizing trotter jockey who tries to continue orchestrating the family from beyond the grave by singing and appearing in 3d during the funeral thanks to high tech equipment that has cost his entire fortune the family gets nil not even the famous horse is given to the family br br there is a warmth and compassion in this film that is filled with grief and laughter that i've never experienced before br br most actors were new to me except robert and one or two more but they all deserve the big slam the film took at the swedish extravaganza the swedish oscar awards a week ago br br male female and male supporting actor prizes went to this film plus a few more to boot br br if you have the chance go and see it the hours float by very quickly
<START> spoilers bruce willis the part time comic and funny guy plays a hispanic assassin nicknamed after an african scavenger prairie dog i guess all the good hispanic nicknames like scar scorpion viper cobra snake tarantula whip blade etc were not available and why would some south american assassin be acquainted with a terrorist from the irish republican army last time i checked the ira is not looking to open any branch headquarters in south america and why would some prison tough battle weary irish terrorist look like a middle aged richard gere i thought maybe this movie was going to be a spoof of the crying game when gere's character was introduced as the person who was going to hunt down the what bad casting and why would the fbi be hiring depraved terrorists in order to track down assassins it seems like a terrorist goes for mass destruction and an assassin usually hits one target in a non spectacular manner but gere is the only person who has ever seen willis alive according to the fbi i thought this movie was supposed to be a remake of the very great film day of the but this movie is just a dumber version of assassins with stallone and banderas both of these movies are really dumb and part of the dumb ness is the fact that as the audience we are forced to watch bruce willis go through his routines and we should say wow isn't he smart the professional with jean reno was a much better movie about assassins the is just a movie about two fat middle aged millionaire actors who could get paid for standing around looking pretty and pretending to be smart the is so poor that i expected to see sly stallone dennis rodman mickey rourke and jean van making cameo appearances as other or fbi needless to say the has eluded the fbi for twenty five years but as soon as richard gere gets on the job it is only a few days before the is i guess the positive message of this movie is thanks to terrorists our streets are safe from assassins overall the has no redeeming qualities
