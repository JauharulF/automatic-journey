<START> this has got to be the most appalling abuse of the word comedy ever witnessed it is simply not funny and the scriptwriters have obviously just tried to use the name of the tv series in order to make a few quid at the box office this film makes a carry on seem subtle as far as sexual innuendo goes no mean feat and has all the charisma of a corpse with a complete washout i'm afraid
<START> i rented this film when my girlfriend was away hoping to see some serious military specialist action br br after 10 minutes of watching this movie i was so terrified and horrified and sick of the quality of everything in this film that i was ready to destroy the rented disc with a flame thrower luckily i find one iÂ´ve seen many bad films but this is not even bad it is total garbage and it does not even deserve to be counted as a movie here on imdb br br i feel sorry for the people who have been involved in the making of this total disgrace hope it wins some oscars though d
<START> let me clarify that this is not a good movie but i am so glad it is out there i am so glad i saw it and for the role that it plays in my dvd collection it is sublime it is the ultimate pg 13 romp it is college as we imagine it will be when we're freshmen in high school it requires so much suspension of disbelief that it may as well be taking place on mars it is so wholesome that even when it tries to be dirty it wouldn't make your grandmother uncomfortable watching it requires so little sophistication in fact thinking too hard about what's happening will get in the way of your appreciation of this work it makes me feel like i'm 12 again and that kind of experience is worth more than 9 99
<START> the next karate kid is an outstanding movie full of adventure and new surprises it has a wonderful plot and moral that tells a wonderful story hilary swank does an incredible job of achieving the role of julie i have seen the actor who plays mr and this is one of his best performances in my opinion the movie is funny and charming and i cannot stress enough about how interesting the movie is i gove this movie a 10 out of 10 i suggest the movie to anyone who likes a good movie
<START> though not a greek i have had a lifelong interest in the eastern empire its fall in was the greatest loss to christianity in its entire history yet while the easter empire is not a topic much discussed in american intellectual circles the us did not merely mimic golden public architecture the us is much absorbed in the fated byzantine historical cycle and now has faced many of the crises involving certain people of a middle eastern extraction about whom it is said that there is a slight tendency for excessive exuberance on religious matters which humbled great i wonder if the loss of the ability to speak plainly was the first sign post on the road to disaster br br john is to be credited not only for his excellent production but also for his joyful enthusiasm for the subject which is most refreshing br br not recommended for americans who like political correctness
<START> a remake of the 1916 silent film based on the 1909 novel by maurice the detective series would be made into numerous plays films and tv series in the uk the us and france over the years this 1932 version starred the smashing barrymore brothers john as the duke and lionel as detective they would also star together in grand hotel dinner at eight and several others over the next couple years sonia karen morley shows up in the duke's bed during a party in this pre hayes code film first the lights go out in the bedroom then they go out in the main ballroom then the search is on for the crook and the missing jewelry as well as other missing valuables you can tell talkies hadn't been around too long as they still use caption cards several times also watch for a new kind of safe that doesn't need a combination well thought out plot no big holes but no big surprises here either not bad for an early talkie film clever ending
<START> esther williams plays a romantically unattached water skiing secretary who longs to stop walking on the water and be some man's wife van johnson and tony martin are her potential choices for a husband despite fine aquatic sequences filmed at florida's gardens this romantic comedy is awfully stale as helmed by plodding director charles walters everything here is made to seem intentionally innocuous which doesn't lend the picture much staying power even esther's big moments in the water are not quite up to the mesmerizing leaps from her other swimming vehicles though they are preferable to the asides with the men both of whom are colorless carroll baker in her film debut as martin's disgruntled ex girlfriend is the liveliest of the bunch flimsy stuff indeed 1 2 from
<START> this movie is great stylish fun good acting i'd seen it described variously as 'lock stock and two smoking and both of which are excellent descriptions the plot is simple but it does not detract from the enjoyment carlyle is a brilliant ruffian and miller is an excellent drunken gentleman the sets and costumes are stunning and the music and camerawork are unusual for a drama' sense and sensibility it definitely is not my recommendation go see it sit back with a huge tub of popcorn and have a damn good time
<START> i recently stumbled across a tv showing of passion having missed the opening scenes ms in to be praised for having the vision and courage to bring such a strange de balzac tale to the screen i am grateful to the entire cast and crew for their parts in producing such a thoroughly fine motion picture it must have been arduous shooting so many scenes in the desert and i cannot comprehend how her trainer coaxed such a fine performance from the leopard this calls to mind another suspenseful adventure naked prey why isn't this film more well known hope i can find it on video
<START> graduation day is a result of the success of friday the 13th both of those films are about creative bloody murders rather than suspense if you enjoy that type of film i'd recommend graduation day if not i wouldn't there's nothing new here just the same old killings br br even though i've given the film a 4 out of 10 i will say that it's not a repulsive film it is watchable if your curious about it just not creative
<START> this movie has bad writing and bad editing it is difficult to follow what is going on because nothing any of the characters do makes much sense some major calamity occurs every 30 seconds as a result none of the action sequences are at all interesting the movie is two hours worth of throw away scenes which are connected merely by the fact that they share common actors this movie doesn't even have enough of a sense of humor to be a good bad movie
<START> graphically it is the same game as the first one just different levels and some new features added for fun br br the ps1 version still has an issue with giving skaters enough air for some ground tricks the dreamcast version which is rarely seen anymore was the best version of the 4 versions xbox eventually came out with a 5th with it had the clearer resolution and the skaters looked better and more detailed the ps1 and n64 could handle br br the levels are really amazingly done from start to finish like the first one the school was my favorite i enjoyed that level so much not only for the golf cart that would sometimes run you over but for the length that's what i liked about the first two games they don't make these games graphically enhanced they just focused on length of levels which is cool br br overall just as good as the first one and well worth playing
<START> this dvd is barely 30 minutes long and has dull interviews that reveal that the average has an iq of around 30 but these aspects are the least problematic here br br the real trouble is that slipknot is one of the least talented metal bands to ever sell over 100 000 units of their crap the only reason i say one of the instead of the is because system of a down are even worse much like ed girlfriends this band's music is pieced together from age old metal clichÃ©s which are to be found in both their image and their ultra dull music in fact their image is kind of fun their videos are like snippets from cheesy horror films hence they fulfill at least some purpose as entertainment br br their music however consists of nothing of quality whatsoever just a bunch of gimmicky heard them a million times before played solely at the guitar neck riffs that are in no way related to each other and yet are randomly grouped together to form songs that have no cohesion no highlights no nothing but if the riffs are truly bad then the vocals are even worse singer has a stereotypical hence uninteresting evil growl the kind 90 of all metal bands today have but that is nothing compared to when this deluded hick starts trying to sing still what could one expect rule no 39 of the nu metal handbook says quite clearly you will alternately growl and sing ignore the fact that the two styles don't mix well because most of your fans are so tone deaf they will love you even if you into the microphone slipknot are at their absolute worst when their singer starts belching out melodies br br but back to their image it's stolen copied ripped off nicked borrowed taken without asking from none other than mr bungle you've never heard of them of course you haven't you only listen to nu metal and mr bungle is quite far from that and beyond any anyway they too wore masks grotesque horror ones similar to those of slipknot i might add in the late 80s and early 90s this band whose frontman is mike patton from faith no more never hit it big because their music wasn't directed toward the average music fans to put it mildly br br so basically slipknot aren't even original in the image department they have nothing at all new to offer hence will be forgotten in several years once the masks become boring to the legions of their zit faced fans which is when slipknot will be forced to compete in the music market solely with their generic music br br speaking of mike patton it's interesting that a number of nu metal bands often site his singing as a major influence predictably and thankfully patton is not flattered by this and has denied being in any way proud to have been an influence for one of the worst metal sub genres ever br br having said that enjoy this short dvd and the cheap thrills it might provide to the untrained ear and bored eye and then polish those slipknot posters because in a few years no one will be taking care of them the poor dears br br having seen corey in the documentary get thrashed i finally understand why he wears a mask he is a blue eyed baby faced ginger looking like dave younger brother not exactly scary br br for more of my music world rants go to http rateyourmusic com collection fedor8 1 br br please punish me hard very hard by clicking no below that'll teach me
<START> from the golden period of british films this has my vote for one of the funniest of all time screened yesterday at my film society to a rapturous audience i was astonished at how well the comedy has lasted made in 1950 it is really down to the expert timing and inimitable playing from two of the finest actors britain has produced margaret rutherford and alastair sim adapted from a play by john dighton this farce is briskly handled by director frank the plot is simple a ministry mistake a girls' school on a boys' school i will always laugh when i think of this film
<START> ok so this film may not have won any oscars but it is not a bad film the original d o a is undoubtedly a better film but that does not mean this film is bad br br the film stars dennis quaid in one of his early roles when he was first becoming really famous after the right stuff made him a star and a very lovely looking meg ryan when she was still now quite famous br br this is more of an update of the 1950 film rather than a remake since the setting is different and the characters too are different the plot is pretty much the same a man this time an english professor at the university of texas at austin is poisoned and he has only 24 hours to find out who poisoned him and why meg ryan plays a young college student who tries to help him jane kaczmarek plays quaid's estranged wife in a low key but intense performance she steals every scene she is in daniel stern also in an early role before home alone made him famous plays quaid's colleague charlotte rampling is fine too in a supporting role br br the entire cast is top notch the film is stylish with a quick pace that keeps you guessing until the end br br i think this is a film that is certainly worth watching as a thriller and as a modern version of a classic film
