<START> i think the bone snatcher should go after anyone associated with this movie watching this will seem like the longest 90 minutes or so of your entire life the plot is boring and stupid there were no scenes that were horrifying even remotely if you manage to endure this fine piece of cinema art all the way to the end you're either going to be highly disappointed or die laughing hysterically i bought this movie based on some other reviews i'd read i wish i had my money back what a if you're looking for a horror movie that will hold your interest watch u turn it may be based on a kooky plot but it's full of those creepy scenes that keep you jumping from beginning to end
<START> this movie is about a group of people who are infected by a powerful man made virus they are pursued by government men into the desert br br the premise of the film is quite interesting but is hampered by the fact that the delivery is extremely boring at no point does the film engage with the viewer on any level granted the miniscule budget is a problem but is not the reason for the film's failure much more at fault is the very po faced delivery there is a great deal of narration but unfortunately the narrator has an annoyingly over dramatic voice very little seems to happen to these people and well before the end you will be rooting for the government men the sooner they kill the protagonists the sooner the movie will end a much better title for this film would have been four people run about in the desert with some stock footage of a helicopter overall very tedious
<START> the gun is probably the worst film i've ever saw the comedians direction is very poor the dialogs sounds like they were written by a 13 year old teenager the plot what plot is another suspense in which it is very hard to get into finally nothing in this movie is any good a big thumbs down to everyone involved and particularly to the montreal film festival who presented this movie in competition
<START> skeletons in the closet takes the father teenage son genre to new levels of low this is a movie that serves no purpose the plot is layed out in the first few minutes there is no suspense the characters are clichÃ© and despite plot twists that try to confuse and everything plays out exactly as you think it will halfway through the movie i could no longer stand the snail pace and started fast forwarding the movie ended exactly as i expected linda hamilton is great as always and the other actors are above average considering there seems to be a complete lack of direction if you really believe you need to see this uninspired lackluster wannabe whodunit watch it on fast forward
<START> this film started off really tense when a poor young boy is set upon by a pack of savage dogs after a tense chase he is saved by said grandpa with magic whip br br we are then introduced to a string of annoying house mates including one tart who is always half dressed during this stage the film heightens tension with strange plinky plinky background noises that had me on the edge of my seat br br i stopped paying attention for a while but when i looked back on the screen there where weird creature type things going around grunting and killing one word of advice if you are ever trapped in your home by some nutter get some cardboard boxes and a tray br br although we did skip half the film because it was totally non interesting or memorable we are now at the stunning conclusion the last surviving creature thing fights a whip duel with grandpa and his magic whip i wont say what happens here but i can say the whip battle is full of tension with aerial fights split level fights and all manner of drama br br i am now going to shove this film through the door of a neighbour i don't like
<START> first off i just watched a movie on showtime called survival island it says it was a 2006 movie with billy zane and since i like him and couldn't sleep i thought i would check it out looked interesting watched it and decided to look up on the imdb who was this new face juan pablo di pace and omg i could not believe it this movie has been renamed three and will be a new movie it is playing again in 1 hr and 30 mins on showtime channel again and this date is may 28 and or florida time you can check your showtime listings by title and see it i wont get into details so you can see the movie but at one point there is a lady in a white bikini that goes into the water taking it all off you see her naked body when she runs back out of the water you see her bottoms on funny there are a lot of other mess ups too i can't believe by coincidence i decided to look up this movie go figure wonder if the people renaming it sold it to some movie studio to put out but it is already playing on showtime ha ha good laugh i give it 1 1 2 stars c d movie
<START> errol flynn at his best as robin hood of the west fighting military red tape confederates indians and business crooks to his great and final heroic end not to forget the ever reliable o de havilland as lady mary of the west never try to link this story to the facts and the real persons it doesn't work out just enjoy it because nobody ever claimed to make documentaries when raoul walsh and errol flynn co worked
<START> when i first viewed the trailer i have to decide if this series would be perfect for my collection but after hearing about it i decided to buy it when i bought the entire collection in a box set it was absolutely what i wanted to see it was very funny and the characters were pretty cool favorite characters in the show are marion carrot the haze knights big momma and i also liked the opening and ending theme songs the show also has some great voice talents from tiffany grant jason douglas and others but however this show is one of the greatest so if you want to see something cool then this show is the one
<START> i'd give this film a 1 10 this film is devoid of common cinematic substance and concentrates way too much upon the current skin trend in bollywood movies i'd definitely not recommend teenagers to watch this movie what really makes me feel dejected is how could such an impressive banner like yash chopra films ever succumb to such an awful production they have perhaps forgotten to keep in view that there is a larger audience than adult audience too which when exposed to these sort of gross movies may wreck their growing mind set and succumb to things devoid of sense and recognition br br on the whole films must not only be entertaining but also must comprise of some sense as well certainly this film is an immense disappointment to yash chopra fans especially me myself i am really disappointed over the plot acting and everything else why can't people put in some substance that can be cherished after confronted with in the films at least for once throughout the film the point is clear i'd like to put my opinion in short horrible disappointment lot of adult material lack of sensible substance lack of normal psyche worthless could grab a or a temptations chocolate instead
<START> woody allen who i have to confess at the outset i have never been a big fan of directed this quasi documentary about the life of emmett ray sean penn a 1930's jazz guitarist whose star apparently shone for a while then quickly faded penn does a credible job in the role portraying a complicated and somewhat neurotic man not unlike allen himself which perhaps explains why woody would be attracted to this project who can't maintain relationships and whose twin passions aside from guitar playing were shooting rats at the dump and watching trains br br there isn't a great deal of consistency to the story it's narrated in a sense by a series of modern day jazz experts one of whom is allen himself who relate their various theories and interpretations of different events in ray's life the end result is a wildly inconsistent account of the life of a fictional man who seems to have been given a fairly interesting life story by his creators who probably should have done a better job with it br br jazz fans and fans of woody allen will probably enjoy this as for me the best i can give it is a 3 10
<START> rabbit seasoning is one of three cartoons that feature bugs bunny daffy duck elmer fudd in a war of words and wits about whether it's rabbit season or duck season love bugs and daffy stirring up pronoun trouble with daffy always the victim of elmer's shotgun resulting with his beak always getting dismembered then there's the cross dressing that always gets elmer in his love struck mode chuck jones and michael maltese are always favorites of mine in the writer director team category because of these hilarious hunting trilogy cartoons i've laughed at since i was a kid and at least two of them end with exclamation to bugs you're despicable can't get better that that
<START> a wealthy young man raised as a son of the gods must confront his chinese heritage while living in a white world br br although the premise upon which this film is based is almost certainly a biological impossibility and the secret of the plot when revealed at the movie's conclusion makes all which has preceded it faintly ludicrous the story still serves up some decent entertainment and good acting br br richard has the title role as the sweet natured oriental whose life is terribly complicated because he looks caucasian keeps the tone of his performance serious throughout gazing intently into the middle distance a mannerism he developed during silent days whenever his character is indecently misused he makes no attempt to replicate his classic performance in d w griffith's broken blossoms 1919 and this is to his credit beautiful constance bennett is the millionaire's daughter who makes miserable she is gorgeous as always but her behavior does not endear her to the viewer and her terrible illness in the final reel is kept mercifully off screen br br multi talented frank albertson has a small role as buddy serene e alyn warren and blustery anders play the leading stars' very different fathers while claude king distinguishes his brief appearance as the english author who befriends br br movie mavens will recognize little dickie moore uncredited playing as a tiny child br br the original technicolor of the flashback sequence has faded with time to a tint the shot purporting to be the south of france instead looks suspiciously like avalon on santa catalina island off the coast of southern california
<START> i was plagued by nightmares involving sesame street and the muppet show during my childhood i loved the programs but when i slept i'd dream about muppets not unlike the ones on tv but not quite the ones on tv br br they would speak gibberish and laugh and sing while eating each other and killing each other they'd take a bite of their cute felt flesh and it would tear apart followed by arterial bleeding nice but that was the past i love this show i saw peter jackson's meet the feebles years ago and wondered why there wasn t similar work out there well here it is as sick twisted and somehow socially potent the old vision br br if you like this show and you haven't seen meet the feebles get it on amazon or some such film source you're in for a treat br br by the way clarence would totally kick dog ass
<START> lol br br the mere fact that i start off my review with says it all i used to watch this movie all the time as a kid and even then i sensed the silliness of it all the low budget horrible acting and lame script was ever apparent back then i watched it again yesterday and just couldn't stop laughing it's so bad it's actually good lol like another reviewer said it doesn't take itself seriously there's no way one could look at this movie and say that the makers did so the soundtrack is so funny i laugh every time i hear it the is just a laugh riot it's an all out war zone in new york full of explosions and total chaos so ridiculous you can't help but chuckle at the sight of it br br other hilarious moments br br the scene with and the cop running side by side like 2 cowboys against the whole wild west was so cheesy it was funny br br it killed me how the bad guys could be shooting at and he could even drop down on one knee taking ever so careful and slow aim and not get hit lmao of course with him it was one shot one kill with his elephant handgun lol br br another hilarious scene was the end when he finally killed the leader of the gang with a rocket launcher lol destroying the whole side of the apartment building with it br br it's apparent that is all but used to losing loved ones when his new girlfriend is quickly disposed of after only a few dates the acting is so bad that you can't blame anyone that could only think that is mad at the destruction of the car lol he runs down looks at the carnage and just walks away br br again so bad it's good br br out of stars
<START> i've recently seen an not because it was a hong kong film but because i was looking for a change from the films being produced here in the us in my humble opinion i believe the film could easily compete against the action thrillers being produced here except for the traditional of hong kong film the one that still bothers me was the chief inspector character i still don't understand why there has to be a complete idiot comic relief type character even in the serious films that come out of hong kong but i can live with it when the movie is this good the characters are believable even if the situations they are in are not the story is fast paced and really sucks you in to it the real scenes for me were the two bus rides that the thief character takes overall a really solid film
