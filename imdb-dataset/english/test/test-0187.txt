<START> this movie is simply rubbish i have to say i am an expert of rubbish movies i reserve the 1 rating for movies that are rubbish but funny but this film is just tedious and certainly not crappy in a funny way but crappy in a crappy way it gets a 2 so those of you out there can distinguish between the ones that will make you laugh and the ones that will make you fall asleep there are scenes in this movie where the actors are looking at something their expressions are of amazement and there wide eyes and slack jaws tell the audience that what they are looking at is going to be profoundly amazing this simply isn't it's just a cupboard or even more desert it has to be pretty god damn awful for me to walk out let me tell you i walked out and so did quite a few people
<START> first off i would like to make it clear that i voluntarily subject myself to the viewing of terrible movies i have seen what i thought were the worst of the worst in my mind movies could not get any worse than the likes of d e b s leprechaun 6 back 2 tha hood and terror storm until i saw this movie br br the pirate movie without any exaggeration is the worst movie in the world i was informed prior to watching that the movie was indeed awful but i did not believe the allegations believe me when i tell you that this movie is simply an abomination to film br br it starts out with a 3 minute clip of a boat of pirates apparently in the middle of a battle with themselves the end splashes across the screen unfortunately it is not the actual end of the movie the movie is about an unpopular awkwardly nerdy girl named mabel who carries around a ghetto blaster and is attracted to ambiguously homosexual pirate boys she drowns and has a overly drawn out hallucination in which she stars as a scantily dressed skank who falls in love with frederic who happens to have just crawled out of the ocean he might actually be homosexual the pirate king has a ruby and diamond studded it honks and squeaks when he squeezes it br br there is singing in this movie you might have the impression that this is a hilarious musical it isn't trust me they are the worst songs that you've ever heard and by the end of the first original tune you will be searching for objects to pierce your eardrums with br br there are references to other movies in here by references of course i mean obvious rip offs the inclusion of indiana jones inspector clouseau and the lightsaber were in fact anti hilarious br br the dialogue is in its better moments painful to hear the direction is flat out awful and at one point you can see the stunt pad in the scene which isn't very well hidden at all br br in conclusion if there is even the shadow of curiosity in your mind about this movie get rid of it there are times when people want to see how bad something really is but this movie is not worth it put it completely out of your mind and never think about it again if you cherish your mental capacity then i beg of you never ever watch this movie
<START> i remember watching this movie on tv a few years back it was so bad i can only remember the scenes that just made me die laughing the only plot summary i can give you without any spoilers is picture a home movie made by college kids who were high br br spoiler alert starts here when the movie starts a guy's running being chased by the demon cop when in fact the man was really being chased by a halloween costume gone wrong a car pops out of nowhere hitting the guy who was running it sends him flying over the top of it and what does the driver do watches the man as he falls gets back in his car and drives away what kind of hair brained dolt would do that i would've at least asked if the guy was okay br br then some black guy stares the demon cop straight in the face then later tells reporters i didn't get a good look at him my sisters and i by then were almost choking ourselves to death with laughter br br then there's some scene in an alley where this girl with an afro pulls a machine gun out of her teeny weeny little purse it couldn't have possibly fit i can hardly remember certain scenes maybe it's because they were just that bad br br cops in the film can't even jump a fence and the acting is so wooden it makes planks of wood look like better actors br br all in all this movie brings shame to hollywood way more than any other flop could you have to see it to believe its sappy cheesy plot which it has none of as far as i can tell
<START> r i c c o is the stupidest film ever made i can't believe my father bought this crap this film should da never got made if this film was wide known trust me it will be on the 1 spot for imdb's worst the acting is horrible it's scary which it is why it's horror this piece of s had no horror in at at all it's an urban action which is funny because i could of swore it was a comedy when people got shot i couldn't help but laugh i am the only person who reviewed this and i hope that i am the last with this vote only i hope it make it to the 1 spot at the worst
<START> the only complaint i heard about this film was that it was slow though perhaps this is the point the two characters clash and the slow build up of tension between them is anxiety producing the intricate and subtle gestures and minimal dialog take the tension to a point where an otherwise normal argument shocks the audience istanbul and the outskirts are dreamy scenery captivating and the plot is thrilling not in that look the hero blew up yet another car and he's now flying with his motorcycle kind of way though i had chills down my spine as the characters moved in and out of each other's spheres and watched the fog engulf istanbul
<START> first of all should cameron diaz ever be allowed to act again to call that a bad performance would be an insult to bad performances that was a historically horrific performance any small chance that diaz had at being a serious actress is now completely done after that laughably horrible br br two the movie was extremely boring and not very thought provoking at all i can sit around and ponder human nature without having to watch terrible actors play out a terrible story br br third there was not a single likable character and even worse it seemed like that was done by design you were not supposed to like or feel sympathy for any character it was quite effective i wanted them all to just die to be honest aliens included kid included everyone was just one big mope in this movie everyone literally just moped around and they called it a movie you could barely distinguish the zombie employees with regular people because they all seemed like zombies br br lastly nothing really makes sense from the characters reactions and emotions to the literal story line it all just seems random this is just a really bad movie disguised and couched as a thinking mans movie which is meant to be confusing give me a break a bad movie is a bad movie and this movie was bad
<START> this movie did not give mr bachchan justice he is a great actor and i was very disappointed in the movie and there was not much plot to it matter a fact this is the first movie i have ever been disappointed in with him in it it starts out with her coming to his home with his daughter and he is a photographer he takes pictures of her in the garden has she's hosing herself down he is a sixty year old man that has nothing to do but to take pictures of this girl the movie makes no sense the whole movie is about her chasing him around and her telling him how much she cares about him then his daughter falls and he has to take this girl around places so she is not bored and is daughter finds out i just didn't think this movie was up to bachchan's standards he is better than this movie i always pictured him as an upstanding person and then i seen him in this movie and i couldn't picture him in this movie the movie didn't hold my interest at all i couldn't wait until the movie was over and you won't either
<START> brain of blood starts as abdul amir reed hadley the leader of a country called is close to death because of cancer however if he dies will tear itself apart without anyone to lead them so doctor robert grant williams one of devotees mohammed have devised a plan to take dead body to america where mad scientist dr lloyd trenton kent taylor will transplant his brain into a fresh body with a bit of plastic surgery no one will ever know he was even dead things don't go according to plan though as when the time comes to transplant brain freak assistant gor john bloom brings a dead body of someone that fell from a balcony trenton needed a strong fit living body since there's no more time he decides to use body as a temporary stop gap until another more suitable one can be found unfortunately when amir wakes up in his new body he's not very happy at what he sees i mean would you be if you found out your brain was inside a badly burned freak br br also known as brain damage the brain the creature's the undying brain this cheapo exploitation flick was produced directed by the one only al quite frankly i'm offended at the pathetic 1 5 rating brain of blood has on the imdb personally i think it's terrific fun in a so bad it's good sort of way the highly entertaining script by kane w lynn joe van rodgers is as loopy silly as they come from sloppy blood soaked brain transplants to crazed mad scientists from 7 foot tall acid scarred freaks who play with toy cars to 4 foot tall midget medical assistant's from basement dungeons to rooftop chases from car crashes to kidnaps to screaming scantily clad women from regina hair do which should get it's own mention during the opening credits to teenage girls imprisoned in the basement for blood to a laugh out loud hilarious ending which includes some deep meaningful speech it's all here brain of blood has quality cheese stamped all over it if your a fan of bad low budget exploitation flicks with a sense of fun then this film should be right at the top of your list of 'must see' films despite it's lowly 1 5 rating i am proud to admit that i liked brain of blood a lot i thought it was an absolute hoot to watch it slows down a bit at the end with a few too many shots of people wandering around doing nothing in particular but until that point it had moved along like a rocket at only 85 minutes it's relatively short it's difficult to second guess the barmy plot i just think it's loads of campy fun br br this is director adamson's masterpiece as far as i'm concerned along with dracula vs frankenstein 1971 which he made a year before this those who have seen an adamson film before will know about the none existent production values cheap special effects cardboard sets that all adds to the fun this film manages that fine between incompetence seriousness to create a memorable viewing experience i love the opening shot of which is obviously just a photo of the taj mahal in india complete with statuesque people in the foreground regina hair seems to be a separate entity on it's own it seems to change styles between shots is frankly horrendous don't get me started about her make up job either that she must apply with a a paint there is another hilarious moment when we see body has been transported to america wrapped in what looks like ordinary tin foil why is the question i asked myself why the effects are variable there's a terrible looking fake spider burned make up job is pretty bad although there is a surprisingly gory brain removal which is actually quite impressive br br the budget for brain of blood must have been practically none existent i must admit i thought lab was quite good with various computers medical instruments although the rest of the film looks cheap nasty the production values are low the music was taken from another film beast of blood 1971 the acting is awful but in a campy fun sort of way br br brain of blood may have the best title for an exploitation film ever as far as i'm concerned it's a highly entertaining piece of nonsense that i had a great time watching laughing at they just don't can't won't make them like this anymore impossible to recommend to anyone looking for a good film but bad movie lovers should enjoy it i liked it but then again i'm just weird
<START> truly truly awful i don't even know where to begin this is a perfect example of a movie that doesn't know what to do with itself i'm not sure i could even assign a category myself except that i'm quite sure it's a slap in the face of everyone every where even the unborn br br at times i thought i was watching a parody or some kind of farce at times just a bad b movie but i kept holding out for the porno which i fear is almost but not entirely non existent br br some one advised skipping to the ending i would definitely second that emotion the last five minutes are intense and certainly contain some of the best film making cgi you will ever see ever br br ed wood would be proud
<START> if you like soap series you might like this film i recommend this film to fans of dutch soap series like or even american stuff like the bold the beautiful if you don't like that stuff stay away from this movie it has the same kind of visual style the same quality of acting direction and writing the film was a big hit at home territory but wasn't sold anywhere else outside holland and belgium pretty strange for a commercial film like this br br maybe it says something
<START> abbott and talents shine in the happily childish version of jack and the the use of sepia tone and colour the music and choreography song and dance the crossing over of players from one role to another plus various other aspects of this very fine movie make it obvious that techniques and styles used for the wizard of oz are being toyed with here and that works right well for our intrepid duo there are certain other things involved that make this movie a treat for me buddy max baer jr of the beverly hillbillies uncle appearance as the cop and the giant pat costello lou's brother having been involved in the writing of the script these things help make this film fun it does however have it's down side i do think that the choreography is poorly done but the cute tunes and accompanying vocals help detract from the rather sloppy dance numbers some of the players the couple in love prince and princess to be precise aren't very good at their trade but these things are a small price to pay for an otherwise throughly enjoyable walk down the yellow brick er i mean climb up the
<START> i can't believe there are actually people here who recommend this movie this is such a slow pos going absolutely nowhere oh yeah ok it goes somewhere but you see that coming from miles away acting really really bad maybe the bartender was kind of ok editing bad i suppose the editor was told we need at least 90 minutes cause half of all the scenes could have gone in the bin music don't get me started on that the lousiest score i've ever heard who is that singing in the last scene for crying out loud directing oh my david lynch sucks but someone trying to copy him sucks even harder skip this one
<START> edward directed this shadowy movie about a murder investigation involving military personnel robert young gets to lecture us about hatred robert mitchum walks through most of this picture and gloria grahame revisits the she exhibited in it's a wonderful life it's robert ryan who gets at the heart of the matter anti he goes so deep into his role as monty montgomery imagine parents named lawrence calling their son larry that the drama sits squarely on his shoulders and he is more than up to the challenge without him the movie would be commonplace ryan has played a number of memorable villains in his day bad day at black rock billy budd but this performance put him on the map with sam levene as the murder victim
<START> fantastic series one of my few favorites miami vice and tour of duty are the other two and this series is right up there with them br br these guys aren't into wearing frilly tights they dress more like woodsmen everything about this series breathes an aire of realism artistic license or not br br it paints a picture of a europe only slightly out of the grasp of paganism as most of the villagers still have their local deities and there are satan worshipping nuns and witches and sorcerers casting spells br br however what comes to the fore most is that it's a series of it's time rather than the version of the fifties which was a lament against centralized government and the mccarthy era persecutions this series is thoroughly grounded in the 1980s bleakness and has a strong environmentalist leaning robin's protector is a nature called the hunter who often appears wearing the head of a deer and is a personification as is this robin of the green man an alternative version of osiris the egyptian god of vegetation and resurrection it is interesting to note that in these series robin in the hood isn't a person but a concept when the old one is killed a new one is summoned telepathically by the person may die but robin in the hood will live forever hence the concept of resurrection br br the music and score are really outstanding and performed by the irish formation when watching it i couldn't help but think how boring authentic medieval folk music would have been br br all this is beautifully shot in the lush forrests of wales which pass for the new forrest br br the only down side is that in the initial episodes of both series the actors have to overcome their own and convince themselves that this really is a serious work after that they get into it and the acting is great michael as the first robin the second is played by sean connery's son jason judi makes a beautiful and fragile redheaded marion phil rose as the portly and really kind hearted friar tuck ray winstone as the volatile and lovelorn scarlet clive mantle as the giant shepard little john peter williams as little john's bumpkin friend and fellow shepard and mark ryan as the ex assassin all of them giving great performances also great are the steady bad guys nicholas grace as the bug eyed scheming sheriff of nottingham and his aristocratic bumbling sidekick and robin's half brother as it turns out robert as sir guy of really cool too is fashion designer richard o'brien as the evil lord owen of cotton magician he appears near the end of the first series and later in the second br br the tithe barn in bradford on avon stood in for the sheriff's castle check it out on co uk under places of interest br br so if you're at all into mythology the middle ages romanticism don't waste your time on xena or hercules this is the real thing so go out and watch it br br alex
<START> what a great cast for this movie the timing was excellent and there were so many clever lines several times i was still laughing minutes after they were delivered i found manna from heaven to have some surprising moments and while there were things i was thinking would happen the way they came together was anything but predictable this movie is about hope and righting wrongs i left the theater feeling inspired to do the right thing bravo to the five sisters
