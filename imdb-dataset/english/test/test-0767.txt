<START> if you wondered whether disney could broadcast a show with a character more spoiled than paris more shallow than britney more vapid than jessica and more narcissistic than the girls next door wonder no more the amazing thing is selena gomez is apparently supposed to be the heroine she's also supposed to be an outcast from the spoiled shallow vapid narcissistic popular girls at school which is no more believable here than it was for hilary duff in lizzie mcguire plots range from recycled bewitched i dream of jeannie to parodies of harry potter the older boy alternates between being a magical genius and being unable to master the complexities of his own the younger boy is just another of the smart mouth wisecracking brats who have multiplied on tv like cockroaches in new york and with the same appeal the dad is the stereotypical dumb tv dad and the mom well she's not totally awful but all pales beside the hideous loathsome and yet horribly fascinating like a bad car accident spectacle of ms smug self satisfied snotty performance and again she's the heroine
<START> graphics brilliant obviously the most stunning things were definitely not given away in the trailers fight sequences move extremely fast but after watching a couple of them your eyes should be used to it and it won't seem so confusing cloud has a wide array of swords and i kinda wish things were moving a little slower just so we could see them because they were each incredibly detailed oh and we finally get to see exactly how one equips br br music brilliant also i was a bit nervous about it since from what i've seen isn't the best at writing music to go along with action remember the steal the tiny bronco sequence but it's brilliant and it fits perfectly i'm glad i preordered the ost they changed the lyrics to one winged angel though so you won't be able to sing along if you know the lyrics br br plot the first half of the movie sets up things and introduces everyone in a fairly complex tapestry but the second half is almost entirely fight sequences once all the players are in place i wouldn't call it a weak plot but it's nowhere near as convoluted as the game's plot was i think this is in an effort to avoid trying to overshadow the game and i think that's a good thing the movie is its own entity and shouldn't try to top the original in terms of sheer plot br br i admit i was kind of hoping that this movie would bring to a wider range of people but this is not a mainstream movie i was going to give it only nine stars just because it doesn't even really try to explain anything to newcomers marlene at least i think it was marlene sounded like her gives a bit of background at the beginning but it's more of a refresher than a crash course but then i realized for me this movie is a 10 10 so why should i take off points just because other people probably won't like it as well if you've played the game or are at least familiar with it you should see this movie but you don't need me to tell you that if you're not familiar with it go out and buy it sit there for twenty hours and beat it and then see the movie although even without any background it's still stunningly beautiful you just won't get any of the inside references which make up 50 of the movie that is everything that isn't a fight sequence
<START> this was really one of the most enjoyable specials that i have seen on tv he is just an incredible performer his personality shines through in each one of the songs that he does i really wish this was available as an uncut dvd so i could watch it over and over without the beeps for explicit language i have not had the chance to see him live but that is something that i really want to do now i can't forget his backup singers they really added a lot of substance and humor to the show with their campy style and flamboyant dance moves they really complement the true talent of dan i wish there were some more of the songs that are on his live cd which is also incredible it is refreshing to see someone like him perform just so incredibly personable and real i really can't say enough good things about dan and this show once again i just wish this was available as an uncut dvd
<START> i went to see this film because joaquim de almeida was in it joaquim had a fairly small part so it was good that i liked the film on it's own in fact i liked it a lot br br the film centers around two characters albert and louie albert is a shy retiring sort and louie well louie is not the story revolves around louie's request to albert to let him come over to albert's place for just a little while louie has just gotten out of prison br br albert and louie have known each other since childhood and of course they do something together there is trouble and it's albert who always takes the fall br br the action of the film is based on the adventures that ensue from louie's visit on the run is a chronicle of mad cap zany situations however bruno de almeida and scriptwriter joseph minion after hours don't always take you where you expect to go there are twists and turns that add depth to this film of course there is plenty of outright comedy but there is much subtle humor here as well br br there are some downright good performances here as well albert is played delightfully by michael imperioli he's getting fairly well days from the hbo series the sopranos br br louie is played by john ventimiglia who imbues his character with a lovable child like quality no matter what he does you just gotta love louie br br both these actors are excellent in their individual characters with imperioli you'll want to hug him and bring him home to mom ventimiglia well you won't know whether you should slap him or bring him home and not to mom p br br there are other stand out performances as well the character of rita is played by deniro yes robert's daughter the audience adored her in talking with the others who saw the film it was fun to discuss whether it was albert or louie who was their favorite of those two but everyone loved rita br br is this film perfect no i can't say that it is there were many times i wished the director had had a bigger budget to work with there were some scenes that cried out for more budgetary freedom give this guy a decent budget to work with and i believe you are going to see a film that will make you stand up and notice br br the ending sequence was a bit of a victim of budget yet budget or no budget the ending screen shot in my opinion brought together the talent of actor and director into a memorable emotionally effective scene br br
<START> this movie was recommended to me so we went to see it together i wouldn't call it a movie it's more like a combination of 10 different unfinished illogical stories which are not all that funny there're several characters in the movie who looked important in the beginning and they just disappeared from the story he's just trying too hard to fit everything in 2 1 2 hours i left the show without wondering what happened to this and that guy br br i think this movie is just an extended version of hitch padded with a lot more characters and dancing br br if this is the best movie that this couple has ever made then i'm pretty sure i'm not interested in any of his previous ones
<START> when i first read about berlin am meer i didn't expect much but i thought with the right people the right locations the right music and fashion you could at least make a trivial movie about the hip berlin everyone seems to be talking about but failed it's so ridiculously it's a complete misrepresentation of what it is going on in berlin's so called scene of course it's not all about but you should expect more from a movie that's being sold as the definite berlin movie br br and apart from all the credibility stuff it really is a bad movie mediocre acting and a rather boring plot interestingly some of the actors have proved in other movies that they are actually quite talented so it really must be poor directing skills br br don't bother watching berlin am meer unless you are 17 come from some small town in western germany and want to move to the big city after you finished school then you might actually find it enjoyable and totally cool
<START> this film goes into my worst films ever made file i have a copy of this film which i watch when i want a good laugh and this isn't even a comedy i am disappointed that such great actors agreed to be in such a piece of garbage this film is inaccurate in its portrayal of hockey offensive to canadians and i wasn't even all that impressed with the acting even the story was a bit weak if you have never seen this film you're lucky if you have i'm sorry
<START> i will admit that this movie was awful cheesy sexist badly dubbed and poorly edited but i loved it anyway i first saw this movie when i was 14 and it has stuck with me ever since fyi this is very close to hard core porn as i remember it certainly got my juices flowing this flick gives a whole new meaning to swedish erotica it is a humourous take on human sexuality as seen by hot randy female aliens who are i think just looking for some for their dying race
<START> from watching the trailer the movie looked pretty interesting the production of the movie is also pretty good it looks like they had a good budget and doesn't look like a cheaply made movie the acting ranges from good joe morton as professor simon to ok kelly as eve to bad james haven as don br br the actual content and plot of the movie is weak the movie starts out like it could become interesting and ends with a poorly executed disappointingly boring twist watching the first 10 minutes and last 5 minutes of the movie would have made this movie ok but everything in between makes this an absolutely boring movie to watch it's as though they made a short movie then tried to force it to be over an hour long by stuffing the middle with an hour of filler material br br if you want to waste a good hour and half of your life watch this movie otherwise stay away from this extremely boring movie
<START> in a word god awful too many plot holes um yeah who takes their kid to dig up a dead body in the middle of the night and what's up with his wife stealing the skeleton who does that why exactly did the shrink stab himself in the neck and that whole dog thing i mean really having sparrow narrate from the beginning also just completely destroyed the suspense for me i mean if he's narrating the story clearly he's lived to tell it so there's no chance of him getting offed where's the suspense there br br of course you expect plot holes in a film like this but there are so many i lost track of the story completely because of them what kind of name is or why did the wife dig up the body who does that or go into that crazy spooky asylum alone and where'd all those candles come from why does the writer have his po box in the freaking book i mean come on and the book just happens to find its way to the bookstore next door to the wife's bakery way too convenient oh and happy birthday honey here's a book about a serial killer what a thoughtful gift the book is like 20 pages long half of which are blank and it takes him freaking forever to read it if he's truly obsessed with this book wouldn't he have read it all in one shot br br a bit convenient for him to bump into his future wife carrying a cake about 23 seconds after being released from a mental hospital how old was he playing 36 br br was i the only one at the end rooting for the bus to actually run the guy down not good when you're rooting for the protagonist to bite it in the end br br it seems like this was written by committee i imagine that the first draft probably had nothing to do with the number 23 it seems as if they needed a gimmicky hook to bait the audience into thinking there was some supernatural thing going on when in the end it really didn't seem to have anything to do with anything i mean i wasn't expecting the godfather or anything but everything about this film was a total let down without all the numerology stuff this movie could actually have been ok instead of some hackneyed se7en knockoff br br not scary unintentionally hilarious and otherwise a total snoozer
<START> welcome to the world of bhatt the man who was once successful and got several hits with small actors like and also the multistarrer awara paagal deewana and his one film with aamir ghulam br br one sneak peak about this films are that all are hollywood remakes and some decent ones like the once which worked br br speed is a remake of cellular and that too a terrible one br br a look at the stars we have the once saleable but now out of work urmila and sanjay suri then we have the flop khan and others br br the film could be a decent thriller but many problems are there the storytelling has several cringeworthy scenes like hijacking a mobile company and many more and the stunts too are laughable while the twists in the end are too laughable the film also took a long time to reach the theatres which looses it's spark br br direction is awful music is outdated br br khan screams makes faces etc what he does always urmila is good in her part sanjay suri is not that convincing tries hard in a negative role and he is okay is horrible and he makes you laugh in a negative role surprising the same director gave him his only solo hit sophie is horrible tanushree is a non actress
<START> absolutely nothing about this movie is funny interesting or relevant besides two characters getting together at the end nothing is ever resolved and there is no plot and by the way what is the deal with the cover of the dvd it has a female ass in daisy duke shorts where was that scene in the movie no one ever wore daisy dukes in this film surprisingly enough almost all of the acting in this film is good and jack black plays a full song could be a tenacious d track don't know though those are the only redeeming values though overall it's just a waste of time
<START> this is such a crappy movie i have no idea how it got on the shelves they must have paid the movie store to make them put it there seriously the story makes absolutely no sense unless you are on some seriously heavy drugs you would definitely have to be on something in order to watch this total piece of garbage so much so that you would not care what was on the tv because you're almost in a coma the writing sounds like it was done by a 5 year old and the acting is worse than grade school plays the hideous special effects they were trying to do look so stupid what did they spend a whole 5 to make the entire movie it looks like it oh my that scene with the old woman who has an 80's hairdo and the ugly girls in the rubber suits me and my friends laughed so hard did someone actually think it was a good idea to make this into a movie i find that hard to believe
<START> i liked the understated character that laura linney played in 'love actually' and she is very good in 'man of the year' br br but wow robin williams doesn't give that much of a performance with a couple of minor exceptions this was weak laura linney may not have been miscast but either the editing raped her character or this was just a sad performance by director barry levinson br br and i think it was barry levinson that got old so many weak performances such uneven results have to be the fault of management br br christopher walken and jeff goldblum are great in supporting roles goldblum plays a sinister side with relish and walken's combination of manager and commentator for the film is wonderful br br but the story is clichÃ© the presentation looks like it could have should have been a very good picture and too many actions are half hearted the pacing story and direction all come up weak compared to say 'head office' spoof of 'secret of my
<START> i was shocked at how bad it was and unable to turn away from the disaster this made 'major league ii' and brothers oscar worthy in comparison br br i have tried to remember watching anything as bad as this in my life and was unable to come up with anything even close
