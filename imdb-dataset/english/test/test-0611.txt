<START> i liked house of dracula much more than house of frankenstein carradine is much more passable his acting isn't as ridiculous overboard as in hof the actors deliver solid enough performances the subplots eg the monster the village mobsters the village idiot the hunchback nurse etc are mixed in well so that none becomes an odd splinter as in hof better run than the stitched together hof the hunchback nurse is as likable as the hunchback in hof the doctor is very good as well lon chaney adds a classy touch with his wolfman worth watching twice a classic universal horror with that typical 1940's long lost flair especially good is the doctor's performance before after his blood had been contaminated with dracula's
<START> can a mentally challenged black youth be a catalyst to unite people in a south carolina town the answer appears to be that in spite of his handicap james kennedy understood much more than what he was given credit for and went to become a fixture in the sports scene also the film is saying how many of us overlook people with problems that can be helped if only we have the patience coach jones showed to the young man because of his own guilt in his heart br br radio directed by michael is a formula film inspired on a true story yet the movie is not a complete failure because of the inspired performances the director was able to get from his wonderful cast br br coach jones is instrumental in getting the young man who is called radio because his passion for collecting them involved in sports a passion he discovers in this retarded man who has had only hard knocks in his young life coming from a poor background radio lives with his mother who is protective of him and questions the coach's intentions radio is seen by the school kids as a mascot at first then his sunny disposition wins him the acceptance of everyone because he is a good person without an ounce of malice in his body br br the film owes a lot to ed harris and cuba gooding jr who make a great pair as the coach and radio mr harris one of the best actors of our times is never boring in anything he graces with his presence he gets the essence of the principled coach who sees the possibility to make amends for something that bothers him from his past cuba gooding jr is also at his best portraying the mentally challenged young man br br the supporting cast is excellent s one of the best actresses of her generation does interesting work as the mother of radio alfre woodard another good actress plays the high school principle with style debra winger only has a few scenes in the film br br radio while being sentimental will warm anyone's heart because it shows how we tend to see some people are in our society that we know nothing about and how quick we are to judge them michael puts a lot of ideas in the proper perspective for us
<START> as the title suggests there is a philosophical thread running through this film if a man has the talent and looks to find his way into society and money what might be the outcome if he is denied it for failing to have the x factor this question is unsatisfactorily dealt with in this adaptation of patricia book and left me rather cold along the way br br matt damon is the ripley of the title and apart from his way on a funded to europe falls under the spell of his commissioned target dickie law homoeroticism and social insecurity get all tangled up in a violent conflagration which escalated and complicate themselves for the rest of the movie law damon and the damningly pleasant paltrow as girlfriend are ok i liked philip seymour hoffman's cameo ish freddie miles the bluff society friend that ripley can never be the problem is that the story is lumpen without arc or redemption for that matter which makes it rather difficult to swallow 4 10
<START> the story of a volcano erupting downtown l a sounds like a nice plot for a disaster movie this one though is missed bigtime the movie looks chaotic has a storyline which is hard to follow or believe and the acting was very bad br br im in agreement with a lot of comments that lee jones is only good at bossing people around as a chief in some particular field in this one he is heading the emergency office being chief of such an office it naturally is a good idea to bring along your daughter to dangerous scenes clever thinking ann heche touching walls and walking in tunnels that suppose to be degrees fahrenheit yea right aside from the bad acting those factual errors make the film look almost as silly as armageddon the only good point of this movie is that there is no ben affleck to make matters even worse avoid this movie at all costs
<START> no bullets no secret agents a story that is entertaining funny and believable met some of the producers actors in this film at the theater they seemed as interesting in person as their characters on screen you may not hear about this movie on tv with high dollar ad spots but it is definitely worth checking out i have spent 8 for a movie ticket on a lot of other movies that weren't this entertaining looking forward to future projects by this production company
<START> flipping through the tv and saw that the secret life of was on gave george duran a shot at being the host i know that jim o'connor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull he really didn't seem to want to be hosting his voice overs were monotonous didn't get involved with the guests it seemed like he was interviewing guests for unwrapped and he just happened to be in the shot i don't know if george is going to get better hosting this show i doubt it because he has hosted his own show now the show did seem to pack more info in but only because we saw less of the host the formula of this show was very delicate and i fear it has now been disrupted for good
<START> for those of you who have never heard of the movie until now of which i presume there are many lucky people who haven't i'll summarise it for you ryan gosling plays the titular character of leland who also serves as the film's narrator a la kevin spacey in american beauty but without the intelligent observations on life leland goes to jail for stabbing a retarded kid to death and the movie attempts to figure out why he did it he seems to be a nice boy if not mentally absent and is portrayed by gosling with a complete lack of violence anger or agenda and if you're waiting for him to reveal his sinister side later in the movie don't waste your time it's not that kind of movie once in juvenile prison leland goes to classes taught by pearl madison ably portrayed by don cheadle who is incapable of anything but quality even when in bad movies pearl attempts to unlock the mystery of leland in an attempt to figure out how such a kid could do such a thing and so he could write a book about it later along with being a juvenile prison teacher pearl is also an aspiring author br br the relationship between leland and pearl is the driving narrative behind the film as their talks unveil past to the audience however to call it the central focus would imply that this meandering film had one it does not the united states of leland boasts an impressive cast which seems to be to the detriment of the film it seems as though writer director matthew ryan hodge don't worry that you haven't heard of him he's never done anything had to give every character a personal story arc and personality flaw in order to get the actors to play them most of these traits and stories are clichÃ©d and most go underdeveloped and unresolved br br i'll try and break them down here martin donovan and ann are the parents of the slain retarded boy i love how the movie kept calling the kid retarded never mentally disabled that part made me laugh inside they apparently have a cold relationship because all suburban marriages in contemporary cinema must be cold their other two kids are michelle williams who is apparently an aspiring actress about to attend college and jena malone who plays the same troubled teen archetype she always plays this time with a heroine addiction malone was also the girlfriend of leland which gives him his link to his victim williams' boyfriend who was orphaned and came to live with the family and is a baseball player looking to go to the same college as his girlfriend is played by chris klein he ends up doing more with his character than any of the other bit players managing to steal the movie at times lena olin is mother who seems to be perpetually sad for some reason kevin spacey also the executive producer is cold and absentee father who is a famed novelist eventually fenn will show up to put a wrinkle in story if you even care at that point oh yeah and there's a drug dealing ex boyfriend a couple of fellow and a co worker of pearl's with whom he has an affair on his long distance girlfriend with played by kerry washington br br sorry if all that synopsis and character breakdown took so long if it seemed meaningless and boring then you've just experienced a bit of what i did during the 108 minutes i spent watching the movie but the unruly supporting cast of over wrought clichÃ©s is the least of this film's crimes the biggest one is that the whole exercise is entirely pointless we aren't given a fascinating look into a troubled mind we aren't given an effective explanation we aren't given much of anything given that it sucked so much i'm gonna go ahead and spoil the ending for you so that you never have to see it leland stabbed the retard because all leland could see in the world was sadness and wanted to spare corky or whatever the victim's name was the sadness in his eyes it's like the worst emo band in the world made an album and titled it the world is sad so i killed a retard oh and leland dies in the end in a sequence so reliant of unbelievable coincidences that it would have ruined the movie if the movie didn't already suck of course he dies in the end because that made the movie so deep br br i'm giving the movie 2 stars because the actors themselves all did a pretty good job with the junk they were given the scenes with cheadle and gosling together were even interesting on some levels but to paraphrase the film itself you have to believe that movies are more than the sum of their parts
<START> millions in gold is traveling by train to the us treasury traveling along is lois lane to report on it along the way the train is attacked by masked thieves they detach the car with the armed guards in it and attack the remaining ones this leads to a vicious fight between the remaining guards and the thieves the thieves overpower them but then lois lane jumps in she beats the thieves off the train at one point using a gun but the train starts to careen out of control lois can't stop it and the thieves will stop at nothing to get the gold good thing superman is on the way br br fast exciting non stop action probably one of the best of all the cartoons just great
<START> i hated it i hate self aware pretentious inanity that masquerades as art this film is either stupidly inane or inanely stupid after the first half hour i through the dvd version and saw the same juvenile over and over and over i became angered that i had spent hard earned money for sophomoric clap trap tinting drivel in sepia or blue does not make something a movie let alone art
<START> as i said sometimes low budget is good you get to see a good movie without a lot of the extra bs that can hide an otherwise piece of crap well this was that piece of crap if anything i thought it had humor unfortunately the humor was unintentional the only half witted acting came from bill smith and his part was cut out that's a joke there was never a bill smith nor was there anyone cast who could act even gerald sucked and he's been cast in nearly 40 movies the fight scenes were comical and made me feel like i could kick all their the sound was horrible as if all sound was recorded on the set my 10 year old could have written a better script btw my 10 year old fell asleep no kidding i give a b to editing for cutting the movie to only 90 minutes 60 minutes would have been an a
<START> i had been delighted to find that tcm was showing this as i love the 1992 version with josie lawrence jim broadbent joan plowright this film had a luminous ann harding a wonderful performance by frank morgan but others' acting made the film more of a farce then the wonderful unfolding that the later film reginald owen's arbuthnot is painful to watch and you can't understand why his wife adores him i found out after watching the film that it was based on the stage play where the 1992 film is based on the book the original film also felt like it was a snippet of a larger piece and felt incomplete too bad it was such a let down
<START> i must admit that i didn't get around to seeing this movie in the theater as it was released at the beginning of a summer blockbuster season this cute little film couldn't help but get a bit lost in the shadow of multi million dollar special effects movies could it br br return to me has a lovely and simple story at its core and is extremely well directed and written by bonnie hunt who has been in a number of major pictures as an actress herself along with this one the charming story is beautifully woven with clever comedy and brought to life with superb performances by veteran as well as younger actors br br to those who say that david duchovny hasn't really had a good shot at breaking out of his fox mulder mold i agree i've seen his other film work and is by far the best thing he could have done for himself minnie driver is simply beautiful charming funny and lively in her role as grace br br outside of these two leads however you are surrounded by grace's close knit family and friends jim belushi is an absolute stitch bonnie hunt is a stable and real life force i cannot however go without mentioning the talents of robert loggia and the dearly departed carroll o'connor ironically i watched this film again on dvd only the day before he passed away this was his last film and he gave a performance that an actor of his calibre could certainly be proud to leave as the finale to a great career br br overall return to me turned what would have still been just a fun love story and grew it into a film that has become one of my favorites take the time rent this one it's well worth the effort
<START> rourke does his usual bit part as a sinister ferocious evil jerk in the same mold as in picture claire out in fifty get carter double team and the rest of the garbage he happens to be in br br he has very few lines br br of course all this is just junk rourke him and doesn't matter for his characterization as an actor still after seeing a prayer johnny handsome barfly 9 1 2 weeks year of the dragon etc etc for many years i considered rourke an outstanding smart intelligent man i think he has changed since br br he looks callous br br he went about with gloomy looks despair inhabited his breast and made the man a perfect pest the example br br i had absolutely no other reason to watch this dull movie except that rourke was in
<START> about five years ago my friend and i went to the video rental store to get something to watch my friend saw space truckers on the shelf and so we got it once we got home and started watching it we realized what an absolute piece of crap it was a beer can floating in space a guy taking a dump in a toilet a guy with a mechanical dick who tries to arouse a women by saying whizz whizz wtf the dumbest stupidest most retarded horribly throne together piece of trash my eyes have ever been exposed to my friend and i still refer to it as the worst movie we have ever seen only one other movie has come close to its crappiness and that would be the stupid jackie chan flick the if you eyes ever see this piece of junk on the shelf at your video store proceed to do the following 1 take it off the shelf and throw it to the ground 2 stomp on it for at least 30 seconds 3 proceed to set it on fire in a contained facility bathroom stall 4 lastly take it to your local hazardous waste management facility immediately so that it may be properly dealt with br br stay away from space truckers
<START> as kids movie it is great for the family it just sucks i was truly hoping for something like the goonies which is a great film for all ages this movie was just geared too much to the kids with the silly script and characters calling each other little names like booger breath alan cummings was however a delight and why do people compare willy wonka to this movie just because there is a theme song closely resembling the willy wonka song doesnt make this film anything like willy wonka
