<START> a really realistic sensible movie by ramgopal verma no stupidity like songs as in other hindi movies class acting by nana patekar br br much similarities to real
<START> dr wants to save his son julio who's dying of heart disease he decides a heart transplant with an ape will cure his son no i'm not kidding he does the transplant and somehow his son changes from a frail guy into a muscle bound man with a dime store mask that sort of resembles an ape naturally he gets out kills men tears the clothes of women and wreaks havoc this is all inter cut with the boring romance of police lt arturo martinez and lady wrestler lucy we also get pointless female wrestling sequences that add nothing to the plot it all ends by copying the end of king kong this is obviously a pretty stupid movie the plot makes little sense there's the gratuitous female nudity a staple of any exploitation film and very graphic gore that looks laughably fake except for the open heart transplant still this does have merit the whole cast takes everything dead serious and actually aren't too bad as actors also the dubbed in dialogue was for a film like this well done and interesting with surprisingly good dubbing also i saw an excellent dvd print with bright strong color which helps we're not talking a classic here but an ok exploitation movie
<START> if this movie were in production today it would probably have the christian right wingers screaming 'child porn' it is far from a great film in fact it is rather pedestrian however if you have an imagination and a fond remembrance of youth and first love i recommend it
<START> never been kissed gives drew barrymore the chance to do something that maybe 70 of us would like to do go back to high school and make some necessary corrections actually the first time for me was bad enough and at my age i doubt i could pull it off the way drew does br br of course the reason could also be that once we leave high school it's like leaving a cocoon and we have to deal with the great big unfriendly world out there i've known a few in my life who would go back and stay if they could in fact there is a law and order episode which explores the dark side of this same situation a girl looking young enough to pull it off goes through high school at least three times and kills the person who stumbles on her secret br br with drew though it's an assignment she's a copy editor for the chicago sun times who yearns to be a reporter publisher garry marshall who plays the part like donald trump took over the sun times gets this brilliant idea and just sees in barrymore a young enough looking person to pull off the masquerade br br high school the first time was bad enough drew was not the most popular then and she's not doing better the second time around that is until brother david arquette also goes back to school and helps her over the rough patches br br of course this raises a whole lot of issues for drew peer pressure from two sources job and school what's a girl to do br br never been kissed is a light and charming comedy which to its credit skips over the opportunity to be crassly exploitive and gives us some good entertainment drew is very funny and sweet and her performance in moments of stress for her character moves nicely into pathos michael vartan as her english teacher is the kind i wish there were more of in the education field and leelee sobieski and jessica alba play a pair of the empty headed cool kids that drew tries so desperately to hook up with br br still it doesn't inspire me to return to high school
<START> the acting is good thats the positives out of the way is shallow and superficial almost all the characters are middle class and english the gay men are depicted as fickle sexual predators aiming to use children in their empty lives this film could only appeal to people who know heath and would get minor satisfaction from pointing out any landmarks there is no time to engage with the characters and has a result you really don t care about them catherine tate at the height of her comedic fame stars as a woman seeking a divorce from her husband and on screen for about the same time as her nana sketches failed to convince however if she had said what a f liberty i would have agreed br br i'd rather take a walk in the park unintelligent rubbish
<START> don't torture a duckling is an absolutely stunning giallo diversion for lucio fulci unlike other subgenre heavyweights like mario bava and dario argento fulci takes a decidedly gritty grounded and socially perceptive approach to the giallo narrative in this film there is nothing glamorous about the child murders and borderline pedophilia a gutsy subplot for 1972 going on here and fulci wisely shoots with a staid and lugubrious eye avoiding flash melodrama and directorial histrionics the proceedings are punctuated by gory and instantly mind searing set pieces that are bolstered even further by fulci's jarring sense of the deeply disturbing witch killing scene in particular with its bald faced brutality feels like a snuff film composer riz ortolani bookends these carnage filled scenes with ferocious reverberating string blasts br br the film is capped by a simultaneously lyrical and violent conclusion wherein theology morality fanaticism and superstition collide it is a deeply effective ending that has the capacity to leave the viewer in a befuddled and disarmed torpor br br fulci couldn't have picked a better location for this film don't torture a duckling was photographed in and around the ancient city of italy as continues to modernize to this day highlighted by its shift from an agricultural economy to an industrial one it is grappling with its sponsored reputation as a receptacle for mysterious paleolithic ghosts the anxieties of the real life are reflected by the characters in the film who wearing their christianity on their sleeves confront any exotic fringe tradition namely witchcraft that strays outside of the norm br br interestingly enough was also used as a stand in for jerusalem in mel gibson's the passion of the christ if anything this adds even more potency to fulci's message catholic guilt and grisly slayings are such a resonant combination
<START> you don't have to spend much time watching this made for tv movie or series pilot or whatever it was intended to be to figure out just what lies in store the incredibly bad musical score makes its debut from the start seriously if this isn't the worst theme i've ever heard i certainly can't remember it while the acting talent is available here from jeff bridges to carl vera miles and sal the writing is atrocious and the story is contrived filled with insipid stereotypes and an obvious ripoff from ken kesey why must hollywood always present tales from the sixties as if the so called hippies were all unidimensional morons it's too bad that such an interesting era in our exceptionally conformist social experience is generally depicted by out and out garbage so that the least offensive of the genre is now accepted as reasonably authentic when almost none of it comes even close to the way things really were the best i've seen to date is a memoir called looking back by a guy named becker but who else has even heard of it no one in hollywood that's for sure they're too busy pushing tripe like this groaner of a movie to bother with reality
<START> florence vidor stars as the daughter of a strict bible toting father who throws her out of the house when gossip taints her name in the big city she finds the dying wife of her own brother the two had secretly married and raises their child on her own years later she goes back home to confront her family br br this old melodrama is heavily larded with fascinating feminist themes circa 1921 but sounding remarkably modern some of it is laid on with a trowel as the father theodore roberts gives his eyebrows a real workout but it's well put together dramatically and lovingly composed and shot by cinematographer henry sharp
<START> plots with a view of 2002 is a delightful little comedy like only the british could do it the film's sense of humor is both mildly morbid and black and yet very lovable and sometimes very slapstick ish it's the only film by director nick i've seen so far and while i am not intending to watch any of his other films at the moment i'm not a big fan of romantic comedies this one is highly enjoyable and very funny the film takes place in a little town in wales where betty rhys jones brenda blethyn is married to the town's drunken and adulterous major robert pugh the local mortician boris alfred molina has been desperately in love with betty since their childhood but has always been too shy to confess his love to her apart from being desperately in love boris has some other problems as the eccentric american mortician frank christopher walken has opened a funeral flourishing business in the same town the film's odd very british wit should amuse everybody with a sense of humor and the story sometimes becomes quite bizarre also plots with a view profits from a wonderful cast brenda who has already proved herself to be a funny lady in 2000's saving grace plays the lead and she is once again very funny and very lovable in her role alfred molina who plays her shy admirer delivers a great performance as always and robert pugh fits perfectly in the role of betty's sleazy husband beautiful naomi watts is also great as the husband's i'm becoming a bigger fan with every film i see her in the greatest role however is played by the incomparable christopher walken one of my favorite actors walken is brilliant as he always is in the role of the eccentric mortician who arranges funerals that are quite unorthodox overall plots with a view is a vastly entertaining little british comedy that i highly recommend
<START> i understand that the budget was low on this film but come on this is really terrible film making the script is just plain awful and that was the free part the effects aren't bad but this film plays out like a conventional r rated movie with lame scares and cut away violence rather than a no holds barred unrated gore fest that was intentionally made for video who were these guys kidding like this would have been released in theaters br br the acting is terrible the editing another free aspect of the film is beyond amateur and the plot as i said before leaves little to be desired there's nothing original about the film gore fans avoid this one to the filmmakers try for something original next time or stop making movies all together you're not good at it people hate a trashy rehash especially one of such low caliber avoid it isn't even worth making fun of
<START> in the animated series br br aeon flux was an amoral rebel that was completely detached from everything and everyone she was cruel selfish loving unpredictable witty caustic confident sarcastic lethal ambiguous all at once the original aeon had layers upon layers of depth she almost never allowed her personal emotions to show through the original plot was deliciously ambiguous and thought provoking you could never tell what motives were aeon was a militant anarchist whereas trevor was a radical idealist because of this they could never have any semblance of a stable relationship br br in the movie br br aeon flux works for the and her political motives and personal motives are very clear she was pretty loving vulnerable easily emotional and very predictable the aeon in the movie had one layer of depth at most the plot was obvious and contrived everything is completely laid out for you from the beginning there was virtually no conflict between aeon and trevor at least in terms of personal philosophies the only conflict between them was that they were on different sides br br the movie was a horrible disappointment to me i felt betrayed they took the idea of one of my favorite animated characters of all time squeezed all the depth and personality out of her and pumped her full of hollywood clichÃ©s the essence of the animated series was completely lost in this movie br br the only reason i'm not giving this movie a 1 is because the visuals were incredible it was neat to see some of the familiar animated scenes like the fly in the eye done with cgi
<START> this film has been lauded to the point of the ridiculous american movie is a boring documentary about a boring person so ordinary you'll find equivalents on just about every corner in america it takes a long hard look at a guy who's failed at just about everything in the interest of making an independent movie or two were his failures for other than his own selfish pursuits or were they in the name of real art the movie might have had a chance america has an abundance of better stories to be told this one should be flushed and many critics have good reason to be ashamed two thumbs up indeed
<START> i happened upon this by chance i was at my friends house and he had just started watching it so i sat down thinking we would shoot the breeze whilst this was playing in the background however within seconds i was immersed in this docu drama and we both spent the rest of the time completely focused on this and not saying a word to each other br br i never knew the tale of the the first solo around the world yacht race let alone the tragic events of one man's attempt against the odds which set out to be his redemption for all of his misfortunes in life but ultimately ends up becoming an example of them having not known of the story i did watch this with the same fervor as i imagine those who were reading about the race at the time it actually was happening engulfed in what was taking place and eager for more information hoping the lone amateur was going to pull it off against the odds and beat the pro's which makes the shocking twists of the story all the more tragic i felt like i was living the story br br the story is told with great care and the interviewees have clearly had time to reflect on the tragedy which gives great insights but is also contrasted nicely by the archive footage of interviews at the time of the tragedy the recordings and photographs of the lone sailors is also excellently used and the insights into the minds of the sailors and how solitude was affecting them was superb br br i'm shocked that this story isn't more widely known or has been turned into a movie but also thankful thankful that we have this drama documentary to tell the tale from those who knew the man instead of some wishy washy movie adaptation and thankful that i caught this gem of a film by pure chance br br it's a must see whether you like documentaries or not
<START> this sequel to the above and the final entry in the kharis series is slightly more enjoyable on the whole but it's also more contrived hell we even get a singing barmaid hostess peter coe is easily the least charismatic of the various egyptian high priests we've seen during the course of these films and martin kosleck as his henchman seems uninterested in the proceedings kurt katch then is saddled with a ridiculous accent as the man who discovers the newly reincarnated princess ananka the latter in the form of virginia christine later a much used character actress gets her most substantial 'role' and indeed the sequence of her resurrection from the swamps is a highlight not only of this film but the entire series unfortunately here too chaney has precious little to do as once again the emphasis is on ananka as i've said his mummy to which he returned most often at universal apart naturally from his signature role of the wolf man remains without a doubt his least memorable monster for the studio
<START> carrot chairman of the board and his at t commercials are living proof that fly blown fecal matter is available in the color orange not freely available however as hbo charges for such garbage the saving grace of is that it surely fills suicide hot lines across the country perhaps providing employment for thousands of telephone therapists who lost their jobs when recovered memory treatment was discredited although sadly carrot top probably contributes to his sponsor at t's bottom line with the increased phone traffic from devastated hbo viewers i can visualize the hordes of traumatized tv viewers phone in one hand and fully loaded 45 auto in the other hand dialing out of last minute desperation before walking off the plank of life to escape the specter of orange haired monster echoing in their synapses like the agony of searing irreversible swelling
