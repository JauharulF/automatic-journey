<START> the only reason i bought the dvd was to satisfy my curiosity about the scene when liz kim basinger strips to the music of joe cocker you can leave your hat on that was the best part of the whole film not because the scene was any good only the song i am not saying it was a terribly bad film just not that good disappointingly so br br especially when the exploration of male and female sexuality could have been expanded upon instead of expanding on the dangerous side of lust obsession and infatuation and where it can lead to it drags its heels from one idea to the other for example when john played by rourke is able to leave her on the top of the big wheel liz kim basinger is unconvincingly rattled at the bizarre experience courtesy of john's sense of humor but less rattled at his sexual exploits involving the ever willing liz and like one reader mentioned that for a woman to enjoy sex she has to experience the dangerous side is unconvincing this dangerous side is not exploited enough in the film and one gets a sense of anti climax from the view point that it all could go horribly wrong the theme of bondage makes an appearance often but only just takes one to the brink of danger and then all goes well is the film sending the message out that this kind of foreplay is fine if the film was making a point about the pitfalls of bondage and by extension the ugly ramifications of sad masochism then maybe it would make a good moral point instead the film awkwardly jumps from one sizzling scene of rourke feeding basinger and her to another in a film that could have been good it falls flat on its face because it does not expand and extend the themes the film is maybe trying to relate thus for me it doesn't have a plot nor a theme just a mixture of ideas
<START> this is one great sweeping movie you will remember for a long time it is about history america the change of times teddy roosevelt morocco a kidnapped american and her children and the leader of the with the blood of the prophet in his veins br br this movie is based on a true story like jesse james was a banker an american was kidnapped in morocco and the marines went part way to the shores of to rescue him so much for that you know hollywood sean connery is the berber chieftain and muslim leader candice bergan is the guy who was kidnapped along with her two kids the son is rex harrison's grandson simon no less john huston is secretary of state with a great john huston style straight line at a state dinner watch out for it brian kieth is teddy roosevelt all american all male a character that is an interesting commentary as modern as today br br the sweep and beauty of the desert and morocco are shown beautifully in the cinematography in this film which will stay with you a haunting and compelling memory the score is as sweeping and exotic as the images br br this is a story about two cultures both with grand ideas and historic pasts struggling for the future without an idea at all about one another in any event the struggle comes down to might versus ingenuity br br then at the last there is the little boy remember the little boy what do you think he thinks
<START> if you thought nbc's 10 5 was stupid you'll be happy to hear that fx reached into the bowels of made for tv hell and squished it's fingers into this pseudo post 9 11 poop not only was the plot stupid it was a complete ripoff of 24 and a bad ripoff at that the filming style was the now overused docu action look complete with cuts to grainy b w footage i'm not quite sure what that means but it sure sounds like something the dp said to the director before filming i don't know what they were going for here but it reminded me of the guy at the office who thinks presentations with fly ins and animations are cool br br the story is that 6 terrorists take over a nuclear power plant in southern ca that's right nuclear power plants where hundreds of people work where there's security precautions up the ying yang for the sake of reality they put 2 off duty in the mix because they'd be able to stop 6 people right six i mean even bruce willis had to deal with more terrorists over at that stupid nakatomi building br br leslie hope tv's teri bauer plays a officer who has problems talking on the phone after she's shot in her bullet proof vest her voice sounds like a sally tv ad whiny and monotonous her character is only a plot device and after she performs her one small duty she is promptly disposed of yes teri bauer is died br br bruce greenwood stars as fbi s a c tom shea who continually points out how he punches foreign diplomats in the face his boss is out so nobody over at the dept of homeland security believes his of the situation he's the sensible one out of a group of paranoid public officials afraid of taking blame for any type of catastrophe he's calm he's strong he's boring br br there is absolutely nothing redeeming or entertaining about meltdown ok well maybe teri bauer getting died was pretty unnecessary and funny other than that nothing redeeming
<START> this isn't so much a review of a tale of two sisters as it is a discussion of some of the smaller plot details so i advise you not to read this review if you haven't seen the film because doing so will absolutely ruin a few surprises for you br br in a way a tale of two sisters is far from original at least from a purely superficial aspect some of its iconography is taken straight from ring or dark water while the storyline itself especially what calls the rubber reality aspect of the narrative is reminiscent of films like fight club lead character interacts with someone created in their mind mulholland drive character creates alternate reality in a fugue as well as other minor aspects of lost highway jacob's ladder and basically every film under the sun dealing with mental illness plus amenabar's films the others abre los ojos memento particularly with regards to the torturous nature of memory et al thankfully all these similarities do not detract from the film's overall emotional impact and i personally found a tale of two sisters an extremely moving and rewarding experience br br many people have commented on the confusing nature of the narrative but i personally found the storyline to be fairly self explanatory even if it is in part portrayed in a non sequential manner the narrative only becomes confusing for some because midway through the final third the story switches from a purely subjective setting ie soo warped perception of reality to an objective one with a flashback at the end explaining the origins of soo nervous breakdown and subsequent mental illness the shift in emphasis is bound to throw some people off guard but structurally i found it somewhat reminiscent of aforementioned mulholland drive even though we're not dealing with a character's perception of reality via a dream but instead their own schizophrenic tendencies something which in turn reminded me of another lynch movie lost highway to be honest i don't really regard a tale of two sisters as a horror movie as such but rather a tragic story of a family's breakdown as well as an honest look at a character's mental illness and i hasten to add that fans of psychoanalytical cinema are going to love this film br br that aside the cinematography in a tale of two sisters is incredible and visually this is one of the most beautiful films i've seen this side of wong kar wai's 2046 the performances are also fantastic without exception and i expect to see more of the four lead actors in the future not to mention the music but then east asian films without a great soundtrack seem to be few and far between these days br br it's very likely that some people will look past the finer artistic points of a tale of two sisters and simply dismiss it as yet another asian horror film oblivious to its aesthetic beauty and honest psychoanalytical approach but then each to their own if you can ignore some of the film's platitudinous aspects and simply take it for what it is at heart ie an extremely tragic heart breaking story then i see no reason not to recommend it
<START> you'd hardly know that a year later mgm put norma shearer in the divorcee which glows with mgm technical know how how far they came in one year cheney is a very stagey early talkie the camera hardly moves shearer is her usual charming self and rathbone does well in a romantic leading role they are all very careful to speak clearly and slowly into the microphone source which does against a naturally flowing dramatic scene but the play is a sturdy and fun so one can enjoy oneself if one's expectations are not too high oh by the way the plot involves a ring of upper class jewel thieves who infiltrate themselves into society to prey on their victims there are some clever twists in the script and true love conquers all an oscar nom for best screenplay adaptation
<START> the story of dirty fat filth like middle age woman who lives out of society be knowing as the filthiest woman ever lived can someone take her the crown there is one couple the nice film for people who don't like ordinary pieces of comedies and don't mind some disturbing sense of humor i was very surprised seeing some scenes and love theirs pungent kind br br
<START> silly and violent thriller that is a rip off of 'deliverance' but without any charm and intelligence the plot is ridiculous and the cast seems to be tired and anxious to be free of this obnoxious entry this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way it's a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this
<START> olivier film stars asia argento as a woman who had a relationship with michael madsen madsen is a business man who's in financial trouble in desperation he is going to sell his share of a business to a company called golden eagle a company from the far east as madsen begins his moves away from his company asia argento returns to his life the pair had a torrid love affair that included her doing business favors for madsen with said golden eagle once argento enters the film the film follows her as we see the tangled web she's woven and how the complications spin dangerously and violently out of control br br i'm not a fan actually i was quite bored as the film seems to go from pillar to post for much of the first hour during which i kept wondering what the point was other than to provide a meaty role for argento argento daughter of director dario argento and a director in her own right is a unique actress at times stunningly good she is more often then not going to give you a quirky off beat portrayal of a damaged human being sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't i don't think it completely works here mostly because the script is too complicated to support it i didn't care what was going on so her wounded girl just rubbed me the wrong way she seemed more nut job than anything else i'm not blaming the actors but writer director assayas who has once again constructed a complicated tale with the sort of parts actors love to tackle but which leave audiences scratching their heads because they they don't really work br br if you must try it on cable
<START> saboteur is a 1942 film partly aimed at getting american support for the war against nazi germany propaganda or not it's great entertainment the leading actors are robert cummings and priscilla lane although director alfred hitchcock wanted gary cooper and barbara stanwyck in the roles which would have given the movie more stature this is a good movie anyway with robert cummings and priscilla lane bringing their own style to the characters as in other hitchcock movies we see the director's disregard for the socially suave and the well heeled he often portrayed spies and foreign agents as nice upper class folk who at the same time sneered at democratic values and concepts such as guilty until proved innocent these upper crust traitors are the last the police pursue or even suspect hitchcock had a lifelong distrust of the police he wanted to elevate the regular guy the and the fellow who doesn't take himself too seriously one can see him wanting gary cooper as an icon in the frank capra mold nevertheless bob cummings puts his own stamp on the boy next door and works well in the role priscilla lane as the spunky female lead comes off as the all american girl who can handle herself quite nicely when put to the test robert cummings as defence plant worker barry kane is framed for a bombing that kills his best friend this leads to a cross country chase scene reminiscent of other hitchcock heroes on the run hitchcock repeats some of the well established formulas from previous films the reluctant female who is drawn into the action e g madeleine carroll in the 39 steps and risking his life to evade the authorities who are on his heels we view scenes of america as kane tries to find the real culprit in the bombing he stands accused of we see rivers bridges backwoods cabins truckers the hoover dam and finally new york city new york is a fitting backdrop for the climax as we go from rockefeller center to the ocean liners with a cut to the ship normandy and the grand finale on the statue of liberty great movie with uninterrupted action don't miss it
<START> certainly one of the most hilarious films of all time excellent original music clever heady it's hard to be articulate about something this good there isn't one character that you don't instantly love to watch there's trouble in the black room my name is rufus the lines thrown away left and right are classics themselves recalling caddyshack anchorman repoman dolemite any comedy whose dialog is not of the formulaic set up punchline variety called you tasteless my organization is pro integration where's lopez in my head' they don't sound brilliant until you hear them in the context of the scene this movie will eat your brain it's too good i've read reviews calling this film racist which couldn't be farther from the truth every scene is gold from the cereal commercial to the brothers in the black room meeting to that haunting trumpet in the closing scene one word genius
<START> honore de balzac's genuinely bizarre short story on which this was loosely based gets an unsettling albeit breathtakingly filmed treatment here as a sort of forbidden love blossoms over a period of time between man and beast in the early part of the nineteenth century thin and very blonde english actor ben daniels plays the role of a young soldier during the napoleonic wars who gets lost whilst escorting an exiled french painter across the rugged dangerous landscapes of the gobi desert after literally going around in circles the two men give up ever trying to reach civilization again thus each decides against better judgment mind you to go their separate ways with the promise of both returning to the same exact spot when and if a water source is actually found this is of course how daniels' character comes to encounter the creature a wild and untamed female leopard and eventually form a seemingly unbreakable bond or rather love with it that both saves his life and nearly destroys it by film's end the exquisite cinematography minimalist dialog somewhat demented story which arguably hints at possible bestiality in about three scenes are what ultimately lead professional critics to pan the film as pretentious and overlong rubbish while it is a film that isn't exactly for all tastes mind you i find it to be a subtle though decidedly left of center mixture of fantasy with a surreal and sumptuous atmosphere highlighted by the fact that for more than half of the flick actor ben daniels is forced to perform opposite a wild animal four leopards were actually used as opposed to just the one which plain common sense and a slight knowledge of theatrics dictates that it must have been a maddening and very difficult job that he managed to pull off quite brilliantly if you ask me overall i think that passion in the desert takes a while to warm up to but if you're a patient person who is willing to give it some time it does in fact cast it's uniquely original spell over you in spite of everything and unlike most platonic human and animal relationship stories it need not require a talking pig monkey or shaggy dog to keep your interest throughout out of
<START> yep it's me again mr 'i sit through crap so you don't have to' br br what do you think this is about could it possibly be about a woman who call a sex line and arrange to meet bachelors in a secluded area then her cross dressing boyfriend comes along and slits their throat with razor before they make off together with his cash wow what a guess and if i tell you that the cop who is put on the case is forced to team up with a sexy assistant da to nail these suckers what conclusion will you come to do you reckon the sexy da will go undercover wearing a flimsy red dress to an attempt to meet the drag queen but then end up being kidnapped and having to be rescued by the maverick officer who has already handed in his gun and badge zing you get 10 points br br frankly this film bored me to tears why do people insist on making this kind of rubbish its a waste of our time their time and yet they still carry on regardless filming a movie that no one gives an iota about if it has any redeeming features there's the fact that it has some of the prettiest ladies i've seen in a motion picture for a while i hope they spent what meagre wages they earned on plenty of botox and they'd look great on the cover of vogue or perched on the top of a car in a bikini they should just leave acting to the professionals like shannon tweed br br talking about future careers i ran into the director the other day he sure does whip up a tasty chicken burger meal i must say too that the uniform really does suit him i asked him about 'party line' and his eyes went to the floor before he mumbled something about extra fries oh well guess it didn't quite work out never mind they're letting him take over the drive thru tomorrow hurray 1 10
<START> what the hell is this that was my first reaction to this film actually my first reaction contained more swearing this isn't star wars star wars is space battles this movie has none star wars is the force this movie only has a retarded witch with a magic ring star wars is lightsaber battles this movie hasn't got any battle worth mentioning star wars is humor this movie isn't star wars is a galaxy far far away this movie has horses in it besides all of this how did lucas get the insane idea to let a five year old baby do the leading role big big disappointment do you like star wars don't watch this 1 out of 10
<START> the silly saying you can't touch this surely applies here with all the clone horror and sci fi films coming out along with all the inferior remakes it's hard to find anything worthy of 2 hours of your time that's why i always rely on the classics that scared the out of me when i was a pre teen br br the thing is without an ounce of doubt in my mind the goriest sci fi horror classic that john carpenter or any other director sorry even you mr spielberg ever made what really gives it power though is not the gore it of slime and blood and god knows what other fluids but rather the sense of dread isolation and distrust it fosters in the characters and the viewer br br you can't get more remote than antarctica and in this howling freezing white setting is where the story takes place several americans researchers and military men are stationed there one day they witness a siberian husky dog running for dear life from gun wielding norwegians before they know it the american outpost is battling a mysterious creature that can imitate any creature it wants it may morph into disgusting slimy bloody shapes before it's finished but once it's finished if you didn't see it in progress you can't tell it among humans or other normal earth animals br br kurt russell keith david wilford brimley richard donald carter thomas waites and charles are just a few of the fine cast this film is the reason why horror can be a great genre it actually still scares me the alien blood jumping out of the petri dish when the hot wire touches it still makes me jump br br still the scariest of them all
<START> well i only caught the tail end of this film on hbo just the final 10 minutes or so but i must say that it contains probably the most laughable depiction of distance running ever put on film i'm a serious distance runner and a dedicated fan of the sport and i've sat through many painful demonstrations in movies before however nothing could have ever prepared me for what is shown on screen in the final 10 minutes of this movie it literally defies belief the depiction of the runners is even more ironic considering that african runners completely dominate the sport and they are elegant and graceful the female protagonist shuffles along like an overweight pregnant woman and her highly trained male supporters are no better well into the race this alleged world class runner is surrounded by pudgy overweight people many of whom are walking i find it interesting that the director decided to have her lead the female competition yet near the end she is shown passing people who look like they're staggering along on two broken legs are we to believe that this amazing stellar athlete has only overtaken a crippled person at the very end of the race maybe the director just thinks that female runners can't run faster than 12 minute miles and he has obviously never heard of athletes like paula radcliffe or br br even if you aren't a running fan you'll be astonished by the insanely inaccurate portrayal of running and this movie is only watchable as unintentional comedy here is a note to the director the next time you decide to make a movie about a sport it might be worth it to hire at least one person who actually has observed that sport in action
