<START> b kennedy tried to make a sequel by exaggerating and gargantuan leftist western not as leftist as the g kennedy sequel that came after this one br br this is the ugliest film of the two ugly looking it is slapdash b kennedy made it without having the genius for that hundreds of hundreds of mexican hundreds of women a desert barren landscapes a largest scale br br everything in this clumsy sequel likable only in a weird way is phony br br the movie itself is very ugly looking brynner who made the best part in the first film doesn't look good at all in this one br br rey plays a priest he will be a political leader in the next sequel of the franchise br br it is true that when you have that many characters you may not need a very interesting storyline sometimes e g brynner meets mcqueen then they pick other or b spencer meets coburn etc it's fun to see where and how they'll meet the rest of the crew etc but you need at least these several characters unfortunately burt kennedy's installment is not very good at that br br return of the seven 1966 begins with a bullfighting vin and chris meet there they decide to rescue the third survivor of the original who belongs to a huge group of 300 abducted by the mexican bandits we find out the name of appealing petra chris must constitute again a small here we have a dirty dozen chooses his men from the convicts another member of the commando is a womanizer who will take good care of the wives left without husbands the sexual humor is especially displeasing and distasteful in this film it strives to seem smart and spicy it is simply boorish and dumb and gross br br the choosing of the members of the small army was one of the greatest joys in the mcqueen film unfortunately in the first sequel there is the most unmemorable of the three crews assembled under the magnificent name br br robert fuller makes a lousy vin oates is the smiley womanizer br br in this attempt a mexican revolutionary leader has a gargantuan kidnaps 300 and uses them to build a village and a church in the memory of his lost sons useless to say that this insane mexican revolutionist doesn't equal wallach's part in the first film b kennedy bets exclusively on camp and stuff ugly landscapes a thunderstorm gargantuan lightning a desert a huge battle between the emancipated and the revolutionary of course return of the seven 1966 completely abandoned the good sense of the mcqueen film br br what is particularly shocking is that this sequel came quite quickly after the original everything changed meantime in the way of making westerns br br both the sequels look weird
<START> robert lansing plays a scientist experimenting with passing objects through solid matter but he goes too far one night and unintentionally makes himself four dimensional atomic age fantasy is rather charming in a very cheesy way perhaps it was considered a thoughtful sci fi in its time with psychological overtones yet seen today the film is mildly overbaked and naive it's a camp fest tailor made for tv's late late show wooden performances by lansing and lee meriwether barely rate as one dimensional though patty duke playing a cute brat pre miracle worker gets a colorful memorable exit br br from
<START> i for one was very anxious to watch this movie br br though i knew it was going to be another type of movie in the style of revenge of the nerds i was still impressed br br there is plenty of truth to the fact of this type of learning and believe very strongly that it should be allowed in a new style of schooling br br conventional teaching methods do not always teach students what they need to know or should know or want to know br br this approach to teaching should be further sought out in true academic courses br br while there still was too much of the partying scenes it obviously had to be thrown in there for hollywood's sake of making a comedy about college even though we all know that life isn't really like that by any means br br a touch unbelievable still funny and with a killer ending br br awesome ending crucial to the entire story and very surprising br br without the final scene the movie would have been half as good br br i liked this movie and it didn't have to have overly amounts of swearing or nudity or gross out jokes for it to be good br br great crew and cast story and even the generic typecasting of the obligatory hampton frat members was well done br br american pie 1 2 3 and american wedding or whatever clones it makes doers not measure up to this by 1 3 br br far better than most comedies about first year college with no demeaning stupid jokes to make somebody throw up with br br i liked it even though it was simple it was interesting and even had heart my only regret for watching this movie is that it wasn't longer
<START> a fairly typical australian movie where the underdog saves the day inspite of himself i guess there is no real reason to see this pic if you have seen the castle or the dish it still leaves you with a positive feeling at the end and it as good or better than most hollywood stuff
<START> bardem is great actresses are great but amenabar did not have to do it like this it is ok that he defends his position on the euthanasia an extremely delicate issue but doing it like this makes him lose his point the movie is a false offensive to the intelligence full of tricks and even sometimes extremely boring some scenes are advertising material more than a movie women are incredibly attracted to this mind sick man who wants to make someone to kill him not understanding the implications of that he seems not to care about no one and thank them for their caring love and attention i think that amenabar might have make people think about this issue in a different way but the way he chose to do it i believe is not correct he could have make his point more powerful exposing the other side of the coin without mocking it
<START> reba is a very dumb show you can predict pretty much anything that's about to happen barbra jean is just too stupid it's like she's not even a character a show like this should at least have someone who resembles a real life person i guess barbra jean represents a retarded person keira or whatever her name is reba brock they're all stupid keira is like the smartest person on the show and she's still stupid everyone is stupid that's my opinion on reba since i have said all i can say about this show i'll just take up the next few lines of text by saying what i am currently saying right now and do it until there's 10 lines there reba gets 2 10
<START> i love this movie the cast were all terrific in the portrayal of their various characters judith did so well portraying a weak fearful dependent who was passive aggressive in her complaining and self involved character that it was a relief to see the character's metamorphosis blythe danner was equally appealing in her role as a somewhat judgmental jewish mother devoted wife and loving sister jonathon bob dishy stacey and lisa performed their roles equally well br br if you enjoy movies that relate to going through challenging times without loosing your sense of humor and hope you will love this movie
<START> a pig tailed linnea quigley drinks milk strips and kills her sister and her sister's boyfriend after they have sex she goes to an asylum makes a best friend out of amy karen russell and the two blackmail their way out of a mental institution by sleeping with their psychologists one is played by carol burnett show regular lyle waggoner on the outside these two man hating mafia princesses stop taking their medication and invite six slimeball ex boyfriends over to their large country home for a party where they're systematically slaughtered in very gory ways by a gloved leather clad mystery killer br br the hideous david barton fx are so bloody but so unrealistic that they take on a sort of surrealistic quality same goes for the movie the dialogue is so strange and stilted the film so ineptly paced and edited and the acting so other worldly you'll start to doubt your own sanity this film actually attempts to have a plot and three dimensional characters but it's all so poorly handled it's almost like what would happen if ed wood did a rewrite of an ingmar bergman script and like any good bergman film this has a mature moral to abide by any good party needs a proper guy girl ratio so there will be enough chicks to tickle your lizard see it for yourself or don't br br linnea the only reason i was even interested in watching this to begin with is very amusing in this one has a lot more dialogue than usual and has several eye popping nude scenes unfortunately she also completely disappears from the final third of this film and the movie suffers because of it br br score 3 out of 10
<START> this is possibly the worst of the cockney gangster genre that has blighted the british film industry since mockney guy ritchie unleashed lock stock and two badly acted barrels this true life story of carlton leach who has everything that is wrong with this genre a truly awful script that consists of people screeching cant cant and i'll kill ya ya cant ad nauseum the acting is uniformly dreadful with the two most recognisable cast members being two former soap stars quite out of their depth for some reason the film assumes we have heard of these people and i can assure you anybody north of essex hasn't and that we should be interested in some low lifes story why this isn't goodfellas despite the blurb on the dvd cover the story centres around a football hooligan turned bouncer turned gangster who's friends end up getting shot boo hoo the fact that these people are totally unsympathetic is the only minor plus for this film in all of the action scenes it seems that the camera was tied to a piece of string and whirled around while people pretended to fight and the story of somebody most people have never heard of and nothing really interesting happens too is a complete waste of time people talk about how violent the film is as though it's the sign of a great film and although many great films have violence in them this is just an excuse for the fx man to show what he can do overall this film is a reminder of why the british film industry is defunct and the sooner we stop funding these pathetic abortions the better
<START> i have watched this movie over and over since it first came out i was fifteen and even then i knew it was cheesy it had such great potential and i constantly rewrite the script in my head the ruined what could have been a good drama i loved the fact that it was shot on location too bad that the characters were underdeveloped it's like they wrote a first draft of a script then made the movie right away at fifteen i could have written a better script some scenes and dialog seemed to come out of nowhere and you were left with a lot of unanswered questions and was it just me or did it seem like lobo was sexually attracted to his cousin grown into some kind of woman and the way he was always touching her would have an interesting plot twist elena working for her drug dealing cousin who is also a perv too bad they missed the mark on this one
<START> this is one awful movie some people told me that it was not that bad actually but i sure disagree the monster is amazingly cheap and funny looking but this is something we all knew i guess in addition to that the dialogs are awful and the writing is just plain terrible br br as bad as it is this movie as the quality of being entertaining not always for the good reasons but it's a good so bad that it's fun flick br br by the way there's no such thing as la according to a secondary character in the film named pierre described in the movie as a french canadian there's a legend among french canadians about a giant bird know as la as a french canadian myself i can assure you that i never heard of such a legend it sure made me laugh though
<START> othello is set to burn the eyes of the viewers of this film the bad depiction of shakespeare's characters and the terrible rendition of the love that desi john had made this movie the horrendous filth that it is by far othello directed by jeffery saks is beyond mediocre and atrocious br br the movie othello is a pitiful drama about the love between john and desi their faithfulness to one another will be tested by the man's friend in the opening scene of the film it is clearly shown that the love between john and desdemona is inseparable beyond belief moments later ben john's friend pops out into the screen scaring the viewers and showing them right away how much of a liar and power hungry person he is br br by far this movie was much more horrid than the shakespeare novel itself with that being said it does have a miniscule amount of good parts for example the love that was shown between john and desi was depicted very well and it looked that the couple was so inseparable just as it was explained in the book although the love between them was shown exceptionally well it still did not show the jealously that othello had between cass and desi as well as it should br br love jealously deceitfulness this movie is based on all three of the main topics that were in the shakespeare novel the novel however really explains how all of this came together much better than the movie could for example the conclusion of this story ends much more differently in the book than in the film much more detail is also put into the novel this is why this film is such a disappointment trust me those who have read it will find it disappointing as well br br in conclusion this film was by far the most horrendous depiction of a novel that has ever been put out by mankind by avoiding to see this film not only will viewers save themselves an hour two of their lives but also save themselves an eye or two from the distasteful face of ben popping out at them
<START> first of all i should point out that i really enjoyed watching this documentary not only it had great music in it but the shots and the editing were also wonderful however all these positive things about the film does not change the fact that it plays to the orientalist east meets west clichÃ© that bothers many turks like myself okay this film tells the story of traditional and contemporary turkish music in a very stylish manner which is a good thing something that would show ignorant europeans and americans that this country is not just about murdering and however the problematic of the film is that it looks at what it defines as east from the eyes of the west i mean like one jazz musician says in the film maybe there is no east and west maybe it is just a myth a lie created by the ruling leaders of western countries in order to keep fear and hostility alive so that they could continue ruling the world and keep the cash flowing br br why don't you think about that
<START> as a scot i find the idea of macbeth shifted in time and space to america totally moronic i am sure this doesn't apply to imdb users but why are so many americans unable to relate to any film concept that isn't set in their country this attitude does americans no favours in the big wide world out here br br it was bad enough that the wicker man was remade and set in the usa totaly stripped of its cultural context and with a correct gender change for a leading character br br one wonders what next robert the bruce as a new york cop mary queen of scots as a soccer mom juggling kids a career and relationships br br come on hollywood open up to all the other cultures on the planet
<START> why this worthless piece of french cinema has garnered any sort of attention other than negative is beyond me br br don't bother renting this one it shouldn't have even come into this country
