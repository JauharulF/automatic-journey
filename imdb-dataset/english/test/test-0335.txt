<START> this movie was like a gathering of people that had been in other movies and they decided to make a really bad movie it had a dude from detroit rock city a girl from the cosby show that dork that kissed the chick and bought that sausage was in sorority boys and there was more ok that doesn't make a bad movie in itself that was just something i noticed the whole thing with the hooker and the french girl having the same name was dumb and the thing with 37 people writing these notes and if you think they are going to get mixed up shocking enough you called it and the purse thing that was just plain stupid it was so bad that i watched the movie in two parts and still only made it to the 50 minute mark if you are watching this and expect van wilder or a movie like that don't
<START> luchino visconti was and is one of the most influential cultural figures of his generation but adam low the director of this thing allows the stronger voice to be helmut how can it be what a missed opportunity we come out of this ordeal knowing less of what made the master great and more about the things one shouldn't care at all the beautiful images belong to visconti's world the embarrassing interviews to the likes of berger and zeffirelli to adam tiny little world a must to avoid
<START> this is an astonishing film a romantic thriller with a convoluted but perfectly constructed and devastatingly symmetrical plot brilliantly by the use of recurring visual motifs everything in it is beautifully filmed the women the apartments but more amazing is the devastating juxtapositioning of images almost every scene has echoes of another this is a story told in light in colour in many almost parallels every time i watch it it fills me with delight br br the acting is great too is stunning as a woman on the verge of a nervous breakdown everything about her changes with her mood vincent cassel plays a very different role to his part in la haine but no less excellently shifty and sympathetic at the same time and monica bellucci ah monica bellucci well put simply she plays is the world's most perfect woman there's one small scene about three quarters of the way through where she does nothing more than smile yet in that instant says more than hours of hollywood junk br br one cannot do justice to this film without at least mentioning the superb sequential climax sad shocking ironic and subtle in turn but if one moment captures the brilliance of this work it's the scene at the start of this fabulous denouement the prospect of which has been teasingly laid before us throughout the entire story yet when the moment comes it is handled so delicately so briefly so deftly that on reflection it makes you gasp only a director of staggering confidence would dare to this vital point but the confidence is justified cinema doesn't come much better than this
<START> savage steve holland wrote and directed his second film one crazy summer with john cusack and curtis armstrong again in a supporting role cusack and bobcat goldthwait are recent graduates headed to cape cod in order to stay at goldthwait's grandmother's for the summer along the way they bump into demi moore being pursued by john and a motorcycle gang soon the three are united in trying to save a house from being turned into another lobster restaurant by a conniving spoiled family that considers work a dirty word the film contains several funny vignettes like the millionaire dollar radio contest gags and the godzilla skit br br like holland's first film better off dead john cusack adds immeasurably to the film otherwise this is a dud of a film filled with contrived situations and idiotic characters as opposed to quirky moore even sings a few bars in a nightclub with some horrible synthesizers goldthwait's gags wear thin after awhile and armstrong never was an actor of any caliber to appear in anything except grade z stuff the tow truck twins are extremely annoying and obnoxious instead of the endearing underdogs they're obviously meant to be this is more of a hit or miss kitchen sink comedy which could have used a better script and direction 1 2 of 4 stars
<START> i think this movie was made backwards first they shoot a whole lot of scenes and action and explosions and then the story writers got to work trying to find a story to tie all scenes up together this movie is without any doubt the worst movie i have ever seen your average porn movie comes with a much better written and much more coherent script the movie makes no sense seriously even if you are a segal fan there's no reason you should ever want to see this movie except if you're one of those folks that like to stare at accidents because this is a horrible accident and should never have been released upon this world br br boran
<START> overall i found this film good exceptional acting with disturbing scenes some essential some useless and weak second half contains spoilers the film is divided in 2 parts i thought the first half of the pianist was terrific we meet erika kohut wonderful isabelle huppert a piano teacher and get introduced to her world she is single struggling to find her space against an over protective and borderline mother we understand that she has lost or has seldom experienced love as a physical emotional chemistry she protects herself by being sharp and offensive to people releases her sexual tensions in sex shops as a voyeur or in sadistic self mutilations this first half is very clinical and builds an incredible tension in the film almost unbearable br br then comes walter a young handsome and outgoing man played superbly by benoit though he gets to feel erika's coldness in the beginning he seduces her and slowly wreaks erika's fortress he loves her deeply but she needs him to fulfil her sadistic desires then when she is about to fall for him he is disgusted by her world and in the end we discover that erika is unable to love or feel at all especially since walter is portrayed as someone impossible not to love this is the second half of the film very touching as we see erika's inability inexperience to love lead her to self destruction this second half seemed less mastered by haneke and sometimes had non credible ie too shocking scenes which paradoxically lessened the drama br br of course this is a crude film at least in the french version you see porn sequences from the sex shop daring mutilation and sex scenes the much talked about fellatio scene between and huppert was quite good i thought and is central to understand erika's sick relation to love as to the actors huppert is marvelous all through the film gets better and better up to perfection and girardot the mother is excellent br br
<START> another stinker from the pm entertainment group and thankfully one of their last br br is effectively a very low budgeted remake of 'the towering i don't mind low budget b movies as long as some effort is put into them there is no effort whatsoever in is stars who is an absolutely terrible actor seriously he has all the acting abilities of a porn star but he turns out to be the best actor here and that's saying something the rest are just a bunch of no hopers given the boot from various daytime soaps the special fx are just rubbish shots showing the burning building from the ground are among the worst i've ever seen the fire looks like someone scribbled an orange pen at the front of the camera on top of that there is not one character you actually root for you hate everyone and hope they all die well before the 90 minutes are up br br the script is embarrassing the red are signposted well in advance someone else has mentioned this but 'the scene where the janitor fights off a blazing fire the building with his broom hilarious or same janitor going into a room marked material' were these scenes supposed to be tongue in cheek somehow i doubt it br br the one good point and only one good point was there was a fair bit of action in amongst the daytime soap dramatics which kept my attention but so little care was given to everything in the film i can't recommend it watch 'the towering instead br br 3 10
<START> this movie was so frustrating to watch the split screens don't allow you to get very involved in the emotions of the actors i was constantly going back and forth watching all these tiny images that i found myself with by the end this is basically a rip off of the talented mr ripley and timecode i was very let down with this film makers attempt to be cool i wish i had walked out like so many other people did
<START> little gus is a ten year old delinquent he runs away from his parents and decides to go on a road trip reaching the petal is somewhat tough for him so he creates a device to help him his goal is to win a gimmicky lottery type card game called he has to find all eight letters in order to spell m o t o r a m a dark laughter follows as it turns into the road trip from hell he runs into some deranged lynch like characters most memorable is the gas station attendant who puts his picture on a kite in hopes that god will see it later gus gets a tattoo and an eye patch for his injured eye he becomes one of the most rebellious bad ass 10 year olds you may ever witness on screen this is no kid's flick look for cameos by jack nance flea and drew berrymore be warned although drew is on the front cover she only appears in the film in a dream sequence for a couple seconds also the film gets confusing towards the end reaching david lynch territory you may want to watch it a couple times was written by joseph minion most well known for his screenplays for after hours and vampire's kiss so enjoy this depraved surreal road trip of fun
<START> first let me start by saying that i am a laurel and hardy buff i have read every book printed about them and have seen all of their available films more than once i even took a chance once and called stan on the telephone he was very kind and spoke with me for over ten minutes i followed with a letter and he wrote me a letter back i still have that letter br br this film has some fine comedy moments but stan and ollie are not up to their usual form stan was gravely ill during the production and looked worse than he did ten years later in my opinion any laurel and hardy film is worth seeing br br but the ultimate opinion of this film comes from the great stan laurel himself to quote him this film should never have been made
<START> when the movie the cure starts we find out about a young man named erik brad erik is a teenage boy living with his paranoid mother and living next door to him is a young boy named dexter joseph one day erik and dexter connect and head up to the supermarket where dexter gets his first taste of when erik learns out that dexter has aids he tries leaves and water tea to make it better but when the front cover of the national enquirer says a new orleans doctor has found the cure for aids the two boys will stop at nothing to get to new orleans for the cure br br in my opinion the cure is easily one of the best friendship movies ever made it shows unconditional love between a boy his new best friend and his best friend's mom everything is so well done nothing needs to be changed not only do i give this a 10 10 for being a fantastic friendship movie but it also is a sad but humorous and fun aids movie and the tragic finale with dexter's of aids is enough to make me shed a tear very well done
<START> i found this to be a tremendously disappointing version of a charming story i thought the acting was on the whole quite good reginald owen did chew the scenery as mentioned by others but i found him moderately amusing in his brief scenes tcm has made an ann harding fan of me and i thought she was fine as usual here jessie ralph had a field day as the old ordering everybody around and frank morgan as always played frank morgan with a twinkle br br for me the problem was the script and or the editing transitions were awkward motivations were murky the movie was just too darned short to convey the story properly i felt completely let down particularly since i had such fond memories of the later version
<START> only in the hollywood audiovisual fiction world could anybody including fbi agents be so unbelievably stupid the good guys are stupid enough to pick up everything they're interested in answer phones go up all in search for a demolition expert who's out to get everybody oh yes and then we get the hollywood supervillain he can be shot even if he's got a vest on and then fall down a long flight of steps and then still have the upper hand over his stupid pursuers every clichÃ© you can think of in suspense movies were used i only watched it because yuki is so hot oh but yes it's great to see how morally superior this fbi agent is when she's pretty certain that there's a bomb in an opera house and she doesn't sound the alarm who writes these scripts
<START> possible spoiler madonna plays an ex con that needs to recover some valuable information that might clear her from the murder that she was put in prison for four years ago griffin dunne is a tax attorney who's marrying his boss' daughter together the two of them are supposed to come together in a world where chaos keeps you from getting on the bus br br when you get down to it this is a stupid movie without trying to give away the plot possible spoiler the bad guys in the movie are trying to protect their boss by retrieving the information that would incriminate them for the murder that madonna was sent up for what kind of bad guys don't commit murder by trying to hide the original murder br br then there's the cops who are trailing madonna who follow the bad guys in a limo where they have the brides maids all tied up and let's not forget those same brides maids who fought from the front gate to the front door still all tied together and i hate to say this but that feline sure looks like a cougar there might be only four of them in the new york city area so they might be endangered there but i know there's plenty of them in the rocky mountains see charlie the lonesome cougar if you really want to see a large cat in the movie and let's look at the old man who falls asleep on his feet naw br br the plot is there but that's all there is to this movie i was barely out of my teens when this movie originally came out and i was some what of a fan of madonna but that was the only reason i liked the movie but since then she's fell out of popularity with me and i've faced the fact that she is just a terrible actress good thing she's got that singing career to fall back on it rated maybe a 5 back then but it's fallen to barely making a 2 over the years
