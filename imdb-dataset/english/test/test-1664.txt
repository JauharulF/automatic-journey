<START> absolutely inane film starring abbott and costello even our young children would become increasingly annoyed with this complete mess of a film br br abbott as what a look he had on his face sure he had to be part of this dreadful film br br did anyone notice that mother in the film sounded and looked like fay bainter luckily for ms bainter that she wasn't in the film br br there is really no excitement hear for children the jokes if any are quite stale some of the singing is nicely done but the lyrics are ridiculous
<START> niagara niagara is a stunning and heartbreaking story about the two outsiders seth and marcy robin tunney gives a fantastic performance as marcy suffering from tourette's getting sicker and sicker as the movie progresses this movie is not very optimistic and it's very hard emotional but at the same time very romantic it's hard to explain but see it and find out for yourself it's definitely worth it
<START> i will not say much about this film because there is not much to say because there is not much there to talk about the only good thing about this movie is that our favorite characters from atlantis the lost empire are back several of the bad things about this movie are that it has horrible characters it has horrible comedy horrible animation and james arnold taylor trying to copy the wonderful one and only michael j fox as milo james thatch the reasons for my criticisms are that all the characters are changed into something that they never were and never should be animation that has been downgraded to the lowest extent possible and finally why would somebody who did wonderful voice over work for obi wan kenobi in clone wars want to copy michael j fox i happen to have an answer to this because they are the same person who thought he had to copy eddie murphy from mulan in mulan ii yes sadly it is true br br
<START> first what is really great about this movie br br ryan reynolds great acting there are very few actors i really like and for now he is one of them he has an amazing skill to impersonate characters br br the soundtrack very good music played at the right time br br the idea of a nine lost in his own world incapable of leaving br br still i give it only a 3 out of 10 for certain flaws br br horrible second part it seems that the director was very eager to make something new but despite of the efforts it was really boring br br very annoying character melissa i couldn't stand the scenes with her i e it was constantly annoying she represents everything that is wrong with american woman br br terrible explanation of the numbers the director was so busy with character development that he completely missed the point of a good story excuse me terrible br br this movie had great potential the filming is nicely done the music is really good but nothing more br br see it only if you are a fan of ryan reynolds or have a lot of time to spare
<START> wow this movie is almost too bad for words obviously the writers wanted to somehow link this to the ghoulies franchise so they got pete from the first one to reprise his role as jonathan only now he's a cop and has no similar character traits as he did in the first one the ghoulies in this one aren't the ghoulies from the last ones the cheap looking puppets have been replaced with even cheaper looking costumed little people instead of being any main antagonist or being evil they are more like the comic relief characters that appeared out of nowhere for no reason br br when watching this film for the first time it felt like i'd seen it before why was this because everything in this was stolen from another movie all the cheesy cop lines and action scenes were from lethal weapon the ghoulies were pretty much like bugs bunny and daffy duck except they weren't amusing at all even scenes from the original ghoulies film were sprinkled throughout this flick br br i think the target audience was supposed to be adults but the mixture of black magic cartoon slapstick cop drama and bad acting doesn't work at all i hope they don't make a ghoulies v because i don't want a movie studio to lose their money br br my rating bomb 78 mins r for violence
<START> despite the fact that he worked for the worst government of the 20th century erwin rommel is generally well regarded by historians and world war ii buffs as a gentleman a soldier's soldier and a brilliant in the field of mechanized warfare if only hitler had given him the troops and he had desired in africa the argument goes things would have gone very differently and that's probably true rommel was in fact a military genius and by all accounts an upstanding honest man br br but this film goes out of its way to portray him as a near saint he does his job trying to win the war for hitler but constantly the fuhrer interferes and gives him ridiculous orders which rommel james mason expresses amazement with but rarely actually questions and never ever disobeys only when it's patently obvious that hitler is leading germany to ruin does rommel think of treason against him this dilemma plays out as the main theme of the film a good man in bad circumstances trying to do the right thing br br mason is fine as rommel but it's hardly a memorable performance along the lines of say george c scott as patton of course rommel wasn't as colorful as patton but this film is so intent on making him look like a decent human being that it forgets to make him interesting he occasionally lapses into some warmth when with his wife lucie a young jessica tandy well cast but usually mason is called upon to give a stiff british performance Â as if the brits were trying to claim rommel for themselves though in all fairness all the nazis have english accents except hitler br br done on the cheap with any battle scenes swiping stock footage and the beaches of southern california doubling for tunisia there's nothing to particularly recommend this film a remake could be interesting i'd pick ed harris only because of a slight physical resemblance and well harris can act were it spiced up a little but this movie mostly demonstrated to me how much more demanding we as viewers have become in the last fifty years a biography this bland would never cut it any more
<START> comparing oceans twelve to the 2001 oceans eleven did anyone else notice all the things that stayed the same br br all the stars returned for twelve and zeta jones was added br br twelve had the same director br br twelve had the same producers br br twelve had the same production designer br br twelve had the same music director br br twelve had the same film editor br br did anyone notice the things than changed once the oceans franchise was established br br twelve's budget was 25 million 30 greater br br eleven got great reviews but twelve largely got panned br br eleven made 450 million but twelve dropped to million br br domestic box office for twelve dropped 32 br br soderbergh teamed with a different screenwriter br br movies are a director's medium of course i almost forgot
<START> well it is a good movie however you have to admit that van movies haven't been so great lately on the other hand if you are a hardcore van dame fan you should watch this as there is a huge improvement with fighting scenes also what i really liked is the music beautiful music am sure this will kill time if you are action fan as for isaac florentine the director of undisputed 2 i don't think he did a good job as he did with undisputed i cant wait when one day van movies hit the cinemas before the dvd maybe one day br br in the end it worth the watch if you got no other action movies to watch this could make your hour and half fun
<START> a hilarious comedy by the best director ever oz scott the list of eighties tv icons goes on and on milano who's the boss family ties stone mr robinson night court 227 d'abo wonder years walston mr hand it is one of the funniest movies ever great lines meaningless subplots cheesy bad acting it is about a group of high school kids who need to pass drivers' ed mac from night court needs them to pass their final exam or he'll be fired great performance by brian bloom as the jerk kinda cool guy conner but is nothing compared to b d wong's kiki pronounced kee chee a great movie for all ages so bad it's good
<START> as i watched i couldnt but laugh at what was taking place on screen sure got a lot of play from both boys and women but i was confused as to why the actor that played in h s was 10 years old then the actor changed age to like 20 to play when he was a senior in hs but whatever i thought it was funny
<START> i must admit when i saw the preview for inglorious basterds i gave myself big expectations this film did not disappoint br br rarely when i watch a movie with such high expectations do i have those expectations met or exceeded this film did that and more even more rarely do i clap at the end of a movie this i and everyone else in the theater did br br i have to say i am a little biased towards quentin i grew up with pulp fiction i watched it when i was 12 and it is still my favorite and most influential film br br however since then quentin has not really lived up to his billing his style was getting a little predictable instead of familiar the quality honestly wasn't there i never watched jackie brown and then there's grindhouse that is until inglorious basterds what quentin did was exactly what was needed for the war genre a spaghetti western feel that could only be done by tarantino or sergio leone but seeing how leone is dead tarantino's the self appointed guy on this masterpiece br br so let's look at the movie which i won't give away the writing was spot on a beautiful transition between using not one but four different languages in this movie not to mention this movie was set up in the classic tarantino mold great scenes of rich meaningful dialog and sudden shocking action br br the acting was superb christopher waltz deserves an oscar seriously i don't say that often but honestly the man should get one for this movie he spoke every language in this movie and delivered with such amazing touch and poise he stole the show in a movie that everybody was amazingly impressive br br i have no problem building this movie up because this movie is the best film i've seen all year and probably all of next year quite frankly the more i think about it this movie may crack my top films of all time and is quentin's best movie since pulp fiction take it from me watch this film i loved it doesn't do this movie enough justice br br i watched it yesterday and i'm still blown away thank you quentin from the bottom of my heart for you making this movie you're back on top again buddy i can't say enough for inglorious basterds
<START> i'm not sure why i disliked this film so much maybe i'm too old or too male or too something just who was the target audience here if you're it and you liked it then i'm happy for you personally i found it a bit of a pill the characters were uninteresting and unlikeable the script was just plain embarrassing and some though not all of the acting was uninspired mawkish tedious and occasionally nauseating surely there's something better on br br on a related issue why is it that whenever i see chris klein in a film i get an urge to slap him silly does anyone else get that
<START> i'll start by admitting that i enjoy many movies that have low ratings on this site i find that if i can see what the creators were trying to do i can find appreciation for their work sound of thunder was a story that interested me i wanted to see what angles the filmmakers would attack in telling the story by and large they attempted to create an entertaining movie the plot was contrived but most action movie's plots are ed burns doesn't know how to carry a rifle but still holds his own well as an action lead considering he isn't asked for much the main problem destroys the whole movie is the horrible cgi it is totally unacceptable for the animals and backgrounds to look soooooo very fake aside from that the animal conceptions could have been really good as could the action scenes but failed because the production failed this could have been a really memorable film if they had only finished it it really looks like they meant to go back and fix all the horrible cgi but ran out of money and still released it save your money because someone failed this movie i give it three stars because it really could have been good but was totally failed somewhere i can't say it enough
