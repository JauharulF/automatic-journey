<START> wow this film was terrible it is as simple as that it is actually the first time that i walked out early as far as i can remember this turned out okay though i had a very nice chat with two most charming girls while we all waited for the rest to finally give up on that crap they called a movie br br where to start bad acting bad jokes humour which i simply cannot stand sorry but snot pee and scat are not funny you have seen the title picture that scene actually drags on for about 5 minutes with the two heroes hitting and mutilating each other which is supposed to be humorous all by itself it is not br br apart from body fluids violence and cross dressing i do not remember much about this at least not much good i was really really disappointed by this piece of garbage or let us be honest here given that i am actually a big fan of british i e black humour i was angry br br so want my advice three words do not watch
<START> this movie was pointless i can't even call it sci fi since that requires more from a movie than merely taking place in space max q isn't even set in space for the entire movie the story plot is unoriginal the cast isn't anything to write home about although it would be strange with a top cast in a mediocre film furthermore it's not particularly exciting or well told at least it's evenly balanced in a low quality sort of way in that nothing or no one stands out everything is equally bland i usually find some quality in space flicks even if it's just 90 minutes of semi lame entertainment bordering on low budget pathetic but max q didn't even give me that satisfaction all in all a complete waste of time
<START> as good as schindler's list was i found this movie much more powerful as it is a documentary and based on real life it details the story of the frank family and anne in particular although it is a bit slow moving at first detailing their family life before the war it becomes very powerful br br due to some of the footage and photos of the camps i would not recommend it for children but for adults it illustrates the horror of the holocaust through one young girl highly recommended
<START> larry is a perfect example of the democratic party in the united states of which he is a staunch member king used to be somewhat fair and unbiased and had a variety of guests on the party used to be centrist too but that was another era now like larry it's far left br br at least 90 percent of all the guests on king's show in the past year or two are liberals who sit there and bash president bush and every conservative they can think of night after night bill one of the more viscous ones is and you can look this up the most frequent guest in the history of king's tv show you can count on other outspoken left wingers to be on king's show each week but don't hold your breath waiting for a conservative they are few and far between br br king was also one of the of the media overkill that all began with the o j simpson trial night after night after night that's all you ever saw back in the mid '90s whatever latest gossip on anna nicole smith or the petersen murder case or paris hilton britney spears or some other tabloid subject you can bet larry will beat it to death sadly all the other networks do the same thing now larry was a leader in that regard br br king also has the nerve to sometimes give advice such as on marriage i am not kidding i 've heard him say it the joke is that he has been married and divorced a half dozen times this man has few scruples believe me when it comes to morality he is clueless maybe that's why he has dr phil on to explain some facts of life to him regularly larry will nod but he doesn't understand any more than when billy graham used to talk to him br br king also is becoming famous for the softball interview meaning he asks no hard questions that is a lot due to the fact that most his guests are of his political persuasion people know being on king's show is liking having an hour public relations gig br br what all this has meant is a serious decline in ratings the past five years people see through him and his liberal and tabloid tv mentality and switched over from king and cnn to fox news
<START> this is the underrated kellie martin's best role based on a true story it tells the story of attempt to save the members of the family and other jews she meets over time one of my all time favorite movie scenes involves an heroic act by little sister all children should see this scene role models like this are very few and far between the movie is well written and acted i am a movie lover and this movie i rate a 10 on rating system it is on my top 25 movies of all time and should be put out on video br br mike porter
<START> 2005 was one of the best year for movies we had so many wonderful movies like batman begins sin city corpse bride a history of violence coming up we also got brokeback mountain king kong but if this year the only great movie that came out was everything is illuminated then we wouldn't miss all this year has brought the first movie as a director of the talented liev schreiber is a delightful heart warming touching drama that also brings one of elijah wood's best roles he is perfect as jonathan a curious man that heads for ukraine to find the woman who saved his grandfather in world war ii liev schreiber who also writes the movie conducts a masterpiece with memorable scenes and a lot of funny quotes this here is a genuine mixture of comedy with drama bringing a movie that will be commented years from now a serious oscar contender everything is illuminated is a powerful original and why not say illuminated movie but there's one thing you should remember while entering the movie leave normal behind this is special 9 10
<START> i would like to comment on how the girls are chosen why is that their are always more white women chosen then their are black women every episode their is always more white women then black one's as if to say white women are better looking then black women i would like for once see more black women then white and it not just your show it's like that in a lot of shows always more white's but i would have thought since you as the head honcho of the show you would see this yourself and have more black women on your show but you are just like the rest trying to act like you are so fair and nice you are just a big hypocrite
<START> this film is not at all as bad as some people on here are saying i think it has got a decent horror plot and the acting seem normal to me people are way over what was wrong with this it is simply classic horror the type without a plot that we have to think about forever and forever we can just sit back relax and be scared
<START> well i just discovered imdb from my twin sister carol carol and i played the fat identical twin in midnight madness we didn't have to prepare much for the fat part that came with us and well and the rest was natural it was our first major film role and we had a blast making it we were 21 at the time and lived about an hour and half from the disney studio in burbank and the hollywood california area we grew up in front of the tv and probably some of the first generation of latch key kids twenty years later we still have lots of fun and are still 'heavy' or what ever is politically correct these days we don't pursue acting any more but have been know to 'come back' when the right opportunity arrives carol is a chiropractor in our home town of southern california and i am in the information technology field in georgia br br i maybe bias but i thought the film was cute clean and fun we knew it wasn't a master piece or an oscar nominee however it was and still is a movie the whole family can watch and have fun together it's nice not to have to worry if your young children can watch a video without having to fast forward certain parts and no one was more exited when it was released on video as carol and i were carol found it at kmart for 6 99 now that's an inexpensive way to capture one's memories and share it with others br br sincerely betsy lynn and carol the thompson twins
<START> harrison ford playing a playing a cop in a crime thriller the perfect ingredients it seems for top entertainment with harrison back to his indy and han solo best protecting a witness from ruthless and merciless murderers how easy it is to be fooled if the film concentrated on the main supposed themes of crime and suspense instead of putting up and shoving ice creams in peoples faces it possibly could have been more worthwhile unbelieveably predictable with the best method of of a foe is with corn
<START> seems to have a love hate relationship with many of its viewers i personally loved the movie and everything about it br br the acting in some places could be improved upon but the filming adds to the atmosphere where the acting can't in some areas the dialogue is a bit cheesy and over dramatic but really what do you expect from the late 90s over all dee did an amazing job in writing what i believe to be one of the most terrifying thrillers i've ever seen it plays on the fears of many age groups adult parents and children every parent fears that their children will get too involved with chat rooms and will meet strangers from the internet and it does happen in the real world and every child and adult fears being kidnapped and tortured against their will that happens too in the real world which is what makes this movie such a sensitive subject for many br br my only warning is if you know you are sensitive to things such as strong violence visible torture and gore then you do not want to see this movie if you are unsure about if this movie will entertain you then read as many reviews as you can ask people you know who have seen this movie and be prepared to turn the movie off at any time should you become disturbed
<START> a true gothic horror trash classic br br uhm actually it's a horrible movie best thing about it rosalba erected naked nipples intensely material br br oh sure rosalba neri is one fine lady never even heard of her before this flick but she is a damn fine looking lady but honestly it were her nipples that did it for me in that very last scene before the movie abruptly ends all naked and erected total dream nipples man okay sorry getting a little carried away here br br basically i got what i expected from lady frankenstein it's a sleazy and horrible flick with a big stupid ugly looking frankenstein monster and a couple of naked tits and it's got a castle in it so i wasn't really disappointed or anything it just dragged too much in certain places the first resurrection of the creature kept on going for ages with daddy frankenstein just experimenting talking trying some more there was one fun imbecilic homage to the original frankenstein though instead of throwing a little girl into a lake here mongoloid franky picked up a naked chick and threw her in a river had me laughing br br some friends of mine raved just a tad bit too much about this flick though had me maybe expecting a bit too much but rosalba's erected nipples sure were worth it aw crap i really need to stop mentioning her nipples i think i'll just end this user comment now
<START> gordon scott made some good tarzan movies but this is not one of them br br as i watched it wincing at the bad obviously interior sets and the hollow wooden sounds as they walked across supposedly dirt trails and cringing at the bad dialog and worse acting among the supporting cast i kept thinking sheesh this is tv show level then i find out it was indeed three tv show pilot episodes woven seam fully into one br br it's nice to see scott get outside alone away from the lame sets in a few of the scenes and the fights do have some pretty nice moves but oh ow and ouch as to the dialog and did i mention the acting heck cheetah or in this version was a better actor than most of the humans br br and that's not saying much br br it is kind of a stitch to see a younger sherman i e scatman acting as a native but probably not worth the overall time investment
<START> tries to be funny scary tense and romantic and fails in every respect the acting is average at best but mostly stupid the special effects are not enough to make up for the stupid plot devices and the chemistry between any character is juvenile br br if you don't want to be mad at yourself don't pay money to see it
<START> even my five year old was bored br br very predictable and overacted this movie couldn't make up it's mind as to whether it was slapstick or wry commentary on the state of pee wee sports br br characters were underdeveloped could have done more with the connection between father and son both coming from an orphanage br br did not like the reference regarding the slipping the laxative to his teammate very mean spirited for a kid's movie br br typical mafia behavior was boring and stereotypical br br the dog however was so darn cute
