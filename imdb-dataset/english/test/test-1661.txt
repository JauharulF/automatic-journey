<START> this is one of the stupidest movies ever not the stupidest mind you but one of the stupidest this is 96 1 2 minutes of sleep inducing material probably jim worst movie ever the last 30 seconds of the film is the best and funniest part but hardly worth sitting through the whole movie for on the other hand if you are a die hard jim varney ernest fan then like me you must add this film to your collection it does have brief rare moments of humor although they are few and far between the mere fact that this movie is so hard to find makes it a collectors item and a must have for your ernest collection i was lucky to find this film online at a dirt cheap price a couple years ago i believe i paid 1 99 plus shipping for it and it was the only copy i could find anywhere even though this is a truly all around horrible movie it is still a must have if you are a jim varney fan and an ernest movie collector such as i on a scale of 1 to 10 i give this movie a 2 but thats only because i've never seen a 1 before
<START> i was expecting this movie to be a stinker but i wanted to see for myself but i was surprised how good of a movie this was i know longer movies often don't do well at the box office but why this was pulled and not allowed to be viewed by the public is beyond me it maintained my interest throughout and the scenery and photography is breathtaking at times the plot was good and the morality play was a good one i liked the realism which was along the lines of unforgiven i had to rent this movie to see it but it was definitely worth it
<START> i can't believe it were they crazy in filming a movie about connecticut in southern california for god's sake there's palm tree's everywhere in one of the opening scenes a guy says welcome to connecticut and throws down a newspaper the newspaper says something like greenwich herald greenwich connecticut doesn't have a herald it has a times as in stamford advocate and the greenwich times refering to the stamford connecticut newspaper maybe the film makers should have done a little research i mean my god at least get the name of the newspaper right or film in locations that look at least remotely like connecticut
<START> dark harbor is a moody little excursion into murky emotional waters that run extremely deep it's basically a 3 character piece featuring a finely layered performance by the always great rickman with polly walker and norman reedus also excellent forming the other two sides of this strange triangle a perfect late night cable film with a surprise ending to boot
<START> hilarious from start to finish there's got to be great courage to handle the theme of death with a smile specially when two funeral parlors are battling for control of the market a classic parlor and a revolutionary one where every funeral is a show lead by christopher walken a treat in the role of the visionary american but the rest of the cast is great also and this one is another success that only uk is capable of making surprising among the ensemble cast is naomi watts that strikes in another metamorphosis accent included always sporting a smile on its face it seems like a paradox that there could be so much comedy to be taken from a movie that could be called four funerals and one wedding but you'll understand when you see it
<START> ok so paris hilton sucks in it typical malibu barbie but the rest of the actors are just great i watched the film last night and it totally kept me going thru out the whole film chad michael murray is and he's just a ace actor total hero man the main girl who is the sister to nick chad is such a brilliant actress thumbs up i think it's so different to films out their these days most of them to go with possessions ghosts but here you have a theme about wax i totally got creepers out by the wax models in the house although they looked so real i still haven't got the story with the twins at the moment i am just waiting to get the dvd then watch it all over again thumbs up to such a great film 11 10 all those people who don't like it please don't bother 2 criticise my opinion as mostly everyone thinks its cool to do so also i think the paris scene when she strips to her underwear is totally inconvenient why not just get a dog shagging some cat be more entertaining then that when paris death scene came up i thought it was poor as she still kept running although a knife just went up her foot hmm interesting br br chad all the way
<START> this documentary is rife with problems br br how arrogant is it to make a documentary about your own family i understand you think the subject is interesting i was bored with it this isn't a fascinating story to me and i don't know why you would think it was br br i don't want to come off as mean but i have to say most of the people in this film are just not attractive and that's ok not everyone is pretty but your camera technique to stick the lens in their face so you can't help but be overwhelmed by their unpleasant appearance because it is filling your 47 tv is not enjoyable i had to put my hand up half the time to shield myself from the warts wrinkles bags under eyes and yellow teeth really i'm trying not to sound inhuman but pull the camera back so its not like total strangers are breathing in my face br br the camera work in this film is rank amateur level it's the kind of camera work you see from everyone with a camcorder at a family picnic uninteresting framing unsteady even static shots are done carelessly put a little effort into it if you're going to do this for a living br br i honestly can't see what the big deal is about this thing
<START> i saw it at a german press screening without giving too much away most critics really seemed to like it very much there was even applause afterwards which is quite unusual for that species from my point of view and until now it was the funniest movie of the year it keeps the charm and wit of the three w g shorts and it is enlarged with many references to these and other movies of course there are obvious allusions to monster and werewolf movies especially to an american werewolf in london jaws king kong and even to peter jackson's braindead dead alive but also to other genres br br characterization was better done in chicken run but that movie had a complete new cast where introduction was necessary here you are already able to know the two main characters so the new wallace and gromit movie is enjoyed best if you watched and liked the shorts already yet it also works on its own chicken run had the more convenient but also more storytelling plot instead this new aardman masterpiece keeps that crazier and somehow more isolated feeling of the w g shorts children should also enjoy it very much especially because of the sweet rabbits if you love cute bunnies this is a must see for you and because gromit has a lot do to and really steals the show children also love dogs but many jokes are thought for a more adult audience there are even soft sexual allusions in it the movie manages like shrek 1 2 and the incredibles to fulfil high level entertainment for the whole family with adding a british and at least a little bit darker edge to the humour of american animated movies br br the animation is Â as expected Â superb and they kept true to the aardman style because they didn't put in too many digital effects i realized just a few when it came to wallace's inventions br br finally the score works fine in the movie although one of the main themes definitely is borrowed by randy edelman's dragonheart score br br the bad thing is it will probably take another six years from now until we can see a new animated gem from nick park co
<START> this movie was horrible and corny james agee is rolling in his grave this movie was nothing at all like the book and made a mockery of it no one should see this movie unless they want to gag
<START> my daughter liked it but i was aghast that a character in this movie smokes as if it isn't awful enough to see product placement actors like bruce willis who smoke in their movies at least children movies should be more considerate i wonder was that intentional did big tobacco sponsor the film what does it take to ban smoking from films at least films intended for children and adolescents my daughter liked it but i was aghast that a character in this movie smokes as if it isn't awful enough to see product placement actors like bruce willis who smoke in their movies at least children movies should be more considerate i wonder was that intentional did big tobacco sponsor the film what does it take to ban smoking from films at least films intended for children and adolescents
<START> i love the jurassic park movies they are three of my all time favorite movies br br and i hate this game if there was one game i wish i never own for the super nintendo was this one br br how can a game based on a classic movie be just too awful and to make it worst i was scare of this game when i was a kid br br how dumb was that but then again i was a kid when this game was first out br br the game play in this game is just odd one minute it's a action game and then it's a shooter what in the world is wrong with making up your mind when making a video game br br the sound in the game is just terrible to listen br br the music is just too sick to listen to br br the in the game don't work most of the time br br jurassic park the game is just a waste of time and money and won't be a classic br br avoid at all cost
<START> as a father of four in his forties i thought this film made compelling viewing if not edge of the seat stuff i deserves a far higher rating than the 4 3 that it had when i wrote this i gave it 7 br br i agree with some of the comments about the characters but cameron diaz was again sparkling in yet another very different role the plot was a little silly but the point of the film for me was beautifully summed up in the final quite surreal sequence a moving ending for any parent br br i could imagine that a young single bloke might find the film quite boring but for other people not fixed on high doses of testosterone would find something sweet in this
<START> this movie had all the potential and makings of a great feel good great love story the cast is perfect the visuals work the original premise works the characters work but the story moves from one chess move to the next in a most predictable way not one character in the movie has any depth or has any depth explained by the director all we know about catherine zeta jones character is she is obsessed with her world nobody is allowed in and nobody challenges her world that much is obvious but the remaining characters all have their own dimensions that are really never explored or exposed aaron character had so much more to offer to the story but wasn't allowed abigail character is so easy to understand that her performance comes across somewhat predictable and phony in the end everything reverts back to the forced turbulent world of catherine zeta jones which the audience never totally falls for honestly her turbulent world is not much more than a portrayal of a selfish self obsessed spoiled lady who most people would not have much time or sympathy for in the real world the director needed to make her a hero and never does in the end it is character that ultimately wins because he wins br br not a lousy movie just a movie that could have been a lot better with more depth of personalities allowed in explained and exposed br br cheers
<START> 2 outta 5 stars br br i have no idea what the title is supposed even less of an idea of what is supposed to be going on in this movie half the time yet it still kept me sort of interested this is low low budget film making along the lines of el mariachi filmed in 16mm and for what it's worth the shots are very well composed and visually stylish directed written by and starring comic book writer artist michael i guess it's no surprise that the film looks good unfortunately some of the acting is beyond bad and the rest is competent at best himself comes off the best but only because he doesn't actually speak much he just strides around looking cool most of the time or running from crazed rednecks who are trying to kill him the sound is also pretty bad almost as if it was unfinished in places maybe they couldn't afford to pay for the music they'd planned to use strange vaguely science plot similar in tone to the man who fell to earth but most of the film boils down to a standard run from the bad guys and kill them before they kill you plot ultimately too oblique to be successful but not without interest for adventurous movie watchers
<START> it is important to realise that eisenstein was a committed marxist film maker who held some very specific and particular theories about what film could achieve and how br br it is simply idle to compare alexander nevsky negatively with anything from a similar period in the us this film comes from the oldest film school in the world from another continent from an entirely different approach to cinema br br to appreciate this film a little more try finding out about and theories of montage for example or read the wikipedia entry on marxist film theory if you're feeling really bold you might even investigate the forms of dialectic br br it follows that if you watch this film without some understanding of eisenstein's ideas and ideals you probably won't get it in alexander nevsky the main characters aren't playing themselves they are meant to be of their nation's character nevsky and his generals are deliberately shown larger than life because they represent stylised heroic aspects of the entire russian people br br the acting isn't wooden it's meant to be slightly mannered it represents a completely different school from the more naturalistic narrative style which hollywood was rapidly adopting eisenstein's films are especially designed not to be realistic if anything seems somewhat obvious whether lighting or language or a pose struck by an actor it's meant to be that way eisenstein was one of the early of film as an art form not just as entertainment br br if the editing sometimes seems to consist of a clash of images well that's the idea shots are meant to contrast with each other eisenstein's films contain and embody elements of a political philosophical argument namely marxist dialectic br br so sit back shout hurrah for russia and her folk hero defenders boo at the cowardly nobles and the teuton invaders and enjoy the difference
