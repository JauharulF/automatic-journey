<START> i think a person would be well advised to read or see i favour reading twelfth night before seeing or re seeing she's the man the movie is good on its' own but comparing the two and looking for the in jokes makes it a lot more fun shakespeare was inspired by others i think he'd give a thumbs up br br bloom said in shakespeare the invention of the human that most of the people in twelfth night need to be locked up the person malcolm is based on is for no good reason people in she's the man are sane in contrast for instance duke is far more than the duke of he also shows that a man can have feelings without being gay he displays a lot of self control br br it's a teen comedy a clean one so it doesn't have the dark edges of the play for instance olivia in the play is mourning the death of her brother in the movie she has been dumped br br if you like sir andrew and sir toby in the play they don't have the same attention in the movie br br the in jokes are quite often quick the hairdresser last name is given once it is antonio lots of people who've read the play say that antonio has more love for a man than is just friendship deep love between men was noted in those days some see a sexual side to it homosexuality was illegal br br the only line from the play i caught is where duke quotes the coach on greatness during the game in the play it is said by quoting maria
<START> once a year in america saturday morning would give way to new cartoons usually sometime in america just about the time school started br br i guess this was to make not having school on saturdays that more bearable br br one friday night before the premiere of the new saturday morning cartoons a movie came on br br at the earth's core i had not a clue who cushing nor mcclure were clearly they were not from the same country so i couldn't grasp why they were traveling together br br i do recall seeing the mechanism in the fire breathing monster's mouth br br what connects this movie for me is the opening with the molten metal and then suddenly we get the band playing as we see the factory br br how do you end a movie like this the music again and two cops as the drill appears behind them br br whatever reason i remember watching this movie more that friday night than i do any new cartoon that came on the following morning br br that was definitely the late seventies br br it would be during jurassic park mania '93 i believe before i would see this movie again br br yes people in costumes there was the fire breather again br br still loved the ending with the two cops br br finally it would be nearly another decade before i would send off for the movie on dvd br br now i would just watch the beginning and intro br br oh i do love much of the movie of all these sci fi jules verne hg wells erb movies this one stands as my fave br br what i note now is that one of the cops begins turning around a wee bit too soon then turns back then he and the other cop are synchronized as they turn inward once again to look behind themselves at the drill br br perhaps for me this movie stands as the best of the saturday morning shows which is why i enjoy it so much
<START> i got interested in this movie because somebody had made a beautiful video for bachelorette with clips from it so i watched the movie and it is indeed stuningly beautiful a masterpiece of animation br br unfortunately the story doesn't keep up it starts out well with interesting plotlines about people fencing for the possession of the rose bride but suddenly elevators fill up with water and looses their walls people float away and finally for no reason whatsoever is into a car and a chase ensues br br i like much anime for it's ability to make alternative universes but this universe is just stupid if you are gonna watch this movie turn of the sound it's better that way
<START> if folks were really this stupid i could be the supreme ruler of the world in this one knotts plays a dimwitted bean counter for some little jerk water town run by a group of crooked simpletons only slightly brighter than he is when things appear a bit shaky for the crooks they go for a frame up of the patsy figg plenty of laughs as knotts does his usual bumbling stumbling act i especially appreciated the extension cord scene asininity at it's highest level
<START> this movie dr giggles as the best horror movie i've ever seen the plot was great the plot twists were even better and the cast was great it's hard to believe that they compiled the most unknown people 8 years ago and they would be big names today br br the plot is simple 4 teenagers wreck their car in the middle of nowhere they stumble on this campsite and do what everybody who is in an accident should do build a fire and tell scary stories br br 1 the hook great opener anyone who is in high school has heard variations of this story on prom night but they do it real good in this movie br br 2 the honeymoon ok this was not the best of the 4 it was pretty good and you get to see some boob on the word some it's just your basic creature in the woods story br br 3 people can lick too this is a cautionary tale of what happens in internet chat rooms all across the country this segment alone should be required viewing for parents whose children have access to the internet br br 4 the now this is the best story in the whole movie a guy on a motorcycle breaks down and goes to this mute girl's house very good plot twist br br the main plot the campfire has the biggest and best twist in the whole movie i won't tell what it is cause i don't want to ruin it i was never this shocked during a movie in my life br br plot a br br acting a br br writing a br br directing a br br music a br br overall a br br i recommend it to anyone over 13 with the exception of people can lick too any parent who's child has access to the internet needs to watch this one with their child
<START> i am not a fan of sean penn but in contrast to my german colleague whose review appears here i think he was perfectly cast as the neurotic druggy character in this film he has every nuance perfected and reminded me of several acquaintances who had similar tastes in recreational chemistry i saw this film but once 10 15 years ago and this is the only part of the film that was etched indelibly on my mind i don't say it very often but in this case i will bravo sean penn as for the story line well it's based on fact and as such it is a tragedy that people would sell their country's secrets to the then enemy again penn has shown what you can do if you disagree with the administration use the freedoms you have paid for in blood don't break the law
<START> of course how could he he obviously co opted several aspects from that excellent movie which was also based on the sensational french case of the self described doctor in the world health organization who murdered his family and himself when finally unmasked as a fraud emilio refers to his son as monster he sings to the radio in his car he hangs out on park benches and he specializes in investment schemes to defraud his family and friends all of this and more directly lifted from time out which came out the year before nobody's life it's too bad because this movie is pretty good on its own with good acting and writing whereas vincent from time out is a much more subtle character who seems to have a sense of ethics even though at times it gets twisted into knots the protagonist here seems devoid of any character at all save for his winning looks and charm seriously the part where he used x rays that show his mother in law's cancer to bilk more money from his father then utilizes a subtle twist on the same scam to avoid eviction from his fancy home for failing to pay the lease on time it's almost too much the guy has no shame whatsoever in fact he's more like the lead in stepfather than some poor schmuck who gets fired and is so humiliated that he can't face the disappointment of his family and friends and feels forced to invent a shiny new life for himself as vincent did in time out thus one could feel the tension mounting in nobody's life and the violent conclusion coming one thing nobody's life has that time out definitely lacked was a love interest apart from the protagonist's trusting wife it's not hard to understand how the sexy babysitter was able to fascinate and ensnare emile to the degree that he ignored the danger of her natural curiosity and allowed it to lay bare his less than carefully constructed con given the reservations mentioned this is a pretty good movie that we found entertaining if you long for something touching on similar elements that goes a might deeper and is more intellectually and spiritually satisfying i strongly suggest time out
<START> 2 3 of this movie is recycled footage of the previous movies a fact that's sadly obvious even to someone like myself who hasn't seen the original movies and somehow it feels like a rip off even though i haven't seen the stuff before it's like that episode of every tv show where the characters sit around a photo album or something and you just see recycled footage of other episodes i've seen some producers do extended montages of recycled footage but never anything beyond 5 minutes or so this movie is mostly stuff that had already been seen by audiences so you could mount a case that it's one of the biggest rip offs ever foisted on the motion picture public br br i got to see it in the theater in a 16mm print which is good enough i suppose considering how rare this kind of material must be on film these days i give the movie some credit for semi convincing gothic atmosphere and for unintentional humor but that's about it the aztec mummy monster looks good even has some mobility in his face which is better than most movie monsters of the period but the robot is pitiful although it's interesting that they made the human face totally visible it's a robot human or something of the sort as they somewhat explain in the movie i think that's considered an android so technically in hard sci fi terms this movie should be called android vs the aztec mummy but i doubt anyone was too worried about technicalities here anymore than they were worried about quality in fact the movie is so sloppily put together that it makes television look good even the dubbing from mexican into english is lazy and weak for example at one point the hero says i might as well begin at the beginning what the heck kind of translation is that couldn't they at least have him say start at the beginning so that it doesn't sound repetitive a high school newspaper editor could have fixed the screenplay of this movie it's the epitome of utilitarian film making just absolutely nothing is in this movie that doesn't need to be there for the basic commercial purpose of the film they put no more effort into making it than they had to and considering the extensive recycled footage i would doubt that they actually spent more than a week making this movie br br i will now cease posting about it on the principle that i don't want to expend more energy in the process of commenting than the creators of the movie actually expended while making it
<START> pauline kael gave this movie a good review but it is terrible it is very outdated the humour is silly and the music is forgetable in fact it is so silly it is almost embarrassing it might have been some fun in 1938 but i can not imagine anyone enjoying it in 2003
<START> this 1955 producers' showcase version of the musical peter pan with mary martin has the benefit of showcasing most of the original broadway cast including kathleen nolan as wendy who was more natural an actress than the girl they hired for the 1960 color televised play it's a shame that most people won't sit through anything black and white anymore because in many respects this earlier production which doesn't even show up in the imdb listings when you put peter pan into the search engine is superior to the color version most people have watched i obtained the original on disc and then did work on it to make it look and sound better digitally now when i put the 1960 color version on it looks garish in comparison i suspect mary martin herself no doubt preferred this original 1955 b w producers' showcase televised version br br as an added plus the disc i got also showed the original commercials and opening promo how far away the 1950's seem now such an innocent time compared to today i miss it
<START> one of the best romantic classic teen is a film which is all about selecting among equals your most soft emotion love this is a simple story of a middle class man who came into limelight by his poetic talent and charming personality he is attracted towards three women and vice versa one a hindi movie star the second a rich lady and the third who lives in his neighborhood br br the situation put him in confusion as he has to decide one of them as his life partner he asked for few days from all of them ultimately he goes to a and asked him who he loves most his confusion is no more and he came to know the lady living in his neighborhood who really cares for him and loves him is his true love played the lead character and has fully justified his contemporary romantic image
<START> hana bi has many quiet moments and fairly slow pacing unfortunately during the many thoughtful interludes the viewer is left to ponder about the recent scenes just watched and many questions surface and annoy br br for example why didn't the wheelchair guy drown in the ocean when he was stuck in the sand and the tide came up around him there was no rescue seen or hinted at br br can it be true that japanese police are so inept and unskilled at arrest procedures as to not first remove the ability to reach for a weapon these detective level japanese police seemed to have no experience dealing with a suspect br br why doesn't the right eye of the lead character blink having one eye blinking was distracting and it went unexplained br br what exactly was the lead character spending all his money on to have to borrow so much from loan sharks he was not seen gambling being a non entry level government employee his wife must have had full health insurance br br what was the single man doing all by himself in the middle of nowhere in the nature park what was his reason for being there br br how in the world could the gangsters find the lead character and his wife up in the far off nature reserve it made no sense br br and again how could the gangsters later find the lead character and his wife up in the remote mt fuji resort there were absolutely no clues available for these gangsters to even know which country the lead character and his wife were in let alone the correct specific location at the correct specific time br br and a third same question how could the junior detectives know which few feet of the japanese coast line to find the lead character and his wife the japanese coast line must be vast were all of these characters supposed to have psychic powers br br two final questions the cute girl trying to fly a kite on the beach where did she come from she seemed to have no transportation or companions with her and why in the world did she still keep attempting to fly what was left of her kite after it was ripped in pieces this was weird unintentionally python esque br br on the positive side i loved the background music it was dramatic and flowing and added much to this movie the photography imagery and art were pleasing to the eye br br one final point the wife was overly pleasing to the eye not once did she ever come close to looking like a dying sick person she looked very healthy if anything these people seemed depressed and mentally ill and not physically sick the husband treated his wife as perhaps a newly gay man would treat a respected wife a love of friendship but not close tenderness br br a mixed movie for sure
<START> i never intended to write a review of this movie actually i was just on the sight looking for the name of the star of the film and then i started reading reviews i guess i'll never learn this movie is horrible i'm not going to justify my comments with specific reasons because i really find it hard to believe that anyone with any taste actually likes this a guilty pleasure okay i guess but a film this bad that wasted talent so good caine and donen is a reason for mourning not a pleasant diversion a low point for all involved except perhaps bologna who must sit up nights trying to figure out which bomb was the bomb that destroyed his career
<START> saw this used dvd cheap and got it for a chuckle i had recently also found the octagon on dvd and bought that one to reminisce having seen it in the theatre as a pre teen and loving it at the time the problem now with going back to these american karate films is that i've since then seen so many hong kong and thai action films in which the fight scenes are long fast and jaw dropping i'm thinking particularly of fights like jackie and benny the jet at the end of dragons forever or tony circular stairwell fight from the protector the hollywood kung fu offerings are just not filmed right and even make someone of certified skill such as chuck look awkward at times and what's worse than a fight going into slow motion then you know it looked crappy at normal speed so they slowed it down for effect it really highlights how ridiculous an opponent looks as they stand and just wait to get kicked in the chest br br poor chuck he just has no intensity in this film nor does he project any righteous menace compare that to his former co star bruce lee who had charm and attitude to burn when bruce would square off against some opponent s you could nearly see the air around him crackling with what was about to happen in breaker breaker chuck seemed to accidentally be kicking people with complete nonchalance when the judge comes to see him in jail and sentence him to death chuck is staring off with a sad look and i thought ok he's doing that eye' focus thing and is going to grab the judge by the throat and get out of this but he does nothing except look up with a doe eyed stare terrible and while the dvd case gives you hope listing a run time of 1 hour 5 minutes it's actually 1 hour 25 minutes so there's 20 more minutes of viewing pain br br for great fight action go watch jackie chan in the first police story the fight in the shopping mall at the end is pure gold
<START> rent this i own the dvd got it for 9 99 a steal being so under rated sure there are better movies movies with fewer or no holes in the plot or action but i don't have that problem with this movie for me if a movie stays true to itself honest and exploitive of its flaws and virtues obviously in the name of entertainment then it has fulfilled its purpose i got me to care because its makers cared the entire movie is preposterous from beginning to end but its makers took the whole undertaking seriously and i did not feel manipulated into taking the movie seriously and that is so true because i want to take every movie seriously yet many oh so many let me down for all of its this movie is almost perfect and completely entertaining what a funny screenplay it also has become eerily relevant in light of the events on 9 11 in no way do i seek to minimize the loss but this movie incorporates the of the wtc collapse before it happened in ways that we will never see had the movie been made after those events br br it's either gone for good or here to stay wouldn't you agree
