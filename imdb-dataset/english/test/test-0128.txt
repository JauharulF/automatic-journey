<START> in my work with the only nationwide non profit organization security on campus inc dedicated exclusively to the issue of college campus crime prevention and student awareness i see all too often the type of campus violence and cover up' through secret campus courts portrayed in the movie silencing mary ' in fact we receive numerous calls and requests for information every month from campus reporters such as mary' who are facing similar situations br br its depiction of a campus rape and the subsequent crusade by mary ' the victim's roommate and a student journalist played exceedingly well by melissa joan hart for justice was very well done and accurately researched br br this was the first television movie that i have ever seen that i felt truly reflected and encompassed all of the various complex issues associated with how rape and other violent crimes are dealt with on our nation's college and university campuses although it would not be possible to address all of these issues in depth in 2 hours this movie comes closer than any others i've seen
<START> michael hypnotic northfork is a film that will stay in one's memory for quite a long time this exquisitely crafted movie that michael and mark polish wrote is visually one of the best things that came out last year from the world of independent films the movie is splendidly photographed by m david mullen with a haunting score by stuart br br if you haven't seen the film perhaps you should stop reading here br br the idea to set the film in montana was a great coup for the polish brothers never has the majestic views of the country and mountains been so vividly captured as in northfork we don't need any color the beauty is in the dark tones of the film that enhances the story of the desolation in this remote outpost br br at the center of the story is irwin the sick child under the care of the mysterious father harlan this boy is seen in his bed where the kind priest is administering the medicine for his body but is he really there at all we watch him interacting with the odd group that we first encounter around the cemetery there are two freshly open graves will one of them be for irwin br br at the same time another plot line plays parallel to this first theme we see the six men in black that have come to the area in order to remove from the area as many people as they can this will be the bed for the man made lake that will be created their reward is one acre and a half of lake front property if they move a certain amount of people br br the third story line centers on the mystical group composed by flower hercules cup of tea cod and happy they are following a possibility of a link to an angel that has been injured in this area when irwin meets them at the cemetery he offers to help only if they take him away at least a thousand miles from here we watch as the quartet examine the feathers the boy has placed among the pages of his bible could irwin be that angel br br the closing sequence show us all parties leaving northfork in different directions the men in black riding their automobiles perhaps going home to enjoy the newly acquired properties given to them as a reward the mystical group is seen boarding a plane and taking off for a higher place we also realize that the child in father harlan in spite of the and the care he received from the saintly figure has died br br michael polish got one of the best ensemble acting from all the principals nick nolte as father harlan turns a low key performance in his portrayal of this kind man james woods as walter one of the men working for the developer does a fine job the biggest surprise is duel farmer who makes an excellent impression as irwin this child actor with the right guidance shows great promise br br the mystical group is brilliantly acted by daryl hannah robin sachs ben foster and anthony edwards the man with the funny spectacles peter coyote mark polish ben foster and the rest of the cast are flawless under mr polish direction br br the beauty of the film relies in its simplicity mr vision will haunt one's memory the images of montana as perhaps an unreal landscape is one of the best things in american films in quite a while
<START> a fairly enjoyable kidnapping caper set in new orleans but its main downfall in my opinion is that it packs way too much political intrigue and double crossing and not enough of the sexy young actors scenes of vibrant colour original cinematographical style and biting humour these aspects combine to give refreshingly daring cinema which makes a whole bunch of recent stuff look unbearably dull let's hope continues with such flair he looks like a talent to watch out for the mismatched bunch of small time crooks in the film are by the investigative partnership of emma thompson and alan rickman the humour of whose scenes is much needed in making the movie what it is the pair pull off their obligatory southern just as well as the yanks and it's a delight to hear these two stalwarts of british cinema yapping away to each other with lethal weapon style fluidity just a pity that the only scenes they have the opportunity to steal are exclusively theirs anyway with a bit less politics and authoritarianism the film would be near perfect so i'll give it a healthy 8 10 and hope that a few people remember it a bit better than the box office did
<START> i loved this movie when i was a teenager loved it it hasn't grown up with me though maybe that's because it's a melodramatic load of old rubbish full of macho posturing cheesy dialogue overwrought slo mo and characters saying a lot the lumpy narrative blobs gracelessly from one character to another one plot strand to another without ever bringing it all together and it doesn't help that william baldwin's mono expression of a performance is wet enough to put out every fire in the movie's overlong runtime robert deniro and donald sutherland are worth watching but no one's really at the top of their game here and the women folk get particularly short thrift the only real impact comes from the impressive firefighting sequences and hans zimmer's majestic score which remains one of my all time favourites
<START> as a native chinese i can not accept this kind of idea that some people must die for a world' i said world' because it is a lie that chinese people have been indoctrinated for thousand years br br i guess most western audience may don't know means the first emperor the king in this film is the most notorious tyrant in ancient china the chinese word was spoken by the king means 'the land and the people' spoken from his mouth is totally lie from then on one after another all the king in ancient china spoke the same thing but very few of them did as what they said br br another fact is empire only lasted about twenty years before it was destroyed by people br br well i do like the beautiful scenes of this movie but it can not make me accept the idea that people should die for a tyrant
<START> in a year when singin' in the rain and high noon were released this overstuffed turkey somehow won the oscar for best picture half the film is nothing more than circus performances the other half is soap opera and melodrama heston and wilde both overact although they are models of restraint compared to the annoying hutton playing a self centered trapeze artist hutton acts like an overzealous high school student in a badly produced school play grahame is the only cast member to turn in a decent performance demille has no interest in telling a good story only in creating an overlong spectacle not matter how dull
<START> i saw this movie on my local cable system under the title of 'beyond redemption' i was searching for new material to watch since most of the reruns one saturday morning didn't interest me i've always been a fan of andrew mccarthy and michael ironside so i chose this movie i was pleasantly surprised br br personally i enjoyed the film rich who posted a comment about the film being spoiled for him by seeing scenes from the movie on the back of a video rental box are well justified i did not have the disappointment of knowing beforehand anything about the film this led me to rate the movie higher than the average score listed on the page br br i like suspense movies and this one was no exception the movie kept me guessing until the very end i was surprised by the ending br br the moments of reflection and remembrance of past experiences by the main character during the film only added to the suspense his reactions to those gave the film a sense of the humanitarian yet side of police work the struggle with his faith is also a welcome addition br br if you like suspense films but also like films that expound on the character's feeling personal inflection side this film is for you br br should you find this movie on your local cable or satellite guide watch it br br however if you are looking for a rental video follow rich advice and have someone get the video for you before watching it
<START> remember those old kung fu movies we used to watch on friday and saturday late nights when our babysitters thought we were in charge well this movie plays exactly like one of those movies patsy biggest claim to fame was the love interest to mel gibson's character in lethal weapon 2 and this performance was one of the reasons why she's never made it big she's a terrible actress br br in lethal weapon 2 i thought she was cute cute enough to check out some of the other movies she'd been in including loves music loves to dance another big let down which i obviously was not impressed with either but as attractive as she is to my eyes my soul screamed at me to turn it off because she played another cheap predictable role and done it very badly br br in this movie kensit stars as a comedienne and not a good one either who's working the clubs of france couldn't cut it in her own homeland so she's making their ears bleed who's down on her luck but even worse the french government wants to throw her out because of an expired visa or maybe they just caught her act but she gets married to this casanova who is just as down on his luck and the predictability begins terribly is there any way to give this movie a negative rating 1 out of 10 stars is over rating it
<START> the priest into profound love and suffering showed not the result of love but the process of love and salvation has high beauty of human or vampire http plaza co jp diary br br and the love of femme fatale is not notorious but lovely in taking the responsible death as a vampire she did not keep falling deep into the paradise lost but decided to leave human alone fragile but lovely femme fatale this movie made me think about suffering between human and vampire that far beyond priest and salvation also i thought about love adam was not so responsible for eve's but this adam priest sacrificial and responsible to pick eve up from the paradise lost vampire's world another symphonic poem of adam eve paradise lost
<START> i'm accustomed to being patient with films because i've generally found it usually pays off but a few works take tedium to new levels and enter the realm of provocation last year at marienbad comes to mind well x ain't no last year at marienbad i can count on one hand the number of films i've walked out on over the years x achieved membership in that august group in my defense i believe i made a valiant effort to stand my ground hoping things would turn around however i finally threw in the towel just shy of the 90 minute mark quite respectable under the circumstances x does not come anywhere near living up to the promise of carax's earlier work after a 10 year hiatus that must have been bitter for him indeed melville is still spinning in his grave
<START> br br is simply david cronenberg's best movie all the people compare it to the matrix they're not even similar if you enjoyed cronenberg's other works just a little bit you'll love this one
<START> if you like bad movies and you must to watch this one here's a good one not quite as funny as the first but much lower quality a must see for fans of jack frost as well as anyone up for a good laugh at the writing
<START> if you came here it's because you've already seen this film and were curious what others had to say about it br br i feel for you i really do and i profusely apologize as a canadian because that's what we do that this film ever had to cross your eyes if only for a moment i hear there is no cure for the bleeding reported out of every dozen cases br br i like everyone else rented this movie believing it to be some stupid b movie ripoff of blade i thought sure i could use a good laugh at a stupid movie i'll give the creators of this film one positive comment about their thanks for removing the rec xx xx xx from the bottom right hand corner of the screen i can see how that would have been a distraction from seeing this movie br br and for the record i saw the movie but did not watch it the dialogue was incoherent and most of the scenes took place in my grandmother's trailer i swear to god br br you know what i'm not writing anymore about this it's just too painful
<START> i adore this film the chemistry between the two leads miller and carlisle is amazing they spark so well off of each other creating an unlikely comedy duo alan cumming is hilarious his enthusiasm for the role is clearly evident as he camps it up the acting is superb and it is a genuinely amusing and touching film not the greatest film ever made i'll admit but it is a huge amount of fun and i would recommend to those who enjoy other gritty brit flicks includes some of the best british actors including michael so you can't go far wrong look out for cameos from david walliams and matt lucas of little britain and rock profile fame
<START> bwana devil is reputedly the first major studio full length feature filmed entirely in the 3d process supposedly producer went to africa to shoot a different movie but after hearing the tale of two man eating lions terrorizing railway builders decided on this one it's a good story too almost hemmingway like fear redemption the great white hunter and all it's the telling of the story that seems to drag almost as though filming in the new process was too weighty for the crew the action scenes are stiff almost too staged but these technical problems appear small in light of the film's dramatic conclusion
