<START> not only does this movie have a great title but quite simply is the greatest drama i have ever watched the viewer is drawn into the movie involving 5 young men working together to try and overcome odds sean astin as billy tepper is brilliant along with great supporting roles from t e russell wil wheaton and shawn phelan the guidance and leadership of and characters makes the movie so much better as time goes on the movie keeps gathering momentum and its a dissapointment that none of the young actors made a name for themselves in the film industry after this wonderful movie
<START> ok it's easy not to confuse this with the lame stuart gordon movie called death bed that came out a few years back because this one is the bed that eats and how do i even begin to describe this well for starters obviously there is a bed that eats this is as a result of demon which of course affect most things i guess in a negative way the bed is in some old servant's quarters or something and has been responsible for the disappearances of quite a few people in its time we have a narrator who is a ghost that sits in the wall behind a painting and collects all the non edible goodies jewelry etc that the bed passes on he died of consumption one of the few people to lay in the bed that didn't get eaten probably because he was sick he as we see him hacking blood into hankies bleah the thing about this movie is that is has a very odd sense of humor to it but it's all played pretty deadpan the movie is divided into several acts i guess breakfast lunch dinner just desserts for fans of the unfathomably weird and bizarre well this may just be right up your alley all i can say is you have to see this one to believe it it pretty well defies description 8 out of 10 stars
<START> this movie features some of the best ensemble work i've seen in film or on stage the actors play off each other with a skill and that in no way can be achieved through editing br br love jones a good story period but it is also an excellent portrayal of the urban middle income twenty something african american set that is not often seen
<START> franÃ§ois mississippi siren had an unconvincing plot the screenplay required too much in suspension of disbelief the plot went at a glacial pace it started off in an interesting setting but soon drifted onto the shoals of melodrama that lacked logic or intelligence what were the critics thinking this one is overrated even to be described as a loser even catherine who charmed in the umbrellas of cherbourg and belle doe jour managed to be simply annoying br br we rented this movie at the same time as we rented another film we watched this one first and found it to be so bad that we sent the other one back unseen at the same time
<START> can't get much eerier than this deep dark film had my heart pumping throughout the lighting is dark and will get you in the mood for a death defying experience literally keifer is in top form as he is today in 24 he's a great actor and he plays a very convincing and shocking role you won't forget for years to come and what can you say for the rest of the cast an all star lineup julia is hotter than ever will oliver and kevin light up the stage in this thriller that will keep you gripping your seats it's a refreshing sight to see a true thriller with top notch professional actors you won't regret seeing this 2 hour seat bender
<START> br br emilio estevez takes the wonderful play homefront and makes it into an engaging movie br br the war at home has an exceptionally strong cast all seemingly digging deep into their characters the acting here is top notch br br credit must also go to director emilio estevez the visual transitions between past and present were ultra smooth the sound effects during the battle scenes were chilling and effectively added to the tension br br remove all of the viet nam elements from the story and still left would be interesting characters wrestling with the good and bad of the full range of family dynamics a viewer might see this point more clearly by keeping in mind the discovering the old photo scene from the beginning as the rest of the movie is watched br br as a movie i found the war at home to be more direct and to the point than born on the 4th of july a fine effort almost a 10 br br
<START> well first of all it's not a bad movie it is good and i like the characters introduced i also like lady and voices more in this br br however i would like to see lady and tramp more i know it says adventure' and i love scamp and angel to bits but it's a sequel to the original where in my opinion they should of just released it as adventure' not 'lady and the tramp ii adventure' br br tramp did have quite a role but he didn't have much time with lady br br but anyway the songs are quite good and scamp and angel are sweet i've seen better sequels but hey it's not a failure br br i give it 7 10 very good but still had flaws
<START> we thought this was one of the worst movies ever i had to volunteer to watch the end the romance was not believable the characters were not developed the love affair made hardly any sense it was miscast and scenery was absolutely stupid because it was either my opinion like the adams family goes on vacation just creepy gypsy and cheesy and the does not look typically like those houses on the surf and who would spend the night in one during a hurricane if it was not theirs also it was not realistic give you plenty of notice to down the hatches br br also the friend was superfluous and did not match the story what did the civil war have to do with the anyway i also have to mention the wardrobe did d lane have to have a scarf shawl on in every scene it was overdone she looked good enough to not have to hide things without making them obvious like with light slacks br br lastly i am concerned with the impact on our landfills when everyone has to dispose of this stupid and i mean stupid movie don't fall for the hype on this one we did not even watchable
<START> this is one of the best and vampire tales ever i love this movie really the character are great even the locations and the story indeed the picture isn't a big budget production but it is absolutely worth seeing br br ok there are some faults especially the names of the castle and the locations in this movie but such mistakes are typically and are almost in every horror movie br br the scenery fits perfect to the story and is close to reality i can say that honest because i visit them once when i was in romania in my vacations br br in my opinion this is the best part of the subspecies series
<START> very typical almodÃ³var of the time and in its own way no less funny than many of his later works and why is that there is nothing to be provoked or shocked about and i guess any such effect is more coincidental than intentional no the great humor stems from an underlying almost surreal absurdity that is woven into the scenery the characters' nearly complete lack of taboo it's the same kind of 'comic suspense' you find in his later works though you'll find it in a more rough version here he's building up for masterpieces to come but is not yet there br br the sole reviewer who commented on this movie before i did claimed that it had to be a very select group of people who'd find this movie hilarious i do
<START> i am a fan of slasher movies especially of scream 1 3 but this one is just one killing after another to my astonishment part ii is far better and you get the whole story of part one summarized so don't waste time on this one and move right on to part ii you won't regret it cause part 2 actually has a plot and is quite self ironical first part 1 out of 10 second part 4 out of 10
<START> this show is pathetic i can't even begin to imagine how anyone with an iq greater than that of a can of split pea soup that's past its expiration date can willingly sit through this garbage for an entire half hour it is one of those rare shows that is so mind numbingly awful in every respect you can honestly say you are less intelligent simply from watching it i conducted a study and found that the average person loses 10 iq points for every fifteen seconds they watch this show that is second only to another comedy network abortion 19 221 iq points per second lost and pretty much a tie with girls will be girls keys to the vip owes each and every one of us an apology whenever i watch this travesty of a show i feel sad for society how is it allowed to continue
<START> i remember seeing this film when i was about 10 one of my friends had it at the time it was just a film as i was about and just thought of it as another action film br br when i look back now as a complete film buff this is quite a shockingly bad film whoever produced this film i am sure had a short hollywood career although the lead actor seems to have done a few films according to imdb albeit i haven't seen any and don't really remember him too much br br anyway just to say that this film is really bad in all ways it could be i would love to see it again though od

<START> with all the hype surrounding the stars of the movie this movie left me wanting i expected a much better movie considering the inclusion of the talents of murphy de niro and russo but found that the movie fell flat on it's face comedy sequences were overdone and the superior performances of the stars especially de niro and russo couldn't save this one br br out of
