<START> i thought this would be a fun comedy with no sex or nudity in it well there's no sexual content but as for being a fun comedy i only remember laughing a total three times during the green butchers the hilarity is centered around cannibalism and mental retardation which is just sick humor in a bad way br br i should have walked out of this film and i'm kicking myself because i didn't in fact i shouldn't have seen this movie in the first place the only good that came out of this film was was the fact that and his brother finally made amends and put their ugly past behind them i advise any well meaning individual to steer clear of this gross out flick
<START> am i the only one to think that this is a bad movie br br i admit that horror movies often lack things like a big story or good acting or even good special effects but the way these deficiencies come together in this movie is surprisingly pitiful br br miserable story the idea of a raped vagina that takes revenge by turning into a man eater sounds quite funny but what the writer made out of it is stupid br br bad acting the actors move like marionettes they play and look like people who really try hard but completely fail to act br br bad fx especially the explosion of the van looks unspeakably cheap br br it is surprising that a director who made some nice movies during his carrier changes over to such messy stuff
<START> i can pretend no knowledge of cinematography or mr angelopoulos but i know greece and i love her people in july my 14 year old son and i traveled to turkey in search of some remains of the neighborhood where his great grandfather lived until the great exodus of greeks in 1923 reading the summary of the film refugees from odessa i thought that perhaps i might learn something more about the forced migrations of modern greeks if i did not have a home in rhodes had i not been to greece 28 times in as many years were i not familiar with dozens of islands and cities in greece and if i had never enjoyed the friendship of these ebullient life intoxicated people i might have believed that this had something to do with modern greece as a professor at a new jersey state college let me assure you that i am familiar with the history of the period covered in the film indeed my wife's uncle was murdered by the communists during the communist grab for power my mother in law lived through the italian invasion and german occupation barely these characters on the screen speak greek they listen to greek music but who are they no they are not even vaguely greek of course they are not people at all but simply allegories they are that which the artist invents when life does not entirely fit or is inadequate to his perception of how it was or should have been all represent some aspect of post wwi greece that greater outside forces consigned to a fate they didn't deserve as we joked in the late 70's in america the revolution didn't happen for an ideologue artist this is no joke it's in fact grounds to put us through two and a half hours of torment and it's all because the various powers soliloquy of guards in different colored uniforms didn't allow the generation after the aristocrats of 1919 to follow the call of peace and freedom the music of nikos and his fellow musicians i e the movement the cause this dark surreal revisionism smears the true and heroic efforts of the greek people to sustain their lust for life through the tragedies of the 20th century to achieve more than any of their balkan neighbors to have become so politically evolved and globally integrated
<START> still haven't read a single dan brown book but i watched all his movies adaptations i won't fall into the game to rate this one with the previous because the scope isn't really the same actually this one is a thriller a race against time filled with puzzles br br the plot is very twisted imaginative and the cast is excellent i never been a great fan of hanks but he delivers well i noticed his jeans shirt the one spilled with blood because i search for one like this in vain the italian is a brilliant newcomer for me but i really applauded ewan macgregor portrayal his inner faith and calm is really impressive br br i really like the debate between science and religion the action taking place in the vatican it felt like vacation at last i am not sure it helps to add new converts into with all the gold and man presence displayed any one would ask what charity means and why women are so dismissed of the church life whereas they stand for half or more the believers
<START> i saw this movie many years ago and just for kicks decided to rent it and watch it again the plot is a carbon copy from fright night i did like the hairy vampire and the bug eating driver otherwise it was not good at all
<START> i actually found out about rising via the imdb website i have a particular interest in afro brazilian culture and films rising is one of those gems that gives a new meaning to human transformation beautifully documented and filmed by jeff zimbalist and matt its the story anderson sa a former rio de janeiro drug trafficker who after the deaths of family members and friends becomes a christ like malcolm x and ghandi all rolled into one sa formed a grassroots cultural movement that uses afro brazilian hiphop afro brazilian martial arts drumming and other to transform the hopeless and most times angry youth into vibrant viable caring community loving individuals br br a few years ago i remember going to a screening of city of god de deus and walked out of the theatre completely numb the images were grim yet stunning and you couldn't take your eyes off the screen i remember how hopeless some situations were in the favelas and how decadent the society was due to the governments neglect how drug trafficking was a way of life how indifferent the citizens of the slums were because death was an every day occurrence like city of god anderson sa talks about how the people of the favelas were also desensitized he talks about the police corruption and how the communities were so by drugs and gangs that you couldn't visit family members in other favelas you had to meet in a neutral location unlike city of god anderson grassroots movement provides solutions to the anger the hopelessness br br there was one part in the documentary where anderson in the spirit of a preacher approached some youth and asked them to join these jaded youth were so scarred by everyday survival and violence their role models were drug dealers and this is what they aspired to be anderson told then that drug dealers don't live very long there was reluctance of course but five months later he was able to get some of the youth to join br br the visuals in rising are beyond amazing its clear to me that jeff zimbalist and matt are not only great story tellers but visual artist as well this is a must see documentary there are some really magical and transforming moments in this documentary i don't want to spoil them for you i want you see it for yourself please tell your friends academics youth counselors family members about this wonderful film it will make you care about the world and our children br br i would give it eleven stars
<START> i rented this when it came out on video cassette in 1995 after rewatching it again my idea about it hasn't changed much br br i was an adult then and i'm still an adult now lol br br the illogical elements mentioned by other reviewers didn't bother me this isn't a documentary it's a fantasy story where animals can talk br br while i didn't care for much of the songs i liked the one at the end of the picture where it's sang by barry manilow and another person br br some people seem to make an excuse for it's primitive animation by saying that cgi wasn't used often in animated features but let's not forget that the lion king was released about a year earlier and that packed possibly more excellence than any animated feature that came before it br br but i think it's pretty fair to say that the pebble and the was made on the cheap while the lion king wasn't br br the high points for me in 1995 as well as today is the suspense generated by the few dangerous mostly underwater chase scenes br br i also liked the opening scene which takes place on a music notes page and a little bit of the love story but most of the time the story dragged on and was boring br br worth a look if you like animation but if you're an adult and not a risk taker go get another walt disney production instead of this
<START> it's just one of those films you're either love it or hate it my girlfriend and me loved it told my brother to rent it and he hated it said it was too flashy and colloquial then again he only usually goes to see big action movies so probably not enough explosions left him disappointed there were some great new talent i'd never heard of the leads before anyway des brady the directors brother was especially good playing a right dick at the start i thought he never would redeem himself but he managed to crawl out of the dark hole he had created and by the end i was really routing for him a very surprising film with a whole lot of heart if you can live without a body count and explosions then this one is very original in the uk
<START> well i fell for it i saw the box for this at the video store and mistook it for girlfight which i'd heard was great in my own defense the titles are similar and they re did the cover art for the box so it looked almost identical anyway to sum it up they obviously re did the whole cover packaging promo to capitalize on the buzz success of girlfight i popped it in and got a bad feeling when they started showing trailers for low budget straight to video flicks and even worse when a music video of the main song for the movie which sounded like elevator music and featured corny slomo clips from the movie preceded the main feature when i saw the first few minutes and maria conchita alonso showed up i knew i'd fallen for it don't get me wrong she's a talented actress but i knew she wasn't in girlfight the movie i'd been under the false impression i was renting br br so apart from me feeling sort of cheated and mad at myself for not looking closer the movie was ok the plot involves belle a young latino woman who is the daughter of an ex champion boxer one of her close friends is a female boxer who and i could see all this coming sooo far ahead of time it was really a drag gets seriously injured during a match with a mean champ named the terminator who resembles a female version of a bigger more pumped up ike turner of course belle decides that the only thing to do is to become a boxer herself and avenge her friend she lives with her caring supportive yet protective dad her mother died of cancer when she was younger who just happens to be a cop her love interest also caring and supportive yet protective is also a cop who works with her dad hmmm they both have jobs that put their lives in danger in the line of duty wonder what's gonna happen she starts training and meets a sleazy manager who of course pretends to care about her but just wants to exploit her the actor they hired looks like a very low rent cary and is so young he barely manages to have a mustache his acting was also really really bad i'm not even going to go into the plot any further because anyone who has seen rocky or almost anyone knows exactly where this movie is going and how it will end br br this was not a completely terrible movie most of the acting was ok and the lead actress was very good there were good strong female latino role models the final fight scene did get me sort of interested even though i knew everything that was going to happen long before it did the actress that played the terminator did a great job of being unlikeable enough that i really did want belle to kick her a and rooted for belle again although there were absolutely no surprises my favorite moment maybe the only moment where i wasn't mad at myself for renting the movie by mistake was when belle slaps her sleazy manager after he's shown his true colors yells at him and then turns away only to suddenly fake a punch and watch him cringe back in fear showing that she is really the one in charge br br the dialogue was really really bad my main complaint one of their attempts to be witty was someone discussing boxing saying size doesn't matter and the female replying wryly now where have i heard that before other lines that are supposed to have dramatic impact are the doctors told me i may never walk again come on you know you can trust me and your mother would have been so proud of you i could go on and on nothing you haven't heard a million times before in bad soap operas or movies of the week br br maybe i'm being too mean the filmmakers did make an effort and i did sit through the whole thing voluntarily but only because there was nothing else to watch while i worked out you could do worse especially if you are looking for a movie with strong female characters but you could also do much much better
<START> daisy movie review by james mudge from com br br on paper daisy sounds like an asian film fan's dream come true directed by infernal affairs co helmer andrew lau and starring everybody's favourite sassy girl popular korean actress jeon ji hyun unfortunately despite the talent involved and the fact that the crew flew halfway around the world to shoot in amsterdam the film turns out to be a bit of a disappointment being a romantic drama which wallows in misery and self importance br br the plot follows young jeon ji hyun a rather naive korean girl who lives in amsterdam spending her life working in her grandfather's antique shop and doing portraits for tourists one day she begins receiving flowers at exactly the same time from a secret admirer who she believes to be a mystery man from her past who once built her a nice little bridge one day she meets jeong woo lee also in holiday and public enemy who unbeknownst to her is actually an interpol agent tracking asian criminals in the netherlands br br with young assuming that jeong woo is responsible for the flowers the two fall very slowly into a chaste romantic relationship however it turns out that the man sending the flowers is actually park yi jung woo sung from sad movie and musa an assassin working for a chinese crime syndicate inevitably the love triangle turns tragic and the two men end up facing off while poor young tries to work out which of the two is the love of her life br br although daisy is ostensibly a love story it has the feel of a funeral with a slow sombre pace and a plot which piles on the misery half of the film's running time is taken up with scenes of the characters staring longingly out of windows into the rain with the silence broken only by bouts of self pitying narration director lau seems to be under the impression that the film is a weighty shakespearean tragedy rather than yet another gloomy hit man love story as such the proceedings have a rather pretentious air despite the fact that the plot is inherently predictable and based largely around glaring clichÃ© borrowed liberally from the likes of fulltime killer and john woo's classic the killer br br almost every aspect of the film is riddled with angst with the three lead characters suffering as if the weight of the world was on their shoulders and steadfastly refusing to do anything to pursue their romantic inclinations park yi in particular as the kind of overly emotional socially retarded assassin so beloved of modern cinema is faintly ludicrous from his blatant incompetence on the job to his hilarious attempts to discuss impressionist painting with young or his penchant for flower growing this languid passivity does make the film's central romance somewhat hard to swallow and lau's attempts to evoke the feeling that it is fate which brings the characters together comes across more as shoddy coincidence br br fans of jeon ji hyun should note that her character is far closer to her role in the glum supernatural drama the uninvited than my sassy girl or and while she tries her best to pull a few wacky faces here and there her performance is certainly more subdued br br the film benefits from glossy production values and lau makes good use of the amsterdam scenery playing on the contrast between the grey almost gothic beauty of the city and the innocent blue skies and flowery fields of the countryside unfortunately he tends to overuse slow motion for some of the emotional scenes which when coupled with some of the picture postcard visuals gives the film the feel at times of a perfume advert there are a few scenes of surprisingly violent action though these are few and far between and whilst well staged seem to have been thrown in as an afterthought and do little more than briefly raising the pulse br br despite its flaws daisy makes for engaging viewing and the story grips almost in spite of itself mainly out of a morbid fascination to see not which of the men young will end up with but to see who will lie dying in her arms the self indulgent melodrama works well enough to tick all the right boxes for the genre and the film functions perfectly well as an enjoyably glossy weepy romance br br it is worth noting that the dvd features the director's cut of the film which for once indicates that it is substantially different from the theatrical version which not only adds 25 minutes but some of the scenes making the narrative less linear although this new version is perhaps too long it is surely superior as without these changes the film would surely have been even more conventional and would have suffered from even murkier character development br br wai keung lau director young screenplay cast woo sung jung Â park yi sung lee Â jeong woo david chiang Â cho ho jin jeon Â detective jang ji hyun jun Â young dion lam Â yun joon ha
<START> i've seen foxy brown coffy friday foster bucktown and black mama white mama of these this is pam grier's worst movie poor acting bad script boring action scenes there's just nothing there avoid this and rent friday foster coffy or foxy brown instead
<START> a rather mild horror movie if not for a couple of sex scenes it could easily have been a tv movie plot holes abound one example why would there be a secret passage from the 18th century leading from the upper floor of a house that was burned to the ground and a new building put ther 200 years later cardboard acting characters doing things that anyone with an iq bigger than their shoe size wouldn't do br br it's got a few fun moments but overall it's a sub par film that managed to get roy scheider because his bills were due if you're looking for an extremely formulaic predictable film that might provide a few laughs it might be worth watching if not then this one's not for you
<START> aside from frank who played abraham gentry an appearance by henny youngman and the last seconds of the movie there really wasn't anything particularly good about this film why it is currently rated 5 3 and adored by some reviewers is beyond me the film is 99 44 crap and exactly what i would have expected from director hershell gordon lewis in the 1960s and 70s lewis was known for making a string of incredibly low budget exploitation films such as blood feast and monster a go go however in recent years he's been christened the father of gore and he has many many fans fans who ignore the ineptitude of his work and only focus on how groundbreaking some of his films were but apart from the liberal use of fake blood and real guts at heart his films are pure crap and don't believe scores of 9 and 10 for his films this would be like putting a velvet elvis painting in the louvre br br the film is about a string of very grisly murders that happen to strippers when i say gruesome it's very bloody and sick for 1972 though by today's standards the special effects look amazingly lame so while some very deviant and cruel murders happen in the film i'd rather not explain them they are from a pretty sick mind and show a particularly sick disregard for women at least they won't you because they were done so poorly it's obvious that in many cases they are cutting apart rubber dolls and mannequins but to have them doing some of the sick acts even if unrealistic is pretty nasty and shows a lot of misogyny br br the only hope in the film as the police are all idiots is a guy named abraham gentry whose mannerisms and style of speech are very close to the stock actor david from the early john waters films while his acting is bad he is so flamboyant and funny that he kept my interest he could be pretty funny and oddly this is the only film he ever made it was also odd that so many women wanted him especially because they just didn't seem like his type br br as for the rest of the folks in the film they are cretins and idiots who could not act in fact i was kind of hoping more would be killed they really had it coming none of their acting was the least bit believable and apparently the director never re shot a single scene as most of the scenes in the film were worse than any of the ones in ed wood's masterpiece plan 9 from outer space in fact for many of the women in the film the only prerequisite for their appearing in the film is that they be willing to take off their clothes now i know this will sound pretty mean but most of them were incredibly unattractive and looked like drug addicts who strip to get their next fix when these ladies take off their clothes men in the crowd give them money to put it back on wow henny youngman should have said that in the film but considering lewis' budgets these were probably the best actresses he could get br br overall a sleazy bucket of bile that manages to be worse than most of the director's other films and that's saying a lot it's violent yet dumb anti women treating them like meat and things to be mutilated and is thoroughly incompetent from start to finish
<START> films like this infuriate me simply because they don't deserve the funding that enables them to end up in my dvd player this movie is ambiguous in its jacket blurb and even more impenetrable in its casting choices why is ms song a romantic interest did they just want an asian woman in there or does her unconvincingly wise character actually lend this message movie's story a fresh perspective one has very little to go on in approaching this film and even less as the story unfolds but a good hour into the proceedings i realized the dull casting is all the casting agent could dredge up the unconvincing character studies are the result of writers' brain fart and the story is amorphous and plagued by unsubtle references to the woes of capitalism materialism and getting ahead in the postmodern world towards the end of this film just before i nodded off and missed the last two minutes i got the sense that everything's gone green is a product of connections in the world of film someone with very little talent knew someone with very little directorial skill knew someone with absolutely no marketing sense but plenty of disposable ego and out popped this dull and inefficient attempt at whimsy and humor with a conscience nonsense and this is what is most maddening how many infinitely better scripts were passed over in favor of this almost unwatchable tripe skip this film and feel good about yourself for doing so
<START> great acting is best rewarded by pairing with a melodramatic script which truly elevates the human spirit to all those minions who toil each and every day take heart your patience is virtuous your and decency will evidence in ways you will never anticipate this is your great story i do not believe you can watch through to the end without a wisp of moisture in that hardened eye or can you for me it would not be so the story is relentless the idealist denied his due will anyone speak up ah but you will need to see the show yourselves observe the schoolmaster in his prime without the notice and the observer would certainly expect and why does he continue so yes you must watch o'toole's performance for yourselves i can only wish it were still 'in to purchase then present to my friends as my evidence of respect for their faithful lives
