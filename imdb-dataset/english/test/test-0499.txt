<START> like the blair witch project before it hatchet has garnered its own fair share of publicity from the bottom on up as an avid reader of fangoria magazine the full page ads are hard to miss even after its middling theatrical run the film is bound to subsist solely on the hype surrounding it and will probably turn into a cult item at some point with a myspace url and a mighty if puzzlingly subjective promise of preserving so called old school american horror hatchet will draw a lot of curiosity seekers with its dvd release where that claim is emblazoned on the disc itself perhaps it was the large print blurb from ain't it cool news on the ads that caused me to approach the film with some trepidation it seems that harry knowles and his minions will approve of any film for vip passes and free food but hatchet makes me question what writer director adam green's idea of old school american horror really is based on the evidence here it means the insipid late '80s rip offs of friday the 13th and deliverance the characters are obnoxious stereotypes black chris tucker type survivalist chick topless bimbos requisite old couple asian tour guide whose interactions are marred by painful trying to be hip dialogues and mostly obvious stabs at humor not quite as bad as cabin fever but still the script has too much padding the rustling bush scene for example and hatchet winds up as typical as any postmodern slasher of the last decade with its only distinguishing trait an expertly calculated hype machine i'll give it some faint praise for the gore if you can wade through the padding in between kills the red is definitely a thing of wonder and the only real reason to watch this
<START> this is the worst film i have ever seen and what disappoints me the most is that this is yash raj film so at first when you see the promos you think yes thats definitely another yash raj hit but when you see the film your eyes will water with disappoint the storyline is stupid and dumb we've seen it many times boy is soon to marry and falls in love with a girl blah blah blah if you do see this pathetic film don't go with you family there is too much exposure and kiss scene i don even see why you would go to see it on your own overall this is a disgraceful disgusting and anything else which is bad and starts with a d film don't go to see it you'll end up hating yash ji and yash raj films
<START> this is one of those films you can have on for a couple of hours on a sunday morning able to do other things with no real complications in losing any understanding of the proceedings and gaining some fascination in wondering why such mediocrities acquired the manpower and financial resources to be produced in the first place br br of course with all the cable channels as well as lifetime's need to fill its time slots with 100 or so hours worth of movies per week along with incessant golden girls reruns this type of fare is now a t v staple also it seems these flicks provide livelihood to the canadian locales where most are made as well as the host of canadian actors appearing in them br br tori spelling like the ferret face paris hilton is somebody who if not for family connections and resources would likely be working at the gap but at least tori has become say a c level thespian appearing in occasional presentations appropriate to this level br br this story is one which has been seen on lifetime and similar venues god knows how many times devious woman a total sociopath trying to screw up everyone else's lives operating during the initial parts of the story with more cleverness than a cia operative could muster committing murder when necessary and out to wreck the life of the flick's heroine br br as usual the male lead is a completely clueless dolt and in these types of films one finds say characters about whom one can really care about 10 of the time this one is in the other 90
<START> i loved this movie it's the finest parody of russian cinema to date who else but sokurov could lampoon tarkovsky so brilliantly you thought stalker was slow well step up to the plate mat i makes stalker look like raiders of the lost ark by no means should you miss this film there's no excuse even if you live a busy life you can still enjoy this film to its fullest by holding down the fast forward button on your vcr sokurov has given us the first feature length film that can be appreciated in 12 minutes br br i suppose the next great masterpiece of the form will come when someone has the vision and courage to exhibit a film that consists of no sound or image at all 45 minutes of a black silent screen wasn't this already explored in in the soup br br apparently the filmmaker and fans have forgotten that motion is the first word of motion picture br br major spoilers ahead br br want to reach the heights of genius that this film achieved here's a step by step guide br br 1 find a talented photographer br br 2 find some subjects and a suitably picturesque landscape think tuscany if you need inspiration watch some luxury car or perfume commercials br br 3 shoot about 3 rolls of film br br 4 photoshop the results to play around with saturation blur aspect ratio br br 5 now just get out your movie camera film 40 of the best pictures and have your actors mumble their lines off screen don't worry about writing it ahead of time just let the actors say whatever they want lines like do you want a drink and let's get something to eat are really all you need to fill up 8 minutes or so if you can't think of enough dialog no problem just have them repeat what they say a few times if that still isn't enough just let the camera run anyway br br congratulations another masterpiece as a bonus if you want to distribute it over the internet no problem the static images will compress down to nothing with standard a 73 minute movie would probably be about 2 3 even at the highest quality levels
<START> one of the best and most exciting of all conspiracy thrillers there were a number of such film in the 1970's this one is about an accident at a reactor and of the attempts to cover it up jack lemmon is the employee who realizes just how dangerous the plant is and jane fonda is the crusading television reporter who takes the story on board and both players are at their best br br the events portrayed in the film are of course terrifying and not in the least bit far fetched much of what happens here happened in real life at three mile island and although it now looks like something a period piece it nevertheless highlights just how fragile and dangerous a world we have created for ourselves expect a number of similar films about the effects of global warming any time soon and not rubbish like the day after tomorrow either
<START> female convict scorpion beast stable the third in the series is a magnificent piece of pulp sleaze closer in tone and subject to a violent than other scorpion entries it is stunningly photographed directed with lurid enthusiasm and populated with a rogue's gallery of villains and degenerates shinya ito the director of the first installment returns for this surreal fable which begins with scorpion cutting the arm off a cop she is handcuffed to and fleeing into the tokyo subway with said arm still swinging from her wrist she takes refuge in a red light district where she befriends a prostitute who is first seen seen having incestuous intercourse with her brother who ends up impregnating her scorpion's desire to protect this unfortunate woman eventually exposes her identity and all hell breaks loose she is beaten sexually assaulted and locked inside a bizarre bird cage in the villain's lair i loved everything about this hypnotic nihilistic and emotionally touching movie it is the superior of the three first scorpion films and features one great scene after another i can't recommend it highly enough
<START> all i can say about this movie is it is absolutely boring the intro to the movie is quite possibly the worst intro to a horror film i have ever seen i mean a angry chick hitting a guy in the head with a frying pan isn't at all frightening which is what i assume the director was aiming for but in fact it was mildly funny br br the acting in this picture was beyond pathetic a note to directors if your making a horror film please hire some good actors not some popular teen soap star who has no idea how to act br br the death scenes in this movie were beyond boring no gore and i'm sorry but horror movies without gore or good suspense are just cheesy i mean this girl gets killed by hair wrapped all around her in the middle of tokyo and not one person sees it happen they just declare her as missing wow thats awesome br br in conclusion if you and your friends want to see this movie make sure u bring some sleeping pills because i guarantee you won't make it to the end me and my friend walked out cause we didn't even care what happened at the end br br cheers
<START> or if you've seen the evil dead trilogy and or bubba ho tep then you should know that his movies are total farces with man with the screaming brain he goes all out again in this case he plays smarmy american businessman william cole visiting bulgaria when do we ever get to see that country when a woman kills him so strange scientist ivan stacy keach replaces half of cole's brain with the brain of a former kgb agent leaving him acting sort of like steve martin in all of me br br yes the whole movie is pretty much an excuse for pure nonsense much of the real humor comes from evil dead director sam raimi's brother ted as nearly brain dead assistant the two men have a relationship more like laurel and hardy or gilligan and the skipper br br so just understand that this is a totally silly movie and you won't be a bit disappointed i liked it anyway
<START> if you haven't seen this film do it its a as i've never seen another some very surreal scenes some hilarious funny stuff a film noir felling musical numbers with a swing sex scenes the 2nd best played orgasm on film bested only by sally a pitch of orson welles blended together into a work of art as an work of art it hasn't to be logical at the end at least not logical for everybody i owned an tv copy on vhs but loaned it to an ex girlfriend and now i can't get it back but the film should be out on dvd in austria on 10 06 03 and be sure i will buy it
<START> i'm an opera buff and operas are full of sex blood and death it may help to know the of the operas the arias are from to really appreciate this film my mileage is very different than tug 3 i am a classical music lover and i liked this film br br i loved ken russell's nessun dorma segment and would actually like to see him produce turandot because opera is supposed to be overwhelming truly multi media experience but then i loved i love turandot and knowing the libretto so well may be why i don't find this segment the travesty that tug 3 did br br the buck henry rigoletto segment is probably the most approachable for the average viewer they are likely to recognize the tunes and its a classic bedroom farce i like bedroom farces so the silliness didn't upset me br br the segment is so outstanding that i recommend people watch this for that piece alone la jour was for me beautifully spiritual and the caruso recording of la aka i with john hurt as the clown was wonderful but people just wanting naked women may feel there is too much music and not enough bare flesh and sex
<START> one unfortunate reality of post soviet russia was that the people's welfare didn't change much from soviet times as we see in window to paris most people are still as depressed as ever while they are encouraged to go after money br br then everything changes for music teacher nikolai sergei after he finds a window that leads to paris he and his friends are naturally quite amazed at what they find this movie has one of the funniest discussions of elvis presley and edith piaf that i've ever heard so watch this movie you're sure to love it it's sort of a precursor to being john malkovich
<START> wow i saw this movie and up on the same day within an hour of each other at different theaters i saw mr bug first and was then totally disappointed in up 's follow up what a beautiful and touching film movies of the 1930s and 40s to us nowadays can be with their melodramatic acting and dialog but as animation the same melodrama and groaning humor can be wonderful and the soft organic lines of 30s drawing and the music just puts you in a nice comfortable mood and you can enjoy the show with all its little characters ladybugs grasshoppers bees snails flies mosquitoes beetles crickets and more each with all their own cute little but not overbearing idiosyncrasies the interaction with the human world from nemesis cigar smokers high heel wearers innocent kick the can playing kids to the kind hearted and to the unknown destroyers is realistic and fascinating you care for the bugs and dick and mary the protagonist is not some perfect superman who comes to set things right but a starry eyed optimist who leads everyone down the garden path literally and every time you think it's going to end happily in 1930s style along comes another roadblock i was on the edge of my seat much more than with up i walked out of the movie theater grinning and chuckling something that hasn't happened in a long long long long time
<START> ok just what the hell is all this supposed to mean halloween 6 let's just call it that ok is without a doubt the most confusing film in the series and from what i've heard seeing the original producers cut doesn't sound like it makes things any less bewildering than the official release what a mess br br this isn't a really bad film as some have said it has its scary scenes and some rather intense moments it just doesn't make any sense don't tell me that michael was engineered from the beginning to be evil and kill and destroy and blah blah blah it was bad enough when they turned michael into jamie lee curtis' brother just so they had an excuse to keep her in the second film this is too much br br it would seem this is another case of the creators of the film trying to be too smart by coming up with a new premise that will shock and impress us all bad move guys we're not looking for an explanation of why michael kills so please don't try and feed us this crap show me michael looking menacing and killing a bunch of people show me dr loomis trying to track him down and as always coming up just short don't waste what turned out to be the last performance of donald pleasance by telling me in the most confusing way possible that michael was created by some cult from hell and that his seed will be passed on to another and oh brother br br halloween 6 has its moments don't get me wrong and we all know there have been far worse sequels than this hellraiser anyone so get what you can out of it the scene toward the end of the film with michael charging down a deep red corridor is particularly effective and try to ignore the screwball plot hopefully one day we can all see the producer's cut and maybe get the chance to make a bit more sense out of all of this till then this will have to do br br
<START> it's just stories some we wish happen to us some we wish never happen to us all about unfulfilled desire the locations and nude bodies are beautiful but after the second story all i could think was 'it takes more than just beauty to create a real film' then of course the film unfolds the stories are moving except sophie fails to communicate her story in this film malkovich plays the story for both of them though the voiceover fails to link the stories but helps malkovich to provoke some thought br br i'd say it is worth seeing and the best of antonioni i have seen given his age remarkable
<START> the first time i watched this show it was ok there were some funny moments and i laughed a couple of times but this show is getting worse and worse carly and sam's web show is not the least bit funny they play a stupid video from the internet scream at the camera and make some very bad jokes and then the laugh track goes off one problem with the show is that none of the main characters are funny carly is not funny miranda acting is lackluster at best her acting in this show is nothing like her acting from drake and josh her friend sam is very rude and crude and the show is written in a way that makes her look like some kind of hillbilly i mean they make jokes about her mom driving a rusty old truck her mom smashing an old tv with a bat and then there's the jokes about sam failing in school getting detention all the time and running from cops none of that is funny at all then there's freddy who is a computer geek he isn't too funny unless his mom is treating him like a baby the show's only somewhat funny full time character is brother spencer he makes some funny jokes and does some pretty funny things like pretending to drive a space ship while making spaceship noises knocking over a girl cookie table for revenge as they did the same thing to him his material is the only thing worth laughing at aside from the characters other things make the show bad too like the fact that a couple of kids doing a local web show from a seattle apartment is a worldwide hit and got them a free trip to tokyo another thing is that how can a 26 year old single guy with no real job can pay for a 2 level apartment in downtown seattle and raise his 13 year old sister and pay for a room full of camera and sound equipment including a remote controlled projector and a green screen and an hd camera this sounds like it was written by a 10 year old the worst thing is that the show contains some pretty questionable content there are a couple of times when carly remember a 13 year old girl appears on her internet web show in a bikini top wtf then i saw an episode where freddy tells carly and sam that he slept in just his socks the night before i mean wtf then there's an episode where rival blackmails her by taking her website rights and agrees to give her the website back in exchange for a kiss creepy and i just saw an episode where carly meets a boy who just moved into their apartment building and he has some kind of back injury and he takes off his shirt and carly stands there drooling over him i can't believe nick even lets them show that kind off stuff and i can't believe that this was created by the same guy responsible for drake and josh this show is not appropriate for kids under the age of 12 and that's even questionable is just another addition to the long list of awful nick programming
