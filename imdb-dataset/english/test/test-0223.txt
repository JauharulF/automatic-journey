<START> i enjoy the national anthem i enjoy the national anthem if for nothing else then just before the midnight news i imagine i'm playing the in the band not as easy as you may think one two three four one two three four but then what so i have sympathy with the practising bass drum player in roy wonderful film patiently waiting for his cue listening to a very 70s cassette player br br the 70s motif seems to continue throughout with some classic soulless furniture moreover every scene has an eerie jade wash which emphasises the minute nuances of the of acting br br which brings me to outstanding purple boots boots which otherwise would have inspired a silk cult advertising campaign br br but then the difficult bit someone asked me what it was about well there is a scene where the opening line as i don't have that length in green brilliant straight out of a gary larson carton br br i can't say what it's about go see yourself br br ron plasma br br hmm larson sounds swedish br br viewed
<START> i had my son for the weekend and my parent's called me up and said that they wanted the two of us to meet them at the movies when i got there my mom said that she really wanted to see the women and asked if my son and i minded due to it being labeled as a chick flick i reluctantly agreed thinking this was going to be another first wives club type movie i gotta say that i was very surprised to find myself really enjoying the movie from the opening scene to the credits it was a great production and the cast was perfect in their roles my son and i found ourselves laughing through entire movie and we are glad that we saw it it made for a great saturday afternoon movie and i highly recommend it to anyone man or woman
<START> the opening scene keeps me from rating at absolute zero i wish the entire movie was as gritty and real as the intro br br in order to enjoy some movies a lot can be forgiven hand guns with 60 shots hero's with super human powers all women are gorgeous and half naked but this assault on my intelligence 13 is so far fetched that i'm surprised the cast showed up for a second day of filming br br firstly how did these guys get to be cops based on stupidity i guess how do the main female characters justify being half naked in the middle of winter in detroit or wherever the heck they are as a matter of fact no character reacts to the elements whatsoever in this movie no windows no electricity which miraculously returns unexplained during the storm of the century and they are all comfy as bugs in a rug what technology exists which all cell phones radios and brain function this must be the same power which causes maria bella to walk from her disabled car knee deep in snow with no coat and hardly any dress
<START> rather than go on location and make a realistic film about drug addiction in the windy city director otto preminger decided to go the opposite way and make his movie appear as artificial as possible thus flying in the face of the fashion set by men like kazan huston and zinnemann who were making their pictures all over the world nelson on whose novel the movie is based went on record as despising it what one wonders was preminger up to and why did he do the movie this way br br the sets in the film are so minimal as to suggest a mr magoo cartoon louie the drug pusher is attired as to resemble the sort of gangster the artists at mad magazine used to draw arnold wonderful comedian that he was seems out of place in a serious picture like this and his very appearance topped off by an exaggerated and over sized baseball cap elicits laughter robert strauss another actor best known for humorous roles is likewise out of place as his large heavily face and runyonesque delivery of lines seems more appropriate to a jerry lewis movie against all this stars frank sinatra kim novak and eleanor parker have to work overtime to just keep the viewer from snickering sinatra is jittery and manic throughout suggesting a man ill at ease with himself hence wholly appropriate for the role of a drug addict miss novak plant like and sublimely deadpan is sympathetic and seems a product of the artfully dingy slums she graces in the film parker is pure hollywood and very hard working as the crippled and crafty she is never convincing but then neither is the film br br i wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone interested in a realistic depiction of the lives of drug addicts in america the caligari sets alone make it unbelievable preminger may have been aiming for a dream effect as the cardboard backgrounds give the proceedings the surreal feeling of a nightmare operetta perhaps harking back to preminger's early days in vienna
<START> such a highly anticipated remake of a cherished musical classic and such a bitter pill it was to have to take very very hard to swallow all of it it didn't have an ounce of believability anywhere and when you don't have a rose you don't have a show br br bette midler seemed born to play this part yet all she was able to produce was a cute funny glitzy trademark bette midler weighed down with all the familiar roz russell has nothing to worry about she can rest in her grave knowing she is still the definitive mama rose of film anyway br br i thought midler was really going to put it across this time to throw herself into what is one of the greatest musical roles of all time like she did in the rose but no she played it safe she played herself she made rose a total dinner theatre cartoon even her songs were uninspired it was maddening to watch knowing midler has the talent to rise above her money making schtick she showed promise only once in this gypsy and that was with rose's turn but by then it was too little too late br br a sincere cynthia as the titular heroine gave the film its only true spark and when the role of gypsy outshines that of rose you know there's trouble in river city br br a huge huge letdown
<START> it's true no one really expects anything from sequels but even by that low standard this is a terrible film br br essentially an anthology movie this fourth installment in the hellraiser saga tries to be an origins story and a wind up to the entire series at the same time an ambitious idea but none of the cast is given enough screen time to do anything with their characters and rookie director abandoned the film rather than give in to studio meddling the result is a steaming pile of mediocrity that even fanboys have trouble defending unless you're an alan smithee fan avoid this one
<START> though stephen gyllenhaal is a good tv director with a few good full length to his credit homegrown is just a mess in its script and direction despite performances from billy bob john lithgow kelly lynch jon bon jovi jamie lee curtis and ted danson a cast this good couldn't save the film br br will know that jake and maggie are in the film but you don't see jake very well and maggie's only in it for 30 seconds as babysitter tipping off lithgow's character about a bust it's not even a lowbrow pot comedy as the film was intended to be it just wasn't funny
<START> did beavis and butthead make this movie it is just that bad truly an uneven and unfair portrayal of bad vs good in the wine world did you notice the filmmaker trying any of the from the featured protectors of individual and the camera work is dizzying at best while the content may put you to sleep before long this is not insightful journalism what i got from this movie was that the filmmaker was trying hard to make a point about the of wine by showing for example that the family owned in all parts of the world okay that is a good start so how do these compare does the napa cab taste like their italian we never find out because no one in the film comments on this instead there is a lot of innuendo about nazi's and fascism well those things don't grow grapes hmmmm
<START> it's the one film i almost walked out of and would have if my friends hadn't been in the movie theatre with me normally even if i don't like a film i think it's still worth sitting through it to the end that way you can really claim to have given it every chance to redeem itself but with the million dollar hotel it was so dreadful i just badly wanted the experience to end as quickly as possible i think i probably would not have been so sourly disappointed if this film had been made by a lesser director one i didn't normally like so much but coming from wenders it was all the more shocking to behold i know bono from u2 a good friend of wenders's wrote the script to this abysmal film and i wonder why wenders let him as buddy buddy as the two may have been stick to the day job bono is a sentence that easily springs to mind whilst viewing this mess pretentious disjointed a mish mash of every possible contemporary film stereotype a naive and transparent attempt at coming across as kooky and daring with the most irritating characters i have ever set eyes upon especially the leads jeremy davies milla jovovich and mel gibson none of whom i dislike normally the happiest ending i could have wished for would have been for a nuclear bomb to be dropped on their collective heads so as to get it all over with as soon as possible on a positive note the first five minutes of the film are extremely good with an extremely stirring soundtrack from u2 but the film's opening shots make the rest of the film which takes a spectacular nose dive from then on all the more disappointing as they are a promise of cinematic quality that's just never delivered not even close
<START> it is hard to screw up this story great book good film version from fred yet this film is awful first the casting was terrible richard gere should of played the himself as edward fox was a similar type of cypher and they didn't need to mess with the original script by adding so much worthless expensive fluff this film reminded me of so many bruce willis films as you see huge expense with nothing cinematic to show for it it is his conspiracy theory it takes some real doing to make a film this bad from such a fine original script every person from michael caton jones down should be banned from making films for 10 years such is the insult this film is to real filmmakers were hollywood to go on trial for having no idea what they were doing this film would be exhibit a shame on you all
<START> husband and wife doctor team carole and niles nelson are doing modestly well in their careers but niles has a gambling problem his luck changes when he unknowingly saves the life of a gangster from joe mob and gets a big bonus from the himself loving his change of fortune and snazzy new apartment niles continues to receive payoffs for patching up other injured members of the gang unfortunately his shady deals come to light in a police raid which hangs a shadow over his wife's career as well br br at this point the plot comes into focus as carole nelson has to rescue her career before her license is suspended this involves bringing the gang to justice more or less single handedly br br this is not a hard edged gangster picture but a plot that might have been comfortable on a show like matlock or murder she wrote there is some tension but the mood is kept light by bogart's tongue in cheek performance of a stupid gangster who imagines himself as the napoleon of crime his other gang members also function more as stooges than hoodlums and there's some snappy dialog between bogart and francis especially when she's treating his injuries at his hideout of course as in all gangster flicks there's a big shootout ending but with a humorous twist this is a good short film showing bogart on his rise to stardom
<START> stalingrad is a terrific movie well acted and directed and rather down to earth in it's approach to the various bizarre aspects of warfare and it's politics this is together with das boot one of the best war movies together with the finnish the winter war in english i believe it depicts the ordeals of some of the german soldiers that fought and died in and around stalingrad during world war 2 no big time heroics no over bearing emotional fuzziness only the fear of every day death in war the mood of the movie is similar to the one in das boot and that should give you some hints on what to expect i guess so if you enjoy realistic non hollywoodish war movies rent it buy it just make sure you see it finally a film buff's note for some of the previous reviewers information i only want to add that stalingrad isn't directed by wolfgang petersen who made das boot
<START> mary haines meg ryan a rich woman discovers her husband is cheating on her with a younger woman eva mendes she doesn't know what to do and friends sylvia fowler annette bening edie cohen debra messing and alex fisher pinkett smith try to help br br ok there was no reason to redo the 1939 movie that's a true classic and doesn't need to be updated and redone naturally it was done this has gotten some of the worst reviews i've ever seen for a motion picture i love the original and have seen it many times i was constantly comparing it to that now this isn't a classic but it's not that bad br br minor spoilers first the bad the story is old and was badly updated really a man cheating on his wife is hardly shocking today meg ryan a wonderful actress is pretty terrible here her face seems unable to change expression i couldn't believe how bad some of her scenes came over eva mendes is bad too but it's not entirely her fault her role is badly written and she has to compete with joan crawford from the original smith's character a tough lesbian goes to pieces in an operating room it is funny but it's showing that a strong woman instantly goes to pieces when confronting an emergency also the script inserts some clumsy passages where ryan talks to her daughter about being yourself in those moments it seems more like a lifetime movie than anything else br br now the good this movie retains the decision to never show a man on screen this movie is about and for women men aren't needed btw i'm a man bening is just great as fowler whenever she's on screen the movie makes a great leap also smith is just wonderful she doesn't overplay or her lesbian character too much messing is good too but she's not in this much bette midler is just hysterical in a small role and cloris leachman pulls off the nothing role of a housekeeper the direction is good too especially during a fashion show sequence i heard director diane english purportedly had a lot of trouble directing her first full length movie but it doesn't show in the final product also there are some clever references to the original mostly certain lines that were inserted with no fuss br br i saw this in an audience full of women there were a few guys but not many and they loved it the movie ends on an operating room sequence that had everybody howling so this wasn't needed but it's not the disaster people are saying it is also people are saying we don't need a movie with all women well why not i see plenty of movies with all guys in the cast and no one complains about that ignore the complaints and bad reviews and see this with a better performance by ryan i might have given this an 8 or 9 but as it is i can only give it a 7
<START> scanning through the comments there doesn't appear to be a lot of love for this movie and it's not very hard to see why it's rubbish br br now i will start by saying that the finished product was hurt in any number of ways by the death of donald pleasance dr loomis in post production this required a re of the film's conclusion with loomis buying the farm and took away what was supposed to be a double twist at the end with micheal swapping places with mysterious man in black and i do not mean johnny cash br br now to the story the fifth movie ended rather unsatisfactorily with micheal myers escaping from jail with the mysterious man in black it turns out aggh that this man knows the origin of micheal's evil and is also a colleague of dr loomis named dr wynn they also kidnapped jamie lloyd played by danielle harris in parts 4 and 5 but here played by jc brandy jamie pregnant escapes from dr wynn's lair and so micheal follows her and kills her but she'd had the kid so now he needs to track the baby down so he can kill his great nephew br br we hear some ludicrous explanation to micheal's evil involving gaelic curses down and mysterious symbols a radio show is broadcast from micheal's home town for some reason which gives micheal some more hapless victims br br in the end the movie just like this review is vague confusing and directionless with a very anticlimactic ending br br some sex scenes and nudity poor plot passable effects with some good run of the mill slasher kills but severely lacking in motivation for what was supposed to explain everything this only stirred up some new questions made parts 4 and 5 pointless and was a poor way for a great actor in pleasance to end his life and career
<START> well this is about as good as they come there are arguments about whether hitchcock was only a master of commercial suspense or maybe a compulsive technician or was he really deep nobody knows precisely what terms like that mean but it's legitimate to ask if at his best he could not have been all three things at once br br in this one he seems to be about at his peak hardly anything in it is accidental it abounds with doubt ambiguity and wit and the story is engrossing patricia highsmith apparently having complexes similar to hitchcock's own br br i'm sure the plot has been thoroughly outlined elsewhere so i won't bother going into it i'll just point out five on screen incidents that hitchcock is undoubtedly responsible for br br bruno antony walker has followed miriam laura miller and her two boyfriends to a carnival at night with the intent of murdering her she's noticed his attention and is innocently flattered by it br br 1 laura and her two friends rent an electric boat to go through the tunnel of love and then to an island in the center of the lake walker is right behind them smiling in his boat pluto pluto it's not an allusion to the walt disney cartoon character it's a reference to pluto also called hades a god of the underworld in greek and roman mythology this tiny touch can't be an accident and the underworld that walker represents is not just a literal hell but the underworld of the human mind i hate to say he's a jungian shadow but that's what he is did carl jung see this movie he was alive at the time of its release but probably not 2 now this is a deadly serious sequence right walker is a lunatic who is about to murder a woman he doesn't even know imagine the way this would have been laid out by most directors a night time stalking through a crowded carnival stealing from shadow to shadow the killer peering from behind the canvas walls and so forth what does hitchcock show us when walker first comes through the gates concentrating on his victim a little boy in a cowboy suit holding a balloon runs up and shouts bang bang you're dead walker jerks his head back in surprise and glares down indignantly at the kid and when the kid starts to walk away walker darts his cigarette at the balloon and pops it then continues his pursuit without another glance that's one way hitchcock treats impending doom br br 3 the famous strangling reflected in the fallen eyeglasses which has been aped innumerable times br br 4 miriam and her friends stop at one of those devices that you pound with a big mallet sending a kind of hockey puck up the shaft to measure the strength of your blow one of her boyfriend it and the puck doesn't reach the bell at the top under delighted and admiring gaze walker smiles and rubs his hands together then picks up the mallet slams it down and the puck bangs against the bell she's thrilled he puts the mallet down looks at her grins and his eyebrows at her like a ten year old 5 after the discovery of body while whistles blow and people shout walker leaves the carnival and encounters a blind man waiting at the curb walker takes the old fellow by the arm and leads him across the intersection gravely holding up his hand to stop the traffic a macabre joke br br these incidents and others all take place during the ten or fifteen minutes of the carnival visit robert walker's performance is exceptional throughout it's essentially a kind of invitation to be noirish cf ride the pink horse but the menace of the scene is undercut by hitchcock's insistence on irony and distance none of the familiar noir techniques are employed there's nothing really creepy about it and the murder itself is hardly a savage one i don't think that any director other than hitchcock would have handled it the way he did it would have been all menace and shadows hiding places abortive attempts scowls instead of grins br br not that it's an entirely flawless movie a flawless movie is not yet with us some of the middle section is a bit slow going and farley granger although a nice guy is stolid dull and rather stupid his new girl friend is just dull br br hitchcock was to treat the of guilt with deadly seriousness in the wrong man i'm not sure hitchcock ever thought about the difference between legal guilt and moral guilt the latter was imposed on him at an early age by his catholic education original sin you're born with it and all that in filmed interviews he always explained away his fear of the police and of authorities generally by telling a story about his father taking him to the police station to put a scare into him after some peccadillo we're justified in asking if that was only what psychoanalysis calls a screen memory i hope you get the pun i know i know it's strained and inept but i spent a good deal of valuable time thinking it up
