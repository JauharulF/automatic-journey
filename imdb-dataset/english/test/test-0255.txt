<START> my favourite police series of all time turns to a tv film does it work yes gee runs for mayor and gets shot the homicide hall of fame turns up pembleton and nearly all of the cops who ever played in this series a lot of flashbacks helps you who hasnÂ´t seen the tv series but it amuses the fans too the last five minutes solves another murder and at the very end even two of the dead cops turn up and a short appearance from my favourite coroner juliana cox this is a good film
<START> after watching this film i experienced a new sensation i had watched a film in which the lead actor had put in a performance that almost rivaled the legend chevy chase in this isn't to say that the performances are comparable but both give practically flawless delivery of their lines that actor is marc singer singer is jack ford the of the title grinding out a living collecting the bounty on androids there are some mutants topless pleasure droids a scandinavian smuggler and possibly a half hearted attempt to make a statement on class or maybe even globalization or well it doesn't really matter what matters about this film is the dry manner in which singer delivers his lines resulting in side splitting humour what matters about this film is that director fred olen ray seems to realize that serious sci fi very rarely works and when your budget is skimpy it is best not to take yourself to seriously olen ray has said that everyone involved in this film had great fun and this transfers onto the film i dare you to criticize a film that allows itself to portray futuristic earth as eternally dark and neon lit and then ends in a and warehouse self parody is a very redeeming quality to summarise fred olen ray is an ambassador for independent film making and marc singer the perfect b movie lead if only olen ray could draft in tim thomerson to the equation then we'd have a film on our hands
<START> the is a bad generic and boring movie the film has got a big problem it does not scare the performances and the screenplay are totally stupid it uses old tricks for scaring and all the supernatural events make laugh i would not call the as a bad movie i would call it an accidental comedy because it's so bad that makes laugh the only good thing about this movie is that it's short so this crap will not stay with us for so long there are a lot of masterpieces of horror genre which count with a low budget like subject two lucky or may which are sadly ignored while this crap is all a success in the box office so i do not recommend this weak and pathetic horror film which is called the
<START> this is a typical sandra bullock movie in which she plays a mousy but profane woman who is in trouble but finds a way to survive and be the hero sound familiar br br there are plenty of holes in this story things just don't add up and some of the suspense is a little corny but that suspense is very good there is a lot of tension in this story which has strong paranoia running through it the story starts off slow but kicks in pretty soon and stays that way making it an involving movie for the viewer that's why i give it a pretty good rating the movie gets you involved in it bullock is more cute than annoying which she normally is to me so this is my highest rated movie with her in it
<START> this movie was alright mary kate and ashley play twin sisters sorry for stating the obvious who against their will are sent to paris to spend the week with their rich uncle or something like that br br right away two french boys who looked slightly inbred start talking to them and taking interest blah blah blah it's an olsen twin movie we already know what's going to happen between them anyway along with that the twins meet a fabulous french model because they're in paris the fashion capital of the world they make bffs with the model and spend a fun montage of shopping in the city of lights yep br br plotwise i frankly can't remember what happened i guess that could say something but hey it's an olsen movie olsen movie seems to be synonymous with light entertainment br br overall this movie was annoying i mean can i really identify at all with two girls who are devastated upon hearing that they're going to paris really also the jokes really weren't that funny however i watched the whole movie so it had to be somewhat entertaining the fact that it was set in paris was what probably kept me watching
<START> this movie was one of the most boring horror movies i have seen in a long time and i have seen a lot personally i liked the piercing take on it all that was original but other than that it was pretty unwatchable i could not stand dee snider as an actor nor as a singer i seemed that he was trying with everything he said to make it a memorable quote which they weren't i can get movies for free and i still didn't think it was worth the time to get
<START> this movie is so daring it doesn't attempt to hide its similarities to the shining it lacks the originality to do so and when it does near the end try to cover up its story of father goes psycho under influence of sketchy haunted house in a foreign place it does so by stooping to plenty of other already established conventions and ideas in other words it reduces itself to mere cliche but hell even i enjoy a good predictable horror or thriller as long as there is an interesting story one filled with violence and gore somewhere before the film makes the dreadful turn towards the predictable and trite well this film doesn't have a good story and i was really disappointed with it what has going for it is remarkable direction and cinematography it is a film well shot and carefully constructed full of fun creepy angles and shots what doesn't have going for it is pretty much everything else to begin with a minor quibble the editing in this movie is obnoxious it jumps from one scene to the next sometimes pointlessly for example the old man in the movie who pretty much carries the background story later filled in by another character is underscored by a hamster running circles i mean it looks cool the first time but why continue to use the same image i guess you'd have to see it for yourself to understand what i mean another problem with this movie is anna paquin's character who essentially whines throughout the film crying and caring all too much about everything she's the film's failed attempt at a character driven horror film the movie has scenes of overblown sentimentalism and the family drama it depicts is simply not believable by the end is a muddled melodrama with a non involving mystery provided with too simple of an ending and it's hardly scary
<START> i never really thought about watching this film i kept seeing it perched on the horror movie shelf in my local video rental shop and never thought much about it just your run of the mill bland zombie flick with a bit of gore and a sex scene nothing special might as well watch python oh no wait that's a terrible film br br i only decided to watch it when some of my friends saw it on tv and said it was an awful piece of trash so i decided to verify these tales and only then did i realise how terrible the film hiding behind the bland and uninteresting dvd box cover was br br not that the idea is bad in itself a plane is a confined area and would be a real death trap for the people on board should zombies make their appearance a good premise for a zombie film but this film took a good setting and crapped all over it with poor acting unsteady camera work annoying characters and a terrible score br br the characters all have different levels of hatefulness there are two young couples who are basically friends going on a vacation in france one couple is composed of a jock and his annoying bitchy girlfriend who is having an affair with mr best friend who came along with his girlfriend who is a blonde psycho there is also a policeman escorting a con man an effeminate and highly annoying con man the policeman is probably one of the least irritating characters of the lot then there is a bunch of air hostesses who mostly end up as zombie chow no i didn't watch the whole film it was just too painful an experience to carry through almost as bad as watching cannibal holocaust oh and there's also a golfer on holiday with his wife some strange air marshal who really does not appear to be important until he's summoned to help deal with the zombie escapees a trio of scientists who all fall victim to the undead and a couple of pilots the camera work is often shaky and although many people don't seem to mind it can really get on your nerves after a while like having a small fly buzz constantly around your head it's small but it's there and it's annoying br br the adulterous couple are genuinely annoying all they do is have sex in the plane's toilets while their spouses aren't looking in fact all the young adults in this film are insanely annoying they whine bitch argue and have some of the most inane and mind boring dialogue in the movie yes it makes you glad to see them die br br the score is atrocious it is so generic and uninspired it kills any kind of suspense a scene could have generated and replaces it with the feeling that someone is scraping a blackboard with their nails and laughing at you in fact it sounds like the score from python that film will never stop haunting me br br there is also a character that the film makers seemed incredibly intent on having in as many shots as possible a nun sitting near the young adults and clutching her bible who is included in so many shots you start to wonder if she plays any major part in the film but no she doesn't so why have her in so many scenes was it because the film's creator's original project was a nun porn flick nobody will ever know br br the zombies look pretty good their makeup is good and they are probably far better actors than the living characters they are far more convincing and likable the guard responsible for keeping an eye on the scientist's illegal cargo was quite funny a large crate appears to fall on him and the camera briefly shows the audience that his leg has been pierced with some kind of sharp object yet he doesn't scream wince or moan in pain he just grunts and in an attempt to get the thing out of his leg in fact he sounds more like an overweight man trying to scratch his back than a man in pain br br ah well all in all i give it 1 for the interesting setting and 1 for the zombies br br watch this movie only if you like young adults bickering and throwing things at each other and sadly there really isn't anything funny about the whole thing so watching for a laugh would probably fail unless you're high on some kind of psychoactive drug
<START> just went on youtube and finally watched this oscar nominated animated short directed by richard i had previously watched his funny getting started there in this one a couple are playing scrabble the wife keeps shaking her eyes while her husband has nothing but e's on his side the wife leaves for a while to vacuum her bed and bathtub before catching her husband looking at her side briefly before this the husband catches a tv show called sawing for teens with the stars sawing something and the husband getting his own saw that program gets interrupted by a special report of a nuclear war happening the newsman is a skeleton here as everyone panics outside though the husband fell asleep during this time and thinks a parade is going on as he and his wife continue arguing about the game there's plenty of other bizarre things going on before the touching ending comes on quite hilarious and well worth seeing for any animation buff out there can't wait to see any more animated shorts from mr
<START> i was subjected to this terrible excuse for a made for tv movie i only watched it because i don't have cable and my only other choices were golf college basketball or local news the plot is very generic and has no substance that i could see not to mention it had a major flaw in my eyes the main character dr is a washed up astronomer who believes that an asteroid named nemesis will strike earth causing all life to cease he bases his belief on his discovery of cave paintings by an i'm sure i spelled that one wrong the paintings show an apparent timeline showing significant events throughout history such as the building of the great wall of china all of the events are shown in perfect chronological order and the very last picture on the timeline is earth being destroyed now to me if the painting showed things that had indeed happened why would the great doctor believe that he could somehow change what was going to happen all that aside the movie moved along with extreme formulaic precision there was nothing in the movie that surprised me at all the actors were not very good and on a few occasions i just felt that they didn't even take the movie seriously to put forth enough effort to try to convince me that the characters were worth caring about the whole movie was cliche ridden and a downright waste of time and money i'd recommend armageddon over this piece of crap any day at least armageddon has some good acting compared to this not to mention the eye candy that is liv tyler now that i think about it golf isn't that bad
<START> this movie was a waste of 3 hours of my precious time in the first 10 minutes i was already annoyed as i am familiar with the real version on the story according to the torah 5 books of moses but i decided to watch it to get my moneys worth and too see how bad it sucked well it sucked way more then i thought it would first and for most lets start with the script and characters the skeleton that makes up the body of a movie if you study torah at all you'll see that the story is all wrong here are some of the mistakes moses doesn't do slave work because he was in the tribe of levi moses doesn't kill anybody at mount but yet the movie depicts moses being whipped and aaron and himself killing people not when moses speaks to the burning bush he knows who hes speaking too but the movie makes moses look like an idiot he states that he doesn't know who the g d in the bush is whatever aaron his brother well regardless of their distance growing up aaron was known for his calm composed peaceful nature but yet he is depicted as angry and arrogant in this movie moses looks like jesus in this movie how ridiculous pharoah the real one was actually and ugly dwarf who sat upon a pyramid of stairs so he could appear bigger then he was and moses was more then 10 feet and in the movie pharoah is taller then him and hes hot with light eyes the woman of am israel nation of israel covered themselves meaning their hair and bodies and they didn't dance or sing in front of men they did not participate in the golden calf so they would definitely not dance with a man in public as the movie depicts wife was married to moses and she therefore covered herself and being as humble as they were did not cuddle or hold hands in public daughter the one who adopts him and saves him from the water actual converted to judaism and therefore would have been proud of moses when he said he was going to go free his people fast fwd to mount moses comes down the 2nd time with two sets of with gibberish writing on it at least put the writing in the holy tongue hebrew or english and put it on one tablet not two sets bottom line is the movie is horribly written directed and the characters are all wrong basically everything is wrong about the movie the old one is inaccurate as well but its more realistic and they actors are believable am israel chai
<START> i really enjoyed the first film and when it turned up again without thinking or checking i took a family of friends to see it i was ashamed that i had enthused so much about it to them br br disney processed the original film just like the human body processes a delicious meal takes in something good and turns out well you know and by having a dark skinned person as the fbi man the results of fingerprinting the informant were subdued br br taken as an isolated film i suppose it is not too bad if one likes that weird sort of thing but when one has read the book or seen the first film horrible
<START> i saw this documentary film at the 2005 independent film festival this documentary is shot directed and edited by a son craig of his mother's year long battle with cancer shot over the course of one year the closer she gets is a documentary in the truest form and gives you an inside look of a family's struggle with battling with the cancer the viewer gets an inside point of view of the effects cancer has on a family as well as the individual throughout the entire process i have never seen such an honest film this is a powerful and raw film and since it wasn't shot by an outsider you get the true emotions of everyone involved many documentaries are shot by an outsider but having this story told by the son adds another emotional level to the film unlike any i have seen before on this subject or any other this is a touching story that everyone should see and can relate to i would highly recommend it
<START> satya was excellent company was just as good but more polished probably owing to the money earned from previous movies ab tak however is even more entertaining the dialogue is gritty crude and at times hilarious nana shines yet again in a role that only he can fulfill with authority but the supporting cast are very talented direction is tight and the story evolves at a satisfying pace with a very dramtic climax as a depiction of reality it may be over dramatised but at the end of the day it's a movie so the balance is spot on i've ordered my dvd and can't wait to see it again at home as a lover of these type of gangster flicks this is very gratifying and comes highly recommended for the refreshingly non yash raj bollywood gangster flick lovers out there
<START> i thought this movie was awful i understand it was shot on a small budget but the acting was terrible and the movie itself was just plain dumb the plot was predictable and the central character was an unsympathetic moron in fact all of the characters were unsympathetic and none were fully developed at all the audience relates to no one in the movie it was supposed to be suspenseful but if you don't care about the characters it's hard to get into the movie at all i felt like an outsider being forced to listen to someone tell me a stupid story all the plot twists at the end were just a little too much i was actually laughing when i guess i was supposed to be shocked all in all i thought it was really just a bad movie
