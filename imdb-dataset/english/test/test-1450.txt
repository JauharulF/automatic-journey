<START> i have seen shallow grave years ago and that was one of those movies i kept in memory for a very long time it was intense from beginning to end and with plenty of sudden twists but all of these made sense br br i can't tell the same about dead bodies above the title is a subtitle that claims it to be even better than shallow grave this is a big lie br br dead bodies looses strength and gets far less convincing during the movie br br two supporting characters for example turn out to be a whole lot less innocent than they first appeared to be that could work as a surprise but it didn't surprise me i could see it coming minutes before and that is a big difference with shallow grave br br another thing i have to mention is that characters in this movie often respond not very realistic they behave like that more often when the movie gets to it's end br br i would have found it far more interesting if some of the characters would have stayed completely innocent not knowing what is going on it would have been better for the contrast with for example tommy and his friend who have to carry a huge secret with them br br but no for some stupid reason the makers of this movie decided that all characters should show their darkest sides it does not work in a movie like this br br the end felt much like an open end it left me with an unsatisfied feeling i expected a whole lot more of it br br at first i would have given this movie six stars because it is not entirely a bad movie i liked watching it most of the time br br but occasionally i saw some really poor acting and unrealistic scenes and because of the disappointing open end i stick to four stars this time and because it turned out to be a mistake that i have spend my time and money to it unlike shallow grave i will probably forget dead bodies very soon it is just not such a special movie br br the makers could have done a far better job with this movie it is a shame that they did not
<START> lauren debut movie is well directed with a nice polished feel to it there's a strong storyline going on with a meaningful point to it all even if at the end nothing is resolved hence the name treading water the storyline revolves around a lesbian couple and their battle with ones mother for acceptance 7 5 10
<START> everything that you need to know about the pornography of the late 70s and early 80s is all wrapped up in paul thomas anderson's boogie nights although the film is completely fictional it is actually supposedly based on the story of porno kingpin john holmes br br in southern california in 1977 eddie adams mark wahlberg is working as a busboy in a nightclub one of the regular customers is pornographer jack horner burt reynolds and two of his starlets amber waves julianne moore and heather graham jack and eddie meet and jack realizes that eddie is well a little gifted br br so eddie stars in jack's films under the pseudonym of dirk diggler he becomes a big porno star no pun intended and seems to be on top of everything then comes the 80s when video replaces film and jack's porno empire begins to collapse along with dirk diggler and everybody else working in the field br br boogie nights is a really well filmed drama there is a little bit of violence but p t anderson makes it more stylized and it kind of is a scathing approach to the of pornography especially when vhs became the standard medium for making pornos br br a lot of bizarre and unique characters are introduced william h macy has an interesting role as someone working on the films whose wife keeps having sex with everybody i especially liked don cheadle's role as buck the stereo salesman the best performance is boogie nights was definitely burt reynolds a 90s classic
<START> this film had some funny moments louie the main character was well cast along with some other decent supporting characters the opening shot of the movie set the tone but the direction and story went downhill from there aside from a twist at the end interesting and funny also i wish this film had better direction and a more developed story without giving any of the plot away the whole idea is better good i just wish it was executed better in this short film the potential was there but it just didn't deliver the goods
<START> this movie has a twist that caught me off guard it made me go over the scenes in my mind to see if there were any clues along the way loved the gorgeous roy thinnes and joan skillful acting the beautiful haunting music stays with me as well as the intriguing story
<START> the funniest thing about fortunes is that one of the main characters lewis urbaniak has writer's block and apparently so did the screenplay writer for the film this is sad as well as i guess by large this is supposed to be a comedy or dramedy but that's the funniest thing i can remember from watching this br br three friends go out and drink one night on the way home two decide to get their fortunes told by a gypsy as they call her those two lives fall apart while the third friend stands by then nothing happens br br i hope i didn't spoil the movie there but really this extremely low budget bad quality movie had some kind of idea when it started but quickly into the depths of hell yeah i'm being harsh honestly it wasn't that bad it was just blah br br the aforementioned writer was annoying to watch though he delivered maybe one or two of the only two funny lines the clichÃ©d ladies man the only one that didn't get his fortune told was just annoying the only bright spot was the remaining friend the married dad whose fortune was told that something big was to happen to his son and he needed to be prepared he was funny genuine and clearly the best actor in the movie unfortunately that's not saying much br br perhaps i'm being too cruel heck they got the ambition to make a movie went and got funding and accomplished something unfortunately however i can't at all recommend the film on the basis there's hundreds of thousands of other independent movies that have hundreds of thousands better ideas and executions this one was literally 10 minutes of an idea stretched another 81 boring minutes
<START> loved it this has to be the best horror flick of the 90's i br br was at the edge of my seat i jumped a couple times wonderful br br acting it is totally horror but it was funny when it was meant br br to be
<START> the only reason there is a question mark in parenthesis is not because i haven't seen every film released in 2001 thus far it's because this film was only made partly in 2001 the rest of it was stolen from roger corman's other dinosaur films carnosaur 1 3 br br i have a confession to make carnosaur 2 is perhaps one of my favorite b movies it borrows so much from james cameron's aliens it's not even funny but i love it i can't explain exactly why it just works for me i liked the sets i liked the cinematography i liked how they borrowed from aliens it's all a bit ironic that cameron at one point was an of corman's with films like battle beyond the stars 1980 br br i own the carnosaur trilogy on dvd and the most i can say for part one is that it has moments the most i can say for the third is that it took me five years to find it watchable br br now we have raptor which does not continue that series instead it borrows entire scenes from the carnosaur trilogy and builds a movie around it and somehow roger corman was able to get eric roberts and corbin bernsen to do it now i'm not saying either roberts or bernsen are at any kind of career high but they were both at one point what could be called respectable actors not here sure actors react to effects they won't even see while filming all the time here however they are reacting to mismatched footage from films that are between five and eight years old there's even a whose costume was modeled directly after a character in carnosaur 1 apparently it made too much sense to get the original guy back br br when raptor was announced i was a wee bit excited i was however disappointed when corman said that they'd be using the old dinosaur models from carnosaur apparently corman decided after this interview was conducted that he wouldn't even do that and its not that he couldn't find an fx crew to do it the script for this was clearly written keeping in mind that the story had to be built around pre existing stock footage br br don't compare this to ed wood ed did better than this at least he only used the stock footage of bela once in one film there are ways of incorporating stock footage into a movie and raptor takes this frowned upon technique to a new low even if you liked carnosaur 3 primal species stay away from raptor
<START> i must i was a little skeptical when i entered the cinema to watch french comedies tend to be so self satisfied nowadays that only the most stupid ones score high at the national box office but i was surprised that though the humor does not always reach the level of the monthy pythons the many references to the vision of the world in the 1950 which represents are hilarious et the director managed to recreate film making style of that time with an astonishing fidelity to put it short a bit of a good surprise not to mention the excellent performances from various secondary actors and at least for once jean style which can get on many people's nerves perfectly with the character he plays
<START> the director was probably still in his early learning stages when he tried his hand at westerns have a look at the outfits everybody looks well scrubbed well brushed well dressed and well ironed as though ready for church even the horses look well groomed and shiny this is a western for crying out loud it's supposed to look dusty nasty and sweaty and then there's the amateurish acting of the females in this bird the whole lot a dozen or so all pretty and well endowed were just freshly raped and widowed but hardly a tear flows instead they all look with great interest if not downright lust at the newly arrived magnificent seven who they subsequently feed bandage and comfort with love during their battles with the bandits the same directing criticism goes for lee van cleef who does a reasonable good acting job our lee playing the law just lost his dear wife but lee hard as organic rock shows no emotion whatsoever and finds himself within days of his spouse's demise in the arms of a juicy widow with whom he together with her brood walks off into the future the cad and then there's another thing that always kind of bothers me with this type of films it doesn't matter how many dynamite induced explosions take place in the middle of a pack of some 50 horses never mind how many shots are being fired at the rabble on top of them only the crooks get killed and the nags always go their way rejoicing in one piece i know silly moi it's just a movie it's not the worst western ever made but prepare for some serious yawning
<START> the fact that this film was shown at london's suggests to me that the print must have been acceptable enough for such a showing now the question is why isn't this long lost and important film available in dvd or even vhs a large number of persons in europe and the usa have for many years hoped to see this film if for no other reason than the wonderful music written for it by sergei what does one have to do to get such a wonderful production as this available for a wider public not just patrons to the at london having been a devoted listener to music for many years and aware of this film please someone 'out there' do the right thing and bring it out as a dvd
<START> so good the acting cutting directing in there may not be the best ever but the dancing the moves the heat and the passion in this movie is definitely the best well atleast for me it really touched me inspired me to learn dancing i even especially registered to this site just so i could vote on it and contribute my support for this movie for this movie it literally gave me goosebumps when i watched it i love it jennifer grey is so pretty patrick is so sexy in there the first thing i'll do tomorrow on my way to university will be to drop by the video store n buy a copy of it n watch it again n again till i am old n wrinkly n cant dance with the movie any longer before than i need to learn all the dance moves there
<START> the bermuda triangle we are told in this waste of celluloid is the portal to another time and dimension and can be crossed using cheap special effects by bad actors spouting inane dialogue br br i simply was unable to decide who the makers of this thought would be its target audience as it seems impossible anybody could derive even a modicum of pleasure from the outcome avoid its not even bad enough to be good
<START> based on its current imdb rating as well as several plot summaries i didn't expect much from 'two but how wrong i was br br from start to finish you're kept deeply engrossed in a genre which has been continuously unoriginal for quite a while even in terms of mise en scene and cinematography the director excels and creates a film consisting of great imagination if you're looking for a film which is not only entertaining but also provocative compelling and genuinely extraordinary then make this the next film you watch br br i'm hoping heath ledger's tragic death will have lead to more people picking up this film he was an incredible talent and his performance in this is one not to be missed don't make the mistake of judging and this amazing film before you've seen it
<START> i can barely find the words to describe how much this piece of trash offended me why is it that american filmmakers always go out of there way to portray as a bunch of backwards ass bush babies and worse yet cast people to play who sound utterly ridiculous when they try to imitate the accent we are not all extremely dark we do not all walk around carrying machetes whether for work or protection we do not walk around naked in our homes and we do not practice voodoo we are doctors lawyers architects businessmen and women musicians actors and filmmakers i am sick and tired of watching all of these portrayals of as a bunch of wearing who do nothing but sit around all day smoking weed on a beach or shooting guns in the air when we're not living in our tree houses yes we wear clothes yes we have electricity no weed is not legal on the island and chances are we speak better english than you the worst part is this isn't just me being angry and bitter these are actual answers to questions that most who have traveled overseas have been asked at some point read a book before you assume what's it's like in another country and worse yet decide to make a movie about it br br welcome to the land where all we do is murder white people and beat our bongos drums tales from the crypt has officially sickened me along with the entire crew of people who worked on this garbage especially the writer
