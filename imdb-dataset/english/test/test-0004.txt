<START> i really liked the movie 'the new groove' but watching this was like coming home and seeing your wife having relations with a llama seriously this movie was bad it's like club dread after super troopers i am supposed to write 10 lines but i don't even know what else to say i laughed a couple of times but only because i was drinking a movie like that should at least be funny when your drunk it was not maybe are just funny and regular cartoon people aren't either way just stick with the new groove if you want a funny cartoon llama themed movie line 10 is this line right here
<START> the monster will look very familiar to you so will the rest of the film if you've seen a half dozen of these teenagers trapped in the woods movies okay so they're not teenagers this time but they may as well be three couples decide it might be a good idea to check out a nearly abandoned ghost town in hopes of finding the gold that people were killed over a scant century and a half before you'd think that with a title like miner's massacre some interesting things might happen they don't in fact only about 1 10 of the film actually takes place in the mine i had envisioned teams of terrified miners scampering for their lives in the cavernous confines of their workplace praying that black lung disease would get them before the grim reaper exacted his grisly revenge but instead i got terrestrial twenty somethings fornicating and in one case defecating in the woods a gang of morons with a collective i q that would have difficulty pulling a plastic ring out of a box of cracker jacks much less a buried treasure from an abandoned mine no suspense no scares and plenty of embarrassing performances give this turkey a 3 for nudity
<START> just can't watch this bit too many times it's full of true enthusiasm and cleverness mickey mouse had in his first 30 years mickey is an smart ass little whiner when compared this steamboat willie always makes me smile at least the ending where mickey laughs after hitting a parrot with a potato animation is very nice and although steamboat willie has no dialog the music is enough for it br br imho if this bit doesn't deserve 10 10 then any cartoon doesn't not only because it's a true classic but also because it's so full of joy and it's always fun to watch
<START> really here the french cinema hits rock bottom and compared to it the least appealing of the american adolescent horror movies the likes of friday the thirteenth freddy and co are masterpieces of the seventh art br br it's all the more infuriating as there were exciting original elements the de and its legends the druids and king arthur all were splendid assets for a dreamlike fantasy and horror film alas filmed as an user aptly pointed out in a fake forest near paris the movie is fake horror fake celtic history fake vestiges you should see the professor who was a wonderful m le in la vie est un long scream for the invaluable scrap which the production probably bought in a dime store fake characters fake excavations br br the boys disguised as druids are unintentionally very funny so are the girls who seem to be experts in martial arts and what can we say of the professors of the monster a ten year old would write a better screenplay than this grotesque farce to think that people can spend money for such drivel when artists are still waiting for a producer br br word to the wise maurice wrote a marvelous story dealing with druids and old ceremonies in his lupin saga called aux a miniseries was made 30 years ago avoid this garbage and try to see it instead
<START> i'm surprised to read all the positive comments on this movie even my 4 and 6 year old were bored the chipmunks are cute but the storyline is overly obvious not recommended for young ones with the least sophisticated tastes br br we did hear a few laughs from the audience while we were in attendance but i wondered why br br i don't admit to ever being a fan but i expected to be entertained it's not even an movie as far as i can tell simply a heavy handed view of too young we've seen more than enough of that with britney spears et al haven't we br br don't bother
<START> wow it's been a long time since i've last seen such a hilarious movie like this one i've never been a great fanatic about french movies but ever since i fell in love with the beauty and the acting skills of catherine deneuve i decided to see all of her movies however i didn't think this one would be so fantastic as it turned out to be lucky me that i bought it even though i had some doubts this is really feel good time film with class and quality there are some great social topics and moral drama's involved that are very close to today's modern way of living which are shown very beautiful and realistic i also liked the dancing scene in the men's room a lot but my favourite is the rather timid attempt of catherine deneuve to sing she brings it the way she is with lots of grace and modesty at the same time very tempting further on i would also like to express my respect and admiration for line who played a fantastic role i didn't even know she acted i've only known her for her music so don't wait any longer and go see the movie you'll be surprised in many ways
<START> this movie made me think of how i could write something about it without personally dissing the director and all the actors who as an australian i am proud of for actually getting out there and making a film br br but the movie itself let me tell you a story br br found this dvd in my local rental shop yesterday and had vague recollections of the reviews at the time of cinema release here so i thought i would give it a go br br for some reason i decided to watch the 'special features' before i watched the actual movie not something that i usually do turned the 'making of' off halfway through as i'd had enough cringing at the 'aren't we so wonderful for putting together such a hard hitting film with such a raw script' attitude br br the movie ugh full of clichÃ©s and pathetic character development the actors well done guys you are aussies and i applaud you and just like a team is only as good as the coach that directs them you unfortunately did not have a great script to work with br br i felt that the movie actually so many of the subjects that it seemed to want to cover i have seen many reviews here that refer to it as nothing more than a soap agreed br br finally and forgive me if i don't phrase this correctly i was extremely disappointed that there were no optimistic overtones at all yes we all know that life is full of hard stuff and yes we know that things such as incest do occur but i really find it hard to applaud a movie that has not one piece of joy in it i believe that a director has a responsibility to put it in there somewhere otherwise the movie is all about them and their feelings they have created it for themselves not for an audience br br which i think is the basis of why this movie isn't so great the special features mention that the director wrote the screenplay in a 36 hour sitting the day after he himself tried to end his own life well it may have been cathartic for him to do this however the movie reeks of self indulgence when you know the story behind why it was written i feel horrid i'm going to write a movie about feeling horrid note i have read the interview with andrew urban and understand why needed to write something to help him through his own issues but i believe there is a line in film that cannot be crossed the line of making a movie purely for your own emotional needs and i feel that this is what has unintentionally happened here br br by his own admission the director had no technical experience at all and sadly this makes the movie come off looking like nothing more than a year twelve media project br br as for any recommendations that this movie should be studied at school or that all teenagers should watch it not sure there either because there is a very dangerous line at the end i too have been in a place where i have thought that someone who no longer has to 'face life' is 'lucky' but as an adult i do worry that this line could be influential on a young viewer that was in a vulnerable frame of mind might be in there to promote discussion but again it reflects no possibility of redemption or joy in this story as a whole in fact it almost indicates that there is more sadness to come br br i haven't seen elephant but i just might go find it given all the comparisons here br br nothing personal here guys i do hope you can make another movie someday and we all have to start out somewhere so forgive me if i've been too harsh i am glad that you are proud of what you created which in the end is what life is all about it's not a movie i would recommend though br br oh i did like the way the time frames often collided thought that was an interesting way to film br br but the whole its the quiet ones you have to watch we already know that
<START> my father the hero is sweet funny and cute gerard is awesome as andre a divorced father who takes his fourteen year old daughter nicole heigl to the caribbean for vacation while there his daughter meets a guy named ben dalton james to impress him she tells him that andre is her lover and that her father is in jail for armed robbery and her mother is a prostitute and that she ran off with her pimp everyone on the island is soon under the impression that andre's a child molester andre is between two relationships one with isabelle emma thompson who makes a cameo in the end of the film and diana faith prince from spin city my father the hero has many funny moments like when he's at a talent show and everyone tells him to play something french so he plays thank heaven for little girls from gigi everyone gets disgusted and leaves my father the hero doesn't deserve a 5 1 i think it deserves a 9 0
<START> from the first to the last scene of the movie director visconti excels at his art to the extent that the movie is ensured to remain as a cultural treasure for only god knows how long it is perfection as a movie that is but the story has some minor shortcomings br br thomas mann's novel is also a perfect piece of art so of course it is impossible to bring into another media visconti follows the story pretty much and it is only when he allows himself to deviate slightly that the transition falters and no matter how wonderful the scenery is the tension in the air between the characters the hundreds of subtle signals and allegories the almost unbearably heightened serving of music still the minute anomalies in the plot disturb me br br maybe i'm just a victim of man's desire to flaw the flawless nevertheless i will offer one example which i regard as crucial br br warning spoilers br br in mann's story eats the strawberries which probably contain the disease that will kill him after giving up his frustrated chase of the boy in venice unable to catch one delight he settles for another which poisons him it is very subtle in the book but it is there the forbidden fruit of sorts but more a sign of him surrendering life itself br br in visconti's film he also eats strawberries but in a rather insignificant scene by the beach the chase in venice ends in a much more melodramatic way it works too but lacks some subtlety indeed and also the multi layered symbolism giving food for thought br br but that's all forgiven when the film allows us to feast on beautiful sceneries faces and constellations and certainly as many other symbols as we can possibly digest the last gesture of standing in the water being the equally sublime and mysterious finale
<START> this movie may superficially appear to be flaky and for teenie boppers it seems to be the stereotypical high school movie but in fact it takes an honest and touching look at the high school experience it doesn't propose some unrealistic ending where the geeks and the popular kids reconcile it doesn't change what happened in adolescence it just attempts to reckon with it this is a really great fun heart warming movie good for teens and for those who can still remember being one
<START> wow i loved this movie this film was filled with plot twists good acting great story and a surprising ending to be completely honest this movie wasn't overly gory it does contain some gore though but was more on the psychological side i read it on the internet the film cost 3000 dollars and was shoot in 8 days amazing this is for someone that wants to think and loves great film making what starts out as a terrorizing thriller slowly transforms into something a bit more twisted even a bit more sinister not much i can say without giving away plot points only that this movie went beyond my expectations
<START> this film got less attention than league of their own possibly because it has only one name star but whereas women's professional baseball had only an eight year midwestern town existence japanese baseball is a vastly bigger entity both in financial and popular support that alone would make it the better movie br br mr baseball shows the facts of life of japan ball the regimented cheering the deference to the pressure of corporate owners on managers the extreme conservatism of play and no hot dog players welcome br br it also touches upon the isolation that any jin but especially an american jock not the people most versed in foreign cultures feels living in dai nippon and the japanese for their part are not comfortable around foreigners and let it show in various ways the jin strike zone one american player complains bigger than a buick br br the script may not have won any awards playing once again on the redemption by improved play theme but i found it considerably more enjoyable to watch than the pokey league definitely recommended for those who want to see another angle on this great sport
<START> alice is the kind of movie they made in the 30's and 40's never attempts to be an event just wants to entertain and it does i was surprised by kiefer sutherland in a role that could be a cliche he made it real the plot does make allusions to alice in wonderland a guy dressed in white does go through a hole and kiefer does fall down one like alice the plot does twist and turn but with a freshness you don't see in small movies i loved the direction sutherland just a very fast paced and interesting movie
<START> this movie is not worth the time it takes to put it in the vcr or dvd player michael dudikoff and lisa howard are two bounty hunters in love yet they are total opposites she is ambitious and organized while he is laid back and totally scatter brained br br in this movie bad guys are chasing jersey character this opens the door to bad godfather impressions ludicrous fight scenes and tony curtis playing the most effeminate looking mob boss i have ever seen the ending has to be the most unbelievable scene i have seen in a movie in quite some time i would believe the terminator even the matrix has a better chance of possibly being true than this ending this movie just reeks of cheapness the script had to have hit someone as being totally ridiculous yet the green light was given for this piece of dung to be made and let loose on on unsuspecting public i watched this movie with several other people who all agreed that we had been cheated no one in the group could say anything good about the film except that it was over
<START> this movie was ok as far as movies go it could have been made as a crossover into secular movies however it had little to do with the left behind books that it was supposedly based on major story premises were removed and new major story premises were added br br what disappointed me most was how nicolae was portrayed he was shown with supernatural powers that he did not have at this point in the books antichrist is not satan is not omniscient and not omnipotent br br faith and beliefs were portrayed in weird surreal ways that seemed to make the movie just silly br br non believers who watch this will have more ammunition to mock christian beliefs
