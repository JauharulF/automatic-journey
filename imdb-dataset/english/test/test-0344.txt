<START> worth the entertainment value of a rental especially if you like action movies this one features the usual car chases fights with the great van damme kick style shooting battles with the 40 shell load shotgun and even terrorist style bombs all of this is entertaining and competently handled but there is nothing that really blows you away if you've seen your share before br br the plot is made interesting by the inclusion of a rabbit which is clever but hardly profound many of the characters are heavily stereotyped the angry veterans the terrified illegal aliens the crooked cops the indifferent feds the bitchy tough lady station head the crooked politician the fat federale who looks like he was typecast as the mexican in a hollywood movie from the 1940s all passably acted but again nothing special br br i thought the main villains were pretty well done and fairly well acted by the end of the movie you certainly knew who the good guys were and weren't there was an emotional lift as the really bad ones got their just deserts very simplistic but then you weren't expecting hamlet right the only thing i found really annoying was the constant cuts to daughter during the last fight scene br br not bad not good passable 4
<START> quite liked flesh and looking forward to heat but couldn't help but feel morrissey grossly exploited most of the performers featured here stumbling around naked in a narcotic stupor seems to be all was capable of in this feature a huge and heartbreaking contrast from flesh his semi erection in a few scenes is the only indication that he might be acting mostly it looks like something he did to buy drugs is a revelation all right she is the embodiment of the lower east side but hers is a one woman show she rarely engages the other performers though it has to be said her sex scene with a beer bottle definitely leaves halle berry in the shade when it comes to cinematic displays of raw passion when she on a young would be lover it is with the ferocity of a vampire two of the female performers andrea and jane have such annoying voices you'll have to mute the sound to get through their scenes the fact that several of these performers committed suicide or were murdered a few years after only adds to the air of exploitation but they were probably desperate to get in front of morrissey's camera anyway there probably isn't a worse way to spend a saturday night but at least it brings a specific time and place vividly to life
<START> okay first to anne rice book fans br br sure eyes are not blue sure he isn't blond in this movie but even though marius is not maker even though they completely altered the story br br how can u say its not a good movie br br this movie is the best vampire movie i ever saw and lestat is pictured perfectly in it maybe not his features but i don't think one can find a better lestat the way he speaks and the way he looks at mere mortals his arrogance and sheer love for fame is pictured flawlessly br br if u for once consider it just a movie and not try and relate every scene to the book u will love the movie as much as i do br br now to the non readers br br be prepared to fall absolutely in love with this movie it has every thing and the goth music is like an added treat the dialogues are beautiful and catching and even though its a vampire movie u will find yourself smiling at the wit of the characters and u will find yourself sympathizing with the vampires br br overall one of my fav movies 10 10
<START> a surprisingly great cartoon in the same league as batman tas and its ilk i enjoyed it in my youth and recently had been able to watch them all again great voice acting from tim curry richard moll tony jay and maurice lamarche in various roles the only qualm i had was rob voice seemed a little too old for the title character but that wasn't a big deal as the stories were great and the fact that the whole thing has a great time loop twist ending some people say it was a cop out but i found it refreshing compared to many series that just leave things hanging hopefully one day they put this series out on dvd unfortunately it came out at a time when dvd's weren't yet prevalent and the cartoon probably only served to sell a particular type of toy which i never found appealing despite the entertaining cartoon
<START> may have a good story but the director is utterly devoid of talent he does not know when to stop when the story calls for people to act confused there are ten minute scenes of people miming the act of confusion when the story calls for a little background history there are ten minute scenes of greenery when the story calls for a kid throwing tantrums you get the idea br br not to mention the extreme closeups so that you can count people's nose hair there are movies that should be seen on a big screen this movie should be seen on a 13 tv also who plays is the worst actress i've seen in quite a long time a normal human being would need to practise overacting for years to achieve what she does so effortlessly br br i give it 4 10 solely because the subject matter is different and the story is not bad the fact that a movie like gets to be india's entry to the oscars tells volumes not about the state of indian cinema but the state of indian judging committees a movie is not good just because its subject matter is arty
<START> this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly the fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film a truly truly bad film
<START> let me start by saying overall i enjoyed the long kiss goodnight i would give it a 7 10 the good 1 acting samuel l jackson is entertaining in almost any role in this movie he doesn't play his usual character the type that is in control instead geena davis is in control and sam is along for the ride his timing on his lines are great and he is the high point of the movie geena davis also gives a great preformance as samantha caine charlie baltimore she is a believable action hero and i don't think too many other actresses could pull off the preformance geena does 2 the action this is a very action packed movie things are pretty much always crashing or blowing up or someone is chasing someone else the special effects are pretty good especially for being almost 8 years old i can see some green screen stuff but it doesn't detract too much from the acting br br the bad 1 why did it take half of the movie to set up the plot this film needed to be edited in the script stage so that it didn't run as long as it did maybe a drama or something can run this long but people really need to be into the movie the entire time to sustain it i think that if you can stick out the first half you will be the second half 2 geena davis is cold weather and a tank top but she never seems cold 3 some things are unrealistic sam jackson flies through a giant sign after he is blasted out of a room and then he lands in a tree and just gets up when you see this part you will think it's a gag overall fun movie 7 10
<START> obviously raw feed video is smarter than all of us who wasted our money renting this flick they will make millions from video rentals and their low budget investment is going to pay off big which will finance rest stop ii unfortunately i figure they spent a maximum of a few hundred thousand dollars american to hire the actors rent the rest stop locale and burn a truck and drag a motorcycle along behind the truck for a bit plus pay for the technical stuff that's it we should all be as smart as these guys i won't knock them for having the genius to promote a stinker into good monetary returns premise of the movie was good and it could have been a really adequate horror movie but it failed by not delivering a clear story line i am always looking for a gem from the upstart film companies but i didn't find it here and neither will you i'm only sorry i wasted 3 99 plus tax to find out
<START> in s o s sylvester goes from picking garbage cans to being a stowaway on a cruise ship that happens to carry a certain canary bird and granny his owner uh oh once again tweety and granny provide many obstacles to the cat's attempts to get the bird sylvester also gets seasick quite a few times too and the second time the red nosed feline goes to the place on the ship that has something that cures his ailments tweety replaces it with so now sylvester can blow fire i'll stop here and say this is another excellent cartoon directed by friz starring the popular cat and bird duo s o s is most highly recommended
<START> kill the scream queen may sound like a good slasher flick but it is terribly boring and very dumb br br kill the scream queen is about a crazy filmmaker who auditions girls to be in his snuff film he rapes and tortures them this is trash that is not amusing suspenseful or entertaining the killer has no motive okay maybe hes just sick and very dull maybe they could of gave a victim a story of their own anything could be an improvement it needed a lot more br br they could of put just a little more into it i love horror slasher films but this is ridiculously bad
<START> i saw this film at the edinburgh film festival and would not recommend it it is two and a half hours long during which nothing much happens at a wading through porridge pace br br the main characters are gormless and totally lacking in charisma or personality no one smiles at all during the film neither would i if i had their lives and although domino seems to have a healthy sexual appetite she doesn't seem to enjoy sex at all br br the whole experience is depressing and ponderous the director lingering over each scene in a way that drove me crazy rather than striking me with the beauty of his technique br br too many questions were left in my mind why does he sniff the algerian man's head why does he levitate what is he looking at over the fence why does he kiss joseph why did we go and see this rubbish rather than ordering another bottle of wine in rouge
<START> i was part of the cast of space odyssey playing fido in mission control i just want to say that none of us actors specially those in mission control who had to react to a green screen most of the time had any idea how amazing it would turn out to be i knew it was going to be good if only for the sheer camaraderie and professionalism that the production team at impossible pictures provided for everyone involved but when we all saw it for the first time at the screening at the mayfair well i for one felt very proud i was so glad that none of us looked like we were in star trek joe the screenwriter and director is the most amazing man to work for he pretty much gets a good team together and then just trusts them implicitly to freely do what they do best i'm really lucky to have been part of this show who knew something this epic and complicated to understand would turn out to be so enticing to watch and my god it's a beautiful universe out there
<START> i am a fan of the paranormal and i love ghost hunters so when this show first came out i decided to give it a try i could barely sit through one episode the show is so obviously staged i mean come on every single episode involves someone being possessed or involves a demonic force trying to kill the family another huge flaw is that these guys never debunk anything when i watch ghost hunters they find evidence and try to disprove it and if they can't then it is evidence on this show they find a voice or a piece of video evidence and they are very quick to call it a ghost this completely ruins their credibility unlike taps and ghost hunters who actually know what they're doing honestly if you're interested in the paranormal and want to watch a show about it watch ghost hunters
<START> theres not much you can really say about this film except that it was crap and probably the worst film i have ever been to see take my advice don't watch this film it just wastes your money and time br br i gave this film a 1 10 which is doesn't deserve
<START> visually beautiful with some fine music this film otherwise has a fairly trite made for tv quality the romance between two characters which spans a cultural and educational divide is simply not plausible of course from early on we knew our heroine would lighten up win over the locals and find true love but that doesn't make it any less woeful that the movie had to take such completely expected turns this film had lots of promise which makes it more of a shame that the promise was unrealized perhaps a nice under the blanket on a cold night freebie on cable but i certainly wouldn't recommend paid rental or purchase i'm sure the soundtrack is wonderful though
