<START> being a science fiction fan from my early childhood long time since i always hated implausible plots it's a pity that most authors of science fiction stories for children do not show this kind of respect for their audience i always suspected them of thinking children are to dumb to realise so we don't have to strive the writer of science fiction 2002 is no exception the story is about a boy who is instigated by his new friends to spy after his parents because they think that the parents are aliens as intriguing the idea sounded to me as much was i bored by its realisation it seemed to me that the filmmakers had exactly this one idea and tried to stretch it over the ninety minutes by dunking it into a dark stylish and painstakingly slow atmosphere the only thing that kept me in my seat was the question how do they manage to get out of this implausible rubbish and then bang they did not even try so if you are looking for good entertainment for both children and parents go and watch 2002 instead
<START> get shorty was an excellent film it was funny and had the perfect balance of highly comical acting and a serious plot be cool is like some cheap knock off trying to pass for a sequel john travolta as chili palmer seems to have forgotten that he was ever in the mob he plays it like he's a bored movie exec rather than a bored movie exec who used to be a shylock uma thurman great in nearly every role she's ever played comes off as strained and confusing is she supposed to be ditzy or clever the chemistry between her and travolta is strained and uncomfortable other than that just add every movie clichÃ© you can think of a well educated rap producer by cedric the entertainer an inept gangster wannabe in andre 3000 the girl with heart soul and a good set of pipes in christina a gimmicky black dude wannabe in vince vaughn and a stupid celebrity cameo by stephen tyler the only funny part was the rock who invents his own new clichÃ© as a gay samoan bodyguard actor wannabe probably the biggest crime is the plot it makes no sense get shorty was clever with chili playing one group against another and coming out on top but this film tries that with about a million different characters and even chili doesn't seem to know what's going on fans of get shorty be warned this is a very different very worse movie
<START> this is a flic that you can safely avoid childish plot and poor acting from cameron she really shouldn't take on these serious roles they don't suit her besides she looks most unglamorous lets face it great in charlies angels and she was superb in there's something about mary the pope wouldn't be a good president of the usa and vice versa my point being that there are some actors actresses who are suited to a particular type of character and cameron is most unsuited for this serious housewife type there are a dozen other actress' would have done a far better job the movie itself is rather unbelievable and juvenile in its plot did i spell right i noticed a comment from another reviewer who has given the box a 10 rating who was derisive in his comments on other reviewers who gave the movie a 1 or 2 rating and couldn't spell i mean whats spelling got to do with a movie review does he mean that persons who spell perfectly could appreciate this movie more that the ones who couldn't c'mon 'professor
<START> i was also disappointed with this movie for starters the things that happen to him don't seem too terrible to me sorry male chauvinist pov as is pointedly said by one of the lady captors most men would pay to be in your position to which he replies but this is not my choice ok ok fair point so how bad was it really please let us know but now the kicker he does not let anyone know until after the movie end unseen not his girlfriend not is mentor not the police not anyone in stead he comes up with the brilliant plan of f ck ng every girl he knows so he may recognize the tattoo or something of one of his captors i thought he'd just had enough unpleasant sex during the 12 days of his captivity isn't it time to take a little break from all that for me his to put it mildly ill advised actions broke the suspension of disbelief of the movie i took out a book while watching the last half hour out of the corner of my eye
<START> haggard the movie is well written well directed and well acted there are many laugh out loud moments and some terrific skateboarding scenes featuring the scenes of west chester pa are filmed beautifully and the script is just downright funny what i like about the movie is that instead of being another sappy love story or another version of jackass it takes a darkly funny look at break ups from a different perspective most break up films feature a naive woman jilted by a cheating man she then goes on to find mr right and gets to tell her cheating ex to get lost this movie takes a look at the emotional roller coaster of a jilted man without taking itself too seriously ryan dunn does an excellent job as the jilted man and with bam and brandon as your best friends trying to help you through this rough time how can you take anything too seriously it is obvious that and co are incredibly talented both behind and in front of the camera i look forward to their future films and endeavors
<START> the adventures of sebastian cole is about a boy named sebastian adrian grenier who fancies himself becoming a writer at some point given he actually puts effort into it this movie is presumably the years where he gets his material for writing the adventure years hence the title and the previous quote in it we experience the very typical coming of age stories and warnings of loves drugs and sex changes yeah there's a slight twist here that is very interesting and that is that sebastian's step dad clark gregg very early on makes a rough decision to get a sex change that has a huge impact on sebastian's family and his relationship with his step dad br br clark gregg plays hank henrietta sebastian's step father and is very good in the part very believable without being over the top which is a route this film could've taken rather easily thankfully they didn't adrien grenier who i'm only familiar with from entourage is also very good in his part as sebastian and together he and gregg have a great relationship on screen it's always quite engaging to watch these guys relationship as it develops and is genuinely heartbreaking at times br br and that's the best of what this film has to offer unfortunately it brings with it some mediocre camera work direction and cinematography it's not bad but it's a far cry from being good or memorable in the slightest the characters are also thinly written and it's clear from the get go how most of the arcs will pan out the only truly fascinating character through and through is clark hank henrietta i've already said grenier did well acting wise but the character of sebastian is not only not engaging but is completely unlikeable i don't honestly see why anyone in the audience would route for his character in anything he does he mopes whines cheats lies and lacks any aspirations other than to be a complete slacker it'd be different if he was maybe a side character or comic relief but to have him as the main focus and to be asked to take the character seriously come on br br and i don't really hold it against this film but i just want to say pick a different song in all these films hollywood no more where is my mind by the pixies we all know it's a good song stop using it in every other film br br i feel like i could just keep tearing more and more of this film apart but in all honesty i didn't hate it i just didn't really care for it and i wouldn't recommend it to anyone the adventures of sebastian cole isn't a bad or boring film it's just not a very good or engaging one either it's very uneven and the script could've used quite a bit of work i guess the point of the film is to be a loose sort of look at the life of a writer before he made it and it worked if that writer put out pieces of fiction that i wouldn't want to read
<START> first off the initial concept of a lost fortune in gold bars discovered in a new zealand lake inside a downed world war 2 plane is a great opening what follows is nothing but cartoon like drivel men chasing men cars chasing men helicopters chasing men helicopters chasing boats boats chasing boats for the better part of an hour the most boring nonsense with absolutely no advancement to the story special mention must be made of the chop shop editing as many scenes seem to have been spliced together in random order the acting by all concerned is an embarrassment one last thing the picture quality and sound quality is so bad on this dvd that you will be appalled merk
<START> julie brown hilariously demolishes madonna's attempt at a rockumentary with gut ripping humor and truly original and catchy songs that rival madonna's own cinematography and sets are top notch br br kathy griffin and chris elliott offer their own injections of comedy that enhances and compliments this film appearances by bobcat goldthwait and wink martindale as themselves is an added bonus br br it's hard to tell if brown's performance is meant to insult or playfully tease madonna though i hardly think the material girl would find humor in it br br my favorite line why don't you come here to the phillipines all they eat is dog and i'm a vegetarian
<START> miyazaki's studio ghibli shows his wonderful touch animating infusing life in every little action of the characters in when puts down so carefully his little boat to reach for the red fish you know that you'll have a very good time watching this movie br br the characters are interesting and you really care for them they recall visually other stories seems a grown up nausicaa with a son an old lady in wheelchair remembers the witch in howl's moving castle br br the presence of the elements wind rain and the sea with its great powerful waves is so strong that i think it has never been evoked in such a way in any other movie it is a simple story loosely inspired by the little mermaid and it reach for the very heart of the audience just like totoro the other miyazaki's true masterpiece br br an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits don't miss it
<START> this film has no plot no good acting to be honest it has nothing the same songs play over and over awful acting and if you can actually sit there and watch the whole thing and enjoy it there is something wrong with you i wish i could give this 0 out of 10 but i cant so it has to be a 1 which is generous ice t isn't even a good rapper and even worse at acting every bit of the film is rubbish i got this film on dvd without knowing what it was for the price of Â£1 99 and thought that i had picked up a bargain i then looked at the imdb rating and didn't take it into consideration but after watching it found out that the dvd i had bought was a complete waste of time money and electricity if you have this film there are two things you can do sell it to someone who doesn't know about it or burn it
<START> this comes close to the worst movie i've ever seen the writer starts you out in a way that you'll side with jasper josh hartnett when he did absolutely nothing wrong sam leelee leaves him for kelley chris klein in a way that leaves you mad at sam you aren't let in on what she feels so her feelings with kelley aren't real to you and their relationship is phony it drags you in either direction and it gets rather exhausting and annoying the only good thing about this movie that i saw was the cast br br
<START> this certainly is one of the best western movies produced in the new millennium it's an homage to all the stars of the great tv western classics and it is the ultimate revival of the western movie the story of two brothers who meet after the war between the states and end up on different sides of the law isn't new but interesting nonetheless and the shootouts and the atmosphere are great there is some graphic violence like bad guys getting chopped to death with an axe or women being shot down in cold blood and lee majors doesn't take part in the action until the very end that's why i gave it 9 out of 10 points but it still is one of the best new western productions i've ever seen i've had the honor and pleasure to meet chris mcintyre at the festival of the west and have a nice chat with him and i've had the chance to meet buck taylor who performs the role of town doctor in my opinion we ought to be much obliged to chris mcintyre for his efforts to gather that many stars of the classic tv westerns and sass around him to perform in a new western such as this chris has an outstanding talent for choosing the right actors for the main characters too both are young and promising and i think we should see more of them in future western productions i sincerely enjoyed this western movie it was worth every minute i hope that chris mcintyre will continue to work on other western movies and present us with some more great productions such as this one great work chris jasper p morgan pete
<START> i'm a large scarred heterosexual male ex bouncer ex rugby player and ex boxer and i love this movie br br it's no mystic river it's a piece of fluff but there is room in life for fluff and when that fluff is engagingly shot well acted by attractive likable people cleverly plotted and full of good dialogue there's even more room for it br br i'm not the biggest tom selleck fan but he's good in this so are julianne nicholson love her bald head and freckles ellen degeneres kate capshaw and even tom everett scott that thing you do br br the scenery is nice the mood is upbeat there's heartache and wistfulness and farce and even a little redemption br br any male reviewer who disses this movie is shall we say not perfectly confident in his masculinity in the meantime i'll continue to catch bits and pieces of it without apology whenever it shows up on cable
<START> this film was utter tripe possible that it is in fact a pollution the subtle tense atmosphere of the original remake are no where to be seen sarah michelle gellar is given nothing to do even in her death sequence but still she is the best performance in this film and the her death is the best thing about it even though she did deserve a better death its the sign of very bad writing and directing i'm guessing she did this film to end her connection with it as its turning rubbish br br not scary not tense not funny makes no sense at all and as said above sarah michelle gellar gives the only reasonable performance out of the entire cast
<START> if you described any of the scenes nightmares of children murdering you in your sleep your infant daughter talking to ghosts searching for your lost child in an abandoned mine at night so petrified with fear that you can't move even though the blood from a murder victim is dripping onto you from the floor above Â then i'd say you had a horror movie but some how 'wicked little things' just wasn't scary i am a horror fan and i loved the location the plot in principal and i liked the three leading ladies i didn't want to see them come to harm i wanted the 'bad guy' to get his just desserts the rest of the cast are always simply cannon fodder so i was indifferent either way with them and it played out every clichÃ© in the book even down to the torch battery running out in the pitch dark just as you start to here whispering voices closing in on you br br i would still recommend that you watch it but unless you are new to horror movies or under 12 years you will have seen it all before
