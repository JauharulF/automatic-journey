<START> this film has to be as near to perfect a film as john ford made the film is magic a masterpiece the reason ford was well ford if you want to know why ford was great this one explains it br br the photography of course is superb black and white as black and white should be wonderful shots not an over the shoulder conversation in it pure ford great moments big and little the famous ripped pants of ward bond apparently two dogs kept invading the set and fighting so ford wanted to use them in the fighting scene but instead of fighting one dog ran away and the other attacked ward bond and ripped his pants which caused ford no end of mirth a whole scene around a rope the way ben johnson burn then snuffs his rope wonderful foreshadowing and anticipation of the final harry carey's naive courting of prudence the usual ford line about being scared and not showing it bond's horse accidentally falling in him and its left in the film johnson and bond are fantastic in that scene lord help any ford actor who does not stay in character while the camera is rolling even when a horse falls on top of you br br a couple of very sweet romances not intruding on the whole focus two very likable leads not to mention for the girls the number of times the cameras focus on ben johnson's rather delightful backside br br lots of old time stuntmen getting lines and roles cliff lyons frank mcgrath some wonderful character studies mostly of faces staring all the villains and main stars a set of villains to rival any group in any western br br many many fordian shots of faces groups children women small things happening in the background ford seems to love images of women in allowing the moment as wagons cross rivers and the camera lingers br br this is probably not a western as much as an artist's picture that happens to be set in the west br br lucky the film was made in 1950 because it is impossible to imagine such a film could be ever made again but then it is such a work of art that it would be a sacrilege to attempt it
<START> i gave airport '79 only two stars because it's a truly lousy film nobody who had anything to do with it deserves any praise except for chihuahua who does a pretty good job in his role this is not to say that the film isn't worth watching it helps if you have a buzz on but this is not essential br br really does seem like an early version of airplane every scene has a set up and a payoff and the scenes blunder after one another as if they were totally disconnected one of my favorite recurring points is that the passengers crew and airplane get to keep going no matter what you're a news reporter and a strange guy gets murdered at your house in your presence the hit man then chases you onto your greenhouse roof no problem you can still catch that early morning flight to paris no need to get the cops involved your plane dodges one unmanned drone missile four heat seeking missiles and cannon fire from an unidentified phantom fighter doing barrel rolls an dive and a crash net landing without thrust in the process no problem we'll have the mechanics check the oil and get you on your way in just a few hours it's truly funny br br and i'll admit that there's a bit of the anarchist in me that comes out when the passengers pay no attention to the cabin attendants the highlight is when the attendant tells jimmie walker he'll have to put away his saxophone god spare me from a flight seated in front of a saxophonist playing jazz prior to take off jimmie basically says nope later in the flight the sax is damaged during a barrel roll and jimmie actually shows up on the next leg of the flight with yet another sax that he won't put away this aspect of the film is just fun one passenger actually obeys the attendant when charo is told she can't take her dog on the flight she leaves the plane naturally this is because you can't get a good view of her ass and boobs while she's seated br br in summary a terrible movie but terrible enough to be a bit amusing unfortunately the filmmakers and cast deserve no credit whatsoever for this as it was probably entirely unintentional
<START> there were very few good moments in this film only a couple of characters were fleshed out and not that well there were plot holes big enough to drive a truck through the pace creep ed along like an old man there were many moments that the film never came back to like coco stripping what happened to her how about sister is she better now what about leroy we learned absolutely nothing about him what about the electronic piano guy how about the rich girl that got an abortion what happened to her that was an interesting subplot br br overall this is not a good movie and i recommend another musical that was in this film let's do the time warp again
<START> even after all these years this remain a perfect movie for me i still remember sitting for a long time in the theater after it was over stunned by the experience overcome by emotion i own the dvd of course is see at least once a year it's incomparable and i cannot add much to has already been written about its excellence and beauty so glad others love it as much as i do a note the author of the book on which it's based michael was enchanted with the film and is quoted as saying he wished he had thought of some of the lovely scenes written purely for the movie the way kip invites hana to his side with a trail of small candles and the way he arranges for hana to view the frescoes in the ruined medieval church
<START> it's a simple fact that there are many of us from the 80's generation who grew up loving those loopy john cusack comedies made by savage steve holland and while i prefer there other more bizarre out there flick better off dead it's hard for me to dislike one crazy summer a movie i grew up loving wholeheartedly as a kid into my teens was a follow up to better off dead returning cusack and curtis armstrong from that film br br cusack is hoops following graduation pal joel murray george to for the summer to each some fun on the beach hoops finds himself embroiled in a feud with a blonde buff punk named teddy whose lecherous father has designs on over homes of a neighborhood to build a giant condominium one of the homes needing it's mortgage repaid belongs to demi moore cassandra there's a race which might be their only hope of saving cassandra's grandfather's home he had recently passed but it has been won by teddy over the past many years and hoops is deathly afraid of boats over water but with the help and motivation of newfound friends such as bobcat and tom villard as auto mechanic twin brothers george and budding love interest cassandra perhaps hoops can come to terms with his fears and win the race to save the neighborhood armstrong has a supporting part as the son of a kooky manic weapons salesman general raymond sctv's joe flaherty in an inspired bit of casting ack who uses the training from his father to assist hoops and company in their goals to win the race br br memorable scenes include bobcat getting stuck in a godzilla suit running rampant across an entire model of mark metcalf barely recognizable as rather unhinged pops 's condominium hoops being chased by deranged cub scouts wishing to perform first aid george a victim of toxic flatulence bruce wagner's nutty uncle frank's increasing insanity every time he tries to better his chances to win 1 million dollars from a radio show and the wonderful billie bird as george's grandma who actually bills the group after a meal jeremy piven as you guessed it a brutish jerk who associates with teddy and causes trouble for hoops and his posse the yummy kimberly foster as cookie girl who attempts to make out with hoops while he attends a luncheon with his father and the one and only william hickey as old man who will not reward his son and grandson an inheritance if they lose the sail boat race demi moore is cute but this is cusack's vehicle though bobcat and villard steal most of the scenes their in again some delightful animation from holland are sprinkled throughout the movie hoops is an artist appropriately if you like his movies i highly recommend the underrated how i got into college
<START> for one thing he produced this movie it has the feel of later movies with international casts that are dubbed the opening credits tell us it was filmed in vienna br br bey was a delight in the universal adventure movies of the 1940s he was also superb in a movie i saw maybe ten years ago but have never heard of since the amazing mr x maybe it was dr x i remember it as a thrilling and frightening movie br br this one is pretty wooden unfortunately the plot isn't easy to follow when i got the hang of it i was disappointed anyway br br francis lederer looks great as a concert pianist he was a very handsome leading man ten or 15 years earlier he never really caught on as a major star though he should have br br this isn't terrible but it's pretty heavy going
<START> although there is very little plot and whatever exists is just all improvisational still it was a good start from a new director with no previous financial back up and also a smart move from andy warhol to make his productions more marketable and viewer friendly in any case this story of a street hustler relies too much on showing joe buck naked almost all the time and the creative use of a flashy editing really wears off after the hundredth time and the cutting off the dialog thing gets really annoying half way this would have been a much more entertaining or even dramatic if they made a documentary of the daily of an actual male prostitute or hustler instead of letting the actors make up some plot and dialog of their own
<START> xavier a french student moves into an apartment in barcelona with a cast of six other characters from all over europe an italian a danish a german a british a spanish and a belgium br br he wants to get a job in eu with the help of his father's friend he says there are jobs here a lot but if you know spanish and spanish market so he advice him to go spain xavier gets an eramus grand and fly to barcelona by living his girlfriend and mother br br he first learns that the house he will stay is no longer available and the small rooms in barcelona are even more expensive than he thinks he stays in a french couples house while he was looking for a house he has been interviewed with the 5 people from the house and has been accepted he had an affair with this french guys lovely wife and totally messed up everything with his problematic girlfriend br br do you want to hear more did you travel abroad for education watch this movie i promise that you will have a very nice time
<START> i'm not sure what i can add that hasn't already been said in some of these other fine and quite hilarious comments but ill try br br so you know the plot there is a bed possessed by a demon that absorbs and selectively disintegrates the bodies of whoever or whatever lays on it with its orange soda filled body we have the man in some scenes looking uncannily like robert smith of the cure hanging out inside the wall commenting on the goings on and we have our various victims that just cant resist the comfort of this mystical bed br br this is no ordinary bed no bob not only does it eat people but it cleans up after itself draws the covers back and it even makes itself who wouldn't want a bed like that it can even use its sheets as a rudimentary lasso to wrangle escaped victims back in especially if they're taking up half the length of the film to try and escape br br our main story if you can call it that is about these three girls who go out to this remote area to house sit i don't recall exactly but it doesn't really matter though as there are plenty of things that defy convention that you just have to give in and accept the dialogue in the film is like no other the characters talk to each other seemingly by telepathy as their mouths never seem to move and there is a constant echo one of our girls believes she isn't liked by the rest of the gang and makes sure to tell us all her feelings on this matter through an echoey voice over but we don't care character development was thrown out the window a long time before in this film so why start now there are scenes when the bed laughs crunches and makes various other noises that we assume judging by our cast's non reaction to said noises cant be heard this and the telepathy makes the issue of very difficult to ascertain but thats ok this is death bed the bed that eats and it defies all logic so its ok it makes for a lush dreamy quality to this most bizarre film if you buy hehe buy did i say buy this dvd make sure to check out the introduction by the director he explains that the filming of this flick started in 1972 didn't wrap up until 1977 he shopped it for a few years with no luck and then fast forward 26 years to 2003 it gets released on dvd supposedly someone somewhere had a print of this in some other country and made bootleg after bootleg of it and it was quite by chance on a message board no less that our director found evidence that people knew and gasp cared about his little known film its from there that he decided to give it a shot and release it i'm glad he did once you've even so much as heard the title to this film you must see it i for one am going to buy this and i'm going to preach its gospel around the world starting with this comment
<START> what was wes thinking making this dribble it does not jive well with any of his other work but then again he seemed to fall into a slight slump after making a a nightmare on elm street this can be seen by his follow ups 1 to hell 2 chiller 3 hills have eyes ii 4 deadly friend 5 and the rainbow 6 shocker all of these films were either mediocre our crap it was not until people under the stairs that he gained his momentum back and started to kick butt again chiller has none of craven's regulars and none of his suspense the only good scene in when the old man has a heart attack on the stairs after for his job
<START> my first of the live action movie trailer viewable on youtube was wow this could be perhaps one of the few better live action anime adaptations br br this time i was just wrong simply put the live action movie was a puzzle missing a number of pieces put together just enough to get the vague image of it all br br story br br the movies story vaguely follows the anime and manga but the movies story is just the frame of a car rather than a complete automobile it seems that many parts of the story originally in the anime were left out altered or completely changed in fact the ending is completely different from the manga or anime endings br br characters especially many left out or had a different feel the connection between and is reduced to that of knowing her because she's the video store lady character felt too strong already and only uttered the infamous i'm sorry a few times in the movie same can be said with we lost the shy uptight yet tall male lead the song he hums and his frequent action of calling silly other characters like and had a different toned down feel to them perhaps the dropping and toning down of other characters was to focus a lot more on and which it did way too much expecting a lot of sweet action scenes like those in the trailer well don't those in the trailer plus a few minutes is the only amount of action you will get so much of the movie is talking that while i was browsing thru the movie before watching it all i thought i had gotten a regular asian romance drama br br pacing was way too fast in the film we see the famous scene of armed with small wings and a chain gun arm in just a little less than nine minutes of beginning it there is very little time to get to know the characters and connect with them what they should have done was split it into two movies or even a trilogy if it had been not as many things would have to be changed or dropped br br but again the movie behaves like a frame the anime was more of a complete automobile because even if all those little details and such are minor they can really add up br br production br br visuals visuals were disappointing so much of the special effects turned out looking quite cheesy especially the cgi sadly they were like those found on sci fi channel movies they are bearable and this movie isn't for the effects br br music music was average much of it was orchestral background music except there were really no themes the film has dropped the addicting song that in the anime was always humming a noticeable piece of music though is the ending song heard in the trailer not a bad and somewhat beautiful song its a shame that it was not integrated into the movie as itself or an orchestrated version of the song br br casting casting was also so so the main star was actor aki maeda who is most famous for her role in the battle royale films the actor that played was pretty good but they took away the glasses from the original character oh yeah and tetsuo looks like lupin the 3rd br br unlike what i've heard from a few others the acting in the live action was not that bad i rather feel at fault is the way the story was laid out and cramming the series into just a two hour film br br what can be learned from the live action br br cgi i really wish the cgi in hadn't been that bad but even with just that we could have gotten a few more fight scenes probably the most anticipated live action anime adaptation neon genesis evangelion most likely wont suffer since they currently have weta studios assigned to do the effects br br modernism owned a video shop used a audio cassette player to listen to music and gave a mix tape for his birthday why this movie is made in 2006 not only that in the movies reality they can create such a thing as so it cannot take place in the 90s the future is an age of cds dvds and mp3 players hopefully in evangelion shinji will have a sony walkman mp3 player not one that plays cassette tapes br br story pacing as mentioned earlier the movie moved too fast and forced the story to drop out many details it was a smart move upon adv films and whoever else to make evangelion into a solid trilogy thus allowing more time to retell the story as true to the original as possible br br characters leave most of the character designs alone and let those classic quotes be said what if the live action evangelion didn't have what are you stupid or i mustn't run away sometimes as small as they seem those frequent quotes add and are who the characters are br br conclusion br br all in all the live action movie had potential it really did those you who aren't fans and see this movie you will be reluctant to start the anime or manga so don't watch the movie first people who saw and liked the anime manga don't get your hopes up on this one studies show you most likely will be disappointed it was still fun to see the anime come to life in the live action adaptation but it could have been so much more br br reluctantly i give the live action a 2 out of 5 br br as says i'm sorry br br
<START> i usually have a difficult time watching a tv movie the extra long commercial breaks will break my concentration and i give up and find a good book this one however made me put up with the adds and stay with it to the end i realize the movie was based on a true story but it was not brought out why it took so long to find denny they had his name and i would presume his social security number while he did move around a lot it would seem he would be found as soon as his number was entered for a job etc the actors seemed a bit old for the part and a buried metal object when dug up had no rust these were only technical glitches and did not take from the file for a lifetime movie it was better than most
<START> ugh yes it's exactly like the mess or the horrific arrests in washington in the movie the mother keeps aggressively questioning her little boy over and over and over until he finally tells her what she obviously wants to hear the court investigators and therapists repeat the pattern the questioning itself is sexually creepy a relentlessy repeated assault in its own way br br the moviemakers throw in a doctor talking about physical evidence of abuse maybe to justify the film's point of view that two to four year olds never make things like this up well they will if every adult they know is asking them to the way this piece endorses such discredited interrogation techniques makes watching it an exercise in frustration for anyone who knows what it takes to get a successful prosecution in real life br br they also add a special arrest incident towards the end to prove their case no parallel to this fictional incident ever occurred in real life can't say more here without turning this into a spoiler but you'll know it when you see it br br yes children are abused sometimes by paid care providers but to watch a movie which affirms the ludicrous hysterical accusations against so many totally innocent people to watch re creations of the trials that ruined the lives of countless children as well as the lives of the accused i didn't think i'd last until the end it's just too sad and made more so by the writing team's seeming endorsement of the abusive paranoid questioning techniques that started what can we call it the bonfire of the br br no one i know has ever been accused of child abuse thank heaven but my 12 times over great grandmother was accused of witchcraft and killed for it mobs filled with what they think is holy anger are just as dangerous now as three hundred years ago sensational drivel like this these accusations of satanic abuse are cropping up all over the country there must be something there so tell the jury that just eggs them on br br and whoever thought it was a good idea to have kids under ten some of them under five play these roles it's traumatic to watch them delivering their lines how much more traumatic was it to act these parts the commitment to fight child abuse apparently doesn't apply to themselves and what were the child actors' parents thinking melinda uncredited at least in the version on the a e network in 2005 but i think it was friel and teddy brian bonsall were terrific professionals or not though they were too young to be exposed to this material much less to be paid to act it out despite ruthlessly exploiting these real life children do you know the muffin man got an emmy nomination for directing which just goes to show how crazed things were back in 1989
<START> low budget horror movie if you don't raise your expectations too high you'll probably enjoy this little flick beginning and end are pretty good middle drags at times and seems to go nowhere for long periods as we watch the goings on of the insane that add atmosphere but do not advance the plot quite a bit of gore i enjoyed bill performance which he made quite believable for such a low budget picture he managed to carry the movie at times when nothing much seemed to be happening nurse charlotte beale played by jesse lee played her character well so be prepared to want to slap her toward the end she makes some really stupid mistakes but then that's what makes these low budget movies so good i would have been out of that place and five states away long before she even considered that it might be a good idea to leave if you enjoy this movie try committed from 1988 which is basically a rip off of this movie
<START> little did i know that when i signed up the the all pay channel package with direct tv that i would face a movie like this it came on right after another movie we had been watching and i was a teenager in 1981 so am not sure where i was at the time but i missed this movie br br i also can't believe we left it on it is kind of funny as it takes you back in the time machine to the early 80s but i think even then this would have been a painful movie it was just well too cute et was cute in a way but not obnoxiously cute and stupid br br when i see a movie like this i come on onto imdb to see what others say i am blown away that this thing was nominated wow the movie industry has come a long way since the 80s oh well it did show some old actors btw that is the other thing i was surprised about the lineup not a bunch of no names but some real actors actresses must have been in their drug days anyways odd interesting bizarre and makes one happy they grew up
