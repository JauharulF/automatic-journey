<START> the discussion has been held a thousand times is the merchant of venice antisemitic i think it is isn't it unfair to always point out this little bit of in an otherwise great piece of art i think it isn't does this play stain shakespeare's reputation as the world's greatest playwright i think it does does it play a role if he didn't do it on a particular racist purpose i think it doesn't michael radford knew all this and this is why he added to his movie a prologue about the pitiful situation of the jews in renaissance venice br br in vain for the play remains what it has always been and the new make up only gives a first but futile hope that someone has dared to set something right that remains a permanent outrage not because its degree of would be particularly shocking but because the play comes under the name of william shakespeare br br why spend so much time in portraying the hatred of a man shylock why employ a great and serious actor like al pacino if in the end everything is getting ruined in this outrageous but hey i'm not responsible shakespeare wrote it court room scene and now i'd like to be very precise just like shylock himself br br he's demanding his right according to the contract which the not very responsible christian antonio who always used to look down on him signed in full awareness of the consequences sure what shylock demands is cruel and useless but that's not the point what we see or should see is a man who has been humiliated for all his life to the point where all what remains on him is his hatred i think it is certainly a bit inappropriate to lecture such a man on things like compassion br br but what the play the movie they are one and the same now does at this point is become a soap opera the cruel madman with his knife the horrified but rather short minded audience the poor victim tied to his chair true antonio accepts his fate but why can't he just say one word sorry i think we need not lose many words on the ridiculous verdict of the young from it's a truly popular verdict not much different from what would be seen 400 years later in the show trials of the nazis from one minute to the next this jew is robbed of everything he owned sentenced to being baptized christian and kicked out br br isn't that outrageous obviously not the story moves on to the romantic intricacies of the rings and its happy end br br what one can learn in jewish museum in berlin and similar places all over the world is that often goes unnoticed by the mass because what's so devastating for a minority or some individuals is embedded in the alleged greater good for the majority it should be exactly the task of everyone of us to develop a sensitivity to detect and unmask such tendencies br br i don't accept the excuse that this film was made to create empathy with the badly treated shylock it just doesn't work out i don't think that anybody can be forced to be merciful br br i don't recommend this movie in particular not for an oscar
<START> tom is about to tuck into a delicious jerry sandwich when a huge bird of prey swoops down and flies off with his snack not at all happy with having his stolen right from under his nose tom takes off in hot pursuit determined to retrieve his mousy morsel br br as much as i love tom and jerry i have got to say that this one is a bit of a stinker the story is rather mundane it introduces a badly conceived peripheral character that lacks charm and it flogs the old 'dress the cartoon character up as a woman' gag to death br br in my opinion rivals 'fraidy cat' and in manhattan' for the title of weakest tom and jerry caper thus far
<START> do you know that they want to the moon for real and in there is the debated project that could lead to make possible time machine all i can say about this movie that is based on facts about future at the time of the movie projects but real hope the moon will exist not happen as in the movie now about the movie itself i saw the original movie too and i also read the book the book i didn't like though but the movie yes i totally agree with a previous comment that this movie was depressing unlike the 60's one that was very good with force this one was only a future of what is good movie
<START> john has made two one man shows o rama and freaks and neither one has shown up on dvd john why do you this to me john put it on dvd john so the people can see they need to see john d just in case anyones keeping a watchful aye
<START> while not the first movie i've purchased for myself this is almost certainly the one i've watched the most the animation is well drawn by the experts at tokyo movie and the animators frequently made use of clever techniques such as having the sun cause lens flare having the camera get soaked and having the camera hand clean the lens etc while the film avoided becoming a an animator's gadget fest the judicious but generous application of such techniques gave the film a much more realistic feel than the typical cartoon br br the story has many plots which don't seem to have much to do with each other until everything comes together at the end in a manner even the writers self effacingly admit is contrived each of the major plot lines has its own musical theme ranging from pop goes the weasel plucky to the love theme from romeo and juliet fifi johnny the transitions between plotlines are slightly varied but consistent br br truly a wonderful film there isn't much original music though the new lyrics to spinning song are clever and enjoyable highly recommended
<START> first at all if you like watching movies i recommend you not to watch this one why afterwards you won't appreciate any other movie so easily anymore br br actually i don't wanna give rise to any excessive expectations but it is almost frightening how perfect intense and beautiful this work of is when in most movies there is at least one aspect spoiling the whole thing like good actors but horrible dialogs or a nice scenery but low budget cinematography Â in of the universe there is nothing of this ambivalence really everything is just great even and not least the soundtrack with the magnificent sigur br br in this story about pall a student that goes schizophrenic after being dumped by his girlfriend especially the dialogs and monologues deserve some attention together with and sometimes in sharp contrast to the plot they range from depressing and fatalistic to the whole opposite of comical and totally absurd what is more they are often with quotes from hegel and shakespeare of such a poetic beauty that the movie almost drifts into a surreal sphere and is only saved to the real world by its incredibly authentic actors br br one of the other comments was already referring to another point this movie is no trivial entertainment for relaxing in the evening despite of several comical reliefs in between it is largely disturbing partly cynical and bitter and most of all sad it is a modern poetry about a life of insanity with all its emptiness rage and solitude br br finally when you've seen the movie Â watch it again there are some great visual metaphors and allusions in it that you realize only when you look twice and connect them with the of the story and of course read the book it contains a lot more of the small funny stories in between and also makes you understand some things in the movie a bit better
<START> after a snowstorm the roads are blocked and the highway patrolman jason adam beach comes to the diner of his friend fritz jurgen prochnow and advises his clients that they will only be able to follow their trips on the next day among the weird strangers jason meets his former sweetheart nancy rose who has just left her husband in los angeles along the night without any communication with his base jason faces and suspicious situations with the clients and finds some corpses indicating that among them there is a killer br br the last stop could be an average thriller but the screenplay is simply awful most of the characters are despicable persons and the motives of the surprising serial killer are never disclosed and the viewers have no further explanation why the killer decided to kill the guests my vote is four br br title brazil trapped
<START> i was very excited to see rock star because i am a big fan of mark wahlberg's i was surprised to have liked it more than i originally thought i would the script did leave something to be desired but the movie's performances made up for it there were a few moments when visions of spinal tap came rushing back and i can't help but think this movie would have been even better as a mocumentary but i digress br br wahlberg continues to demonstrate his talent as he plays with believability an ordinary guy whose biggest dream comes true he does it with the wonder and innocence that make you not only believe him but also make you really care about his character br br jennifer aniston who hasn't impressed me in movies up to this point is surprisingly good as the girlfriend manager she shows more real emotion than i've seen in her last few movies combined br br but above all it's the music in this movie that really draws you in peppered with some 80's tunes let's face it bon jovi would have any 80's music fans rocking in their seat the movie really rocks with the original steel dragon songs and wahlberg's performance of them br br i plan to see this movie again but first i'm going to rush out and buy the soundtrack
<START> translates into spirals arriving within this new wave of asian horror films following such hits like ringu ju on and the eye two of them with remakes and much more coming like dark water and tale of two sisters falls short of the spooky supernatural thriller element so characteristic of the other movies the only thing that remains is weirdness and not in a tim burton or david lynch kind of way but in a irrelevant and dull way br br its start with a girl some other kid with a crush on her her best friend and his dad who's obsessed with everything that happens concerns people die and you see so okay it'll go along with it i'm kinda amuse by spirals myself characters don't seem to go anywhere but i'll play along we find out the town is cursed by people start screaming at and the point is are everywhere the movie is a disaster it doesn't know where to go except to show you the power of there are some cool concepts like when the mother cuts her fingers because she sees on her fingerprints but then there's another scene where she hears her husband from beyond the grave tell her that she also has in her ear the way they handled that scene was just laughable not even cheesy fun there are also some a little bit of cool visuals like the collection the father has of and the girl with the hair yep hair its out of context though its seems like it was taken out of a fruit snack commercial where if you eat an fruits snack its taste is so incredible your hair turns into now if this wasn't bad enough suddenly out of nowhere there are snail men or whateverÂ and you know why right because in their shells they have that only left time enough for a crappy anti climatic ending and by that time i was sick of friggin' here there sure look around you how many can you if you want to see a movie about spirals go see pi 3 now there you'll find some pretty cool concepts in between the meaning of life and dark city has also a little bit of a spiraling thing in there br br this movie could have worked as a music video it has already garnered a cult following and thats why i was compelled to see it but after doing so i'm not sure why people think it's great i was truly disappointed
<START> a very accurate depiction of small time mob life filmed in new jersey the story characters and script are believable but the acting drops the ball still it's worth watching especially for the strong images some still with me even though i first viewed this 25 years ago br br a young hood steps up and starts doing bigger things tries to but these things keep going wrong leading the local boss to suspect that his end is being skimmed off not a good place to be if you enjoy your health or life br br this is the film that introduced joe pesce to martin scorsese also present is that perennial screen wise guy frank vincent strong on characterizations and visuals sound muddled and much of the acting is amateurish but a great story
<START> rififi deservedly gets a lot of mention for the famous heist scene and indeed that scene deserves all the credit it gets it's a masterful piece of suspense character interaction and photography but rififi isn't just this one scene every scene in the film is as masterfully put together and as a whole the film is not only taught with suspense plot and character but an adroitly told moral tale that set the scene for film noire for years to come br br cinematically and technically the heist sequence may be the most impressive scene of the film but for me it's the final scene that holds the most power tony le hallucinogenic drive towards redemption
<START> this is not great cinema the film is cliche ridden and in many places it is a copy of the original carrie the parallels with the original film are striking but with an added improbability about the powers being congenital br br i can't say that i disliked the film because it at least passed a couple of hours but these were passed as one would read an undemanding book on a long train journey that book would not be great literature but would absorb one for a while and be forgotten soon afterwards in that it would blend in with the numerous other cliche ridden books likewise the film was okay whilst it lasted but is perhaps forgettable at least i think it is i cant remember much about it now
<START> i paid 2 00 for this piece of crap i want my money back it is a d grade horror movie that isn't so groovy br br there are many many floors in this film including the acting the lack of actual horror the lack of nudity which besides the starting nurse porno outfit and the still breathing nude corpse flash there is none br br the sound track maybe is the best thing because it has some upbeat sorta guitar riffs tracks br br there are your usual typical characters the jock the jocks woman the nerdy guy who looks more like a jock the rookie cop ranger who has the biggest gap in his teeth i wanted to slip a few dollar coins into that gap or go for a field goal the mysterious fella and the pure girl br br the make up was pitiful with side views of dr chopper showing a clear make up line and natural skin tones the cover art to the dvd is clearly photoshop enhanced to make the cover more enticing as dr chopper looks like an old the scraggy women that hang around dr chopper are not explained and or look convincing like the rest of this movie br br the plot twist was very predictable and the abundance of bad looking fake limbs was laughable what did they think um throw some limbs around and some fake blood and you have a horror film br br dr chopper himself is the most stupid character created i've seen in a while though original i believe that the creator of this film was strained for ideas and possibly tried to use the rhyme doctor and chopper bike and thought bingo ill make a crappy movie about that br br i've seen worse before but this is just plain bad everything about it is bad the lack of suspense the lack of actual horror or character development the lack of a decent storyline the only thing good about this film was when it finished this film doesn't fall into the category so bad its good for me either br br overall 2 10 the director writer editor should know better
<START> this is a great horror film for people who don't want all that vomit retching gore and sensationalism this movie has equal amounts of horror suspense humor and even a little light nudity but nothing big linnea quigley isn't over the top as she was in return of the living dead where she danced naked on a crypt but she is still essentially the same slutty character cathy is a virginal and chaste character before going on to dallas and we are also introduced to amelia soon mimi kinkade the sexy and sinister would be dark matron of the house as she and linnea are possessed and take over the house they reanimate the bodies of their dead friends to scare the limits out of the survivors i've heard a lot of people compare this movie to the evil dead but if anything this movie is a rival to that one the same way freddie rivaled jason this movie series though is far superior to that one
<START> american made final entry in the blood island series of filipino horror films concerns abdul amir reed hadley ruler of a fictional country he dies of cancer yet it's figured out how to bring him back put his brain into a donor body the mad doctor in charge kent taylor puts it in a highly unlikely body the facially scarred giant manservant named gor john bloom a doctor friend of the ruler tries to remedy matters and put an end to the mad plans br br film making partners samuel m sherman producer and al adamson director corral several actors they've worked with before including taylor sexy wife regina carrol angelo rossitto and vicki they tried to go for the feel of the previous blood island entries but one can tell this was made stateside while not necessarily a good film it's got a bunch of amusing elements to add up to an entertainingly trashy whole a malevolent dwarf rossitto gory operations a rather unconvincing makeup job on bloom the political intrigue subplot caverns full of cobwebs etc the narrative is actually pretty coherent with plot twists thrown in here and there i think it could have been trimmed a bit some scenes drag but it's got its fun moments and an ending people might not expect br br for this kind of thing the acting isn't too bad both taylor and rossitto are fun the latter seems to be having quite a good time in his role is appealing enough and williams is o k in the heroic role in any event it's nice to see all of these familiar faces in one of these films br br absolutely nothing special but as a trashy b horror i use the word loosely none of this is exactly scary film it certainly amuses br br 7 10
