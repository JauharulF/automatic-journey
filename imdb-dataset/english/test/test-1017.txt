<START> anyone who will pay to see troma movies knows and appreciates what they are going to get having said that i didn't think it was possible to make a movie this bad and still be compelling i found myself watching just to see how much worse it could get before the end first off it's an indonesian action movie with an american main character who looks and acts like the bastard son of taxi 's christopher lloyd and rambo he puts posters of himself dressed up like sly's cobra all over the place and even has a custom built firing range with action posed cutouts of his greatest enemies in jakarta although he's in the cia and has just arrived days earlier there is a lot of action involving gun play no muzzle flashes on those m 16s only sound effects motorcycles that bust through walls karate where no one makes physical contact and even some sex where all the actors are ugly the main plot of an epic like this should at least be reasonably plausible but not here it involves the world's most dangerous drug cartel going all out to find a drug detector device why would they need it that is never revealed why not kill drug sniffing dogs makes no sense but it is taken seriously the actors are to be commended because they really seemed to think this movie would make them all famous and tried hard to act best line now dance to your grave you dirty whore best scene rambo jumps onto flying helicopter pulls machine gun out of hand let's go falls shoots helicopter as he's falling helicopter blows up cut to mannequin thrown in water f king genius if you can't appreciate trash don't watch it if you can it's awesome one last thing did i mention it was directed by the three punjabi brothers
<START> this is movie is garbage it looked really funny on the previews but i didn't laugh once through the whole movie do yourself a big favor and don't waste your money on this don't waste anyone's money on this i gave it a 1 10 believe me i would have given it less if i could have i'm a 15 year old guy and i thought it was trash if you wanna see a good movie go out and see jay and silent bob strike back
<START> this stupid anti environment wannabe jaws is sad pathetic boring poorly dubbed and stupid there is nothing redeeming about it br br plot follows some shark octopus creature thingy that appears off the coast of florida and kills some people including a boring stupid couple with a whiny wife and a silent husband who stabs himself with a fork for some reason his ascent to the surface is always represented by a vague of something bumpy over and over it makes no sense it's horribly boring and it's conspiracy plot sucks br br there are moments of camp that cannot be ignored the same shot of the boat of the couple of the opening sequence three times the doctor slamming a dying patient's chest twenty times with a without stopping even though he's clearly dead the porno esque soundtrack the shot of the couple making love on the beach with three different that us is getting ahead of us doing this the ancient computer that sounds like kermit the frog a beer guzzling scientist screaming i know a la dr smith the list goes on and on br br oh and everyone drinks at least thirty bears in the course of the movie much noticed by mike and the br br the mst3k version is their best episode but it's certainly better than the movie itself this is how i like to go fishing guys with a flashlight and a flamethrower crow br br one star for devil fish seven for the mst3k version br br
<START> kairo or pulse as it's known amongst english speaking audiences is set in tokyo starts as sunny plant sales employee decides to visit her friend taguchi kenji to about a computer disk he's been working on when she gets to his place he gives her the disk but then rather inconsiderately commits suicide in front of her meanwhile a student named ryosuke haruhiko kato has recently hooked up to the internet keeps getting spooky messages images on his monitor so he ask's computer whizz koyuki whats happening she doesn't really know but it seems that the place where people's spirits go when they die is full they need somewhere else to go earth is as good a place as any right these spirits don't like sharing either so they sort of make people commit suicide or turn them into ashes or something like that i don't really know because the films a bit of a mess br br this japanese production was written directed by kiyoshi kurosawa right off the bat i have to say i hated kairo i hated everything about it it proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that asian cinema can produce something as crap as any american filmmaker the script is an overlong mess the thing simply doesn't make any sense with scenes which seem like they are from a different film sequences which make no logical sense or are not explained in any way kairo is also the most downright boring film i've sat through this year at two hours long this is a real chore to sit through i really wanted to fast forward it but i'm fair if nothing else so i stuck it out to the bitter end frankly wished i hadn't there are so many things wrong with kairo i suppose the filmmakers were going for a surreal ambiguous deliberately incoherent feel but those are traits which i despise in a film unless they are done properly then there's the whole internet thing which i just couldn't relate to at all i use the internet all day it's not in the least bit scary to me in any way then there's the fact that kairo as a film provided zero entertainment value for me maybe i'm a neanderthal but i kind of like the films i watch to entertain me make some sort of sense not bore me to death br br director kurosawa has made the ultimate insomnia cure as far as i'm concerned if you have trouble getting to sleep stick this in the dvd you be fast asleep within 10 minutes i guarantee you i didn't think kairo was scary in the slightest the whole internet thing was laughable as for scary you should see some of the penis enlargement pop up ads i get now that's scary i hate this film i hate this film i'm sorry i just need to make that basic point again twice forget about any action tension or gore as there isn't any if you have a very nervous disposition then there are maybe a couple of scenes which might creep you out otherwise this is kiddie friendly pg rated stuff all the way urgh br br the film looks so dull boring it's untrue the camera just sits there for very long shots when it does move it moves very slowly this has all the style of a mexican soap opera since kairo is sub titled it's difficult to judge the original performances so i won't bother it's hard to care for someone when they don't even speak the same language you don't know what they are saying br br kairo is crap i hated it it's as simple straight forward as that just because it's an asian flick doesn't automatically make it any good the mess of a story the plot holes the fact it makes no sense it's an absolute bore means kairo would rightly be torn to shreds by people if it were an american production the worst film i've seen this year by some distance kairo got a hollywood remake as pulse 2006
<START> when i was a child my grandmother took me to see this movie and i fell in love with it i admired dorothy dandridge so very much and wanted to be like her i fell in love with sidney poitier pearl bailey made me laugh and sammy davis jr was so great as life the music was just breath taken when i had my first son and the movie came on tv i let him see it and to this day he has never forgotten this movie he loved it i will always remember and bess it has a special place in my heart then and now i really wish that they would restore this movie because it was one of the greatest movies there has ever been with an all star black cast
<START> new york family is the last in their neighborhood to get a television set which nearly ruins david niven's marriage to mitzi gaynor bedroom comedy that rarely ventures into the bedroom and nothing sexy happens there anyway gaynor as an actress has about as much range as an oven she turns on she turns off film's sole compensation is a supporting performance by perky patty duke pre miracle worker as niven's daughter she's delightful happy anniversary is not from
<START> this movie was rented for free i had no misconception about this being a very bad movie i rented it for thanksgiving because we eat turkey and then the family watches an awful movie so you ask what makes this movie so bad you gave it only 2 stars dialog the lack of dialog makes this a movie perfect for a deaf audience in fact if you rent this just turn the volume down to zero and pop in any heavy metal cd from your favorite artist i know you will enjoy it better the plot of this holiday turkey was so encumbered with tech and geek speak you need a translator for the narrative now for all you people who enjoy good sci fi effects eh they are not much better than video game trailers or cut scenes in cases worse the actors um both of them are not much to look at either they say nothing much through out the entire movie many of the technical aspects will make you laugh like the scene where the hero straps herself to a missile and fires it at the city away it never showed how she landed the scene before that we see a robotic sentry fire at her with a cannon from 12 feet away and he misses multiple shots also we are told that the political division between the antagonist and protagonist is bio tech genetically enhanced humans vs cyber tech machine enhanced humans but both seem to be cyborgs or enhanced humans what told me this was a bad movie at the rental store was the cover that looked like a video game cover art and there was only the one copy good new releases have many copies available
<START> i was never in the past interested in this play although love shakespeare and have seen most of his plays now and enthusiastically studied some at school something about this story and all the fuss about it seemed to put me off i never bothered to try to see hamlet until fairly recently deciding i should at least try to watch it and i borrowed the olivier version from the library well i struggled with it olivier seemed far too old not only in his looks but in his acting of the part the play had been enormously cut to fit a more conventional movie length and i think must have missed out too much as i found it difficult to concentrate on it soon became bored and annoyed by it i still think olivier's henry v is the best version i've seen of that rousing play tho' admit i haven't rewatched the beeb version yet and can't recall how it was when first shown br br i heard of the branagh full length version of hamlet although i enjoyed his much ado i think the beeb version is far better and i wasn't entirely impressed by his henry v but i was off branagh a bit after seeing his disappointing effort at a musical of love's labour's lost which is a play i like and was so well made by the beeb br br finally acquiring the complete beeb shakespeare on dvd recently i soon rewatched one of my most favourite shakespeare plays richard ii and was simply enthralled by jacobi in the part so was immediately persuaded to watch his hamlet next what a revelation this play now is for me yes it is splendid but i feel it needs an actor you can with to play hamlet and this for me is jacobi amazing intriguing to note that although he is older than i understand the character hamlet was it doesn't show whilst in olivier it did now i note he's also in the branagh version and had much to do with training branagh so i shall have to watch that to see what does with claudius i'm interested to discover jacobi has trained branagh as yes you can certainly see the influence br br and now i'm going to watch it all over again
<START> this movie could have been a lot better than it was if hadn't been a disney film i thought that the young girl playing shirley was all right you could tell that she was really trying to do the job right the teenage shirley temple wasn't right at all i think that they should have spent last time on her childhood the first hour should have been about the young shirley then the last hour should have been about the older shirley this was a boring movie and not a good shirley temple story
<START> ever since midnight cowboy' i have been on the lookout for films with dustin hoffman and have mostly not been disappointed ever since kramer vs i have been on the lookout for films with meryl streep and have mostly not been disappointed she gave a superb performance really one of her best in sophie's decision' and i lapped her up in out of africa' that these two actors came together over 20 years ago for kramer vs was definitely a very good idea the result is an excellent character drama with a theme which is still very relevant in today's society br br on divorcing everyone has a pretty bad time though the kids seem to suffer beautifully handled by robert benton in some original directing presenting some memorable scenes even the passageway takes on character and should be included in the cast and as for the breakfast scene with billy justin henry just simply magnificent just how do you get an eight year old to act benton managed it and of course with hoffman there seemed to be good electricity the result is certainly engaging endearing and convincing justin henry's performance must rank among the best 5 or 6 kids' performances of all time the best thing once again was the naturalness there was no going over the top so frequent these days br br this film came up again on the small screen the other night though i have had it in my video collection for years it is still worth watching and paying attention to everything around out of 10
<START> unspeakable starts in los angeles with jim roger cline his wife alice noll arguing as they drive along in the pouring rain unfortunately jim crashes the car his daughter heather leigh silver ends up dead while alice is turned into a wheelchair bound vegetable devastated by the death of his daughter jim starts visiting prostitutes he then kills them because of voices in his head erm that's it really br br written produced directed by chad i hate unspeakable as a film there are some films you occasionally see that move the as it were in regard to everything you watch thereafter some films are so brilliant that all other's will be judged by it while other's like unspeakable for example are so bad that it sets a new cinematic low this is truly one of the worst films i've ever seen i am seriously surprised by the largely positive comments on the imdb although i'm not surprised the the low overall rating on the main page i not sure if i missed something but for a start unspeakable has no plot it has no story a lot of it seems almost random there was nothing in unspeakable to maintain my interest or entertain as a result became a test of endurance to get through to the end the film tries to be shocking with some limp scenes of sexual abuse of a rent boy by a priest there is a scene in which a disabled person craps herself it splats on the floor her dodgy male nurse starts feeling her soiled genitals legs underwear if anyone can find such crap entertaining then i'll just cut my wrists now the character's are some of the worst i've had the misfortune to know the dialogue is hilariously bad with some it sounding like it came straight from some dirty faggot porno of the worst kind it doesn't work as a horror as it's not scary in the slightest it's absolutely hilarious frankly insulting to claim that it is trying to be a serious drama about someone suffering a great loss attempting to cope with it overall i just think it's a pointless rubbishy badly made piece of crap from troma br br director films like some badly made documentary the special effects are terrible are of the 'let's pour tomato ketchup on our actor's face the audience will be convinced that they died a gory death' variety there is no graphic violence at all apart from a suicide where someone sticks a knife in their own mouth considering the amount of prostitutes in unspeakable the nudity levels are kept to an absolute minimum br br apparently unspeakable had a budget of about 20 000 all i can say is where did all the money go oh a quick note to the filmmakers if your going to record sound live make sure you don't have your actor's deliver their lines next to a main road that half of los angeles seem to be driving up the acting sucks period br br unspeakable is in my opinion total crap it's probably not the worst i've ever seen but it's right down there i can't remember seeing such a awful film recently one to avoid unless your a masochist or insomniac
<START> it's rare for a movie to both encompass the process of problem solving and a fantastically far reaching moral quandary and be a fairly accurate historical movie but fat man and little boy pulls off this trick br br it's the story of the manhattan project the world war ii effort to build the atom bomb told as the conflict between the two men who made it happen gen leslie and robert oppenheimer br br the historical figures are a great study in opposites military vs civilian practical vs idealistic emotional vs scientific brute force vs consensus based problem solving immediacy vs long term vision a fictional character played by john cusack is added as a sort of synthesis of the two historical figures to show the humanity that oddly escapes the real people and of course the obligatory love interest played by laura dern one looking for a straight documentary might criticize the lapses into melodrama and occasional with the facts but that's hollywood for ya but the purpose of fiction is to synthesize and galvanize events into more universal truths so i think this can be forgiven br br one of the great visuals in the movie is when oppenheimer witnesses the first atomic explosion it's done entirely through his reaction and considering the awesome visuals inherent in an atomic explosion it's a brave and entirely effective way of describing in a single moment the ambivalent effect on humans of unleashing such power the sort of thing lost in the typical hollywood shoot 'em up version of history the use of music is particularly excellent in the last third of the movie br br fairly accessible and highly recommended as both a historical movie and drama of the highest order
<START> br br philistines beware especially american ones this has all the elements you'll hate a approach to film language a painterly sense of composition an intense homoerotic focus to its elegant narrative a wonderful and unusual use of music and even worse it's based on a story you'd probably hate as well if however you do feel that films don't to have derivative plotlines be full of action and crappy dialogue don't need the visual grammar of mtv tv commercials then watch this it's one of my favourite films and is perhaps visconti's most perfectly formed piece of work it's sublime like the movement of he uses insistently throughout the film
<START> the appeal of this film has to be the artsy euro style because there's absolutely no substance a bunch of stuff happens that seems to be going somewhere but it never gets there br br it's difficult to come up with a full 10 lines of commentary because this film is such a totally empty experience there's lots of nice photography of a cemetery some really lame zombie effects some flashes of what might pass for surrealist humor and a feeble existentialist ending these elements undermine each other just when you might be enjoying the creepy mood there's some silliness with bouncing heads or zombie sex to keep from screaming with boredom you clutch at the minimal story line and it disintegrates into ridiculous illogic it's like someone took several half baked b movies and tossed them in a blender br br what comes out is mostly a film about meaninglessness and not a good one clearly it will impress that category of art house fan who sees emptiness as indistinguishable from depth everyone else should stay well clear of this dreary mess
<START> well well at last a view of this underrated flick but you can't find a good copy of it terrible copy full with green drops the editing isn't the sound do has sometimes that terrible hiss and sometimes you even can hear the camera recording overall it's too dark a waist of time you should say but it isn't it's a bit slow the first half part of the movie it's all talking and making love to each other it is even still weird that the girls in movies from the 60's never wear any when they enter the sleeping room it's full glory anyway banned in the uk since 84 and still on the video nasties list the reason is simple it's gory for their time being it really has some nasty and it's creepy in some way due the fact that it is filmed handycam way so every shot the image is moving things they do these days with the steadycam the ghastly ones could have been better if the quality of the film was better but still better then other films of the time like schoolgirls in chains
