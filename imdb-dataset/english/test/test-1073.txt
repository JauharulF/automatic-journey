<START> i have been a huge lynn peterson fan ever since her breakthrough role in the 1988 blockbuster movie far north and even though i loved her in her one other film slow 2004 where she plays francis this is by far and away her strongest role br br lynn as i'm sure you all know or should plays the critical role of driver br br unfortunately other than lynn's amazing performance i'm afraid this movie doesn't really have much going for it br br oh wait there was one other thing the amazing creativity of the editing to remove profanity for tv viewers memorable lines like you son of a gun you son of a witch shoot and well forget you br br o k bye br br p s does anyone know where i can get another lynn peterson poster
<START> i thought this movie was pretty good ok so maybe it had a few scenes that could make people think of other horror movies but i have seen a lot more pathetic movies that got much higher ratings than this many movies nowadays are remade to a more modern version and there's nothing wrong with that it keeps the story alive i don't think this movie was pathetic at all and i'm not just saying that because i'm a major chad michael murray fan but because i enjoyed it i was on the edge of my seat for most of the movie and my friends and i really enjoyed it and we were talking about it the whole way home i would tell my other friends to watch this movie i'm not saying it's the best movie that's ever hit the box office but it's a lot better than some people are describing it to be everyone has their own opinions so if you really want to know whether it's good or bad watch it and then decide
<START> if you've ever seen open water this is the same kind of gritty edgy indie style of film i liked the action suspense the slow building of it all i just hope they don't do to this one what they did to open water with that sequel but anyways the one thing i didn't like was the annoying younger sister i was rooting for the croc the whole time film starts out pretty much like it should kids packing up for a trip they hire a guide who mysteriously left 5 mins before they got there so i guess his assistant takes the two sisters and the boyfriend out on the water now mind you this is the second day of their adventure curiously enough the first day they spent at guess hmm a crocodile farm so they are out there and all is good for a little while then bang crocodile time very intense you know something in this movie you don't see the crocodile a whole heck of a lot but when you do gosh it is very scary i love the croc's snout and eyes and the shroud of fog that seems to the croc every time he raises his head above the water very very creepy but good overall this is a great film if you can get past the annoying little sister
<START> this movie made me laugh so much it was a bloody joke to tell you the truth so unbelievable and the worst plot ever the acting as well was bad i don't how come so many popular bollywood actors and actresses took on to do this movie the script must have been somewhat of a joke the visual effects in this movie was painful to watch i believe that a kindergarten kid could have done a better job of the visual effect and a monkey could have done a better job of coming up with a plot br br the plot has numerous attempts at copying major hollywood movies like the terminator but it fails miserably i laughed my head off seeing this movie a total disaster in indian cinema history
<START> punishment park is a pseudo documentary made by peter the premise is that the nation's hippies musicians protesters pacifists etc are being rounded up and tried by a tribunal and then given the choice of prison or running the course of punishment park it's a 52 mile grueling trek through the desert to an american flag with police national guard and various other authority figures in pursuit the idea is that if you make it to the flag you're set free the tribunal consists of a bunch of conservative types all condemning any behavior that is not like their own and there is no result except a prison sentence or the option of punishment park for any of those on trial there are a lot of things in this that still ring true today which is quite disturbing in itself the people running the course are promised water at the half way point which isn't true and the pursuing officials are mostly a sadistic bunch that are just out for a bit of target practice this is not a very graphic film but it's more shocking in its ideas and themes than anything else the scary thing is it could happen not a very upbeat film but definitely worth seeing warning it might make you angry 9 out of 10
<START> the original grudge the original american remake surprisingly pulled off just about everything you could do right with a ghost flick it had suspense dark and moody atmosphere some good jolts and some genuinely creepy images the grudge 2 attempts all of these techniques but ultimately fails only showing us the same old stuff we saw in the first movie as well as a messy storyline constantly switching from tokyo to california it begins in tokyo with some schoolgirls who wander into the house now heavily blocked by one strip of police tape one of them comes face to face with a similar wide eyed ghost girl while trapped in a closet she gets out screaming frantically and they all run out of there next we cut to america where karen's sister is sent by their mother to japan to find and bring her back home we eventually find ourselves following a very familiar concept involving a curious guy and girl investigating the history of a mysterious house we cut back and forth to the girls from the beginning who are disappearing one by one as well as a young boy hearing strange noises in the next apartment at night all leading up to a very unsatisfying ending the scare scenes are dull and ineffective like the ring 2 avoid this god awful sequel
<START> another fantastic offering from the monkey island team and though it was a long time coming and had to survive the departure of ron gilbert it's another worthy installment my only gripe is that it was a little short seeming in comparison to the previous two though that might be because of a glorious lack of disk swapping roll on
<START> this video is a fantastic testament and insight into the work of bill hicks thought provoking barely begins to describe it it's funny and moving and educational and a whole host of other things that are good for you make sure you see it
<START> having read all of the comments on this film i am still amazed at fox's reluctance to release a full screen restored version in dvd yes the history may be a bit inaccurate and it is certainly not as powerful as the book but it was the 2nd film by fox made in real cinemascope and the production values alone merit a restoration and distribution i saw this film in second grade and it triggered my lifelong interest in all things egyptian culminating in my visiting egypt 4 years ago amazing the power of film on a child's imagination eh in high school i read the book and made a promise to myself to one day take that dream trip now true this film was made in the old school style meaning that egyptians were portrayed by pink skinned and blue eyed brits however has anyone seen the current hbo series rome everything old is olde again one can't imagine why in this day and age we are still casting actors mincing around as mayfair aristocrats in roman drag not one actor on rome could pass for an ancient italian that being said the period in egypt is still one of the most fascinating events in human history this film is immensely appealing to borrow a word from for its historical information beer brain surgery iron and its gorgeous cinematography and score i have a dreadful taiwan dvd version which i watch over and over again praying that one day a true restored widescreen version will be available for anyone else interested in this subject i highly recommend the historical novel a god against the gods by the author of advise and consent if anyone of you film buffs out there knows how to contact fox to urge them on please let me know
<START> i haven't seen many movies worse than this one the story line the dialogues the acting it's horror the story just jumps from a to b to c without any logical steps in between every time you think you've missed something but no that was the way it was intended to be and why on earth is the character that jenny garth portrays so in love with that no no loser guy who actually now plays in the movie cinderella man with russel crow o well it's no spielberg of course i have to write ten lines to get posted this movie really isn't inspiring enough to write 10 lines it's a romantic feel good movie with a lousy story so if you're up for that you'll have a ball
<START> what can i say about tromeo and juliet other than if you like twisted troma machinations then you must see this movie this is my absolute favorite troma flick and i have seen almost all of them penis monsters births to live rats and popcorn lesbianism steamy sex scenes in plexiglass boxes incest nipple piercing dismemberment shameless troma plugs and computer masturbation how can one go wrong it amazingly follows the original story very closely you must see this movie oh and speaking of shameless plugs check out jane comic book whore cd on records it is awesome
<START> the film is a remake of a 1956 bbc serial friend charles' as such gallops thru the material in a relatively short time i found it fast moving enjoyable unpretentious did anyone else notice the scenes towards the end where john mills was being gassed the producers obviously decided to omit the scenes maybe censorship but notice when he's sat by the window of the flat deep breathing closely followed by similar scenes with the car window open the francis serials all seemed to inhabit the same universe that of unexplained happenings people being not what they seem the villain being someone close to the hero victim a predictable universe in some ways but one with its own rules regulations
<START> most of you out there really disliked this movie you were right a small minority of you really loved the movie can't say you' re wrong for me this movie was too stupid i have seen many dumb silly comedies but this one surpasses every one of them as i was watching i couldn't stop rubbing my eyes not believing what i was seeing and trying to decide if i should laugh or cry as really stupid stuff were going on on the screen and people were leaving the theater br br according to the leading characters time travel is accomplished just enter any museum and you will actually travel to the past plus if you are seeking an after death experience just go to the nearest there you shall meet lord sorry and be given important commands all te above t really make sense right well go ahead watch the movie i almost never regret the movies i watch you probably won't like it but you will be intrigued by the writer's ability in producing the ultimately stupid script br br i' m giving it a 3 out of 10 not good far from being the worse
<START> can this really be a troma movie some scenes almost have an a movie look the acting is generally competent the two leads and the nurse surrogate were especially good and i liked some of the confrontations between the young capulets and ques the scenes were smoothly edited the plot is coherent it's funny it has a hip original sound track br br it does have the usual troma gross outs and low humor but i don't think shakespeare would have minded so much in fact i think he might have gotten a few good laughs out of this br br it's a good dvd there is an alternate sound track with a very informative commentary by the director several deleted scenes and the usual collection of troma self deprecating silliness br br i'm not going to tell you this was citizen kane but it is some pretty inspired low budget filmmaking
<START> i have nothing but praise for this mini series it's only about a year and a half old but i have seen it twice already with greater enjoyment the second time than the first i'm seriously thinking of watching it again soon since i find it spiritually uplifting br br it is a very tender romantic drama with such beautiful performances sets costumes music and scenes that it has a resonance which places it almost in a league of its own among mini series br br some others have commented on the difficulties of living as a lesbian in britain in the 1890s nothing especially difficult about that it was only male homosexuality that was against the law as poor oscar wilde experienced to his great cost and as a great loss to the literary world anyway i digress br br in my view this is essential television it is perhaps one of the greatest tragic romantic dramas since romeo and juliet although not in the conventional sense br br 10 out of 10 from me br br jmv
