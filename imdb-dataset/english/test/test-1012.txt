<START> you get this stupid excuse of a child's play rip off man what were they thinking first they mess with a rumpelstiltskin horror movie then they make crap like this tale haters well to be honest i've seen this as a kid and it scared me a bit a lot simply because i was under aged with the assumption that pinocchio wouldn't do that wah wah wah but i've grown and come to think of this as child's play rip a fairy tale bashing nonsense and a lame tales from the crypt episode or trying to be one at least with a lame ending that was stupid and it had many plot holes and i still can't understand how it came to life was it the work of an evil then what after a few evil deeds he becomes a real boy who becomes america's most wanted personally i think the concept of an evil sounds better he builds an army of wooden killers and starts a crime wave funny but this is awful awful awful awful awful awful stinky like a shoe and awful it sucked it sucked if you want killer puppets settle for the killer doll specifically child's play instead no strings attached or if you want a fairy tale figure turned upside down watch leprechaun or if you want pinocchio watch the animated version or live version with jonathan taylor thomas and martin landau instead 10 10 negative 10
<START> ok if you are a fan of mystery science theater 3000 and love to mock movies then you will have a lot of fun with this otherwise it may really be too painful to see br br plot obsessed sneaks a huge crate containing a onto a cruise ship apparently not having to declare it at customs or even mention that he's bringing aboard a live animal no really it's research equipment the air holes are just an accident some he hired to it open the crate figuring he paid bunches of money maybe there's something to steal once the wood crate is open the breaks through the steel bars inside and goes on a killing rampage br br yeah whatever br br by a stroke of sheer coincidence a marshall i assume a u s marshall since he was in the gulf war not just some guy named marshall is on board investigating some money that went missing from the ship's safe he's posing as an insurance salesman lady i'm the best insurance you've got other scintillating characters include the captain john rhys davies and sadly his dignity is the first victim of the film his tae bo instructor daughter snicker tae bo an annoying old stuck up lady with a tiny dog which should be fed to a cat guess what eats it and an incredibly unpleasant gigolo who might have been believable in a movie made in 1964 not in anything more recent much of the acting was really bad and the characters were just there so that you can laugh hysterically when they died br br overall screamingly bad bad on many levels bad bad bad what bullets don't even make flinch but the tae bo bimbo can punch him and scare him away hey sci fi channel you desperate for scripts or what
<START> soul plane is a horrible attempt at comedy that only should appeal people with thick skulls bloodshot eyes and furry pawns br br the plot is not only incoherent but also non existent acting is mostly sub sub par with a gang of highly moronic and dreadful characters thrown in for bad measure jokes are often spotted miles ahead and almost never even a bit amusing this movie lacks any structure and is full of racial stereotypes that must have seemed old even in the fifties the only thing it really has going for it is some pretty ladies but really if you want that you can rent something from the adult section ok br br i can hardly see anything here to recommend since you'll probably have a lot a better and productive time chasing rats with a sledgehammer or inventing or whatever br br 2 10
<START> i saw last night and i'm of two minds on the film br br on one hand i appreciate it for being the total of a michael bay film no dialogue extremely stylized grainy b w photography some of the most genuinely horrific imagery ever set to film and a very compelling use of sound which nobody else seems to have really picked up on yet it's a reflection on a theme and it dares go where most filmmakers do not not only in terms of images but of production and concept it's a movie that most people don't understand and if you read through these comments you'll find a lot of people whose lack of ability to figure this film out results in them shrieking about with the fervor of a rattling the bars of its cage at feeding time it genuinely shocked and disturbed me and the last time a film managed to do that was a while ago br br on the other this is a thirty minute short that sprawls out to over an hour and a half i understand that there might be artistic merit in using repetition and monolithic pacing as a bludgeon but in this case it just doesn't help everything hang together imagine being approached by a ragged man on the street who you by the shoulders and says something that completely confounds the core of your being but then instead of leaving your shattered and gibbering in his wake he just keeps talking and talking and talking by the end of the movie i found myself glancing at my watch now and again br br this is not entertainment people this is this is how you people who just watched glitter if you watch movies to be entertained this will frustrate confound and possibly anger you you don't approach like a chocolate cake you want to eat because it tastes good you approach it like something on the menu you have never heard of before something you see furtive glances of through the kitchen door something that's dark and and twitches on its platter something you order not because it will taste good but because you just have to know what it's like
<START> ed wood rides again the fact that this movie was made should give any young br br aspiring film maker hope any screenplay you might have thought of using to br br line a or a birdcage should now not seem that bad do not watch this movie unless you have a healthy stash of tylenol or rolaids watching this br br movie made me realize that boa vs python was not that bad after all it probably would have been better to do this movie in claymation as at least that way no actor would have had to take credit for being in this film it is understandable why this director has so many aliases there is a bright side to watching this movie in that if you can get someone to bring you a bag of chips then you can eat your way out of the cocoon of cheese that surrounds you enabling you to br br make your toward your tv set's cocoon of cheese that surrounds it
<START> i was more entertained by watching my wife almost pull her hair out in frustration through most of this movie i thought something that would tie it all together would be just around the corner of the dairy barn any minute so i cheated grabbed the remote and was relieved to find out it was ending in merely 20 minutes i should have turned the channel cute it had potential but yuck
<START> it's just when a band tours and only has one original member it's not the same as the classic line up all new actors playing the main roles of rag scotty etc with ashby as virtually the only returning face from the first movie and he was of only minor note of the first flick serving as the only redeemable group of the three guys that scotty was trying to assist in meeting females the film is poorly written featuring the dumbest dialog this side of armageddon even for a t a movie this one is a turkey not even die hard low budget 80's films fans would want to sit through this movie which has no plot and plenty of bad acting this film would have been better off never being released just plain bad
<START> if you're a film student or were one or are thinking of becoming one the name battleship potemkin has or will have a resonance sergei like other silent film pioneers like griffith although eisenstein's innovations are not as commonplace as griffith's and murnau has had such an impact on the history of cinema it's of course taken for granted the reason i bring up the film student part is because at some point whether you'd like it or not your film professor 9 times out of 10 will show the odessa stairs sequence of this film it's hard to say if it's even the 'best' part of the film's several sequences dealing with the at the time current times of the russian revolution but it does leave the most impact and it can be seen in many films showcasing suspense or just plain montage the climax comes to mind br br montage which was not just knack but also his life's blood early in his career is often misused in the present cinema or if not misused then in an improper context for the story sometimes montage is used now as just another device to get from point a to point b montage was something else for eisenstein he was trying to communicate in the most direct way that he could the urgency the passion s and the ultimate tragedies that were in the russian people at the time and place even if one doesn't see all of eisenstein's narrative or traditional 'story' ideas to have much grounding kubrick has said this one can't deny the power of seeing the ships arriving at the harbor the people on the stairs and the soldiers coming at them every which way with guns some may find it hard to believe this was done in the 20's it has that power like the passion of joan of arc to over pass its time and remain in importance if only in terms of technique and emotion br br of course one could go on for books which have been written hundreds of times over not the least of which by eisenstein himself on the film in and of itself battleship potemkin is really more like a dramatized newsreel than a specific story in a movie the first segment is also one of the great sequences in film as a mutiny is plotted against the captain and other head ups of a certain ship this is detailed almost in a manipulative way but somehow extremely effective montage is used here as well but in spurts of energy that capture the eye other times eisenstein is more content to just let the images speak for themselves as the soldiers grow weary without food and water he isn't one of those directors who will try to get all sides to the story he is of course very much early 20th century russian but he is nothing else but honest with how he sees his themes and style and that is what wins over in the end br br some may want to check it outside of film school as the sequence is like one of those landmarks of severe tragedy on film displaying the ugly side of revolution eisenstein may not be one of the more silent film directors but if montage detail in the frame non actors and bolshevik themes are your cup of tea it's truly one of the must sees of a lifetime
<START> i saw this film at the boston festival of women's cinema last night and was saddened to hear ms tell us in her q a after the screening that she doesn't expect to see too much us distribution due to her insistence on including all of the so called gay content it was a fantastically entertaining comedy and it just seems to me that american audiences might enjoy it in much the same way they enjoyed the full monty so it's really unfortunate and kind of ridiculous that a few shots of two boys kissing is keeping it away from mainstream theaters wonderful cast fabulous script and of course rose direction make this one of the funniest films i've seen
<START> is a great show i first saw it when i was 10 years old at the time and after school i rushed home and turned on comedy central i saw a cartoon called and i loved it it's such a funny and cool show it's created by klasky csupo who are great creators of cartoons they animated some of my favorite shows ever like the simpsons and rugrats br br i've seen lots of episodes of this show and i think they're all really funny and sweet the voice actors did a great job voicing the characters too br br i wish that comedy central could bring this show back along with the critic and dilbert br br but this is a great comedy central show great job klasky csupo
<START> young elijah wood and joseph are outstanding in this excellent film about two boys who have promised to take care of their mother and how they cope when their new stepfather begins beating the younger boy the supporting cast around the boys is top notch as well the script really gets inside the mind and heart of an imaginative child it's hard to believe wood could grow up to look anything like tom hanks but that's nothing new in hollywood that's honestly my only criticism of the film
<START> this is a review of the later english release by disney featuring alison lohman patrick stewart and co br br i really wanted this film to be good really really i'm a huge fan of princess mononoke and spirited away and after seeing all the glowing reviews on this earlier miyazaki film i was eager to see it but i was shocked shocked i say at the quality of this film those later films boast well crafted plots 3 dimensional characters and the best film music since well ever this film just doesn't come close br br might as well start w the positive aspects though like all miyazaki films this one is still very imaginative with a bizarre fantasy sci fi setting in a post apocalyptic world where insects are the dominant species nausicaa can also boast some far superior animation to other films from its time though not as beautiful and fluid as miyazaki's later films and the english voice acting is quite well done br br but this film just isn't good the characters are all cardboard from saccharine sweet little nausicaa to the ruthlessly evil tolmekians to everyone in between once you've seen each of them for 30 seconds you've seen all there is and the fact that the plot just ambles along doesn't help br br then there's the music now hisaichi is hands down my favorite film composer but nausicaa doesn't do him justice half the music is 80's keyboards on overdrive and it usually enters and leaves so abruptly that it distracts the visuals rather than helping them i highly suspect that hisaichi was told to compose a lot of the music before he even saw the picture br br but wait there's a great message with this film right let's all save the environment too bad that this film hits you over the head with it like a sledgehammer there is a scene in which nausicaa hugs a tree no really i ain't kidding br br it makes me a little sad to talk about how lame this film is but for some reason all the other reviews on imdb seem to adore it and when the characters have to talk to themselves in extended sentences to tell you what's going on that's lame br br if you're the kind of person who worships anime enjoys 80's music and plants a tree every arbor day you will probably like this film otherwise save your money for his later films because they rock big time
<START> the major flaw in this spanish slasher shocker is within it's script for the first half hour it's an okay effort building some suspense and an atmosphere of fear and dread we even get some nice killings too then it goes completely downhill and turns into a whole catalog of your basic slasher clichÃ©s i must admit that i was quite disappointed because the trailer promised so much more the final thirty minutes consists of some killings and a lot of running around in an abandoned convent it should have been so much better although the final scenes in the flooded room is quite okay br br first of all we have the dialog it's awful most of the time there was quite a few giggles in the audience here and there when i saw it and merely adequate elsewhere it is also barely audible during a lot of scenes drowning under the pressure of sound effects and the soundtrack however that might not be such a bad thing after all considering the stupid lines we have to listen to there is one line in the whole movie that makes a reference to the i know what you did last summer movies indicating that the film makers wrote it all as one big joke but i doubt it br br and the ending well some will hate it others will dig it for me it was mostly a question of the former because the final twist comes from out of nowhere if the audience had been given some clues to the girls mental status i might have thought otherwise it also throws all logic out of the window because the murderer could never had been in place for some of the kills but as an avid horror fan i have learned to live with these inconsistencies in spanish and italian movies br br but all is not bad the movie has a big budget appearance mainly due to the excellent cinematography the scenes from past times really shines here tight editing and an atmospheric soundtrack even though most of the actors are pretty bad anita is an exception making the most of what she has to work with real screen presence br br and like i mentioned before the killings are gory enough for the fans of such stuff and they are usually accompanied by very good special effects involving images of water but the water theme tends to get tiresome in the end though br br so to end this review it's a movie that is quite fun in a so bad it's good kind of way and it's also pleasing to the eye but don't expect too much because it doesn't deliver as you probably think it will judging from trailer and plot descriptions
<START> the railway children at least this 1970 movie version written and directed by that long time british character actor lionel jeffries is an unmitigated classic it tells a childhood story with great simplicity and charm the sentimentality is muted the evocation of childhood adventures is involving and jeffries brings cleverness and style to his production br br the waterbury family is leading an idyllic life in edwardian london the father is prosperous the mother is beautiful and loving the children are well mannered and affectionate their home is warm and cozy then one night during the christmas holidays two men appear at the doorstep talk quietly to the father and then take him away in a moment the lives of mrs waterbury dinah sheridan and bobbie 14 jenny agutter phyllis 12 sally thomsett and young peter gary warren have been changed only their fortitude and good spirits are going to see them through now teetering into poverty mrs waterbury takes her children to live in a musty old brick house in the countryside near a rail line not too far from a small village with a train station the children discover the rail and regularly sit on a small hill to wave at the passengers as the train chugs by one day an old gentleman going to his business in the city looks up from his newspaper and finds himself waving back it's not long before he will play an important part in the story br br as time passes mrs waterbury brings all her love and intelligence to bear on her children she begins to write stories to earn money she teaches them their lessons and provides a home of warmth and security for them the story however is about these three children especially bobbie at 14 she is old enough to want to share her mother's worries yet young enough to enjoy the adventures she has with her sister and brother they find a poor man at the station who cannot speak english they discover he is a russian refugee who no longer knows where his wife and child are they insist he must come home with them and their mother takes him in before long the children have written a large sign to the old gentlemen on the train asking for his help they help a young man taking part in a who breaks his leg in a train tunnel soon he is at their home recuperating they decide to have a birthday party for the station master a man with few friends and several children who is a stickler for his dignity it's not long before the children help him realize the difference between friendship and charity in other words the three children encounter all sorts of problems in their childhood adventures and manage to be instrumental in seeing that all the problems have happy endings br br but what of their own problems bobbie finally learns from her mother that her father was taken away because he had been accused of treason of giving state secrets to the russians will bobbie be able to find a way to help will the old gentleman be something more than simply an old gentleman on a passing train will their father's case be reopened will there be a happy ending br br jenny agutter was almost 18 when she filmed her part she plays the 14 year old bobbie with great naturalness and charm as important as the other players are especially dinah sheridan as the mother agutter is the heart of the story for me it is jenny talent and lionel style and restraint that make this movie so memorable the story's problems come with no serious doubt but that they will be solved and jeffries does not just give us an expertly adapted and directed movie he adds touches that are barely noticed but which charm us this might include just a split second of a freeze frame as two people talk or a slow close up of a small yellow in the grass outside home then a slow pull back from a yellow oil lamp being turned up inside or the realization that a delightful interior shot or a view of the green countryside or a look at the train station from a hill all suddenly recall those charming edwardian hand tinted drawings of a perfect by gone time br br perhaps this gentle story can't compete for the time kids need nowadays to perfect their nintendo monster skills i'm almost positive it would never capture the attention of most of their parents especially those weaned on batman and leone still it's a perfectly put together movie and shouldn't be forgotten as an aside 19 years later the story was retold as a television program this time jenny agutter played the mother
<START> i first saw this movie as a younger child my sister had told me about it and i thought it would be more of a kid's movie however it remains to also be an incredible movie true that the subject behind the movie is ruff but also true this movie will never stop touching your heart br br i was only 6 when i first saw it and just yesterday 7 years later i saw it again for the first time in a long time even after i knew how it ended i knew that i had seen it a billion times i wept like a teeny weeny little baby when i saw it a few years back i finally got the idea and the seriousness of the film so i stoped watching it for a while but yesterday i didn't change the channel i watched it by the end i was astonished at how much it still made me laugh cry think and above all believe in again i haven't in a long time and this movie got me out of my shell and opened up my heart this movie wasn't just impacting i was also so impressed with the actors especially bobby so if you are wanting to see this movie for the first time i suggest seeing it alone with tissues and being ready to discover your young sweet innocent side and the side that still has hope this movie touched my soul when i was only 6 and even in this time of trying to figure out who i am this movie helped me realize both what i don't and still do want to be in life
