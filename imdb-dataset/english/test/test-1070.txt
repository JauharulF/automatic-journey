<START> if you listen to the pod god satan then you know what's going on with split i found that watching the film under the influence of lsd helped to deal with audio video from fantastic editing job the plot was only important from second to second the acid helped to interact with the sounds subliminal and general pace of this masterpiece don't bother writing about something out of your reach there just isn't enough of these great independent attempts at expression at it's most raw amateur level i dare anyone to make a movie that can equally mess with my head and change the way i look at visual arts and the world's reality not to mention the many realities that haven't yet been explored by this humans mind i love the vision of chris shaw i also appreciate the texturing film the begotten by e elias
<START> being of descent i was happily surprised when watching the movie i have heard the true history from my relatives that still live in but when watching the movie and reading the book the sketchy bits of history were filled it is all true the italians would sing the oppression and the earthquakes that rock the island so often the earthquake in 1953 killed my great grandfather and the book and movie both portray the feeling of the era with great compassion if you haven't seen the movie go and watch it and read the book it is not only a love story and yes there were plenty of italians in love with women in fact boat loads of women were taken to italy after the war it is a true depiction of history
<START> aubrey davis amber tamblyn travels to tokyo to investigate the mysterious disappearance of her sister karen sarah michelle gellar and gets caught up in the same mysterious curse that has killed so many people with a group of others she tries to solve and end the curse for good br br the grudge 2 rehashes everything from the first one and it produces only a couple of scares the first grudge was an average movie at best the premise was decent but the acting was wooden and some of the scenes were really ridiculous the grudge 2 is even more silly and less scary than the original also scary movie 4 has made it nearly impossible to take these films seriously and i had trouble keeping a straight face during the scary scenes which should encourage laughter more than fear how takashi shimizu messed up his own franchise is unexplainable yet he succeeded at creating a decent atmosphere unfortunately he kept the film at a slow pace with a bunch of dull characters and lame scare tactics clearly he did this movie for money and i'm glad it failed br br the screenplay was pretty bad mainly because it made no sense and they didn't develop the characters at all in the movie there were three different stories going on and each of them were somehow related to the grudge the connections were weak and a bunch of people were killed without a real reason they don't explain the rules of the curse very well and it ended up being a bit of blood bath because of everyone dying although the pg 13 rating kept things from getting interesting so even some of the death scenes were pretty lame the dialog was weak and none of the characters were likable or developed well enough to truly care about br br the acting was on par with everything else and it was a lot worse compared to the first one amber tamblyn was annoyingly wooden she moved on screen very slowly and all of her emotions seemed fake sarah michelle gellar was okay although she just had a cameo jennifer beals gave the best performance she had a few good scenes and was kind of effective arielle kebbel was okay a little bland the rest were either horrible or just too forgettable to mention overall the grudge 2 was a disappointing sequel it lacked a lot of things and it's not worth watching rating 4 10
<START> for producer david o selznick no one director would ever do hence on a farewell to arms 1957 we get two Â charles vidor and john huston though both men were quite accomplished in their own right neither could make head or tail of this disastrous remake of magnum opus hemmingway in general has never translated well from book to screen but under selznick's zeal to transform it into his next with the wind' the excursion is both punishing and exhaustive at this point in selznick's career he was no longer the titan who could take box office poison and transform it into gone with the wind tired frail minus his studio and with an impending sense that his second marriage to jennifer jones might have been a mistake selznick handed the creative reigns of this flick over to fox studios Â but he kept enough of himself in it to become a damn nuisance on the set br br by now one is or should be familiar with the bittersweet tragic love story of a nurse catharine barkley jennifer jones and her soldier hero lt frederick henry rock hudson their passion is supposed to serve as the force for what is essentially a war tale with romanticism thrown in for good measure but the chemistry between hudson and jones is both turgid and dull in the final reel jones' facial contortions during child birth are so bad i am surprised that neither director opted to cut them from the general release part of the problem with jones is that at thirty eight she's far too wise to play the optimistic catharine with any great conviction yet older actresses have frequently managed to make an audience forget discrepancies in age not so with jones one is painfully aware that she doesn't fit the bill in either acting chops or years invested on this planet hudson's laconic charm is hopelessly out of touch with to stoicism of an army soldier whose heart is broken but head remains strong the supporting cast is peppered with such luminaries as vittorio de sica and mercedes but these are wasted bits of nonsense that in no way reflect upon the formidable talents of either actor and best made evident elsewhere in their canons of film making br br the anamorphic picture element for a farewell to arms looks good enough though there's just a bit too much film grain present in certain scenes for this reviewer's liking overall colors are subtle and muted though balanced in accordance with the deluxe color processing employed at this time some fading is evident flesh tones don't appear very natural contrast levels are a tad weak blacks are generally solid whites are almost clean there's not much to recommend this film sonically it's essentially a wordy picture with gun shots as a backdrop there are no extras
<START> i watched the first few moments on tcm a few years ago but stopped after about 15 minutes i saw it listed on the schedule at the stanford theatre in palo alto and i vowed i would make the 40 minute drive the stanford is an old fashioned movie house that starts each movie with the curtains still shut yes they have curtains they opened as the fox logo fanfare began to play when the best of everything appeared in huge pink letters spread against the new york city skyline i knew i was right for waiting br br i lapped this movie up there were so many little moments that added to the look and feel of the movie when hope lange walks into the publishing office for the first time the titles of the magazines published there are etched on the glass the teenager and elegance joan crawford's swanky apron that she wore so she could serve her guests at her party without her outfit the way the camera tilted to indicate how crazy suzy parker was becoming it was almost sideways at one point how hope lange kept living at that dumpy flat she shared with the others even though she obviously was making a lot more money than at the beginning of the film guess it was too scandalous for a single gal to live alone br br hope lange was so beautiful so was suzy parker and how about mark goddard in a non speaking role i fell in love with him when i was a kid watching lost in space br br seeing this gem on the big screen prompted me to plan another trek down to the stanford to see the old dark house incidentally i bought a small soda and popcorn at the concession stand and i was taken aback when the worker asked me for two bucks
<START> let freedom ring was probably made with the best of intentions but it sends out a curious mixed message in the final product br br the folks at a western town where the railroad is coming through are overwhelmed by the arrival of immigrant railroad workers working on the railroad being financed by robber baron edward arnold there are a few ranchers and farmers whose land stands in the railroad's path and these folks are dealt with summarily by arnold's hired men one man who won't give in is lionel barrymore whose son is coming home from harvard a lawyer and ready to take up the cause br br only nelson eddy decides the best way to fight is to go zorro on the bad guys but other than charles butterworth no one knows he's the wasp a very interesting choice of names by the way br br what arnold's done is used the tried and true methods of the political bosses of the east getting the immigrants to vote nelson's idea is simple if the immigrants only knew the truth about what a bad guy arnold is they'll vote with the original settlers and knock out the alien urban political machine in their midst he kidnaps newspaper editor raymond walburn and takes him and the press to a mountain cave where some subversive newspapers are printed and distributed br br the railroad workers are a real mixed bunch of immigrants not the irish working west or the chinese working east as history has it it's a real united nations working on arnold's railroad the workers are kept in line by foreman victor mclaglen and nelson has the unenviable task of beating some sense into him like john wayne did in the quiet man br br of all the films that starred jeanette and nelson and they certainly have come down in history as a duo this was the worst of what they did at mgm nelson is about to be hanged along with barrymore for crimes that are undefined at best but certainly nothing worth being hung for and virginia bruce who plays the nelson's girlfriend saves the day with a rendition of my country tis of thee that the immigrants join in with in the face of a revolt by his paid for immigrant voters arnold quite rationally packs up and leaves town to build his railroad somewhere else br br i kid you not that's the ending here just what is the message vote with the settlers and lose your jobs with arnold but somehow you'll get by here br br i do wonder some times if 20 years from after the incidents of this film take place and the town as settled into a sleepy backwater of the west while some towns where the railroad has come through that are now cities that the good citizens of that town haven't rethought about what nelson eddy did if they did they're probably running him out on a rail br br nelson is of course in good voice and has a variety of concert and popular pieces to sing including a ballad to the immigrants written by sigmund where else but here the song is a heartfelt tribute from an immigrant who did make good in his adopted country too bad it didn't have a better venue br br the almost platinum blonde virginia bruce i'm sure is dubbed here and i'm sure jeanette macdonald was just as happy she wasn't accompanying nelson on this trip west
<START> i have a friend that works at blockbuster and he gets 5 free movie rentals a week so one day as we were scouring the aisles for something interesting i stumbled across 18 weapons of kung fu and judging by the box alone this movie seemed pretty wack but nonetheless we gave into temptation and rented it afterall it was free and thank god it was this is by far the worst movie i have ever seen the budget must have been a pickle and a piece of string the plot was ridiculous the only mention of the 18 weapons is that there is some book that teaches the ways of the 18 weapons that some bad guy is after and thats it there isnt even any weapon fighting in this movie that and the action sequences are just flat out bad 9 times out of 10 the other guy's punches and kicks come about a foot away from landing on the other guy's and there are many times when the the movie will skip frames a result of ridiculously poor editing the dubbing is as well laughable and it is hardly even understandable and we wont even get into the acting the ending will definitely leave you saying wtf however to be fair i must mention that the fighting techniques used by the actors were somewhat decent and the old guy is a mad chump but thats about it thankfully i didnt have to pay for this movie but i guess at least now i know exactly how bad a movie can actually be
<START> this looks decidedly like the amateur hour how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etc it's all wrong why lance henriksen accepted this will remain one of the great mysteries of cinema maybe he was in dire need for money or maybe be was under the influence of some illegal drug br br it is pointless trying to explain you what this movie's about it deals with the big foot legend but done in the worst possible manner in fact this stinker smells like a direct to video release br br avoid at all costs 0 out of 10
<START> star rating saturday night friday night friday morning sunday night monday morning br br one time heroin addict frankie machine frank sinatra gets out of prison to his bumbling jailbird partner sparrow arnold needy cripple of a wife eleanor parker and bit on the side molly kim novak he's trying to make it big as a drummer in a band but until his big break comes along he's stuck doing the only other thing he was any good at other than being a junkie dealing cards in high stakes games and try as he might even prison hasn't cured him of his addiction to the devil's drug causing him to lie to and deceive all those around him and driving him to desperate measures to feed his habit his yearning to come off it is his only motivation towards a happy ending br br when people think of frank sinatra they generally think of classic high pitched songs like under my skin new york new york and it had to be you but lest anyone forget he was actually a renowned actor too and if his performance in the acclaimed from here to eternity wasn't enough he will also be remembered for this cutting edge drama dealing with what was at the time the ultra taboo subject of drug abuse br br the film is often listed as one of the first to feature graphic heroin use probably the reason behind the 15 certificate in a time when it was a subject that was still very much pushed underground in his portrayal of the main protagonist sinatra is fine perfectly conveying the despair desperation and sincerity of a man losing every second chance that is being given to him his cold turkey scene is much more intense than ewan mcgregor's in trainspotting the first co star to make an impression is parker as demanding needy cripple of a wife using her husband's guilt and sense of duty to all the effect she can novak as his secret lover still manages some strong moments but is less of a star than parker does his usual comic relief thing as the bumbling sidekick who trails the leading man around with his waspy new york accent br br director otto preminger does allow the pace to drag a bit sometimes but this is still a powerfully absorbing film all the way with plenty of unexpected twists and turns and which should be admired for being one of the first films to bring such a grim subject so powerfully to life
<START> is a bunch of short stories with an only common point the little town of in this film the director tries to explain some of these stories by using a young reporter as a continuum the result is a strange film as it has any main character the movie spends about 20 min to each tale other than the town of any story is really well explained and the fact is that they result very boring it was by far the best film of the year in spain but well that's not saying too much the only good thing of the film is the precious scenarios it is filmed in a very precious valley and it is more enjoyable to spend the time watching the scenario rather than being aware of the story
<START> sui generis folks i'm not going to lie to you is a one or two hit wonder but what a film it almost excuses suspect zero i'm also not going to pretend to understand it completely half of what makes it what it is is trying to second guess what the hell they are doing on the screen because of the chiaroscuro br br richard says it is as if a cult had re enacted for real three bible stories creation the nativity and jesus' torture and death on that's not a bad description but there seems to be more to it than the seemingly one to one religious br br there's an environmental theme right up near the surface note that toward the end after the of the landscape there are large pipes not unlike those on a construction site oh no he's going to say look at how people are raping mother nature one rarely sees a dead metaphor in action and with this much hyperbole but to see it acted out is way than language implies br br and yeah if you just want something to sync with a death metal soundtrack it does have the requisite atrocities but as for myself and others like me it's an important art film that should merit a criterion collection release ranks right up there with murnau's faust br br ray
<START> the stage star grace hayes stars in this obscure little film after years of being on the stage she is going to visit a small college town to check up on her son who is being raised by his grandfather the kid doesn't know who his mother is and when she sees him in a local malt shop he's a boorish jerk part of the problem is that he is a college clown the other part is that he's really spoiled br br interestingly it turns out that mom is really quite wealthy and has been not only funding her son's life but is a hefty contributor to the college so she has the idea of forcing the young man to mature she talks to the man who's raising peter and has his allowance cut off completely hoping he'll rise to the occasion it also turns out that she puts the screws to the school because she thinks all these kids need to stop playing around and be more responsible br br now here's where it gets pretty dumb to show that they know the value of hard work she hires a bunch of them to sing and dance at the malt shop she just purchased talk about contrived what happens next is like a long and not particularly good talent show or perhaps a poor man's version of a judy garland mickey rooney musical i'd suggest the kids try to do something else to earn money or perhaps sing and dance until people pay them to stop i know i would pay them br br considering that the talent is far from talented peter is a bad actor and his change from lout to responsible adult is almost instantaneous the whole thing is a bit hard to take not a very good film by any sane standard this is an obscure film that should have stayed obscure br br by the way it is interesting that ms son in the film peter is actually her real life son the only problem with that is that peter lind hayes is a truly awful actor he's not handsome enough to be a leading man and he comes off as either dull and uninteresting or downright obnoxious in particular all the stupid impressions he does are really bad and he has the charisma of the gelatin that you scrape off spam despite this terrible performance he did go on to have a reasonably successful acting career who would have believed it if you'd seen him in zis boom bah because here he's about as welcome as the bubonic plague
<START> i'm not a disney fan at all but i happen to be in orlando for a friend's wedding so my traveling partner and i went to disney for a few days i haven't seen a good 3 d effect in well ever so i usually try to stay away from these presentations the 3 d effect in this was so good i'm a grown man of 38 and even i wanted to try and reach out and touch it's that good word of advice at the end look to the back of the theater on the wall put it like this the first time i saw it the effect wasn't working so i told my friend it would have been nice if my friend said that's exactly what happens it's not working for some reason it's an awesome show you will not be disappointed
<START> spoilers beautifully photographed slice of life home front wwii love story with norman rockwell paintings in the beginning and end of the movie about how a war hero is not just someone who kills for his country but is also someone who thinks for himself and isn't corrupted by the war propaganda that's constantly drummed into his head washing out of the marine corps marion jan michael vincent is kicked out of boot camp after five weeks and forced to put on a baby blue marine uniform that shows that he just didn't have it to make the corps and scorned wherever he went as he's going home to st louis and terrified what his family whom his dad was in the marine corps in wwi would think of him in that he couldn't cut the mustard as a us marine br br stopping in a bar and finds sitting next to him is a marine member of the fearless and deadly marine raiders richard gere whom a admiring hedge buys a beer making conversation with richard hedge is shocked to find out that not only is he being sent back to the pacific theater after all the battles he fought in and combat medals he got but the totally gray hair and mid thirty looking richard is going to be 21 next month that's what being in the marine corps and wwii did to him buying hedge a number of drinks richard takes the drunk baby blue outside and knocks him out taking his baby blues and leaves his impressive us marine uniform with some money in it for hedge to ware br br as soon as hedge puts on richard's uniform that fits him perfectly he's confronted by this big drunken us paratrooper who calls himself cement head wanting to have a fist fight with the marine raider hedge doing everything he can to avoid trouble is forced by cement head to belt him after he himself cracked two beer bottle over his cement head to get himself warmed up for the big bout between marine hedge and paratrooper cement head hedge incredibly floors the big cement headed buffoon knocking him out cold with one punch i guess the trick is not hitting him in on top of his head a stunned hedge tell his cement heads fellow g i's br br hitch hiking to this small town of hedge notices this us military camp for japanese americans who are there because their considered a threat to us security it's later in the movie that hedge shows everyone what a real hero he is not who the people in the town think he is by risking his life to save one of the hated japs who mindlessly together with two of his friends escaped from the camp where the hell did they think they were going anyway hedge risked his life by saving the scared to death japanese american from drowning in the dangerous rapids outside the town hedge in his actions taught the people of that not all japs even those who are american citizens are bad and treacherous banzai screaming suicidal like they were thought by the newspapers magazines and movies at the time to think that they were br br hedge strikes up a conversation with the very cute and pretty waitress at the local diner rose glynnis o'connor who's just crazy about him that even hedge at first thinks that it's his uniform not him that impressed her later when hedge admits to rose that he's not what she and her parents think a us marine raider that he is rose had by then gotten to know the sweet and caring washed out marine so well that it didn't matter to her at all what he was supposed to be a marine a paratrooper or a post office worker it was what was inside his heart that really counted br br the film has a number of touching and beautiful scenes in it between hedge and rose that shows how movies used to be made years ago without all the sex and profanity that we see and hear in movies today that involved two people in love with each other br br the way the film accurately not phony baloney shows the true feelings of average americans back then in 1943 about the war in general and japanese in particular couldn't have been done in more authentic and accurate as well as good taste baby blur marine does it's best not to be too politically correct in not showing the hero's or leading actors and actresses in the film having the same feelings and ideas back then during wwii as most people have now which would have come across as phony as a three dollar bill to those people watching the film who lived during those historic and momentous times when the film was to take place
<START> ty cobb is by far the most interesting and insane athlete to ever live his baseball career was unparalleled in absurd statistics brilliant strategy and pure unadulterated violence every game he played in was a spectacle in human ability and cruelty so of course the film about him deals with none of that instead focusing on the writing of his biography by author al stump now this isn't such a horrible idea in theory as cobb himself slid even further into paranoid dementia as years progressed and the stories of his crazed outbursts even as a senior are shocking even by today's desensitized standards but instead of focusing on these events which i guess was simply too interesting the film is a pseudo fictionalized road film with clichÃ©d a clichÃ©d plot that will cause any knowledgeable cobb fan to cry vinegar tears br br tommy lee jones does quite well as a crotchety cobb but somehow manages to overplay his cartoon most stories about cobb are barely believable but to make him even crazier seems both impossible and unnecessary robert wuhl portraying the writer al stump is a dark vortex of nonexistent talent he sucks the life out of every scene trying to make this film his own nagasaki there is a reason we never see him as a leading man anymore arliss doesn't count it's barely a show even the played out inevitable role reversal of cobb and stump by the end is made even worse by his pure inability to utter words that don't sound like a poor book on tape narration voice br br for all the awful writing and bland film making on display there is one sequence which stands out as so far superior to the rest of this failure that accepting it's from the same film is near impossible a hyper stylized flashback sequence displaying overpowering psychology and brutal athleticism while actually playing the game of baseball is pure brilliance the camera moves in bizarre fashion and the whole event seems like a dream due to the unique playing style of the monster cobb every slide hit and tackle are rendered even more forceful due to enhanced sound and tommy lee jones owns the intensity of the master player it makes the viewer drool over the possibilities of a true biopic of cobb in his prime with the same actor it's worth watching the film for this incredible few minutes alone just to see what could have been br br i may be slightly unfair to this film due to my own knowledge of ty cobb and wanting it to be something it isn't but to make such boring neutered movie about this maniac is nonsensical i'm glad ron career has slid ever since
