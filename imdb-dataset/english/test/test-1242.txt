<START> een for a lost soldier is a sad example of how not to translate to film a touching complex psychological study of that most magical time in a man's life when he is still a child but starting to become a man the novel records the real life experiences of rudy van as told thru the boy jeroen during the waning days of wwii at age 11 as he deals with his incipient sexuality and his deep fears of abandonment as he has been sent to the province of north of holland by his parents because of the lack of food in amsterdam and has not heard from them in many months as the postal service has broken down the arrival of the liberating soldiers in the film is presented in a painfully corny way with the soldiers providing entertainment vaudeville style then one soldier walt romances jeroen and the pair is presented as two frolicking males who consummate their love in a sexual experience this taken in stride by the 11 yo jeroen the reality was somewhat different jeroen describes his encounters with walt 6 in all in detail but in oblique language but there is no misunderstanding their nature walt is aroused to an intense passion by jeroen during which he handles him roughly so that in their final meeting jeroen is bruised and suffering a painful wound on the shoulder where walt has bitten him during this encounter walt rapes jeroen twice jeroen could have easily avoided walt after their 2nd encounter when walt first assaults him as walt is clearly anxious to keep his abuse of the boy from the other soldiers why jeroen keeps seeking walt out is a mystery of the human heart and not explainable by me anyway what the film leaves out is the aftermath the nightmares the the frantic search throughout amsterdam on the chance of finding walt for jeroen loved walt and nothing could shake that
<START> certainly not a bad little low budget film this bride of the gorilla but nothing special neither and not memorable enough to be ranked among the meaningful sci fi efforts of its time director curt siodmak was an eminent scriptwriter during the 1930's and 1940's and delivered stories for some true genre classics i walked with a zombie the wolf man but as a director he obviously lacked the required competences bride of the gorilla is similar to the aforementioned the wolf man in story and atmosphere but the film looks a lot more amateurish and pitiful both handle about cursed men that turn into large animals at night but the titular gorilla doesn't look half as threatening as the werewolf even though the film got released a whole decade later during a cheesy opening speech actor lon chaney tries to convince us that the jungle is an ominous place and hiding many mysteries but actually there's no real mystery in the plot it's just handles about a plantation manager who's jealous at his older colleague for having such a beautiful young wife and he kills him a native woman witnesses his crime and puts a spell on barney that causes him to transform into a hideously big gorilla at night or maybe she just wants him to believe he's turning into a hideously big chaney himself plays the police commissioner charged with the murder investigation while raymond burr who starred in about a thousand perry mason tv movies portrays the greedy plantation manager nightly gorilla siodmak attempts to make the film look like a supernatural thriller Â is it or is it not all just happening in barney's head Â fail miserably and it causes way too much talking and too few jungle action several of the jungle settings are nicely pictured but the rest of the special effects are tacky and poorly done still the acting is pretty good barbara payton is looking beautiful and Â although very predictable Â the story is strangely compelling until the very end weird movie it probably voodoo cursed meÂ
<START> drifting around on bootlegs sometimes thought an urban comic book legend the first ff movie is pretty much as bad as everyone fears i guess marvel comics now pretends it doesn't exist what with the 2005 version out in theaters earlier this year but it's out there a reminder and the last of the first wave of bad low budget marvel super hero adaptations captain america punisher most of the tv movies 'low budget' is too easy a description for this ff pic due to basically no funds showing the powers of the super foursome was limited to very quick shots mr fantastic quasi animation torch and fades invisible girl the easiest to do the thing suit was not bad and probably half the budget the face part was especially almost convincing the acting alex hyde white as reed is pretty good the other 3 are ok tho jay as johnny acts like a spaz at times to sort of show off his temper the dialog is comic book style and it's the supporting cast which ends up floundering trying to make it work dr doom is way over melodramatic and unintentionally comical and his two main henchmen are a case study of how not to act or write dialog br br the plot not too good it was quite faithful to the origin story of the ff more so than the later big budget version and even though the non budget again restricted showing for example the actual crash landing it kept the essential ingredients of how they discovered their powers in an isolated area it's the best part of the picture tho you have to wait a full half hour for it i also found the music odd in places when the 4 are bathed in those cosmic rays a kind of church choir is heard as if it's a religious experience the rest of it however is hopeless even with no budget the story could have done without the character resembling the mole man villain of the books it spends way too much time with him and his underground gang as well as the blind alicia these sections are a waste of celluloid and very boring the climactic struggle with doom his men starts fine but degenerates into an awful mess as the torch races a laser beam cool animation but belonging in a cartoon fans can have a laugh at the bad ff fx and witless storyline if they don't get depressed outraged first
<START> just getting released from a six month drug rehabilitation program and having served his time for dealing cards in illegal gambling card games frankie machine frank sinatra has high hopes for going clean and finding a new life as a big band drummer however upon returning to his old crime ridden chicago neighborhood he soon finds the pressure mounting from those around him including his wheelchair ridden wife eleanor parker to return to the old money making dealer lifestyle that first got him started on the path of self destruction that is being an heroin addict br br it's very rare that a film has so many great character performances as this one does frank sinatra is superb as frankie machine and realistically portrays the symptoms of a drug addict going through withdrawal arguably better than anyone else had ever been done before him sinatra seems to possess a keen understanding and awareness of his character here and expresses the constant battle for control over his own life that is forever going on inside the heart of the man that is frankie machine parker as his crippled wife wants to possess frankie forever to have him deal to make good money so as to take care of her and pay her ever mounting medical bills she seems terrified by anything she sees as a threat to her control over him such as the freedom the life of a drummer might offer or anything that might change the status quo between them br br onlooker molly kim novak a girl who lives in the same building and seems to possess real strong genuine feelings for frankie having no desire to control him but only to help him proves the best thing frankie has going for him in the world if he can just stay straight long enough to wake up and realize it darren mcgavin as the heroin drug peddler louie however is always there just waiting in the wings knowing just the right buttons to push just the thing to say to get a former addict to revert back to that old habit one profitable to louie but deadly for the addict br br the setting too seems to take on a life of its own constantly dark gritty seedy and crime ridden with nowhere near enough positive things to look forward to in life a place where it's all too easy to escape via a bottle or drugs a quick fix that's truly no fix at all but only works to keep one in the dark away from the daylight and all the bright prospects the world might have to offer it's a neat touch that when frankie is on the right track the setting always seems brighter than when he's headed down the wrong road while some argue it is a bit dated to me this is a gritty film featuring a realistic inner war within a man for control over his own fate one that features very strong character performances by all involved given that the man with the golden arm gets my highest possible recommendation
<START> i never saw doctor who before at least not in any focused way so i was new to the concept i have to say that the new show works very well it's funny it really also ought to say comedy in the genre description many plot turns are only acceptable because of their comedic value it's well written and it's making a meager budget go a long way the human dimension is very strong and engaging which is very rare in current tv shows br br i've seen the first eight episodes and 6 8 were my favorites so far even types of stories that are all too easy to screw up with time travel saving one's dead parents and that sort of stuff works out amazingly well here br br christopher eccleston is a joy to watch as the witty and light hearted though occasionally morose doctor if they can find a good replacement for him i'll be quite surprised but i'm willing to give the new guy a chance there's little doubt however that the eccleston episodes are going to go down in history as classics br br the relationship between the doctor and rose is particularly refreshing the doc is much more of a father figure to her than a romantic interest and yet there are hints of romantic innuendo between them which however is much more emotional and human than sexual br br a good show the biggest drawback is the low budget a show like this ought to have better special effects and why they don't simply use some cheaper effects i don't know in this day and age sfx don't have to cost a bundle just look at the star wars revelations fan film br br 8 out of 10
<START> if i had to decide which was the best ernest movie and don't act like that sort of thing doesn't happen all time it would be this one br br all of the ernest movies are entertaining but the best ones are the ones that have jim varney doing a number of different characters additionally i am known to enjoy the comedy stylings of bill and gailard sartain as brothers chuck and bobby tulip ernest goes to jail contains all of those elements as well as a funny script and a supporting cast that features several beloved character actors br br and that is why i have chosen ernest goes to jail as the king of all ernest movies disagree with me if you must but deep down you know i am right
<START> edith best book has been adapted into a truly magnificent film i love it the film itself has gorgeous cinematography and fine realisation of the subject matter the ending is enough to have you in tears as it is so beautifully done lionel has directed some truly excellent films like the amazing mr but this is his best film as director by a mile the costumes were absolutely lovely that matched the beauty of the countryside and the sparkling and conveniently faithful script helped matters however it is the quality of the acting that holds this film together as it is nothing shorter than incredible dinah sheridan is suitably sincere as the mother a much needed characteristic of the character and bernard cribbins was hilarious as perks in fact i preferred perks on film as he isn't as humorous in the book the children were perfect gary warren and sally thomsett both gave spirited performances but it is jenny enchanting portrayal of bobbie that impressed me the most another special mention is the gorgeous music by johnny douglas the title music reminded me of charlie chaplin's smile in conclusion a funny and poignant masterpiece that is better than the book i think 10 10 bethany cox
<START> this movie starts out with kids telling each other urban legends such as the poodle in the microwave and getting something extra at a chicken place unfortunately it then turns to your basic anthology movie the first being about a janitor with a bit of a secret this one is okay at best then it gets worse as the next story about this kid obsessed with dead flies is on and it goes on and on and on it is way to long and not all that interesting to begin with after that you get the typical shock scene and it ends you need more than this in an anthology movie you need at least three stories and one shouldn't be so long it becomes dreadfully uninteresting especially considering you can see how it is going to end a mile away
<START> this is an incredibly compelling story told with great simplicity and grace the story itself is the object of the film although the scenery is beautiful the acting is understated even superbly so for the characters themselves come through in all of their eccentric simplicity br br this piece of art will likely not be appreciated by those who view movies casually without due attention it takes work to be brought into the story but once you become involved the is complete
<START> the series finally hits rock bottom with this lousy fourth installment which was thank god the last one none of the three sequels did justice to the highly entertaining original but this particular film is nothing more than a shameless attempt to exploit the name of the magnificent seven and bernstein's rousing music theme the production values resemble those of a made for tv movie and the characters are forgettable and indistinguishable in parts ii and iii you couldn't remember their names here you can't even remember their faces lee van cleef was an inappropriate choice for the role of chris but nobody could have replaced yul brynner in our minds anyway don't waste your time
<START> i really should have learned more about this movie before renting it it was one of those movies where you keep watching it figuring it's got to get better then when it ends you feel stupid for having wasted precious time in your life that you can never get back ice t did his bad guy thing and well that was the highlight of the evening the pictures of the shuttle looks like it was done with a little toy inside of a box and the scenes were funny because you could see the strings attached to the space suits the script was lacking and the car chase scene with the guy bleeding and going unconscious was incredible because he drove better than i could have on one of my best days all in all i have seen worse but this sure isn't one i'd recommend or want to remember
<START> yep edward g gives us a retro view of the criminal defense world first he's an overzealous prosecutor who sends the wrong man to the chair played passionately albeit briefly by deforrest kelly then he's so filled with remorse his only solace is the bottle throw in a jaded romance a genuinely rapid descent into penury and no qualms about who he defends and next thing you know black leg lawyer god i love that phrase he sees the light just in time to save his jaded beloved from the chair yawn br br but really the courtroom action is pure melodrama see him punch out a witness see him drink poison see him argue passionately as he clutches a bullet hole in his breast be prepared for melodrama br br the hoot of the film though is jayne russell with curves defying the laws of gravity and an iq approached absolute zero she is something to see even sings a bit
<START> over the years i seemed to have missed this picture of ronald reagan and due to his recent passing to the big screen in heaven it was shown on tv recently this is a great low budget b w film of the late 1930's however it is very interesting to see how criminals used their talents to steal money from insurance companies with false claims during this particular time frame i was surprised at the role ronald reagan eric gregg the killer's played in this picture along with a great veteran film star sheila gregg nightmare circus '73 who was a great supporting actor it was a great film that showed ronald reagan as a very young man reaching for the stars in his career in hollywood at the time god bless him
<START> much like final fantasy if you look at a still shot it doesn't look so bad but when the people start moving it's utterly horrifying uneven jerky motions frightening lack of emotion and lack of a feel of life in the face gives me the creeps the characters do not even appear alive organic br br i saw a preview screening with my daughter who actually fell asleep she was not at all engaged for the record i thought her to be easily engaged by both pixar esque films as well as a number of the 'bad' 2d films like sinbad br br the lighting is painful giving the children the appearance of holding a flashlight under their chin at a campfire the lip syncing is bad worse actually than final fantasy br br i also seriously question having hanks play five characters this was a major distraction throughout the film the role of the conductor is eerie although in a way i just can't pinpoint it reminds me of my father's fake phone voice when greeting clients br br i think this is why the multiple roles are distracting you are aware that the voice is the same but yet distinctly different it gives each character the feel of being acted as opposed to being real human characters the illusion of reality is broken by the multiple role playing of hanks i've seen the technique work a la eddie murphy but hanks just can't come close to pulling it off with a voice alone given the horrifying animation br br i would not waste my money on this wait for the rental
<START> star trek v definitely earns the dubious distinction of being the weakest film in the star trek series despite the good acting efforts by the actors it suffered from a general lack of funding from paramount pictures paramount pictures was not enthusiastic about this film at its very onset br br the movie begins with the enterprise crew enjoying their extended shore leave as a for saving the earth from total ecological disaster their shore leave is cut short when a disturbance occurs on nimbus iii the planet of intergalactic peace captain kirk and the enterprise arrive at nimbus iii only to have their ship hijacked by spock's half brother the crew of the enterprise and sets it on a suicide mission to rendezvous with god just past the great barrier at the center of our galaxy captain kirk must then figure out a way to regain control of his ship and to fend off the pursuers br br the only bright spot in the film is the acting and directing william shatner leonard nimoy deforest kelley laurence and the rest of the cast all give good performances william shatner also does a pretty good job directing this film br br however the film suffered from a general lack of enthusiasm and funding first the part of was initially offered to sean connery but he refused so laurence got the part second many of the special effects were severely cut back reducing the movies entertaining potential third the scene that depicts the arrival at the great barrier left much to be desired finally the romance between scotty and uhura in this film did not make much sense at all considering that no such romance ever occurred prior to this point in the star trek universe and it was never explained how such a romance could suddenly materialize between star treks iv and v br br overall this is a very weak film you should probably just skip this film and move on to star trek vi after all the cast and crew made star trek vi partly to bail themselves out after their debacle with star trek v
