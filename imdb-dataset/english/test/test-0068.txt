<START> in my opinion this is the best oliver stone flick probably more because of influence than anything else riviting stuff full of dread from the first moment to its dark ending
<START> some movies are not for everyone this accurately describes movie shame at only 18 i still have what i guess you could call a minor form of add and well i watch movies to be entertained shame was a movie with a very interesting premise of trying to convey the effect of war on the common people it however fell short of accomplishing this for me i don't know if it was the subtitles black and white filming length of the movie or the fact that it took two hours out of my studying for a huge chemistry test but i did not enjoy it i understand it is considered a great movie and very important in the history of cinema however i think as my teacher pointed out not everyone has liked or likes it i guess i just wish it finished all of its many side plots maybe the translation lost something but i felt there were infinite little off shoots that never met a conclusion you would meet characters and never see them again or really understand why they were included in the movie my overall recommendation for this movie is that it's worth seeing but only to form your own opinion on it whether or not you like or dislike it it is necessary to respect the point that it is trying to convey
<START> this is a perfectly watchable adventurous movie to watch with a great cast and a good story based on true events br br it's interesting to note that the story of the movie is based on true events it's above all for most part an adventurous story with all of the usual ingredients you would expect from an adventurous movies set in an arabic world so lots of sword fighting good old fashioned honor religion and a rich proud country but the movie is also filled with humor to make the movie a light and pleasant one to watch br br the constant cutting back and forth between the morocco plot involving sean connery and candice berger and the american plot line involving theodore roosevelt brian keith wasn't the best possible approach in my opinion the two things have totally different paces totally different characters it are just totally different worlds of course both story lines are connected and focuses on the same thing but the contrast between the two worlds is just too big to let it work out it doesn't at all times make the movie feel connected and a bit disjointed the american plot line is most of the time more political while the plot line is purely adventurous and action filled in the end you could perhaps even wonder what the whole point or roosevelt in this movie was seem that john milius is just a big admirer of him often the american plot line would take away most of the pace out of the far more interesting and more action filled fast paced plot line after all john milius always has been at his best as an action director br br it isn't until halve way through that the movie fully gets on steam the most and largest scaled action of the movie then kicks in especially the large scale end battle does not disappoint i wish the entire movie was like this that way this movie would had also been a better known one no doubt br br the movie has a great jerry goldsmith musical score that is perhaps way better known than the actual movie itself the movie is also a good looking one with great production design and nice looking action and battle sequences in it appereantly the movie only costs 4 000 000 to make but that is really hard to believe considering the settings and size of the movie i mean john milius his best known movie conan the barbarian cost about 20 000 000 to make but was a far more campy looking one and was less impressive on its scale br br quite funny to see an arabic speak with a big fat scottish accent but hey it's sean connery so you just simply tend to accept this he suits his role well so does candice bergen it's always hard for a female character to come across as believable and work out in a movie such as this one but she manages also john huston plays a great role in this movie br br a perfectly fine watchable movie br br 7 10
<START> this is a pretty good documentary i'm not a skateboarder i don't particularly like skateboarding or skateboard culture but somehow for about 2 hours this movie made me interested in the subject br br i wouldn't call it the most intriguing film of all time but for some reason when those guys were talking about how they started their skateboard clubs and were skating in those empty southern california pools i was interested br br i should also add that the music in this film was pretty good too i don't sit around yearning to hear more 70s rock bands but it seemed appropriate for what they were talking about
<START> what makes this movie so damn bad is it the lame sub par juvenile humor could it be the horrid trendy suck ass music perhaps the uninspired go nowhere story or maybe even the fact that traci lords gives her worst acting performance ever and to add insult to injury keeps all her clothes on throughout the length of this steaming turd sandwich regardless no matter what the reason this film sucks the fact remains that it really really does i have never wished i could be watching a movie with dean cameron in it instead of what i was watching in my life but ski school is a masterpiece of comic genius compared to this travesty br br my grade f br br eye candy nesbitt buffy tyler and suzanne all unleash their tits br br where i saw it starz on demand
<START> i am a usually a very generous voter on imdb and don't bother commenting on movies i did not like but this was just lame i actually turned it off 15 minutes before finishing it to watch this is it because my gf wanted to i just chose the lesser of two evils br br if you want to watch this movie picture this film as a collection of worse than average horror stories like scary short stories that you find in an issue of reader's digest in the waiting room of your dentist's br br i did not expect anything particular terrifying or funny i am not the i want to see blood type of person but this movie is neither horror nor comedy nor entertaining in any other way br br it's probably more scary funny and entertaining to look at the movie poster of you've got mail for 90 minutes while drinking tea br br conclusion a horror comedy for people between 4 and 7
<START> so i decided to watch the entire puppet master series and had just watched parts 1 3 which i thought were all excellent they had a unique charm to them and a certain intelligence that i really appreciated about a year ago i even saw puppet master vs demonic toys which of course was bad but still a terrific guilty pleasure and fun to watch br br from the very beginning of this film i knew it was in trouble the cheesy power rangers style egyptian skull villain who watches the puppets style' through his pyramid glass came straight out of left field all of the additions to this franchise in this story were completely absurd suddenly we have a grand assortment of all kinds of new and random characters and plots that are a far cry from the first three films i seriously doubt that when the first puppet master was being penned the writers had visions of someday seeing an egyptian power rangers villain totem monsters annoying twenty somethings who seriously can't act and are supposed to be brilliant scientists but never say anything intelligent and a lame puppet who's head can morph into the ghost of toulon br br another thing that greatly disappointed me in this film was that it completely ignores what happened in the last entry part ii since iii was a prequel suddenly the puppets are back at bodega bay inn back in their case minus blade and toulon for some reason is willing to help his puppets again he betrays them in part ii for his love of elsa this isn't explained at all and so with that and all of this other junk thrown in i was no longer amused br br i'm a huge fan of ridiculous b movies a connoisseur if you will i even collect laser discs of rare b movies you can't find on dvd and so it takes a lot for me to say that this was one of the most absurd movies i have ever seen in my life i still love those puppets the original ones blade pinhead jester and the rest and if they had only stuck with what they had rather than trying to fix something that wasn't broken well the series might still be alive and in good health that being said even though the reviews aren't so great i'm really interested in checking out puppet master retro sounds like an interesting one that pays great tribute to the original themes
<START> decent action scenes but the movie is saddled with a slow convoluted storyline nearly non existent dialogue that leads to minimal character development and a seriously horrible storyline br br did i mention that the storyline made no sense but in its defense the action scenes were impressive enough even if they leave you scratching your head as to why they just happened br br there's not much else to say about the movie it's a slick mindless action adventure that makes no sense whatsoever it's like watching a worse version of the matrix and skipping all the storyline and dialogue
<START> no one is going to mistake the for a good movie but it sure is a memorable one once you've taken in myrna loy's performance as the hot blooded gypsy girl you're not likely to forget the experience when this film was made the exotically beautiful miss loy was still being cast as foreign vixens often asian and usually sinister she's certainly an eyeful here it appears that her skin was darkened and her hair was curled in most scenes she's barefoot and wearing little more than a skirt and a loose fitting peasant blouse while in one scene she wears nothing but a patterned towel i suppose i'm focusing on miss loy's appearance because she is by far the best if not the only reason to tune in to this creaky antique and to keep watching you sure won't be attracted by the dialogue which is hopeless in one typical passage gazes out the window at the departing caravan and waxes poetic always the gypsies they sing weird and sad when the big sun have breath of fire that burn and when the pale moon look from behind cloud and breathe air cold as death they sing poetic or what lovers of purple prose will have a field day i can't help but wonder though if in her later years miss loy preferred not to recall her involvement with this project br br like so many early talkies this one was an adaptation of a recent broadway success the stage version opened at the street theatre in november of 1926 and ran for over a year the play provoked a famous episode involving the humorist and theater critic robert who was known to have an aversion to characters who spoke in thick dialect or pidgin english according to a much repeated anecdote mr squirmed uncomfortably through the opening portion of this show the spanish village setting moved to a village in hungary for the movie for some reason gave the actors leeway to practice their accents with varying degrees of success but benchley's patience reached its limit when during a family dinner sequence a door burst open and an actress dressed as a gypsy girl dashed into the room shouting help help he keel me she then threw herself at the feet of the mistress of the household and exclaimed me me good girl me stay here at that point mr rose and announced to his companion me bobby me bad boy me go now and left the theater br br the film version offers numerous examples of unintended humor but never comes close to benchley's level of wit the melodramatic plot concerns the lajos family father josef mother maria and son paul a student at the nearby college we would consider this prosperous family upper middle class as they are landowners with servants and all the comforts of life but their comfortable existence is abruptly thrown into turmoil when a gypsy caravan arrives in the village and their home is invaded by yes the nubile gypsy girl she arrives at their door during the storm of the title symbolizing stormy emotions i daresay the girl is fleeing an abusive relationship and begs for sanctuary after considering the matter the lajos family agrees to hide her from her angry lover who shows up shortly afterward but is turned away becomes a servant in the household kindness motivates the family's decision to take her in but soon enough that conniving little good for nothing has paid them back by seducing every able bodied male in the vicinity starting with the servant peter then working her way up to son paul breaks up paul's relationship with his fiancÃ© irma played by loretta young still a teenager causes him to flunk out of school and then prompts him to buy her jewelry by stealing the savings of the family's maid lena zasu pitts lena for her part is still mourning the loss of her own fiancÃ© peter seduced and tossed aside by when she turned her attentions to paul ultimately sets her sights on the josef and i suppose if the running time had been longer she also would've gone after uncle dani maria the village priest and god knows who else br br i guess it goes without saying that a scenario like this one easily lends itself to parody but during its first half the nonetheless exerts the undeniable fascination of a daytime soap we watch hypnotized as the bad girl works her spell on the men folk and wreaks havoc like an irresistible force of nature almost like a storm ah haa another metaphor but as the plot machinations grind on the campy fun fades during the later scenes is de emphasized and the focus switches to the dysfunctional dynamics of the lajos family and after awhile these people get to be a real drag the son in particular behaves like an absolute heel yet the parents never acknowledge this or face up to their own shortcomings everything we're told is the fault of that no good tramp br br the men of the cast are dull aside from miss loy the only actress who can handle performing in talkies is zasu pitts terrific as usual the mother of the lajos household is played by alice joyce a longtime silent star who was out of her element with speaking roles and who retired soon after this loretta young's fresh prettiness provides a nice contrast to dusky allure but her line readings are so awkward it's kind of endearing no there's only one reason to watch this flick and that's herself i can't think of another actress who could've played this silly role and managed to come off half as well i'm not an objective observer however i have a desperate crush on myrna loy and will watch her in anything even the
<START> i can't think of anything i repeat anything positive about this movie the whole 1 hour 45 minute movie could be shrunken into a short 5 minute movie in most scenes there is absolutely nothing going on and it seems just the camera was left on recording on purpose only to increase the time of the movie all you see is someone in the background walking around or watching tv with no specific subject or even talk what so ever i just feel i've wasted 105 minutes of my my family's and my friends' weekend for nothing if a movie is poorly made or the scenario isn't great that's whole another story at least it leaves you something to discuss about but about distant i just have to call it a movie because it was motion pictures recorded by a camera br br if you haven't seen it imagine a 105 min long movie based on two three lines of story what will you end up with 5 of content and 95 of fillers that's exactly how distant was at least for us actors did a great job acting roles that had nothing special in them they barely talked or showed any special emotions i picked up this movie in the comedy section of a store relying on what i read on the back of its cover i'm still wondering what was funny in it other than our face after watching the movie
<START> the movie was slow the dialogue between actors actresses felt flat and basically there was no development of the characters in the story br br omar epps skulks around with a mad look on his face the entire time pouting and basically looking annoyed with everybody danes has no on screen magic and ribisi's character is a that nobody would want to hang out with even if they were paid to do so br br throw in the weird scene where epps has to dance with an old man and you have what quite possibly could be the worst movie in cinema history br br i watched it on satellite thank goodness i didn't pay for it and wished i hadn't br br do yourself a favor and go sort your underwear and socks drawer if you need something to do but are tempted to watch this movie when if it comes on your tv awful movie if you ask me and i generally have something good to say about just about any movie out there
<START> one of warner brothers best and highest grossing films during the thirties was this charming family drama about a widower who lives with his maiden sister raising four daughters but not four every day type daughters all of them have been trained by their musician father on instruments and one as a singer they do make some beautiful music together even if it is for the long haired set br br you can watch the infinite variety of roles that claude rains played over the years and still marvel as he shows you yet another aspect of his creative personality the opportunistic vichy captain in casablanca is as different as the scientist gone mad in the invisible man as the patient and wise job in mr all the same man and all so incredibly different br br here he raises the four girls with love seasoned with a little at their willingness to accept modern music the lane sisters and gale page may know beethoven but they're hep cats as well and can beat daddy eight to the bar every time and if rains gets a bit too testy than aunt may robson can put him in his place br br with four daughters unmarried at the time you know that's going to change all the sisters develop romantic interests in dick foran frank mchugh jeffrey lynn and john garfield of course the mating process does get a bit complicated and one of the sisters suffers a tragedy but it does promise to work out as the film ends br br four daughters is also known as the debut film of john garfield other than a tiny bit part in footlight parade years earlier garfield had no other film roles but he'd been acclaimed on the new york stage for his performance in golden boy and warner brothers signed him and found the perfect film debut role as the cynical musician who just can't quite get a decent break in life it earned him a best supporting actor nomination in 1938 but he lost to walter brennan for kentucky br br this film was so popular that it practically spawned a small cottage industry for jack warner sequels with cast members like daughters courageous four mothers four wives all cleaned up at the box office before world war ii and warner brothers remade it with frank sinatra and doris day playing the parts that john garfield and priscilla lane originated now those two made some beautiful music br br still a timeless mold was created in four daughters and the film holds up 70 years after it was first seen
<START> i love aaron carter but even i expected pop star to be predictable but i was so wrong aaron carter was really funny in it and a great actor also the actress who played jane was a brilliant actress every one who i no who watched it loved it br br the music in it was also really good br br the my favourite lines from the film is you cant send me to a public school mom im a and take your time it'l come to you br br although the endings kind of cheesy all the good chick flicks do this film is great and a proper good chick flick that i can watch over and over again
<START> i saw this last night at the tribeca film fest and holy god was it bad from the script to the editing to the acting to the cinematography none of it worked not to mention the set design costumes were so distractingly wrong for the time period it spans the years from the late 70s up until 2006 or so even john hurt who's usually an amazing actor was so over the top ridiculous granted quinten crisp is an over the top guy to begin with but hurt was given nothing to work with here i don't know much else to say except the audience i saw it with absolutely loved it so maybe it's just me but audiences love anything at film festivals when they're sitting next to the director and all the actors it's not a very accurate test of how good the movie is or how well it will play personally i thought this movie was terrible on the other hand it was so terrible that it was hilarious get drunk and give it a shot when it's on hbo in 2 years if it ever makes it that far
<START> as betty sizemore renee zellweger secretly watches her tyrannical husband del aaron being murdered by the vengeful charlie and wesley morgan freeman and chris rock her bruised sense of reality becomes totally immersed in the fantasy world of her favorite soap opera in a state of complete denial and delusion betty escapes both physically and mentally from her unsatisfied small town life to search for dr david greg kinnear the handsome and loving hero of a reason to love a soap opera set in a hospital and produced in los angeles immune to reality betty arrives in l a and becomes nurse betty as she tries to belong in the hospital world of her dream lover meanwhile the angered charlie and wesley track betty down convinced she is a dangerous witness who also knows about their compromising dealings with del br br nurse betty creates comedy and suspense by contrasting its main character's extreme innocence and optimism with the evident hypocrisy and violence that surround her by clearly defining the protagonist's difficult life nurse betty justifies its character's tendency to turn away from reality thus while offering a comment about the popularity of the soap opera within the film nurse betty also makes a comment regarding the widespread addiction to television and its celebrities in addition nurse betty benefits from the effective manipulation of its protagonist's mental state particularly in those scenes where she cannot distinguish between dr david the character and george mccord greg kinnear the actor who plays him betty's incapacity to recognize george as an actor leads to funny misunderstandings which stress the magnitude of her delusional state however in spite of these successes nurse betty suffers from the troubling characterizations through which the narration evolves for example while charlie and wesley are consistently portrayed as a comical pair the brutality of their actions undermines any sense of appreciation or acceptance the viewer might have initially experienced similarly although the initial scenes establish del as a detestable man the humiliation and violence he experiences with his murderers surpass all the humiliation and violence he caused his wife betty br br finally toward the end of the film charlie undergoes awkward transformations as he develops an obsession for betty an obsession which results in noble feelings of love and which ultimately destroys him consequently since the characters' roles as victims lack consistency the story's victimization processes seem random and unsubstantial all in all nurse betty's rather than creating suspense weakens its characters and pollutes its plot br br
