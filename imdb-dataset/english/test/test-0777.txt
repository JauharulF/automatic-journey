<START> watching this movie i can't help drawing the comparison between it and wild reeds another thoughtful film about teenagers coming of age br br like wild reeds this movie is slow and the director would not be hurried so if you want a quick resolution to things don't watch it this movie is like a slice of life beginning imperfectly and ending imperfectly there's no resolution to anything no happily ever after for anybody just like real life br br this movie is as real as it gets the acting is surprisingly good the director is fond of long really long shots and the actors and actresses excel at showing subtlety and inner thoughts br br i love this movie i almost didn't watch it but now i'm very glad that i did it's not a movie for everyone but if you're willing to let it grow on you you will be rewarded br br 10 10
<START> this movie i watched back in 1981 when it came out although i missed the first part of the movie what i did see was great this movie is hard to find but if found you must see the acting is great very believable sad movie if i ever find me a copy i definitely will buy me a copy to treasure
<START> warning some spoilers br br matt a rich writer is in fact still just a boy in his behaviour he doesn't care about anyone's but his own needs and couldn't care less about the consequences of any of his actions just as he gets to know and her bonds with her and her he starts to feel that something is missing in his live br br he starts to realize that he is in fact lonely and stuck in impersonal structures that are just convenient but lack heart and commitment nevertheless he shies away from any and is reluctant to change his live but will he be able to settle again in his old life and ignore the bonds he's already unconsciously formed br br situation is the absolute opposite she is pressed into the regulations of her community its prejudices and its medieval values being a single mother her position is difficult and it gets even worse when she falls in love with matt a white devil as the would say a man who cannot commit the women of the community plan to marry her to the to end her single status and give sammy a name but that would mean for to give up all independence and self determination but is there an alternative for her if she wants sammy to be accepted and herself to become a respected member of the community br br this movie has it all a very sensitive and sensual love story with very sexy scenes of matt and and an endearing child who is eagerly matchmaking a beautiful scenery in lively colours br br colin firth swoon and long show a great chemistry it's just fantastic to watch them and roberts as sammy is just to die for you simply want to adopt him i just love the way sammy and matthew talk to each other they are both on the same level in many ways especially when sammy asks matt about sex this scene is absolutely adorable br br almost nothing to complain about wait that's not true one thing is not good that the movie is not long enough well and maybe that the is too bad and too silly to be convincing br br 10 of 10 by all means
<START> ok i'm normally pretty open minded about movies i can normally see a good side to a film which has been totally pandered by others this is an exception br br i won't waste to much energy telling you what happens but think along the lines of bill and ted meets the worst police academy movie out of all of them and you won't be far off br br the thing that really got me about this film was the stupid purile racism that was evident throughout the general theme of latino black guys cool white guys lame is slightly amusing for the first couple of jokes but when the same joke has been reiterated for the time not an by the way it gets both tiresome and offensive br br i spent months waiting for the laws of karma to get back at john leguizamo for this film i had almost given up hope when the 'my vh1 awards' were screened live in the uk what followed was mr leguizamo performing the rare feat of a comedian bombing on stage you'd have to be a complete sadist to laugh at him ahem ha ha ha
<START> i hate to be too critical but this one really was bad i like the baldwin brothers i just wish there was more talent evenly spread between them i did like the general plot but there was just too much and not enough actual as far as quality acting was concerned br br my favorite character out of the whole thing was bald cop he reminded me of jeremy roberts i believe from start trek 6 undiscovered country just without the hair br br if you have hollywood video's mvp program and are really trying to get your money's worth then through this in with one of the three mvp movies you pick up it's worth it for a few laughs br br the single most impressive special effect in the whole show is the sound of stephen baldwin's rifle firing i suppose that lets you in a bit on the quality and excitement of the rest of the show
<START> i saw this movie alone when i was an early teen in my hometown in india at a time when the only thing that fascinated me aside from girls were tigers i came home after watching it with a glazed look in my eye wanting to be that bloke in the movie that befriended the tigers what a movie and what a moment that was the theatre i saw it in does not exist any and has given way to a shopping mall i don't know how i'd feel about it now after so many years and do not want to spoil a childhood memory by finding this movie available on dvd or something similar and not finding it interesting anymore i have learned from previous experience that a childhood memory is often tarnished when one travels life's jaded highways occasionally trying to rediscover their unadulterated past by way of movies only to find its gushing innocence completely soppy and not welcome anymore and i do not want to throw away the experiences of a memory of this movie into the wind i do not have kids so i probably am being selfish in leaving this movie in a sepia toned area of my brain not wanting it on dvd but if you are at a precocious age and want to recollect in later years memories of an endearing childhood try to watch this film if you can ever it'll be really worth it
<START> thus starts one crazy summer the evil twin of better off dead how can any movie be bad when the opening lines are sung by david lee roth br br this movie is a total blast pairing again john cusack with curtis armstrong but this time adding bobcat to the mix has great funny results hyperactive bobcat grates the nerve of everyone around curtis ak ak is the son of a deranged military with pacifist tendencies and demi moore with natural breasts wow as the love interest of once again chronically depressed cusack br br the story is well simple enough the laughs are there but both savage steve holland films have a certain quality to them they are funny but they are also sweet the scene where curtis finds a blown up doll in the target practice beach and begins about how a little girl won't be able to sleep was dumb funny and touching the animation used throughout is quite surreal the boat is hysterical complete with u sail and plush doll overall a fun film though not as good as better off dead
<START> why does this piece of film have so many raving reviews br br this is amateurish unfunny and annoying br br the only memorable thing here is the corny title song br br the production values are low and the comedic if you want to call them that ideas are weak they seem like leftovers of leftovers from snl that even they would not dare to have put on the screen br br i'm beginning to thoroughly mistrust imdb ratings br br this is light years away from kentucky fried movie not even in the same galaxy br br it's not even possible to write 10 lines about it br br ok another good thing ugly street scenes and ugly people something one doesn't get to see a lot in todays tv and movies
<START> a study in bad bad direction bad acting bad writing and f x teach you that better upgrade your computer before filming itÂ´s the kind of flick you used to do totally drunk in your cellar with camera when you were young at heart but you certainly would not show it in public when youÂ´re sober again would you you wouldnÂ´t even view it avoid at all costs
<START> spoilers ahead but that shouldn't matter since i hope you wont see this one anyway br br if you planned to see this one i have to strongly advice you not to because this was one of the most wasted 1Â½ hours i've experienced br br first of all this is an complete rip off of the great movie battle royale it is as stupid as watching any lame american tv show like cops or candid camera br br the plot are totally predictable one challenger pregnant and another is a nurse anyone doing some logic thinking understands in the beginning what should happen between those br br the concept is ripped as mentioned before and the movie lacks the violence necessary of making this movie enjoyable i mean the preggo shoots a guy in the back and no blood or not even any trace of the hit in the back br br i could go on forever without finding anything good about it so take your money and get a copy of battle royale instead of watching this piece of crap br br 1 out of 10 too bad i couldn't rate it lower almost makes scream 3 a masterpiece
<START> i was prepared to love where's poppa it features the nexus of normal lear sitcom character actors who when i was growing up felt like extended members of my sized broken nuclear family how fun it would be to see censor free barnard hughes vincent gardenia ron liebman rob reiner and a pre snl garret morris br br but alas where's poppa drags it's claustrophobic and plodding and breaks the cardinal rules of farce lightness of mood and a fast pace br br the plot involves the efforts of a lawyer george segal to rid himself of his overbearing jewish mother who lives in his gigantic new york apartment along the way we are exposed ridiculous characters and situations a comedic group of muggers who repeatedly mug the brother of the main character the rape of a policeman which involving a gorilla suit and subsequent gay love ruth pulling down segal's pants and biting his ass as he serves her dinner why doesn't this work part of the explanation is the sense of doom engendered by the cramped dark interiors and antique set decoration i absolutely eat up cinematography of new york during this era but watching this movie felt like i was through the police gazette in a dark bus terminal br br the main reason though is the slow pace modern mtv style quick cuts have changed what moviegoers feel is a comfortable editing tempo but even taking this into consideration camera shots are held for an excessively long time plot developments are also very slow there is one situation in which this works a weird love song george segal sings to trish van softly very close to her face and for an excruciatingly long period of time it reminded me of those cringeworthy extended shots in the british version of the office where you find yourself mentally begging the camera to cut away and at the same time you can't stop looking br br sadly most of the film is more hurry up than can't look away which made me wonder if it's possible to have a black comedy that is also a farce the dilemma is that the gravitas of the subject matter in a black comedy tends to weigh down lightness of the farce movies like robert altman's m a s h and kubrick's dr strangelove prove that it can be accomplished they do this not only through speed but also through entertaining subplots something where's poppa neglects br br although the film features multiple stereotypically funny characters almost all of them are directly involved in the central drama of how to deal with the mother the scenes featuring garret morris and the central park muggers are as close as the viewer gets to a mental break the muggers seemed almost shakespearean following the tradition of comic ne'er wells if the rest of where's poppa had clung a little more closely to stage tradition it would have been a better film edgier isn't always better it's as if all these talented actors and the director carl reiner were taking a short before the creative maelstrom of the 70's br br random notes after ron clothes the muggers mention cornel wilde's the naked prey 1966 a great action movie that was a stylistic precursor to planet of the apes br br as politically incorrect as he was it's disquieting to learn about the death of an action hero as formidable as charleton heston linda harrison who played nova taylor's mute mate said that james in the sequel seemed to be cute and tiny compared to heston
<START> i remember waiting to be born br br vision quest that was the american west br br we went to a psychic br br i'm sure their first reaction is that she's cuckoo br br the place is haunted br br i think there's another dimension right here br br an artist marta and her husband many decades ago left the hustle and bustle and culture of new york and moved to a god forsaken town with a population of 10 in death valley there they renovated a theater painting it is a very home spun folk art manner and once finished she putting on dancing performances for practically no one in many ways it's highly reminiscent of the werner herzog film or field of dreams though is a documentary of a real person not a mythical crazy man like klaus kinski or kevin costner her husband eventually leaves much of it apparently because of the lifestyle she chose so today she lives on with her ten cats and a sanctuary for eventually along with her new male companion tom br br what you think about this documentary depends on your perspectives if you are into new age ideas and open to these sensibilities then you'll more likely appreciate the film her talking about how she remembers her birth ghosts vision quests and psychics frankly made the psychology teacher in me cringe and this would definitely be the case for many people in addition her sanctuary and trying to preserve horses in the desert will most likely appeal to peta and many other animal lovers though with my background in environmental concerns and biology i see the and horses as a blight that would destroy the native plants and animals so on two different accounts i tend to think quite the opposite of marta who is more of a and sensing individual depending on how you feel about all this will definitely color your opinions and i am pretty sure most people will either think she's a genius or a nut you'll just have to guess what i think br br now despite all this the film is interesting and life is definitely not dull particularly since in recent years people have actually begun taking trips to the desert to see her perform there is a definite following for her and her unusual little world while i would not be nearly as positive as most reviews i also can't be as negative as the one review as there is definite merit to this odd documentary i like films about unusual people and marta certainly is unusual i also appreciate her love of her art and happy life that is a rare gift br br i teach psychology at an arts school and it sure would be interesting to show this to the staff where i am pretty sure we'd get a strong positive and negative reaction to the film probably depending on whether the teachers taught the arts classes or core curriculum it sure would be interesting br br by the way and i am not trying to be sarcastic but when husband was having affairs with whom did this occur after all they lived in the middle of no where and i was left wondering where he'd find partners br br by the way if you'd like to see her perform and or stay at her hotel it can be found at www com the site is in english french and german and hotel rates are pretty reasonable as are ticket prices
<START> several things become apparent after the first few minutes of this film first the scenery and special effects are incredible the best and if everything else worked as well its austere presence might have made it a great film br br but as soon as the actors open their mouths you suddenly realize that you are sitting in your den watching a movie the story itself is full of and melodrama and the dialogue is some of the worst i've ever seen and as if that weren't bad enough they made a fool out of the protagonist and in my experience you don't want to do that unless the film is a comedy br br bottom line i had a hard time getting into it and i wouldn't recommend it
<START> back in 1983 michael jackson's popularity was such that if he wanted to make a 1 million horror music video with the american werewolf team and featuring the voice of vincent price then that was exactly what he was going to do and never has a music video created such a sensation before or since when it was released on vhs this 13 minute short became the world's largest selling musical of all time but odds are you already know all about it as whenever there's a list of the greatest music videos of all time this one almost invariably takes the top spot br br it begins with michael jackson walking down a dark street with his date after their car has broken down he explains to her that he's not like other men damn right and then the full moon appears from behind the clouds his girlfriend stands there and screams and screams and then screams some more during a lavish transformation sequence as michael jackson becomes a werewolf he chases her through the forest catches her and we cut to a movie theatre ah all of this is just occurring in a horror movie that michael jackson and his date are watching br br so we're five minutes in and still no sign of the song thriller extravagant much anyway you must know how it goes from here dancing singing graveyard vincent price zombies what's the problem then end credits end credits for a friggin' music video thriller isn't one of michael most memorable songs but even by today's standards it sure is a bitch of a visual experience if you still haven't seen it in it's entirety then you definitely should someday soon
<START> the worst movie i have ever seen i didn't even watch it all i just fast forwarded it to burt's bits and then the end he is the only reason to watch this i have to admit to owning a copy as i am a huge burt fan stop laughing and needed it for my collection i wouldn't care when this movie came out i had a nightmare renting ti as my local store only had 2 copies and fans of all the various stars always beat me there imagine my disappointment when i sat down and watched this movie there are just no redeeming qualities about this movie absolutely nothing what so ever to like about this movie this movie became a running joke between myself and a mate burt's worst rob lowe's worst worst hour and a half of my life
