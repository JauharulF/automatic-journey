<START> this movie and i say this lightly is nothing but pure trash i feel sorry for those people that actually wasted their money to go see this in theaters i saw a screener of the movie from a friend and i've regretted it ever since br br as a black woman i am extremely embarrassed to have seen this more so i am extremely horrified that people of other races may have seen this as well and might believe it to be behavior of black people in general it's full of stereotypes against all nationalities and genders horribly vulgar coarse jokes and lame one liners out by somewhat well known african american comedians who should have known better after reading this script i must also mention the numerous rap and hip hop singers rappers that populate the movie like it was an overlong music video they had absolutely no place in the movie i guess they were the jiving singing minstrels horrible br br the writers producers and whoever had the stupidity to fund this movie should all be shot or locked in a room and forced to look at this crap nonstop for the rest of their lives do not watch this movie it's time wasted out of your life that you can never get back
<START> charles bronson is back in his most famous role in my opinion this is by far the best film of the series and my favorite movie ever this movie doesn't take itself seriously because the filmmakers knew that all the social commentary that was necessary was put across in the first film golan and globus made this film for bronson fans not for the critics and it works has been unfairly criticized as trash and a weary entry in a worn out series these statements would be true if the film was made to be taken seriously or to spread a statement but it wasn't if you take it as what it is is just a fun action packed romp with charlie doing to street punks what we all wish we could do the action is non stop the atmosphere is great and the movie is just out and out the best bronson flick ever made you can tell that the penny pinching cannon group spent a lot of money on this one it is believed that bronson thought this film was too violent and that was the reason why winner didn't direct any of the following entries i can understand his concern but as is always the case of sequels you have to push the envelope even further to pass a previous entry in any case this movie was no more violent than any other movie made during this time what makes the best of the series and my favorite film ever not the best just my favorite is the action charlie's presence memorable villains and it's ability to get the viewers to jump on the bandwagon the first film may be the most technically well made but this one is the most fun for once charlie actually has some clever lines although he doesn't say much and a halfway interesting story photography action and direction to back him up charlie has never been more intense or super cool than in this one yes it's exploitive maybe it does promote stereotypes and maybe it is the same story as before but bronson's films always have and always will stand for defending the common man and giving his audience what they want to see many argue that the dw series manipulates its' audience my reply is that the movies don't manipulate us the fans are the ones in charge we demand that bronson blow away deserving scum and in turn winner and co deliver the goods and for those of you who still want to put it down remember a few things was the 1 movie in america when it came out and was among the viewing favorites of millions of people on video and television because they realize that not all films have to be epics they just have to be fun 10 you can't get any better john batchelor
<START> i saw this film at the 2005 palm springs international film festival i went in with the assumption that if it stars and hilary swank it had to be at least decent well after a kind of a slow start i was far from disappointed in fact i was quite pleased with the final product br br i must admit the and accented english of some of the actors were kind of hard to understand but like seeing waking ned devine trainspotting or any other film with heavy accented actors i adjusted after about 15 minutes and i was trying to figure out why hilary swank was supposed to be south african and sounded like she was trying to put on an accent but sounded very american as if she was making a weak attempt at putting on the accent but later in the film as more is revealed about her character and how she moved to the us as a teen you begin to understand how she might have lost some or most of her accent so it began to make sense that only certain words might have a lilt to them br br i know it's a little weak for one to use film as education but one of the great things about this film is that it was interesting to see a dramatization of a truth and reconciliation trial i'd heard about the t and r process in south africa after the fall of apartheid but i didn't really know how it worked br br the final verdict is that although some of the scenes felt a little contrived this was overall a very strong film the closing sequence where the truth comes out was the strong finish every film hopes for a definite must see for anyone who cares about what happens outside their borders
<START> what a tribute to his father he set out on a quest to learn more about a man whom he knew little of and by the end of the journey i believe nathaniel kahn is content with what he learned and personally felt the film is 5 years in the making and a quarter of a century after his death louis i kahn's total commitment in his work consistent strong desire to build buildings that are meaningful to humanity and timeless to the whole world with insight into his life is proudly depicted by his son nathaniel in the documentary my architect a son's journey br br the film is by no means an anthology of louis' work there are plenty of books and archived materials that have records of louis kahn's projects and buildings this documentary works like a mystery writer director and co producer nathaniel kahn was searching for the man whom he briefly knew as his father br br the film is in chapters in heading west we're at the salk institute for biological studies at la california it's a sight worth beholding kahn's integral concept of building and environment light for the scientists at work is amazing from a former colleague who worked with 35 years ago we hear about his meticulous attention to detail also how he could be certainly didn't mince words in his criticism a memorable scene is when the camera pulled back wide and we see nathaniel skating around at the plaza area of the salk institute a tiny figure like a child happily playing in the bowl of his father's hands br br the immigrant segment brought us to meet anne the architect who worked with and also bore him a daughter alex now at 80 return with film crew to the bath house project at trenton new jersey was nostalgic in go to sea we get to see the barge for american wind symphony orchestra all made of steel and meeting robert who was surprised by nathaniel when he finally told him he's son was touched he said he had seen nathaniel when he was six with his mom harriet and he was not to tell anyone that lou had a son it was a emotional moment of reunion br br like his father the nomad nathaniel traveled to jerusalem and learned about the synagogue project that his father began but not realized he visited the wailing wall and seeing his kept falling off being off' his head gave me a sense that he need not be jewish to be his father's son we continue with sitting down with his two half sisters at the family matters segment we also hear him conversing with his mom at maine and from talking to previous office personnel at his father's office we come to know how his father intensely worked and practically lived there sleeping on a carpet on the office floor weekends and all br br the end of the journey brought us to india to the indian institute of management building talking with architect b v was a revelation in the end nathaniel found a very much alive louis kahn his father his spirits live within him this documentary is very much a tear jerker for me i was teary eyed most of the time it was very touching and am in awe of the man the architect and his son and the women in his life besides his famous works and buildings louis i kahn wanted to give his love to the world ' juggling work and three families you might say he has three women in his life to keep his inspiration going as wares the architect at the capital of bangladesh complex completed 9 years after death so poignantly noted louis kahn has given the people of bangladesh a lot spending time at bangladesh understanding the culture of the place and people as well as giving them democracy through what he has achieved and for such a dedicated man usually the people close to him he'd often miss seeing it seems the price of being great comes with inevitable personal sacrifices br br this film reminds me of king vidor's the fountainhead 1949 good dramatic story in b w with music by max steiner based on ayn novel with gary cooper as the uncompromising architect who stands by his own ideals and patricia neal as the parallel supportive woman in his life br br
<START> it must be remembered that the gammera movies like many of the first series gozilla films were in fact aimed squarely at kids little kenny and his cohorts are living out the daydreams of the kids in the audience they get to run around and play with top secret stuff while the adults stand by and allow it they get to cavort with monsters and even when the bad guys enter they are never in any real danger br br perhaps the first gammera film is an aberration because the child does get punished and is put into danger but the rest of the series is pure wish fulfillment br br as one critic said these aren't failed adult movies but successful kid's movies
<START> this dvd will be treated with indifference by of classic rock music devotees across the world because rush just aren't cool it is a shame that rush have had to overcome sneering disdain from the majority of north american and british music journalists over their thirty odd year history as this has deprived many people the chance to get into a real band each of the last four decades are well represented here and what a catalogue of songs it is we have the seminal the magical the trees and the lyrical tom sawyer interspersed with the high energy genre challenging pieces from their latest album vapor trails the musicianship is almost flawless the stage show is spectacular and the brazilian fans are just plain crazy at one point they sing along to an instrumental each band member plays at a level that defies belief real craftsmen performing art if you doubt this try out the la villa or the rhythm method for size and yes the latter is a drum solo which has to be seen to be believed br br sound and vision production values are very high as befits the rush experience and you also get a documentary and multi angled set pieces to boot br br this is an astonishing performance and tribute to the canadian rockers and all serious classic rock fans should own a copy
<START> the beginning of this movie had me doubting that it would be little more than a typical b sci fi flick but as it progressed i began to get interested and i saw the whole thing through the premise is interesting original and has the makings of making a classic alas it instead ended up a mediocre movie done in by the usual factors which turn a potentially good movie into a bad movie bad acting low budget etc i'm interested to see how this would turn out if it were remade with good actors and a big hollywood budget
<START> sorry folks this is without a doubt the worst film i have ever seen sometimes when a movie is really bad you can joke about it and have a good laugh like plan 9 from outer space this movie is so bad you canÂ´t even enjoy it on an ironic level
<START> i caught 2 37 at the afi fest in los angeles it's a very well shot first film though the dv format begins to show itself in outside scenes and i'm sure it has good intentions of showing us the dark side of high school in other words every side of high school but the filmmaker doesn't have the talent to write or direct up to the promise there are several characters but none of them are any more than what the plot requires them to be there's no depth to these caricatures beyond the machinations of i am troubled teen x i have y problem the perceived roles of men and women in this story are phenomenally troublesome br br let's start with the men you have the stoner kid who's gay the jock who's also gay the boy who rapes his sister and mr as the stereotype requires all gay men must be sexually unfulfilled and violent toward women and themselves naturally or unnaturally as the stereotype assumes the two gay male characters beat up women and themselves i'd be perfectly fine with these characterizations if the stereotypes were turned on their heads or if the characters somehow transcended them yet neither took place and that's all there is to these characters' stories br br next the ladies one young woman wants to be a bulimic housewife another is the pregnant of the sister raping brother and there's the girl who kills herself i'll get to that later again i don't think there's a requirement of political correctness for filmmakers i'd be out of a job were that the case but i do think that it's only justified if there's more to that character or story if that archetype were being used to reveal something about character other than i'm a teenager and life sucks i'd be happy as a clam but nothing new is revealed nothing is subverted or changed or sublimated br br finally the girl who kills herself this is blunt and highly sloppy storytelling we're supposed to sit through 5 minutes of a girl violently killing herself who we've seen for maybe 30 seconds through the whole film we've followed all these other stories for an hour and a half and now we're invited to torture ourselves for a character that isn't part of the story it's cheap exploitative and sloppy despite the millions of crappy indie films that came before this you have to earn something like that you can't simply purchase it on credit so this suicide happens we get wrap ups from the characters that go similarly nowhere but down and the film ends what have i learned i already knew high school sucked been there done that i already knew people have stereotypical views of gay men and young women i already knew that kids with disabilities are mocked br br what else is there then smoke mirrors and some really nice views of leaves oh and the nastiest deus ex machina i've seen in a while
<START> how is it in this day and era people are still dumb enough to think that other dumb stuff is smart maybe dumb people like watching stuff that makes them feel smart such as 'the war at home' it's even dumber than the dumb people who watch it there are no jokes only half jokes and slight gags that barely even warrant a tiny internal smile the acting is your typical unsubtle idiotic standard sitcom flailing limbs type acting and why oh why did this crap replace arrested development well you gotta hand it to fox they know that they need to have stupid shows to attract all the stupid viewers you see the reason arrested development wasn't massively popular was because it was so smart it was so smart that it made dumb people feel bad about being so dumb and of course if a dumb person encounters a smart person the dumb person will hate the smart person most of the time anyway either that or try and off of the smart person if you like this show and are one of the dumb people i truly cannot fathom what it must be like not to have open eyes and open minds i cannot fathom what it must be like to be mindless laughing drones influenced by every little thing basically people who laugh with a laugh track are parrots trained obedient mindless parrots maybe i shouldn't insult parrots by comparing them to you you know who you are if i seem like a in this review it's because i'm so annoyed at ad being canceled
<START> if you were ever a fan of mtv s the state then these three guys will be familiar to you but even if you only stumbled upon them via the internet like i did you will soon come to appreciate their unique brand of comedy br br born out of their stand up comedy trio michael ian black michael and david wain produced these brilliant vignettes of surreal comedy to display at their shows and now after being available only to download from two websites they appear in pristine glory on one dvd br br think comedy sketch show sans censorship and you'd be halfway there no stone of decency is left unturned but for those who like their comedy rude self indulgent and bordering on puerile and i mean that in the most flattering way this is the dvd for you br br i think it's worth the money for the commentary from the two michaels and david alone you can't help but take a liking to them as they explain their actions cringe at their own antics with sex toys and by turn pat each other on the back and hurl abuse br br fantastic br br it must say something for the appeal of stella that the likes of julie bowen and paul rudd are willing to throw themselves into the action so fearlessly and you should follow their fine example throw preconceptions to the wind and prepare to laugh yourself sick
<START> i saw this movie in its brief run in art house cinema in '69 i found it so funny that i literally spent part of the movie on the floor having laughed so hard i fell out of my seat in retrospect years later i thought it had been done by melvin van peebles when i mentioned it to a friend he said that a friend of his downey sr filled virtually every non acting role in the flick director writer producer etc he was right of course and my memory was wrong except that this was one of the movies ever made the part of the arab was particularly priceless
<START> an orphan boy named tom tommy who works for a pair of shady chimney sweeps is falsely accused of stealing from the mansion where he is working at by mr james mason the real thief and goes on the run tom's only alibi is the niece of the mansion's owners samantha gates a slender blue eyed blonde with long wavy hair who i'm sure was the primary reason why i repeatedly watched this as a boy he and his dog jump into a river and a witch turns them into water breathing cartoon characters while underwater he befriends and rescues a group of water breathing children known as water babies from a shark br br a very interesting and always fascinating fable set in 1850 that should appeal to all children the animation 42 minutes of the 85 minute hbo vhs print is just average but it's preferable to most modern day animation even computer animation my only real gripe is a plot hole caused by a deleted scene at 42 06 after the first verse of high the film cuts to a scene with swimming followed by tom and encounter with terence this leads to a scene in which the killer shark voiced by mason leads our heroes into a trap the shark then greets tom with young tom so nice to see your ugly mug again but this is the first time in hbo's print that tom meets the shark most reference books list the running time as 92 or 93 minutes and it was previously available from sultan entertainment and nelson so it's very likely that hbo's print is edited and or time compressed adding insult to injury mgm released a fullscreen 76 minute print on dvd in 2002 let's hope a restored version appears in the near future br br the film is copyright films 1978 is the water baby voiced by samantha gates bernard cribbins who plays mason's partner in crime also voices the electric eel a k a slip slide adventures
<START> not to be mistaken as the highly touted samuel l jackson vehicle snakes on a plane snakes on a train is low budget features no actors to speak of but some pretty decent visual effects an attractive young woman julia ruiz does not want to marry choice for her husband so she is put under a powerful mayan curse that has snakes hatching inside her body slowly devouring from the inside out her only hope for survival is a shaman who lives across the border in texas time is running out for her and she is put on a train from el paso to los angeles before long the snakes are leaving her pain wrecked body and rapidly growing in size the passengers aboard the train are now trapped and soon to be snacks for the snakes the finale sequence is no doubt the best of this 91 minute flick also receiving acting credit are castro al and giovanni
<START> i'm a fan of the horror movie regardless of which hemisphere it comes from i know what to expect from the west the east and most horrors in the middle so i received the dvd of in the post and looked forward to a slow build of ever increasing tension and scary children with odd disjointed movements hiding under br br the major selling point for this film was that it has a far more linear story line than many of this ilk you get who the characters are where they are from and what they do you get the baseline information nice couple can't have children and realise that the premise is just too normal for something freaky not to happen br br and then comes the bad the number one complaint is that the story is obvious i got it pretty much the moment the kid hugged the tree i knew where the film was going and was even able to predict the order of death and for what reason br br the editing is shocking and unfortunately not to the benefit of the film even were i still pondering the events tension isn't allowed to build because the director seems to have gotten a new editing suite for his birthday and wanted to use it as much as possible br br and my final gripe is this the tree was unnecessary this would have been a perfectly good tale of subtle horror with just the couple breaking down over the death of the child the titular tree bought nothing new or exciting to the film so i'll finish where i started my overall impression was 'oh '
