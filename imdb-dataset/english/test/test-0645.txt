<START> in the book of life martin donovan plays jesus who shows up at jfk airport on december 31 to usher in the new millennium by battling with thomas jay ryan satan and deciding the fate of the world there is also david kurt the accountant from amateur as a compulsive homeless gambler br br as usual hartley creates a surreal world in which the beauty of the ordinary made strange and otherworldly flows through artfully framed scenes and urban industrial landscapes filled with dazzling light and shadow as usual he introduces seemingly incidental details early then brings them back later in hilarious and unexpected contexts the humor is simple but giddy and irrepressible hartley has an amazing ability to build toward small and rapturous moments of the simultaneously mundane and outrageous as usual he creates a tone that is jaded and world weary but at the same time vulnerable open and honest he moves within minutes from uproarious humor into language that is metaphysical and poetic the kind of writing that is so dead on and perfect that it's difficult to hold back tears despite the lack of obvious emotion another awesome and highly entertaining film br br the book of life is shot a digital camera with a blurry effect a sense of the celestial hand in hand with impending doom and a hyper awareness of the present as fragile and fleeting in it's last moments all of hartley's films have a way of the present but this unique effect compounds it as the images wash across the screen in a way that is at first jarring but becomes increasingly beautiful as you settle into it the final shot is spectacular all this may sound precious but the film is a comedy and it makes fun of itself even as it makes fun of the concept of armageddon judgment day and although it is actually quite profound moving and life affirming it is for the most part lighthearted and playful the acting is flawless in terms of the kind of the subdued tone that hartley has developed in his films a tone that some people don't get and that prompts them to judge such acting as hollow the same people who have a negative response to peter greenaway as always there are bound to be people who respond to this film with cynicism and scorn people put off by hartley's abrupt shifts and what they see to be pretentious or techniques but anyone who is a hartley fan will love this film if they can get a chance to see it that is it's hard to say what it would be like on video
<START> it was full of plot holes inaccuracies doesn't the time clock stop for injured players or loss of helmets in texas football games and not so much redemption so your dad beats the crap out of you well do something right for once and then he will love you and make it all worthwhile br br either make the movie about a team and its quest for a championship or make a movie about a player within a team and his personal struggle but instead this movie tried to do it all and came up more than a couple yards short the book probably showed the whole story much better the movie should have picked one element of the story and stuck with that br br instead the movie jumped from one character dialogue to flashes of game play and then another character dialogue months later without actually telling you who people were or why they were important the calling his sibling to take care of the mother whatever happened with that because the mother was coherent by the end of the final game does that mean she's not crazy anymore its one redeeming quality was the soundtrack buy that and then watch highlights while iggy pop plays in the background
<START> words fail me whenever i want to describe my feelings about this movie and the sequels does it have flaws sure it does starting with the subspecies themselves which were not executed well enough for a special effect so why do i glorify these movies for the herd of movie mass consumers out there who care more about quantity than quality about cheap fun more than about depth crap like blade it doesn't even deserve a capital letter underworld dracula 2000 dracula 3000 and so on are good movies to munch popcorn to and drink a couple of cokes what makes subspecies a superior effort for anyone claiming to be a vampire fanatic on the other hand is obvious the vampire himself is romanian the story is set in transylvania the scenes filmed on location are more than convincing and the atmosphere is not based on any action packed chases or expensive orchestral music himself is the source of the atmosphere this is what a vampire should look like and this is how he should behave add a breathtakingly gloomy castle with dark passageways situated in romania include some typical vampiric elements such as the movement of the shadows on the walls when the vampires take to flight and you have a work of art in short if like me you 're fascinated with vampires and feel that their appearance as well as the setting should be sinister and dark there's no better place to look in than in a subspecies movie or in vampire journals the brilliant spin off of the former
<START> i have absolutely no idea why i watched ali g except for the fact that salon seemed to think a crime was committed by not nominating sacha baron cohen for a emmy for his work on da ali g show it is a sure bet that i will never watch that show as there was absolutely nothing funny about the movie comedy torture was more like it it was just about the stupidest thing i every watched i will admit that i was captivated by i had not seen her in anything she wasn't on the practice during the time i was watching so i guess i will have to check out boston legal one of these evenings to see how she does in something that may be worth watching
<START> i really wanted to like this movie because it is refreshingly different from the hordes of everyday horror movie clones and i appreciate that the filmmakers are trying for something original unfortunately the plot just didn't hold together and none of the characters were likable enough for me to really care about them or their fates br br visually the was pretty interesting the director took a lot of somewhat risky moves like adding in little bits of flash looking animation in parts and really cheesing up some of the special effects such as the light from a certain amulet sometimes this worked and sometimes it didn't but he deserves kudos for the attempt and the cinematography was generally of high quality br br unfortunately when this same approach of throwing lots of things at the wall to see what sticks was applied to the plot the results were not very good the film never really finds a tone that it likes moving from black comedy to family soap opera to 80's witchcraft flick to childhood nostalgia to embattled family slasher taken on their own bits and pieces of each of these elements work fairly well but nothing ever into a satisfying whole besides that large bits of the plot are never really explained i'm not one who likes to have everything spoon fed to me and i like movies that leave things up to the audience to decide but the parts that are left out from the just seem like they either ran out of money before they could explain them or they didn't really think things through to begin with br br i look forward to the director's next project since i think there is a lot of talent lurking under the surface here but i can't really recommend the on its own merits
<START> i gave this movies a 7 out of 10 i think the general dislike of this movie is due to people not really understanding the plot if you think about the story line this movie actually makes perfect sense it just doesn't ever give you a dumbed down explanation its true that the special effects are sub par and it appears semi low budget but i think the originality of the plot keeps you drawn in people say that the vampire genre is overdone and clichÃ©d out but with bled what you get is not your conventional vampire flick its a dream alternate reality story line with a vampire eternal life spin on it i loved it the only thing that kept me from giving it a higher rating was the lack of special effects and that i personally dislike movies where most of the people have accents but like i said earlier if you really get the plot this is not a bad movie
<START> everyone knows that succeeded in the first transatlantic flight so how can there be any suspense or intrigue in this film well there is don't ask me how but there is partly due to the director's expert telling of the tale but mostly due to jimmy stewart's thoroughly engaging performance we are drawn into the story as if it were unfolding for the first time right before our eyes despite the fact that half the movie is filmed in a cramped cockpit it is as dynamic as any action flick out there so if you are apprehensive about seeing this movie because you think you know the story already give it a shot i think you'll be impressed
<START> i am currently 22 years old and remember seeing this movie in the theatres when it first came out you heard me right i was 5 years old and yet i can still distinctly remember what i saw that afternoon so many years ago was it a mystical trip through the fantastic world of mark twain's creativity no on the other hand it was a quite creepy film about mark twain's dark depressed and in fact suicidal side one scene that still bothers me was a particularly strange scene in which mark twain is playing the organ at his own funeral br br would an adult enjoy this film well this movie quite possibly features some interesting viewpoints that a person with a working knowledge of mark twain's writing might enjoy but trust me on this adventures is not the film you want to use to introduce your young children to mark twain
<START> probably the best comedy in a long time keeps you laughing nonstop the acting is good and there are a lot of hilarious cameos such as ben stiller as the guitar store guy the plot wasn't as good as i had hoped but the comedy makes up for that i can only hope for a sequel cause it seems like they can still do so much more even though it was 1 hour and 40 minutes long i still wanted more at the end also there is a scene after the credits which is actually one of my favorite parts of the movie i suggest this to anyone who loves a good comedy and definitely suggest it to fans of the d or jack black you should buy the album also the songs are so damn catchy and hilarious the music on it is top notch as well
<START> if you have seen the telugu version of you will find this to be very similar in story line but has different songs and takes place in tamil nadu not andra although this is a remake of you will find that vijay and make this a unique film vijay and make a great pair a few negatives were when character slaps character for going to buy a present for him he never apologizes and she still stays with him in the end good action and songs make this an all around great movie i recommend it br br i give it a 10 10 one of the best i have seen
<START> pitch black is a surprisingly good movie i was not a fan of vin diesel before i saw pitch black but after seeing pitch black my respect for vin diesel has gone up he did a great job playing riddick a man wanted for many murders his character is cold and makes many decisions that surprised me like near the end riddick was going to get on the ship and save his own ass leaving everyone behind to die i like this movie and how it deals with human instinct this movie is low budget but this movie goes to show you don't need amazing special effects and lots of money to make a good movie i think all the characters made this movie i give this movie 8 out of 10
<START> widely known as don't look in the basement this is pure 70s horror b movie goodness that could actually pass as the genre's version of one flew over the cuckoo's nest though the movie seems to go nowhere throughout the first hour of it's runtime i enjoyed this particular batch of quirky crazies and their various personalities and deficiencies such as the former army sergeant a chick obsessed with caring for a plastic doll a lovable man child and a loony nymph after their head doctor is murdered by a patient a small sanitarium hires a new nurse onto their under staffed facility who becomes immersed in the resident's different ticks and outbursts things gradually become stranger however when patients start acting far more abnormal than usual you never really know or care where the movie is going 'cause it still entertains up until it's completely whacked out ending several of the twists felt a little too forced and i could have used a tad more blood but i really dug this much too under rated blend of humor and horror check it out
<START> this was the greatest movie i have ever seen in my life the action was great and i was so scared there was a lot of gore which made it great i would see it 1 000 more times and paris hilton d mn she fine in that movie but anyway i would recommend it to anybody even kids like me adults like it to you would probably have nightmares at night though but beside that it is awesome i cant stop bragging about it ever sine when i heard about it i and and in school i gave out saying may 6 house of wax see it i got my whole school into it but anyway i would definitely it may 6 house of wax be there it be slayed
<START> buffalo bill hero of the far west director mario costa's unsavory spaghetti western the beast with klaus kinski could only have been produced in europe hollywood would never dared to have made a western about a sexual predator on the prowl as the protagonist of a movie never mind that kinski is ideally suited to the role of 'crazy' johnny he plays an individual entirely without sympathy who is ironically dressed from head to toe in a white suit pants and hat this low budget oater has nothing appetizing about it the typically breathtaking spanish scenery around almeria is nowhere in evidence instead costa and his director of photography luciano who shot another kinski western and god said to cain lensed this horse opera in rather mundane setting around tor lazio italy and monte falls river lazio italy nevertheless the beast qualifies as a continental western because it deals with wholly unscrupulous characters and the action could be classified as film noir because the hero and heroine are trapped by intolerable circumstances that compel them to resort to criminal activities predictably their well laid plans backfire owing largely to the kinski character indeed the licentious kinski character resembles a wily e coyote type character consistently he struggles to have sex with several beautiful women but either lawmen or outlaws frustrate each of his efforts ultimately the beast amounts to a tragic character study brimming with irony the stelvio orchestral score sounds as if it were lifted by the tony anthony western the stranger returns the mario costa screenplay takes place on the western frontier between san diego and mexico that is being terrorized by a notorious mexican bandit called machete giovanni of we still kill the old way and his gang they prey on the stagecoach and nobody is safe from their the first time that we see 'crazy' johnny laster he pauses to refresh himself at a stream and spots a gorgeous looking woman washing clothes he creeps up behind her and attacks her but a bigger man armed with a rifle intervenes and he has to flee he shows up in a nearby town and a snuff snorting gunslinger recruits him to help ambush a wealthy man mr powers on the trail and rob him they wind up killing him and getting no money mr snuff accidentally leaves his snuff box at the scene of the crime and the sheriff arrests on suspicion of murder 'crazy' shoots his accomplice from his hotel room so that he doesn't have to worry about being implicated in the crime br br meanwhile a young couple in love are having trouble making their way in the world riccardo steven of requiem for a bounty killer lives a mexican couple on their ranch and helps them raise their real son juan in the village lovely girlfriend juanita gabriella of stranger in sacramento sings and dances in the cantina riccardo and juanita plan to marry but the last place that juanita wants to settle down is on a dusty ranch she dreams of living in the city but life in the city requires more money than either riccardo or she has they team up with a blond outlaw name glen paolo of shoot the living and pray for the dead and they plan to kidnap mr power's daughter nancy when she comes to get her inheritance glen makes the fatal mistake of enlisting 'crazy' johnny to help them because glen knows that johnny needs the money to get women br br they abduct powers' daughter and keep her at a remote cabin with johnny standing guard over her meantime juanita masquerades as powers' daughter and shows up in town to get the money from powers' attorney gary pinkerton giuliano of blood and black lace but he grows suspicious because juanita doesn't look anything like he remembered nancy riccardo brandishes his six gun and warns pinkerton that they have kidnapped nancy unfortunately for riccardo and juanita pinkerton can only lay his hands on 50 thousand because machete has struck such fear into the hearts of everybody that the powers' total inheritance cannot be shipped through the territory by stagecoach meanwhile back at the cabin horny johnny tries to rape nancy but she outsmarts him knows him out with a chair on the pretense of needing to be alone while she undresses after she knocks him unconscious she steals a buggy and drives it back to town johnny recovers pursues her and murders her about the same time that glen riccardo juanita and pinkerton meet him on the trail they inform johnny about the complications created by machete's reign of terror and give him 12 thousand as his cut of the money pinkerton is aghast at the sight of nancy's bloodstained corpse and threatens johnny naturally johnny guns him down in cold blood on the spot br br things really begin to deteriorate as the law in san diego sets out to capture machete glen riccardo and juanita return to mexico while johnny attacks two women at a ranch and narrowly escapes getting caught he rides to mexico finds a cantina whore and is going down on her when a bounty shoves a revolver in his face johnny confesses that he knows where they can find more money if they will release him machete's men follow up on johnny's tip and capture juanita the villagers join riccardo to attack machete and johnny rescues juanita but she dies later on after a big shoot out riccardo is left standing alone now machete and his men retaliated against his step parents not only killing them but also little juan everything that riccardo and juanita dreamed up having goes up in clouds of gun smoke for an unhappy ending 'crazy' johnny dies and never gets to assuage his lust if you think about costa's uncompromising the beast emerges as an interesting character study and an exercise in film noir in a western setting where everybody is punished
<START> i found this film to be a bit too depressing i don't mind dramas but this was a bit too much for me luckily there does seem to be somewhat a decent outcome i suppose it was well done i'd watch it again but it's nothing to rave about
