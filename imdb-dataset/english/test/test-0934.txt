<START> even though it doesn't really matter to the film this is a creation myth god a convulsing bloody figure in a chair cuts his organs out with a straight razor and dies in his own filth mother earth rises from his corpse and impregnates herself with his seed giving birth to man it is however highly unlikely for you to figure any of this out without reading a synopsis first and it's not especially important to the film that you do as it's more a surrealistic art house imagery thing all in processed black and white a sick bleak atmosphere is created with the stark photography and minimal sounds mostly water dripping groans scrapes etc but each scene goes on a bit too long and so does the film as a whole this could've been great as a short film and the god killing himself scene was excellent and extremely creepy especially being the first thing you see but it's hard to be patient when it goes on for so long and you don't even know what you're seeing for much of the time br br still a good film for the original style images atmosphere and content
<START> jeez when i heard this movie was a national lampoons i thought it was going to be awesome but i really got a say it was a rather disappointment i have seen the most movies they've made from christmas vacation to van wilder and this movie is the worst movie in their name really bad actors and a to much intense movie this movie is probably good to watch if you are watching it with a crowd of worked up people and the ability to laugh at it but if you are into good comedy's like i am i do not suggest this movie i would much rather watch van wilder a second or third time than to watch this movie you have been warned
<START> the film is somewhat entertaining but the greatest feature is shalom harlow's laughable performance it has been 4 years since this movie was released and hopefully harlow has gone through more training perhaps she should stick to the more worldly somewhat characters that she has generated in other performances
<START> i kind of had somewhat high expectations for this movie i've always thought that tom lesser known movies ie runaway and coma where well above the ones he had more press for maybe the producers should have had a little more knowledge about former major league baseball players who became stars overseas the majority were players too good for triple a baseball but not exactly major league i admire the idea of putting character in versus the clichÃ© of having play in the minors sad to say this movie much like the title of the post is stranded at third by a movie that seems to be running on autopilot i wouldn't mind seeing a sequel and hopefully the producers would learn from the mistakes the premise is just way too unique to be left alone with this uneven flick
<START> i really liked this movie one thing i have noticed is that korean tv drama's are way better as far as giving you the whole story i watch movies when i do not have the time or feel like going through 16 30 episodes movies are seem to be rushed and if you do not watch carefully you may miss something br br i do feel this one was rushed and i had to rewind a few parts to try and find what i missed especially towards at the end if you like nice love stories i still think this is cute and if yo have the extra time i still think this is worth watching br br it is always nice to go back follow the actors in different movies as we do not get to follow them from when they begin as we do the actors producers and directors in our own countries
<START> the film successfully gives a graphic portrayal of the suffering of forced sex labour but nothing more the agenda behind this movie could be seen a mile away and leaves viewer so embarrassed while watching if you know that feeling so the women are kidnapped and sent to ex yugoslavian territory to work as sex slaves because take a deep breath the american military institution is corrupt and looks away while their private security contractors are selling people abroad you don't need half a brain to see the relevance to iraq war and black water company br br what a load of excrement looks like i have been fooled all my life into thinking that this problem and many others were a direct result of grip on this region for 45 years but no it was the american war on iraq which is also responsible for earthquakes tropical storms and the constipation i had last week br br the film ignores the fact that 95 of the sex trade is women willing to sell their bodies for money and entry to the western block you also see scenes that are so stupid you want to pull your hair we have someone chasing down a woman in the streets of london in broad daylight beat her up then somehow drags her unconscious body half a mile back to the apartment where he rapes her no one sees this or calls the police and the running woman does not care to scream during the chase even better we later see 4 5 women lined up in the centre of london in again broad daylight to be sold one of them has a smashed face and people are shopping in the background as if nothing was happening you can't make this stupidity up br br i used to think that such trash was exclusive to hollywood but apparently i was mistaken
<START> the great war breaks out and daddy is a brave pilot who goes off to carry out some unsightly business to put jerry in his place mummy is doing her bit as a nurse so the five children are evacuated to their barmy uncle in the country where a secret passageway takes them to a mischievous sand fairy and the beginning of a magical adventure br br based on a book written the best part of a century ago they don't make stories like this anymore and there's a reason the men fly planes and author books the women change bandages and clean house the boys lead the way with their compasses and nighttime the girls do what they are told and play violin badly fat kids who wear specs are nasty all the kids speak in those clipped vowel flattening accents that are soppy and prim but which a certain economic class of english people cultivate on top of the snobbery and yearning for imperial there are plot holes a five year old would not tolerate i mean that literally my son was asking why the father disappeared before sunset why the compass didn't just drop from his hand as he disappeared the film at least tries to aim strictly for the kids until a completely inappropriate and unfunny monologue by eddie izzard what a waste of genuine comic talent plays over the final credits br br no doubt the five percent of british schoolkids who go to expensive public schools in the uk will find it all such a jolly for the other 95 percent of british families who no longer live in the 19th century the good news is wall e ratatouille and wallace and gromit are all out on dvd
<START> before i speak my piece i would like to make a few things clear 1 i am a chick who's not into chick flicks kate leopold and someone like you are extreme exceptions hugh jackman's ass 2 i only picked this one up because i am a fichtner fangirl who looked forward to see him in a bathtub 3 i am not a demi fan though i think her performances in immortal and a few good men were sublime and have earned places in my vid library also i think she's a little crazy no way is she not still sleeping w br br if this is a character study of an unfulfilled woman living dual lives of independence and happiness then i'd say we have one narcoleptic melodrama marty literary agent makes 6 figure salary lives in an upscale manhattan penthouse easy for her to read several hundred manuscripts and fall asleep at her desk for some highly suggested nocturnal escapism or perhaps stepping through an portal she has the career the looks a cool car a great pad now where are the man and kids in steps our boy aaron some real escapism what are architects they're artists who can do math dreamers that make real money aaron gives marty the dream of security and fills a void where she obviously has no self confidence br br on the other side of the coin there's marie still living out her schoolgirl fantasies while she muddles through motherhood her children are her career and life but what about marie does she only exist through her children in waltzes william a parisian stranger who helps her focus on the one thing she has lost touch with herself br br a supposed journey of self discovery and late a coming of age thrown in some with angst and some resentment to marty marie's own mother this gets a 3 10 all i could say is thank god for the multimedia division i wouldn't waste my 2 99 at blockbuster on this put it toward a harlequin blaze title
<START> this is a movie about a black man buying a airline company and turning the company into a african centric over the top airliner they even portray the owner as not only being in control of the airline but also controlling part of the air terminal at the airport one day this guy wins 100 million dollars a the next time you see him he is walking all over the airport acting like the owner of the airport everyone calls this movie a parody but nothing about this movie shouts parody this movie is a flop and will forever be in the 4 95 bin at wal mart br br i can't even come to terms to why mgm would waste 16 million dollars on this movie this movie doesn't even warrant straight to video status the writers one black and one white should be blackballed from hollywood forever not only do they over stereotype blacks they portray them as ignorant human beings i would be ashamed of going to a movie that constantly humiliates me don't waste your time at the video store wal mart pay per view or on a sunday afternoon when the movie is shown on tbs
<START> when i was engaged my fiance and i would frequent the adult bookstores he would look for his favorite mags and on occasion a video that caught the eye as much as i enjoyed the one on one with him that the media caused there was never a video that i really enjoyed i had seen only one other movie way back when there was a satellite channel called xxx it dealt with a private eye unraveling a case that actually had a proper plot and was enjoyable all the others were grunting and puffing and blowing and whatnot there's only so many times you can watch a blonde bimbo faking 'it' br br this movie caught my eye and i migrated to it allowing him to wander the shop he noticed how hard was it not too grins i was actually interested in something lol in the video section and came over buying the slightly used copy for me we took it home and i loved it here was a porno with a plot i wasn't sure it even classified as porno but i use the word loosely br br the librarian was a character i could identify with alice rejected her boyfriend's advances she was not comfortable with her own sexuality and prudish in her comments bill went away and she continued to check in books the white rabbit ran through the library one book if you notice closely i believe it's been ten years since i saw the movie was by lewis c and alice for that same reason that propels teenagers to run into the woods when a chainsaw wielding maniac is behind them rather than towards populated areas follows it's the best way to get the plot forward alice finds herself in wonderland br br i barely recall all the details but i do remember clearly the swim in the lake and how she was dried off i liked how they got humpty dumpty up again the mad hatter's size of member being on his hat to wear it proudly and the brother sister team of dum and dee which did disturb me slightly then again they could have been husband wife but i never could tell no matter how many times i watched it the woman on the knight who told alice go away and find your own knight what's a a nice girl like you doing on a knight like this br br the part that really caught my attention when i watched it about a year or so later was one of the cards 3 of hearts i think who resembled my ex's current wife exactly we couldn't help but tease her about being in the movie the king of hearts was interesting and the queen was even more so due to the openness of the forum i can't go into details just say it was orgy based and we'll leave it at that br br when we split up i was allowed to take the video he knew i liked it but in the time since it's been lost in borrowing someday i'll find another copy br br btw if anyone could tell me what scene was cut from the amazon version i'd really appreciate it br br i heartily recommend this movie for the over 18 crowd it was soft sweet and really 70's but i liked it immensely br br out of 5 d
<START> low budget films like this just give me hope as an aspiring screenwriter in other words if there are people out there who are willing to finance a piece of schlock like this than there's certainly much more than a glimmer of hope for someone like myself who can actually write stories this film is right up there or should i say down there with the ed wood's of the world the story if you can call it that and the dialog not to mention the sophomoric acting is a travesty toward the genre itself someone should have driven a stake through this stinker while it was still just on paper it follows that since literature has pretty much been killed off that film should follow in order to have a good or even just passable movie you must have at the very least decent writing the legendary curt siodmak springs to mind they used a lot of his stories for low budget films way back when but they still come off today as good serious entertainment i e brain the cast for this work should seriously consider going back to work at their respective hamburger joints or shoe stores and forget about any future feeble attempts at appearing in front of a camera avoid this one like the plague itself
<START> i'm a big horror film buff particularly of the 1980's name one Â i've probably seen it last year a new little horror movie that seemed to slip under mainstream radar called saw was about to hit theaters i was moderately excited having not heard anything about it i thought it looked quite promising judging by the previews and posters well except the back and white ones with the severed hands and feet those just looked terrible i saw the film on opening night it was one of the worst experiences of my life this movie was literally mentally and psychically painful to watch because it was scary no because it was one of the most awful movies i had ever had the displeasure of seeing first off the construction of the screenplay and editing was utterly atrocious even by horror movie standards starting off a sequence in an interrogation room with a victim smith who recently survived a serial killer's attack then showing a flashback of what she survived not scary it was impossible to feel any type of tension whatsoever knowing that the aforementioned victim was perfectly alright sure that reverse bear trap thing was creepy but why should i feel in the least bit frightened when clearly you just showed me she survived the ordeal unfortunately the entire film was constructed this way it starts with two guys in a cellar then they show flashbacks of how they were abducted not scary why because we already know what's gonna happen to them seeing as how we just saw the result of the attack they're fine move on with the story even more unfortunately the actual story was meager at best i couldn't have cared less for these annoying pitiful excuses for characters and the acting didn't help cary elwes was solid for the most part and then suddenly towards the end he started crying like a lost infant while straining to keep his american accent in tact it didn't work Â the audience i saw this with was in stitches this drove him to a rash and idiotic decision even the most simple minded wouldn't attempt he had other options better ones smarter ones even given his intense emotional state horribly communicated through horrible acting it was still irrational i didn't buy it bad writing alert furthermore even when certain sequences were played straight through and flashback free they were painfully predictable i constantly found my foot tapping impatiently waiting for the dumb sequence to end this happened for the entire film i saw every single twist coming twenty minutes into the film i had already called the killer's identity not to mention his connection to his accomplice s as soon as they appeared on screen better acting might've been able to overshadow the awful script instead the actors might as well have had red herring or accomplice tattooed across their foreheads br br by the end of the movie i was utterly outraged i had wasted even a fragment of my life on this film and the entire theatre was laughing hysterically at the downright horrendous finale seriously you'd think they were watching a monty python movie i would've been laughing too had i not been so angered at the film's total and utter failure to accomplish anything it set out to do when we left there was no joke a line to speak to the manager of the theatre to get their money back didn't happen i was absolutely positive the movie was going to be a box office bomb the following week you couldn't have imagined my shock to find out saw had hit number one at the box office and everyone was talking about it mostly individuals who found napoleon dynamite to be a thought provoking epic tale and thought satire was some type of rubber i am so utterly sickened to hear people praise this film that i often feel as though i'm going to vomit it's entertainment for the most feeble and simple minded of the human race those who find some weird jigsaw clown puppet riding on a threatening it's a doll Â knock it over and leave Â what's so frightening about that br br don't get me wrong i own every friday the 13th love my splatter movies thought napoleon dynamite was hilarious can't get enough of freddy michael pinhead or leatherface have a font appreciation for unknown horror gems and rank sleepaway camp ii unhappy campers amongst my top 10 favorite slashers however i realize these films aren't the most sophisticated american cinema has to offer Â i appreciate them for what they are Â quick easy fun saw is cinematic garbage the film attempts to be a smart and semi sophisticated nasty little thrill ride and bogs down to an irritating annoying waste of time money energy and celluloid atrocious on all accounts every single copy should be incinerated along with its feeble minded fans shame on all of you br br will i see saw ii maybe after i take a double shot of liquid before i gouge out my own eyes and impale white hot kabob into my ears and colon my rating 0 10 avoid at all costs
<START> all i ever heard while being raised was equality of the sexes and here we have a film that not only exemplifies imbalance but continues through with a whole concept that one sex is better all the while watching i was hoping for that redeeming quality to make the viewer feel as though there is hope for the future and there wasn't i'll admit to not finishing the film i had to turn it off at the part where the old man whore told the genetic man adam that it was ok to be a whore and get and i quote more tail than any man in the past time i know not finishing it is a bad review on myself but it is the responsibility of the writer and crew to a story that will keep a viewer interested and they failed this film betrays all true female nature qualities of the mother figure and the need for balance instead it exemplifies what america ran by lesbian would be like and i'm not against lesbians thank you mr director someone please give me a redeeming quality wait i have it there's no sequel
<START> one of my favorite movies great cast lead by jonathan silverman and blythe danner serious drama situations with brilliant comedic punches an exact mixture of character and story real people with real problems and everyone has a different relationship with each family member sensitively moves from slightly sad to hilariously funny read the quotes this is the best adaptation of a neil simon play br br if you wanna see more of eugene check blues starring matthew broderick who played in both stage versions is ok a bit on a darker side get away from the made for tv broadway bound
<START> i'm originally from brazil the sad thing about this movie was the exploitation that was done to that boy they told his life story and he never got one brazilian cent of that movie fernando is not the first and will not be the last to go through that life style in brazil sad but that is the world we live in it's about making money not saving lives question is where is fernando today most probably dead we tend to want to live in this disney filled fantasy life when someone comes up to the plate to help along comes the higher power and says what do i get from this where's my cut i wish people's conscience would speak up
