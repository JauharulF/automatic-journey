<START> well i would say that this is a very enjoyable and somewhat touching movie despite its flaws i didn't believe for a minute that matthau knew the first thing about being a dentist also hawn's character seemed to recover from suicidal depression rather quickly at the beginning of the movie not to mention the entire thing seemed rather ridiculous however the film does succeed due to a good pace humor and its stars matthau may not have been a dentist but he was as amusing as he usually is bergman brought a great deal of sensitivity to the film especially during the scene where her and matthau go out for a drink after work and also a good deal of humor i believe it was her performance that made my brother take notice of this movie after overhearing a couple scenes hawn's performance is noteworthy although an oscar may have been over doing it a bit basically don't take this movie too seriously and you will enjoy yourself
<START> i wish that all the mockumentaries and horror spoofs would go away if you are going to investigate loch ness do it for real enough of the bull same with horror and sci fi if you are going to make a movie and it is supposed to be scary make it scary not funny i hate when watching a horror movie and the character is fighting for their life or running or whatever their life is at stake and they are cracking jokes this never happens cmon where have all the good directors gone i think horror and sci fi have really gone down the tube since the 70's i long for the days that a horror flick was scary all this scary movie crap is for the birds this film is also for the birds if you really would like to see a good investigation or here serious talk don't expect it in this video
<START> just watched this movie and it's not bad there are a few tense moments and not a lot of long dialog strings comes off as fairly intelligent almost like style' this movie will evoke some nostalgia and a bit of cold war paranoia with cars street scenes and life in the 50's the acting is fairly solid and at 85 minutes run time it goes by at a good pace an atomic era film buff shouldn't miss this one
<START> for late 80s cheese this really isn't so bad there are a lot of pretty funny throwaway one liners that was grand theft thanks and madonna gives a fine performance nothing award worthy here but that goes for razzies as well as oscars i'm curious to know if the movie would have been better received if she had used her regular pre british influenced speaking voice rather than the hyper accent used instead oh well as a side note i got to meet one of the actors who played one of the motorcycle cops through my work he said that it was a fun film to work on but gave me the sad news that the actor who played buck the ups delivery guy died about a year after who's that girl
<START> i saw this film right in the middle while going through a breakup it was about 3 in the morning and i was battling insomnia with a quick snack it wasn't too bad at the time but every time i have tried to watch it since i can't get into it like i did that night br br at the time i thought it was cute and i loved the variety of characters though they totally could have done better than goran v in my opinion but the one thing that kept me watching was heather's character and her sad commitment to her husband who didn't want her anymore which made me feel sorry for her and root for her at the same time considering i was in a similar situation at the time perhaps that's why i liked her so much not a bad film but you pretty much have to be somewhere near the character romantically in order to appreciate it and let's hope you never are
<START> following a mugging incident at new york's grand central station an innocent bystander kevin spacey the usual suspects is arrested by police who believe him to be under the influence of hallucinogenic drugs we can understand why they think this considering how the man politely informed them that he wears his dark glasses because the light on your planet is really bright and so as he identifies himself pronounced as rhyming with goat is shipped off to the psychiatric institute of manhattan where a weary workaholic doctor mark powell jeff bridges the big lebowski attempts to understand this man's so called delusion br br manner is courteous and cooperative when asked why he believes he has been institutionalised he matter of factly replies that it is because you think i'm crazy within minutes after satisfying his insatiable newfound hunger for earth fruit the completely forthright has revealed that he is an extraterrestrial from the planet k pax which resides 1000 light years away circling the star system agape and located in the constellation he also details how his infinitely more advanced species has already mastered faster than light travel through harnessing the energy of light an accomplishment that is allegedly eons away for the human race br br powell is understandably very skeptical of these outrageous claims though he is nevertheless fascinated by them and commits himself to understanding how came to believe such a thing meanwhile uses his time to observe his fellow patients in the psychiatric ward eventually offering everybody around him something to live for and hope of a cure on july 27 later reveals he will depart again for k pax and he can only take one human with him of what will actually happen on that date nobody is certain br br originally slated to play dr powell Â with will smith as Â kevin spacey stepped into the main role when smith had to withdraw from the film you can tell that he had a lot of fun with his character the completely matter of fact delivery of his sometimes ridiculous dialogue your produce alone has been worth the trip often eliciting genuine laughter there is undeniable intelligence behind many of words but logic maintains that he must be delusional mustn't he br br the audience is led back and forth between the possibilities Â for the first segment of the film we almost accept the possibility that is an extraterrestrial this is a sci fi movie isn't it before being totally convinced when inexplicably displays an impossible knowledge of the astronomy of a newly discovered planet system a final investigation by dr powell offers us a neatly packaged terrestrial explanation for delusions but this is just as quickly whisked away and we are left scratching our heads again the film quite rightly keeps its ending open leaving the audience to contemplate what they've just watched and to discuss it with those around them nevertheless whether you believe to be an alien or not two irresistible linger in your mind the universe is indeed a fascinating place and perhaps there are higher forces that we humans are yet to discover
<START> i wonder why i haven't heard of this movie before it's truly a magnificent comedy i'd say farce but it's too well acted and i'd hate to denigrate it's quality a comedic character study about the travails of mid life crises the inequity for gays who can't have their long time unions recognized and the general differences of people who can't fit nicely into society that pairs kathy bates and rupert everett to a wonderful effect forget julia roberts and rupert kathy bates and rupert should do another movie together the anxiety ridden acerbic and outrageous daughter in law meredith eaton is a truly wonderful character if you liked the tales of the city films you'd like this quirky charmer
<START> oh boy my god what a movie this one this is probably the best movie by sean austin and louis jr i have seen all the comment for this movie and most of them loves this movie very much but i don't really understand why it only got 6 1 in imdb list this one should above 7 5 the plot and the script are completely perfect the acting are superbly well acted sean austin will wheaton louis jr have given an incredible and awesome performance in their career this movie contain a lot of action br br just one thing i gotta say watch it br br 10 out of 10 stars
<START> don't let any reviews critics imdb users or mine influence you seeing this movie i read only the plot premise and became intrigued after watching this movie in my opinion is definitely worth seeing it gives a perspective on life that many have probably not contemplated its is not however as leland himself says a movie that can be wrapped up in a neat package with a bow and everything other user reviews on this website claim to have a psychological background and imply that the story is not feasible quite obviously they missed the entire point of the movie which is disappointing to say the least br br in short it is a well acted well directed movie the story is not a feel good one but i feel if you don't come away from the movie feeling good you may just have missed something to characterize it as art house is unfair in my opinion but as our society likes labels this is probably the one that fits if you find you know everything there is to know about the world i'd suggest skipping this one if you feel movies should be a form of escape from the world you won't find it here but if you do watch it you just might find something in yourself
<START> it's a long time ago i saw this movie and still it's one of the worst i've ever seen i like lots of kind of movies sci fi action drama thrillers and sometimes even horror not a combination of two this could have been a wonderful movie but they all blew it up i didn't want to see this movie but friends of mine insisted to watch it i didn't know it was such a crap i loved the first part in which clooney and tarantino drove through texas killing everybody on their way especially the scene with the liquor shooting was excellent but at its turning point in the titty twister bar everything changed stupid vampires took over the place and what could have been a perfect gangster movie became a stupid horror movie like 'nightmare on if you like horror watch a real horror movie and when you love thrillers don't watch it at all you will be very disappointed at the end
<START> i loved this movie it was adorably touching and funny finally here's a story about a group of people who meet some challenges flounder a bit and then decide to just be themselves and end up happy for when was the last time you saw that in a film dealing with the fluidity of life love and sexuality the characters are faced with real problems albeit in often ridiculous situations like the men's group camping trip and the explicit liaisons and manage to learn and grow without the movie getting preachy darkly desperate or too unrealistic you'll love and care about the characters who far from being hollow stereotypes portray real people with just a touch of the truth behind their would be labels br br a good romcom for a saturday afternoon and the only movie i've ever seen where sexual fluidity ends happily and no one is forced to be anything they don't want to be far better than kissing jessica stein a good choice if your tired of watching gay movies that have some painful lesson and bitter lesson or maybe you just like a good british romp james purefoy looks dashing as always and tom hollander is deliciously funny so go forth watch enjoy you won't regret it
<START> logan lerman dean collins iii of jack bobby fame provide a nice touch of familiarity as friends in this even if not maybe as close as they may be on jack bobby but the expressions of young students taking their stand for a good cause is very well expressed in this movie logan lerman may be seemingly typecast in roles of being different as thusly seen from here as is seen in this as well as in jack and bobby the movie also opens up with a very nice tune coined as a lost 45 and i'm wondering where the lions are a song which i'd always heard on the speaker my old job of and got it played on my local radio show of the hosted by barry scott but the last time of which i suggested this with this movie as it's dedication but the dedication was left out environmentalist demonstration is well expressed in this movie too for the protection of the ground owls as seen in this movie too what a hoot too this movie is hoot a hoot in the tradition of the owl commercials of the 1970s too truthfully stephen steve g baer a k a ste

<START> the creator of donnie darko brings you a twilight zone themed tale of the oddest fashion the film centers on a middle aged young couple living paycheck to paycheck in 1976 one day a mysterious box appears with a red button later on that day a spooky gentleman shows up and tells them that they have the choice to press the button and receive a million dollars but someone they don't know will die it's a disturbing and provocative question suspensefully outlined in the trailer and tv spots but let it be known that you just don't know what your in for until you see it at times pretentious and a bit melodramatic the film is ultimately effective because of it's good performances and intriguing subject matter it would be unfair to ruin any of the plot twists for you but lets just say the film will deliver on the aspects you expect it to and not completely fulfill others it begins to outline there's a lot of apparent symbolism and subtext in the film which is both interesting and annoying as it wasn't so evident in his other superior film donnie darko there isn't too much more to say without ruining the film for you it's meant to inspire lots of cafe chatter afterwards however i'd also like to say it's shot well and has an appropriately aged look to it and it's worth a watch check it out
<START> i don't understand how people could not like this movie you have jr the kid who played the main character in stand by me sean astin and many other great actors lots of action and fun that you don't see in today's movies anymore it's really a shame br br this is an underrated movie that is among other great movies like let's get harry the 80's and early 90's created such great movies that will never again be topped by today's standards br br they tried to somehow recreate this movie in masterminds but came up short with some really bad acting the only thing that movie had going was patrick stewart but obviously that wasn't enough
