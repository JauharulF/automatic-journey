<START> great movie i thought it would never be as good as it was great special effects great story big laughs it didn't take itself seriously which is why i think it worked so well even the acting was surprisingly good overall a very funny and sometimes chilling story
<START> plants in an ancient mayan pyramid structure killing all who come close yes it is weird as the travelers do not figure it out until everything starts doing crazy and in a movie like this i just wished it went absurd and had marching bands being attacked by plants wielding machetes br br anyway a group of people from america vacation and go into the mountains with a couple of other newly made german friends who know about the place when they get there mayans began shouting at them and hide on the structure and when there thats when the plants decide to take them out mimicking cell phone noises humans and ancient mayan dead people br br nothing was really scary about the movie and was not even entertaining not even the weird ending could save this piece of crap i kept looking for something really good to happen but nothing oh well f
<START> this film was great i love the way it mixes dark humor with drama there are times when you think there is no possible way you could laugh at the situation presented and yet you experience a surprising giggle it is wonderfully acted with great performances by sigourney weaver jeff daniels and emile hirsch it is well written with a stylish surprising ending i'm not one to say that everyone will like it as much as i did but give it a chance and rent it the dvd has great special features including full length commentaries by director dan harris and emile hirsch and one by sigourney weaver that give you interesting information about the film i hope my comment is helpful and that you enjoy the movie
<START> sylvester the cat stowaway upon a ship that tweety bird happens to be on with his owner granny oh i don't even have enough words to convey how much i disdain both the tweety and granny characters they simply are not funny to me and made this short quite the chore to sit through indeed sylvester is a great character on his own but there's only so much he can do when confronted by the sheer awfulness of that accursed bid and senile old witch of a granny this animated short can be found on disc 4 of the looney tunes golden collection volume 1 and features an optional commentary by micheal barrier br br my grade d
<START> unfortunately a boring flick and obviously the only way to see it is the butchered bootleg public domain version which is so blurry and dark that at times you have hard time making out where the screen is the leading actors are a nuisance the man spends most of his screen time trying to appear nonchalant charming and sexy forgetting totally what the film is about and that he is a murder suspect because of some dame who played him for a goose to start with the dame herself merely walks through the flick being dignified if she's not busy appearing cute it's a rather badly written stuff never interesting or witty no good camera work no memorable soundtrack no glamorous actresses or atmospheric sets it only scratches the surface of the genre and nothing happens if you miss this totally missable flick
<START> what i liked best about this feature length animated film from 1941 is the great feel it gives for the early 1940s it's the songs the clothing automobiles buildings lingo of the day etc you feel like you've stepped back into time br br from reading some of the reviews here i see this was a hard luck film being released a couple of days before the pearl harbor attack wow no one would be interested in going to the movies for a feature length cartoon during those eventful and shocking days i'm sure too bad because the folks missed some nice animation would have really impressed back then almost 70 years ago the colors are nice drawings are good and story involving as we root for the bugs led by and and his beautiful girl honey to make it happily ever after and out of harm's way it's also about all of them finding a spot they can live and not worry about humans trampling them br br there is a nasty villain though c bagley beetle and two of his henchmen those helpers swat the fly and smack the mosquito are comedians complete with their brooklyn ese accents the story is a familiar one where a nasty old man wants to marry the sweet young thing and uses unscrupulous means to force her hand the good guy meanwhile has the decked stacked against him but in the very end of course prevails br br my favorite part this will sound worse than what it was was when good guy got temporarily electrocuted and he danced in black and white that was fantastic animation br br you know it's a good thing i didn't see this as a very little kid i would have been afraid to play outside and squash all those nice bug people you never know what or who is in that grass beneath your feet
<START> in this peculiar movie the themes of the end of days and satan versus jesus are treated in a new fashion jesus doesn't want to open the two last seals and satan is thwarted in his attempt to get another soul into hell armageddon armageddon and turns out to be a company and the book of life is a little hard to open br br what's memorable about this movie are the slanted image out of focus shots and light effects which are effective but sometimes irritating and of course donovan is great as a disillusioned jesus trying to come to terms with what the world and its people have become so do see it if you get the opportunity
<START> having avoided seeing the movie in the cinema but buying the dvd for my wife for xmas i had to watch it i did not expect much which usually means i get more than i bargained for but utter utter cr i like abba i like the songs i have the old lps but this film is just terrible the stage show looks like a bit of a musical but this races along with songs hurriedly following one another no characterisation the dance numbers which were heavily choreographed according to the extras on the dvd are just thrown away with only half the bodies ever on screen the dance chorus of north europeans appear on a small greek island at will while the set and set up of numbers would have disgraced cliff richard's musicals in the sixties meryl see me i'm acting streep can't even make her usual mugging effective in an over the top musical her grand piece 'the winner takes it all' is meryl at the met note to director it should have been shot in stillness with the camera gradually showing distance growing between streep and brosnan some of the singing is awful karaoke on amateur night the camera cannot stop moving like bad mtv one can never settle down and just enjoy the music enthusiasm and characters but what is even worse is how this botched piece of has become the highest grossing film in the uk and the best selling dvd to boot blair campbell and new labour really have reduced the uk to zombies critical faculties anyone
<START> this is a good episode but it's not my favorite a lot of people love it and on a creative level it's brilliant most of the episode has no dialog which is such a cool idea and hush handles the silence really well plus this episode introduces tara who i like a lot but i don't like or the or maggie walsh and they seem to get a lot of screen time in hush plus i don't think the gentlemen are that scary and i get tired of watching the float around sunnydale i know that i'm in the minority but i tend to fast forward parts of hush of course there are other parts of the episode that i think are great so if you're watching on dvd i recommend seeing this episode it really is a classic br br hush revolves around the entire town losing their voices looking demon guys called the gentlemen arrive to gather seven hearts from human victims but if they hear a human scream they die so they steal the voices of everyone in town buffy and the try to figure out what's going on while the also start investigating meanwhile xander comes to realize how much anya means to him and willow meets a fellow witch named tara buffy and finally come face to face while fighting the gentlemen they are both stunned about what they learn he's a commando and she's the slayer in the end buffy saves the day but she now has to deal with her new knowledge of secret life br br really the creativity of hush can't be seen in a basic outline of its plot it's the overwhelming silence of the episode that makes it so great the characters try to communicate in different ways white out boards pantomime obscene finger gestures etc and it all just works really well after a while you forget that there's no dialog because they're all so good at expressing themselves during the talking parts of the episode there are a lot of references to the importance of really hearing each other anya claims that xander won't really talk to her ignores spike and protests and insists that spike move into apartment buffy quickly substitutes the word petroleum for patrolling when she talks to so she won't have to explain her calling and then at the end when buffy and really do learn the truth about each other they sit there with nothing to say it's all pretty cool br br there are a lot of good parts to this episode i love that people keep forgetting that they can't talk buffy and xander both try to use the phone riley can't use the voice recognition thing in the elevator people try to scream it's basically what everyone would really do if they suddenly had no speech and i think it's hilarious that spike has to move in with xander they'll also share an apartment for a little while in season seven xander and spike have a fun bickering childishness that's just hilarious also i like the beginning of tara and willow's relationship tara plays an important role for the rest of the show and she and willow are pretty cute together it's nice to see them just starting out br br on the downside i don't understand how the gentlemen are choosing their victims they just seem to float around dorms and pick random people also i don't like i've never liked him but from hush on i'm pretty much just waiting for angel to come back to town and beat him up finally what happens to olivia after this it seems like we just met her she and have a relationship everything's going fine and then she's suddenly dropped i don't get it br br my favorite part of the episode who are the gentlemen lecture to the the whole scene is wonderful and his over heads are just hilarious he makes some similar looking in season first date pretty much anytime starts drawing monsters it's just gonna be fun
<START> despite looking dated and the bird is my opinion an enjoyable and charming cartoon the artwork isn't extraordinary but good enough this cartoon has no dialogs just sounds and music but this combination works out pretty well the cartoon itself is good funny old fashioned creative entertaining and amusing br br this cartoon also makes the difference because it focus in just 3 characters the little black girl the bird a very strange bird and a hungry lion that wants to have both and for breakfast so he chases them both during most of the cartoon br br i actually find that lion very handsome hilarious and cool i really like that lion that poor lion is so silly and loser that you have to feel sorry for him for me the real enemy is the bird not the lion at one point the lion almost eats it too bad he doesn't get to gulp it because it deserved to be eaten br br back to this animated short there isn't a single dull or boring moment at least for me the only bit that i find stupid is the ending because the bird has a major fight with the lion steals his teeth and puts them on itself other than that i have nothing major to criticize about this aside the fact that the steak should've definitely have gone for the lion and not the bird br br in my opinion this is a very forgotten and underrated little jewel that should definitely get more credit
<START> this usually all sounds a lot better in my head so forgive me for rambling i'm hardly tarantino's biggest fan and will try not to stoop to calling him a which is quite hard i don't like to mock or critique a movie before seeing it so with cautious hesitation i walked to the cinema today to watch br br now to call it a 'rip off of a rip off' would be unfair here tarantino is happy enough to take the title from enzo less than spectacular dirty dozen clone but not it's plot points that he takes from all other genre of movies opens with a nazi officer and his lengthy interrogation against a farmer who is hiding jews in his basement this is such an anti climax in that it's dialogue is stale and outcome signposted a mile off of course one of the hidden jews makes her escape but more of her later we the obviously easily pleased audience are treated to the introduction of lt aldo raine ha ha that name almost sounds like b movie king aldo ray ha ha quentin keep those coming and this character is played by none other than brad dallas pitt sorry dallas was about the only good thing he's ever starred in and with jaw jutting mr jolie treats us to a hound dogged southern drawled smirking nazi killer meanwhile mr tarantino forgets that actual grown ups may be in attendance so assumes that the won't have heard of the 'dirty br br raines consists of john cassavettes looking blood thirsty jewish soldiers all looking to get the big payback on adolf hitler tarantino in all his superior knowledge pays special attention to two of these men by casting his long time best buddy and fellow homage sycophant eli roth as the baseball bat wielding the other man is called hugo and i'll wager more than half the qt fan boys had never heard this name before this movie keep up the good work tarantino you've managed about 6 or 7 so far in the first 15 minutes keep adding them and it may detract from the plot or lack of br br anyhow cutting a long and extremely boring and protracted story short both raine and his men the and the sole survivor from chapter one both have separate plots to kill hitler at the showing of a nazi propaganda movie in a french cinema owned by the fore mentioned survivor now grown up br br more boring and pointless conversations follow two and fro as pitt mugs away at an audience past caring and any genuine suspense leading to the assassination of the most deadly tyrant of all time is thrown away by the directors insistence of placing a 1980's david bowie song in a wwii movie br br my problems and there are many with this movie is the re occurring problem i have with most tarantino product he rarely knows when to either start or stop i don't need 'homage' after 'homage' to get the joke whatever it may be i knew of inglorious bastards enzo castellari aldo ray hugo and the ultimate crime of the entire movie ennio morricone's haunting score from revolver i go to the cinema to see the stars if the best you can do is the dire pitt i'll assume you mr tarantino are the main draw here i don't want the audience directing the movie i pay to see your vision your ideas your creativity not how you can patchwork time and time again endless scenes from endless movies it's high time the fan boys on imdb employed some 'tough love' on your god knows if you don't the studios should br br the tired old argument with tarantino worshippers is well if you can do better do so let me tell you if i was a 46 year old director with the unfortunate pull qt has i'd want to offer you a lot more than a warmed up muddled re hash of better wwii movies than this tripe the directors he attempts to emulate made movies so bad by accident or due to budgetary constraints it's a cop out time and time again to hear his fans campaign his lack of imagination as 'art' i'm sure he's capable of better but after giving him the benefit of the doubt once more and not to mention 2 and a half hours of my life maybe he isn't
<START> the youth in us is a pitch perfect gem i saw this stunning short at this year's 2005 sundance festival the story took me on a profoundly transforming journey the directing by joshua leonard the acting of kelli garner and lukas haas the art direction the cinematography the score every element was true to the bone one can only hope that this exquisite and excruciating film is prelude to more great work from this gifted director br br just as a short film is shown before a feature at sundance commercial movie theatres used a similar format in times past it would be wonderful if miniature masterpieces like the youth in us could reach a wider audience this way
<START> for all losers who gave it negative review its because you probably have sex once in 2 years or you are in ltr with one girl for years and guess what she is going to cheat on you when player like those on that show approach her somewhere off course any male who is not as good as these guys are going to hate them and hate the show and that one chick who thinks this show is meant to mock these guys its more actually how to show clueless man how to pick up woman what these guys are doing it way better then what most man are doing not approaching at all for anybody who has open mind i recommend to read the book the game by neil strauss it deals with similar theme as this show
<START> how does anyone keep on seeing horror movies after this one really this one it's so bad that makes me sick and love horror movies but come on who could had remembered to do such a awful movie it as no history it's only a men who chases a bunch of teenagers because they take something from him and what have they took gold it's typical the movie is boring from the beginning until the end and what is karen black who is a great actress doing in such a ridiculous movie like this but what can i say i think everyone should see it because my opinion is my opinion may be you would like i don't think so but
<START> i don't honestly know what legal or illegal substance they the writers were on when the wrote this horrid piece of tripe br br the cast sucks the plot sucks the editing sucks the whole premise of the movie is that a girl with psychic telekinetic powers comes across a lesbian vampire sorority you just have to be totally out of your head to watch even 1 minute of this br br the only reason i had to watch it it was on the here network as part of a two picture purchase and the movie that came on after it was the real one that i wanted to see i fast forwarded through the whole thing and was just amazed how stupid this movie was in double speed br br do not rent buy or watch this movie the vampires in the movie don't suck as much as the overall movie and production does br br if you want a good lesbian vampire movie the hunger with david bowie susan sarandon katharine deneuve excellent movie to watch own rent in place of this piece of pure sh t
