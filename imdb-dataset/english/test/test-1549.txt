<START> i felt i had to add a comment after seeing the breathless gushing of the other comment i was taken to see this film as a child by my unknowing parents expecting a normal norman wisdom jolly romp comedy instead what you get is this insipid british sex comedy of the worst kind where norman norman plays a swinger aiming to get off with as many as possible absolutely typical of the genre poorly filmed and acted no semblance of a script beyond the worst kind of double entendre and very vague hints of and all seemingly on that special grainy film stock that is reserved for 1960's 1970's british low budget films about the only memorable thing is the annoyingly catchy theme tune which still pops up in my brain after 30 odd years br br finally in the last scene you also get to see norman naked running across the sand and looking frozen i think so anyway at that point my mother hauled me out of the cinema i saw it again many years later and guess what it was still dire br br if you're any fan or take any interest in the little man and his career you'll apply the '10 foot rule to this believe me you do not need to see norman backside
<START> occasionally on talk shows a good topical debate sparks some interesting opinions from the audience unfortunately there is always some desperately sad person seeking acceptance who will end any interesting debate instantly by getting up and saying the proverbial everyone should get along and love each other as they know they are guaranteed to get applause and affirmation as no one would dare disagree br br well they are the same people who marked this film as good why did they do that insecurity anyway that's all i'll say on that matter br br the film it starts of reasonably interestingly so you hope it will build and if like me you've settled in with a nice couple of glasses of wine and some cheese then you will give it even more of a chance simply because you can't be bothered to move br br but then you daydream you wander your mind drifts of onto other things why because the director did too he took his foot off the gas and then he realized so to compensate he hard but then he drifts again and again so do you the story slows the plot thins and almost disappears you even wonder to yourself 'so what happened again ' as you ponder your screen will show nick nolte running around with some supposed purpose but you will have long since cared as to what he is doing and he will appear as nothing more than a screen saver in the background to your day dreaming br br michael moriarty who plays john converse has an amazing ability to speak without moving his lips or indeed his face somewhat like a ventriloquist he must have gone to the nicolas cage school of expressionless facial acting or he was attacked by the phantom botox br br tuesday weld was to play marge converse but instead she played mia farrow to perfection br br in all there are hundreds of thousands of films to see so leave this one to one of the last you see i've just wasted an evening watching it when i could have watched or done something else learn by my mistake nights off relaxing are precious so don't waste one watching this boring tale do anything else dust off that old game of practice gurning for the evening or have an argument with a loved one trim your nose hair get rid of unused files on our laptop it will be time better spent what ever you should choose
<START> unlike one of the reviewers below i don't think that a great and glittering career should lie ahead for the director of this inept and tedious piece of navel gazing whereas it is good to see a british director attempting to break out of the confines of convention only claim for innovative fame rests on the novelty of the triple screen at first you think that this might prove to be an interesting device but its only real contribution to the film is to test your eyesight and patience seeing the same character from 3 different angles in a 2 dimensional movie does not make it more revealing or complex if you can forget the triple screen which granted is very hard to do you then have to deal with the unintentionally hilarious script the audience is beaten into submission by chiche upon chiche about the british class system the film has the political and emotional sophistication of an episode of upstairs and downstairs to sum up the emperor's new clothes and a rather poor outfit too
<START> this movie was so stupid i couldn't believe what i was seeing as i was watching it it was like a huge train wreck i couldn't look away because it was just so horribly awful i can honestly say i've never seen anything this bad in my whole entire life it was so cheesy and the acting was just so deplorable that i just kept thinking this just has to be some kind of a joke right nobody would actually make a movie this crappy on purpose right i really hope this is all just a bad joke and these people don't actually expect people to watch this with a straight face and i really hope the people who were in this movie were doing terrible acting on purpose and don't actually believe that they are good actors the drag queens are pretty funny to watch though and so are the cheesy special effects straight out of a bad 80's sci fi movie br br only watch this if you've already seen every other movie in existence first and there is nothing left to watch at all i would give this a 0 if it were possible
<START> in the end credits of shadows after we read by john cassavetes' some white letters on the screen can be seen the film you have just seen is improvised they say i am always pursuing the fact that words are so important in movies since filmmakers started using them because basically there's no film without a screenplay and many other reasons br br cassavetes pursued the same goal and he believed in the freedom of words shadows is the perfect example it's a film with no real main characters with no real main plot lines it's mostly people in different situations talking yes some of the situations are connected but cassavetes apparently always in a rush to get to the talking uses a fast forward technique when the characters are going somewhere or escaping from someone and are not speaking br br appearances are everything in this movie for example there's a brilliant score full of jazz influences and a lot of fantastic solos and there's one character that says he's a jazz musician and plays the trumpet ben all the characters' names are the same names the actors' however we never see him play the trumpet or jam with a band he doesn't even talk about music and just wanders with his friends around the city they do talk a lot and about anything that's in their minds going from how intelligent each of them are to the hilarious analysis of a sculpture br br shadows is funny in its intellectual references in parts like the one above because these friends are not cultured the only important female character in the film lelia though wants to be an intellectual but again she has one very interesting conversation with an older man at a party about a book she's trying to write and about how to confront reality but nothing to do with being intellectual at that same party a woman is actually making an intellectual statement full of complexity and asks a guy beside her do you agree yes he says but you can tell he doesn't know what she's talking about br br another character a singer hugh talks about his glory days in occasions and we see him perform only once but no references to the musical industry there the focus of cassavetes is the singer's relationship with his manager rupert which most of the time involves chats about trivial stuff and not real 'musical' talks so the trumpet player's important deal in shadows is the time he spends with his friends the intellectual wannabe girl's is her way of handling romantic relationships one of the movie's strong points and the singer's is the bond with his br br the reason why performances are not important in this movie is simple cassavetes needed people who could master improvisation without mattering if they were actually good i believe some of them aren't but they surely know how to improvise in a scene and you can notice how well they do it shadows is not about performers it's about a way of making cinema based on the magic of conversation and there you could say that performances mean something br br that's why in every conversation the camera is like a stalker constantly on the eyes of every character constantly looking for the expressions that come with natural speech there's a scene where the trumpet player and his friends are trying to pick up some girls they are three so each of them sits beside one girl the girls are three two in three different tables they all talk at the same time and the camera shoots through the table and sometimes the friends look at each other while they say whatever they are natural
<START> there are a few aspects to park's movies and in particular wallace gromit that i would say make them so great the first is subtlety and observation the flagship of which is the character of gromit he doesn't speak he doesn't make any noise all he has are his eyes brow and body posture and with these he commands the film park manages to give us everything we need from this silent character through his expression the comedy and the emotion is conveyed through the of movements and it works superbly well br br watching the movie you have to be aware of the entire screen normally you'll be guided to things in the movies the screen won't be cluttered too much there won't be many things to take your eyes away from the main clue or action park seems to need to look the other way with his movies he throws extra content at his audience there's action in the background to the side of the screen even off screen and there's just about always something in the foreground to catch your eye his movies are about multiple viewing and discovery they're layered with jokes and ancillary action br br throughout this film there are layers of things happening on screen jokes in the foreground maybe on a jar label and background shadows that give away action you can imagine that for park the movies has always been an event and the movies he loves are ones which he wants to watch again and again this is what shows in his movies and in through his most beloved characters br br then there are the bizarre and wacky inventions which wallace make something which is reflected in the storyline and the twists and turns of the plot everything is bizarre and off the wall yet it seems so perfectly normal in this world you can imagine that inside park is the mind of wallace br br there's also one more thing that make these movies so unique and that's the modelling and precise hand animation i must admit i was concerned when i knew dreamworks was involved in the making of this movie and i thought that they would bring their computer animation experience to the forefront what i was scared of was wallace gromit becoming cgi entities or at the smallest cgi being used to clean up the feel that the modelling brought to the movie br br not so you can still see and on the characters and far from distracting from the movie this just adds so much real feeling to it and a feeling of physical depth to the characters and the scene on screen br br so what of the movie well i must say that the plot twist was something i had thought about well before the film was in the cinema and it came as no surprise but that did not affect my enjoyment one little bit actually watching the twist unfold and the comic timing of the discovery and reactions was everything and it had me just as sucked in as if it was a thriller yet all the time i was laughing br br watching the movie was fascinating in various ways to see the animation completed how wild the inventions are how wallace is going to get into trouble and gromit get him out where all the cross references are in the movie and where all the jokes are i must admit afterwards talking with my friends i couldn't believe how much i had missed br br there's something different in this movie than with the others there's a new level of adult humour in here and i don't mean rude jokes although there are a couple that are just so british you can't help laughing i mean jokes that simply fly over kids heads but slap adults in the face the kind you are used to seeing come out of somewhere like pixar this just adds even more appeal to the movie br br okay though let me try and be a bit negative here i didn't notice the voices in this movie you know how you usually listen to the actors and see if you can recognise them well i was just too wrapped up in the movie to care or to notice who they were okay that's not negative let me try again the main plot wasn't as strong and gripping as i'd expected and i found myself being caught up in the side stories and the characters themselves again that's not a bad thing the film was just so much rich entertainment br br i honestly can't think of a bad thing to say about this movie probably the worst thing i could say is that the title sequence at the end is quite repetitive until the final title really that's the worst i can say br br the story is a lot of fun well set up well written well executed there's lot's of fantastic characters in here not just wallace gromit there's so much happening on screen so many references and jokes check out the dresses of lady cheese jokes everywhere jokes for all the family the characters are superbly absorbing and you'll find that you've taken to them before you realise there's just so much in this movie for everyone br br there's so much i could say and write about but i know it will quickly turn into a backslapping exercise for park and aardman it would also just turn into a series of this bit was really funny and there's a bit when and what i would rather do is tell you that this is a superb movie to go see it and to experience the whole thing for yourselves i will say though that the bunnies are excellent
<START> just read through the other comments here and was a little surprised to find that no one had said anything about the acting or plot br br richard pryor and eddie murphy can both deliver an amazing stand up comedy show great actors they are not enough about that br br as for the plot oh man every time the movie tries to fool you into believing the good guys are going to lose you know those scenes what the good guys loses oh i see it was just a trick it's done so terribly bad you can spot it a mile away br br it had 2 or 3 funny moments but not enough to save the day br br it's a little silly that these comments has to be 10 lines now a lot of people will fill it up with crap for it to be eligible being brief is an art
<START> as someone who has read all of baroness books and seen most of the movies based on them i must say that the 1980's version with anthony andrews and jane seymour was better than this it was better written and stuck more to the spirit of the story than this one which seemed to go out of its way to involve people getting shot this new adaptation is less light hearted yet does not have as much depth either although there is some good acting the actors did not have much to work with nice costumes though
<START> this film is likely to be a real letdown unless you understand the circumstances under which it was made the were chosen to be cast in the film version of a play that was not originally written for them they are sort of force fitted into the roles ironically it might have been funnier if it had used different actors who did not have such high expectations placed upon them instead it has been forever enshrined as part of a canon to which it really doesn't deserve to belong
<START> what can i say about ocean's twelve who thought that it would ever come to this a gigantic mess that loses itself halfway and can't retrace i found myself amazed at how bad this really was really i have never seen the ending properly because this film is just insufferable i'm a huge fan of the first but this is a lame excuse for a sequel br br what was the point of the heist if they were going to give the money back the movie is just boring and so drag along that i can't ever sit through this it really is bad just stay as far repeat far away as possible from this movie it's worthless
<START> when i think about tv movies i always think of this film i have watched it a few times on sky movies it was terrible br br its been a long time since i have seen this film was just browsing and came across it on here s br br a linda flemming goes on holiday with her son william flemming at this holiday resort kinda place they meet up with paul johnson taxi driver owns a bar and kathy johnson br br its like a weird romantic thing william starts to fall for kathy and paul falls for linda br br some guy passes out in a street he has some mark on his arm joseph joseph was a deep sea diver who on some dive saw a light or something and converted to religion says he will take care of this person there is a gap in my memory then there is a wide out break of the virus i think linda offers her help to come up with a cure kathy gets infected william notices a mark on kathy's arm with the virus also does joseph br br paul says some lines to joseph then joseph stumbles away the next time you see joseph he is cured some how that information is used to cure the infected then there is a beach party the end
<START> just reading why this show got canceled makes me rather steamed this was a favorite of mine as a kid and i always watched it when it came on no matter how many times i saw the episode sure the effects were not great but they were also not horrible either they did a fairly good job with the costume and it had the nice 70's vibe to it that is always enjoyable to see and hear as the music was also very 70's it did not really have any villains from the comics but then most comic book live show adaptations had none to very few actual super villains from the comics powers were a bit different here too he had his spidey sense and he could climb walls but he was not nearly as strong as the spider man of the comics he was super strong though as i do remember an episode where he broke into a room by breaking the door knob off he just was not the car hurler that the one from the comic book can be the show was set in los angelos so there were not as man buildings to swing from but they did okay with the web it is nice that this show actually has the web shooters and not organic shooters of the movie i love the movies but part of me wishes they would start over and do the more smarty pants spidey that has the mechanical web shooters this show had a good star as peter parker and he was okay as spider man it is nice to see a spidey who does not basically live in the slums like he does in the movies neither this show nor the movie though has a spider man that is quick with the insult like the one in the comic still this show was fun without being as corny as the batman show
<START> this movie is one of the worst movie i have ever seen in my life i waste my time on this i watched this movie completely as i took it a punishment for me i wonder how darshan could make such a movie it doesn't have any it feels he just shoot scenes and then joined them in some editing software music is of course good but the film doesn't need so many unwanted songs looks fake and i wonder what role does celina has in the movie bobby deol is good at least he can act patel needs to take some acting lessons rather than taking off his shirts in almost all the scenes the end was the most pathetic br br i watched boom boom after watching 300 the movie you guys can really imagine what i felt about this bollywood movie br br i really respect bollywood but please directors and producers get real not everything is fantasy
<START> zoey 101 is basically about a girl named zoey who transfers into an all boys boarding school during the first year that they integrate girls into it that raw plot line is i'll admit a pretty good idea although this show was meant for children a five year old could probably point out its fatal flaws first zoey is a clichÃ© character her being super popular super attractive super smart and there s nothing wrong with her no girl is like that it feels like the show was put the spotlight on jamie lynn spears and increase her fame dana who appeared at the beginning of the first season is just plain mean however in my opinion she was probably the most realistic character of them all which is sad seeing that dana is never nice nicole is too peppy and acts like a complete airhead but mysteriously gets straight a's lola seems to be able to fool anything with her emmy deserving acting skills quinn is supposed to be super smart and although she is able to create the most unrealistic things she is also made out to be weird and she never gets any guys although she is both beautiful and smart while zoey lola and nicole get guys and they're all beauty and no personality chase and michael are very similar and i even sometimes get them confused logan is unrealistically rich and hands out millions like they're dollars nobody's that rich i've also noticed that every character on the show is mean to that stacy girl who does nothing but act nice to them that's not funny that's mean and it just influences young girls to act mean to totally nice people finally the school itself adds the frosting to the unreal cake by providing the students with 5 star amenities such as a scenic location sushi bar hot lounge equipped with free soda machines pool jacuzzi movie theater and the allowance for boys and girls to freely go into the other dorm rooms at most boarding schools if a boy were to go into a girl's dorm or vice versa they would be expelled br br in conclusion zoey 101 was poorly written and should have spent a few more years in the drafting process
<START> this movie was fabulous it is definitely a top 5 hitchcock film the directing and camera shots are nearly flawless aside from the dog scene when he licks the guys hand clearly in slow motion the plot is well written and realistic it was very believable that an innocent man could fall into a trap like that br br i would rate bruno as hitchcocks second most interesting character of course bates is first robert walker plays a very believable maniac he didnt overact the part which made it believable much the same how perkins didnt overact his part overall this is an excellent movie an absolute must see for any hitchcock fans br br br br
