<START> i waited a long time to finally see what i thought was going to be a fun caper flick and was shocked to discover shoddy direction awkward dialogue a lackluster pace unmotivated slapstick gags and an overall coarseness that permeated the film throughout just not funny the sets looked cheap the costumes by the usually excellent are garish and distracting even the title song is annoying the whole children's book characters doesn't come close to representing the married couple whose life is turned upside down when he loses his job for a film that seems to aim a dart at the unfairness of welfare and unemployment systems the filmmakers have no problem in being unfair themselves allowing hispanic black and gay stereotypes played at such a cruel level the look of the film resembles any episode of love american style this is not a compliment tacky seventies fashions abound in this world of white collar theft that only lends an air of implausibility to every situation outside of a clever initial idea and two capable stars in jane fonda and george segal this dated exercise in social commentary comes off as forced and mean spirited to minorities especially to gay people if you want a better caper film you're better off with the hot rock with george segal and robert redford or what's up doc with ryan o'neal and barbra streisand now that's funny
<START> spoilers ahead mel has got it going on from the opening credits to the ending credits this movie has straight laughs dave shows why he is a comedic force cary carries the movie most of the time but the supporting cast fills in strong when the plot is drawn away from robin hood right from the beginning this movie proclaims it's self not to be taken seriously if you took a time machine and gave the characters thoughts of modern day antics you would get this movie what makes this movie special you say throughout the movie you see and walk beside each other becoming great friends as robin hood's sidekicks but it is never told or fails to grasp that he is black until the crowd says a black sheriff replays he's black that is a timeless scene simple one of the most movies of our time
<START> this outing of knotts includes one of his best sidekicks ever frank welker welker makes the film knotts and welker compete for the laughs and both receive plenty knotts works for a small no where town where the city is being run by some of the most ignorant officials when things go wrong the city fathers allow knotts to take the fall frank character befriends knotts and together they stumble together to clear up the mess and knott's good name this film shows the usual knott's scared to death character that made him famous for years on television and film this may have been knotts' last good outing when you have an extra 90 minutes get a good old fashioned laugh a great icon don knotts
<START> this film is about a mysterious love letter that turned 4 people's love life upside down br br the idea of the film is interesting and the film could have been funny however this film is simply what a romantic comedy should not be the characters are inadequately introduced at first so it gets so confusing the supporting characters come and go without adequate reasons as if they exist just for one particular scene and then vanish into thin air the pacing is awfully slow that it makes 90 minutes seem more like 180 minutes br br it could have been romantic and funny but this film spectacularly failed to do either
<START> surprisingly effective british drama about two very different people who find common ground and in particular the of one of them an embittered spike type youth mcavoy with md is placed in a home for the disabled and quickly makes friends with a youth robertson with cerebral palsy robertson has never known anything outside of the home but mcavoy has and he is bound and determined to get back into the real world together they manage to do just that in this funny and heartwarming and often heartbreaking tale of inner strength overcoming physical shortcomings the two leads are terrific especially robertson who must surely have spent some time studying the disabled to pull off this tricky role he appears in almost every scene and acts up an absolute storm to anyone who doesn't know they might think he really has cb highly recommended
<START> i just saw this at the philadelphia film festival it was the most wonderful movie the best i've seen in quite a while the enticing character of is an open exploring and as remarked in the film love filled person portrayed by the beautiful camille the accompanying music is soothing and transporting a balm to the soul br br each character seems to be conflicted in some way and their interactions w conflicts make for a great story the tale told by a k hangal as the old man was most magically done i wanted it to go on and on br br that hari seemed to remember his place throughout added get power to the story a refreshing change to the bubble headed plots of many modern writers br br all and all an excellent film go see
<START> so often these lifetime flicks are one dimension with over the top characterizations and performances and with contrived plot lines and climaxes which are intended to trade any semblance of reality for drama br br but most of all many of these flicks provide characters where it's difficult to feel a trace of sympathy or empathy for even the good guy good gal characters much less the bad ones br br however here the performance were all good the characters realistic and the relationships among the three leads as well as the ex husband father and the two females rang true throughout br br the mother's boyfriend was portrayed as being about halfway in age between mother and daughter and the actors were age appropriate to this in term of their actual ages none of the characters was portrayed at an extreme either all good or all bad and all rang true br br without in any way condoning his allowing the relationship with his prospective stepdaughter to advance to the level which it did you can still feel some sympathy for him without blame br br neither mother nor daughter were perfect neither good nor bad but simply two individuals whose relationship seemed realistic and not contrived by the script writer br br lifetime flicks even those which begin with some semblance of normality often end with a deranged character brandishing a carving knife or such other stories seem to need to provide the everyone lived happily ever after close br br this film presented a realistic premise story and resolution from start to finish a welcomed variation to the norm of this genre
<START> wild rebels is fun in a bad way but also frustrating due to the actual good or at least workable elements in the story it deals with a race car driver steve who gets mixed up in a group of bikers called satan's angels who hang around a lot until they decide to rob a bank meanwhile also gets recruited by the cops to report back to them what the angels are up to and where they'll rob next it's not even that the film is really too 'dated' though it does of course carry the significantly crude and stupid music in the film from the band on stage in one scene to performing if you could call that drek that to the regular generic score br br it's just that there's not more care taken by the filmmaker into putting a little more logic direction and better actors for the parts as it is i didn't have a major disliking towards the film as i did with the but it almost left me a little indifferent to it all too what could come through as being unpredictable only comes through with stupid things like the name of the florida town ho ho so it's not completely un worthy then of its mystery science theater 3000 status as of late the commentary is good on the movie even if once or twice i almost wanted to hear what the characters on screen were saying in case it might have some worth wild rebels might be more of a good time if you've got a six pack and low expectations but as it is i wouldn't watch it again
<START> i've read all the dave novels and consider james lee burke to be my favorite contemporary fiction writer i've also visited new iberia and much of to be able to better visualize the setting in most of these books needless to say i greatly anticipated seeing in the electric mist especially since i thought tommy lee jones would be terrific as br br i was greatly disappointed the story was very choppy the interplay with the ghosts of confederate dead was shallow and lost the impact and nobility it added to the book and tommy lee jones was doleful expressionless and difficult to understand as dr the best way to describe this forgettable film is to add my ditto to an earlier user comment that this movie was like one of those old made for tv movies i expected jill st john or cameron mitchell to show up at any time br br the location settings were accurate and the photography at times captured the essence of the steamy smoky juke joints and eerie above ground graveyards of south louisiana too bad the story's disjointed presentation and tommy lee's sub par performance interfered with the unique mood and spicy zest of the region br br next to final comment in the novels dave nickname is streak because of the distinct streak of silver gray hair on one side of his head similar to how the sopranos' paulie walnuts would appear if he were seen only in profile tommy lee had no such streak in this film probably because the editors are james lee burke fans and they airbrushed the streak out after witnessing mr jones's poor imitation of dave br br final comment while i generally find alec baldwin to be pompous and obnoxious in most roles he was by far a better in heaven's prisoners than tommy lee was in in the electric mist also heaven's prisoners is much more interesting and exciting with uniformly believable performances and more evocative atmosphere than this new movie br br in the electric mist is okay to watch when one feels like out and there's nothing better on tv but then so are infomercials
<START> it was sad that committed lasted only two weeks in dallas theaters i thought this movie had a lot going for it the script was funny full of subtle emotional shifts and it had a good message the acting was great everyone did a superb job especially with the script's subtleties heather graham not only has beautiful eyes she has expressive eyes for that matter all the actors were attractive why it didn't do well in its theatrical release i don't know other than the studio didn't seem to have much of a push behind it but it deserved to do better and i hope it does well on video it's certainly one of my favorites for the first half of 2000
<START> the next karate kid in my opinion is an excellent martial arts flick i thought that eric chris conrad and julie hilary swank looked good in their prom attire to me ned michael was a real bully this was because he got julie in trouble with principal wilkes eugene boles if you ask me colonel dugan michael ironside was a pure a this was because he was a very harsh man who wouldn't tolerate mistakes my favorite parts were the prom and the showdown between julie and the alpha elite in conclusion i highly recommend this smash hit to all of you who like martial arts flicks or are fans of hilary swank
<START> this is a plot driven movie and extremely entertaining nothing startling or original within the plot but crucially it moves along at a great pace and therefore keeps your attention i didn't really notice the acting which i guess is a good thing john mills was fine but did seem to take everything in his stride somewhat considering how his life was falling apart around him he would be clumped on the head stand up 20 seconds later dust himself down and carry on as if nothing had happened a minor quibble in a film with a strong story authentic locations and a plot that continually keeps you guessing right up to its conclusion
<START> yet another foreign war movie that puts hollywood to shame real in the same proportions that hollywood productions such as harts war and are unreal a moving story backed up by strong acting and great film making
<START> i liked most of this film as other reviews mentioned it has a good cast the plot is interesting enough all in all it is fun to watch br br but the ending i feel is completely botched it left me bewildered yes you expect people crossing and double crossing each other in this sort of movie but quadruple crossing well if it's justified by the plot then why not br br but that's the bad part there's completely no need for it after a certain point it's all scheming with completely no meaning here comes the spoiler after the airport scene enrico and his accomplices already have the money i couldn't understand the need for the rest of the scam is it all necessary just to rub nose in the fact that he's been fooled i don't buy it br br so 6 out of 10 for 3 4 of the film and 2 out of 10 for the ending
<START> sen's 15 park avenue is a film about nature of reality br br a young delusional girl prone to imagining things and hearing voices possibly out of sheer boredom is taken to be schizophrenic by her educated father and control freak educated elder step sister controlled pitied and treated like an invalid even if out of love and affection she has ghost of a chance to develop as a normal person when a boy offers to marry her her father and step sister passionately try to convince him against taking such a step a traumatic experience caused primarily due to her sheltered existence finally takes her across the line of no return and she lives full time in a delusional world of her own br br the family and society around her are intolerant of her delusions and want to suppress them with electric shock therapy anything even though they all have delusions of one kind or other of their own br br her mother doesn't see the irony in allowing a ghost buster to treat her of the delusions her step sister is a professor of physics teaching among other things quantum mechanics a subject in which a stream of experts accept parallel multi universes and many more dimensions in space than the 3 we see a friend recounts with admiration an experience with a holy person claiming to hear hallucinatory voices far away george w bush has real or fake delusions of weapons of mass destruction and is allowed to invade iraq br br as some viewers have already pointed out sen shied away from attacking the mother of all delusions mainstream religions which is a pity br br in other words accepted reality is what a majority or an influential minority believe in that's been the case since the beginning and lot more powerful people than in the film among them bruno and galileo have suffered as a consequence br br the film's controversial and difficult ending was necessary to show it's a film about nature of reality and not the case study of a schizophrenic girl br br all the cast have given great performances but shabana azmi and konkona sen sharma have excelled sen has produced an outstanding philosophical film
