<START> i got this for my birthday in a box set under the name broke skull well after watching one on the dvd and being pleasantly surprised i popped this sucker in it was worse than i had expected and i didn't expect much this movie is basically a convoluted story about a guy who dies and comes back to life with the mob and other bull crap there was some interesting ideas in this that were never followed up on now everybody has been saying there was a lot of gore can somebody tell me were i saw a bad effect of a head being crushed brain tissue or something and blood coming from the penis area two times i have to say the the part were the guy gets his man hood bitten off made me squirm that was the only good thing about this movie and that gay sex scene was just thrown in there for no reason the acting in this was atrocious really it blew that asian chick was annoying then the annoying mexican boyfriend who comes in to just be killed i say if you get this in a box set that is fine but don't spend any money on it at all
<START> outside sweden you are not expected have seen this movie happy you the cast includes several actors that are important part of modern the swedish movie history and still br br seems like peter dalle only had a an idea lasting for about 20 minutes robert gustafson is totally misused in this movie trying to copy a younger by the way is the only actor fulfilling the expectations br br credit that can be given is for the photo splendid idea using black and white music is ok br br but over all it's a waste of god actors and the time of the audience
<START> what can you say after watching this movie that is if you had the interest and concentration to see it to the end i was left speechless due to the amazingly dull story annoying situations where one american equals that of a fifty or more iraqis and boring dialogue i think that if this movie has something to teach it probably goes like don't screw with us or we'll come and kick your butts plus this film truly encourages and votes for killing masses of foreigners in the name of war i got the image of tackling chess pieces out of the playing board except now it's fast and there's not so much thinking and on top of that no character there has any spirit then how can you care at all what happens to any of them excluding war movie fans with no taste i wouldn't recommend this to anyone there should always be something more interesting to do
<START> this is without question the worst screen adaptation of a stephen king work if not the worst movie of all time this is an unbelievably horrible movie i fell asleep on this stinker several times and i wasn't tired i would rather shoot myself than sit through it again
<START> i just picked this up in a decent if not outstanding dvd version for one dollar at wal mart br br run out and buy it br br i'm fairly sure that this version is the short incomplete version released against the animator's wishes in the late fifties but even so at a buck it's an incredible bargain br br this film was syndicated in small chunks as a serial to local tv stations in the early 60s for the kid's shows that almost every station ran on weekday afternoons in those days mr bill and bozo monty's gang channel 4 sc and captain grady channel 13 asheville nc which is where i saw it it made such an impression on twelve or so old me that i immediately recognised it when i spotted it in wal mart tonight and grabbed it br br wonderful you should get it
<START> let me say first of all that i spent a total of about two minutes of my life on a skateboard before i realized i was totally uncoordinated i've always thought it was cool watching cats that know how to get extreme on 'em do their stuff but i've never been a skateboarder and have never really followed the sport that being said i thought this was a very informative and interesting documentary some reviewers have said that these dudes were sort of waving their own flag a bit but what the hell it looks to me that these guys probably deserve as much credit as anyone for giving the skateboarding world a jolt and they've provided some good footage of their innovations to back it up it's great the way viewers are allowed to see these guys both then and now and the footage they shot while they were teens growing up in california provides some interesting nostalgia that goes a bit beyond the sport of skating i never would have realized where extreme skating came from but this films sort of ties all the pieces together and gives us an informative documentary i'm sure it's at least a tad biased but aren't all documentaries worth watching for anyone interested in the sport or as in my case anyone who grew up in the 1970's
<START> the movie begins almost achingly slowly a romance yawn that seems to ramble off course all part of the plan then roughly one hour into this solemn movie is the feast it's worth paying attention to that first hour the feast is still solemn but humorous suddenly the withdrawn and slightly petty characters come to life and everyone you and the characters leave feeling enriched by the experience br br women will love this christians of all sorts will enjoy the profound faith demonstrated by the characters not my favorite movie of all time no dinosaurs or laser beams after all but definitely a movie i am happy to have seen not to be missed br br jim
<START> this is a pale imitation of the die hard franchise that just sucks the low ambitions of the movie are clearly on display when the terrorists hold the vice president hostage and he has to call the white house to beg them to transfer some money in most movies of this genre the president is kidnapped or held hostage because after all he or she is the most powerful person in the country with finger on the nuclear button etc etc would most americans have really been worried if dick cheney had been kidnapped the honest answer is probably not why the terrorists would choose a stanley cup final to carry out their operation and why despite many explosions around them the audience inside the hockey stadium is oblivious to the situation are unanswerable questions let's just say this film is really hokey not hockey those who liked the film and found it to be exciting should get a life
<START> oh my god what a story this movie is very good and it had to be god who had this happen you did a awesome job the acting was really good you picked the right actors for sure this movie is so good i am really glad you made this because if you had not then i would have never ever known about this story because i am not a big golf fan and i think it is kinda boring so thank you i really enjoyed it and that is why i gave the movie a 10 10 i liked shia labouf too he was perfect for the roll of i hope most of that stuff you put in there was true also oh and some parts were funny and others i was just really happy
<START> luscious candace bergen as a prim victorian beauty kidnapped by sean connery as a devilish desert how can you go wrong how oh let me count the ways earthy primitive sean connery exactly the right man to tame a brittle classy beauty like candace is well underwhelming in the role that's because instead of having dialog about the real issues you are a woman i am a man he has to babble nonsense about the will of allah and the wind blows destiny across the desert sands john milius a director known more for the worship of naked male bodies and brute military force than any insight or interest in conventional human relationships has a maddening way of cutting away from his desert lovers every time it looks like candace might get kissed instead of watching nature take its course with two fabulously attractive people in a picturesque landscape we are treated to endless and i do mean endless shots of brian keith flashing his walrus sized choppers and delivering gritty sermons on the joys of being teddy roosevelt i have nothing against teddy roosevelt but watching him test out his new rifle or make speeches about the heroic death of a big bear just doesn't excite me the way the love story between candace bergen and sean connery would have if it had ever actually gotten underway the weird thing is milius spends most of his time building up characters and story lines that have no resolution two little children in the story both get more screen time than she does there's no humor no chemistry no sizzle in any of the things that happen to her in the desert unless you think it's funny that after weeks of galloping around on horseback her hair is still perfect br br the only real moment in the story is when late at night candace bergen shakes her little daughter out of a sound sleep on soft cushions and says we must escape the little girl turns over and without missing a beat replies but mother i was sleeping that one line sums up what's really missing from the story no danger suspense or sizzle in the basic story line of a cultivated lady in captivity she and her children are both so snug and well cared for that it's hard to believe anyone is worked up about their fate br br mind you if candace herself had said the line it might have worked better if the tension came from her enjoyment of her captivity or her delight at being in the arms of sean connery and her guilt about all the trouble being caused by her abduction then the story would have had some tension but milius makes the odd assumption that the audience is just as worked up as he is over whether teddy roosevelt will get the chance to prove his manhood three thousand miles away in the end the pretty lady and her children don't seem to matter worth a damn to him and since they're at the center of the story the whole thing seems rather dry and endless like the burning desert sands
<START> don't get me wrong i really love the arena martial arts genre and i get more and more surprised over how many films like this there are out there this one is one of those and it's not even close to be one of the best with mathias hues in it i thought it would be good he can't save this movie though and to be honest he wasn't very good either just don't pay attention to what other people say the fighting scenes in this movie are not good at all i really know what i'm talking about since i have seen so many movies like this there are also a bunch of scenes that have absolutely nothing to do with the plot whatsoever i guess they added these only to make the movie last a little bit longer in addition to manifest the bad guy as bad like we didn't know that already
<START> this movie will send chills down your spine even if you don't understand german i first saw this in my german class in high school and found it for 5 at my local wal mart i've seen it at least 20 more times since this being only a couple years ago and it's great to watch on a movie night the plasticized bodies are mostly real used from body worlds this movie was an out lash to that a german dr nicknamed dr death began human bodies for display and now body worlds is a touring deal right now in chicago il many people were opposed to this and so a great german horror movie was made i personally love this movie and would recommend it for all who like thriller slasher films
<START> i own this movie and i love canadian movies but hire an actress like rose i don't understand she is completly useless in this movie just a name that's all the rest of the cast is good good enough to make this little thriller work i was surprise by the plot which is not the first time it was used but those unknown actors did very well even i'm not a big fan of his but i liked him in this movie if you got the chance to see it go for it
<START> i enjoyed this movie extremely it was the last great mario van peebles movie i know of it had a hip hop old west flavor to it big daddy kane and tone loc had major parts it shouldn't have won any oscars but it was enjoyable all the same
<START> spoiler in fifth paragraph this was an amazingly frank uh huh uh huh picture for 1955 otto preminger and carlyle productions took a chance by making it the motion picture association of america balked at a film that openly shows a junky jabbing a syringe full of heroin into his arm frank sinatra took a chance both on playing an addicted musician and at falling flat on his face in a role that required at least twice as much acting as he'd ever done all in all these gambles paid off the movie is a classic though it's not perfect br br nelson novel may be great but it has far too much going on to fit comfortably into a two hour movie 'the man with the golden is minutes and often feels much longer however in my opinion it's not just frankie machine sinatra that makes the film but the other characters and their sub plots all involving frankie ultimately it's not just frankie who has the addiction everyone and everything seems to be dependent on him and he feels it keenly when the pressure gets to be too much the drums start pounding on the soundtrack and frankie steps across the street with his well dressed friend louie br br it's an exaggeration to say that frank sinatra's music career was ever really in the doldrums but in the early 50's he was in limbo between his days touring with big bands and the las vegas era 'from here to established him as a serious actor and his career as a singer rebounded as well but 'the man with the golden was still a significant challenge the whole show sinks or swims with his performance he pulls it off with such skill that for several minutes at a time i forgot i was watching frank sinatra he must have known junky musicians and exploited that knowledge to the utmost br br set side by side with billy wilder's masterpiece 'the lost weekend' there is more emphasis on the sociological causes of addiction in 'the man with the golden arm ' whereas don ray milland in 'the lost weekend' seems to struggle mostly against himself frankie machine is beset by external forces and he takes refuge in the needle neither approach is wholly right or wrong mostly because addiction is impossible to fully explain but it seems like this film might have benefited from a little more insight into frankie's internal struggle br br spoiler one of the problems i have with this film is the clichÃ©d reliance on quitting cold turkey i realize that 'the man with the golden was probably setting the trend rather than following it but that doesn't make it any better in the beginning of the movie frankie has to all appearances kicked his habit with the help of a doctor and a treatment facility of some sort naturally the drama of the film requires that he but i found the all american ideal that a man has to face his problems alone or maybe with the help of a good woman out of place here going cold turkey and riding off into the sunset with kim novak seemed too unrealistic the end of 'the lost weekend' was similar but in my opinion was a little less rosy
