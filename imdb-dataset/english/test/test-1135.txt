<START> br br the kind of movie that demands too much from the audience yet to disappoint most of them i think of the mexican people who either in an attempt to support mexican movies or willing to see a film casting top mexican stars saw it half of the people went out of the theater when i went to watch it it's definitely not the kind of movie one could expect i think too of the people from other countries who dared spending 2 hours seeing it till the very end what a piece of crap in order to understand de un one has to be mexican and one has to be familiar with the low middle classes or even better be part of them there's nothing accidental in this movie the family is and has what many families in mexico at least share one has to see it with a wide open mind to accept it entirely it's not the kind of movie that you fully understand after you watch it the older brother wouldn't let anyone sit on his red couch the sister is staying no matter how she wants to leave the younger brother is going to an excursion and all he cares about is the yellow radio the mother has to prepare the breakfast for the family no matter how tense and unbearable the situation is the father came back after who knows how long allowing the mother to live a night of passion that somehow turns out to be momentary and ends up by repeating all the attitudes of his sons the stories around the house are surrealistic and so is the movie a travestite looking for his penis a factory worker and his attempt of suicide by the kisses of his girlfriend a fat man riding his bicycle after a interesting conversation about homosexuals with his sister wife mother the music doesn't pretend too much but it achieves a lot not more than a snare drum cymbal a some strings thanks good a movie like this was done and released br br one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it br br
<START> the main character is a whiny irresponsible study of how to throw yourself a pity party she loses it at the drop of a hat acts pathetic is schizophrenic and left me wondering why on earth she doesn't understand why these 'friends' of hers haven't called her in three years get a clue sister you're a juvenile mess i couldn't stand her or the friends i never felt connected to any of the characters to make the entire movie even more unbearable someone went far out of their way to put the world's most hideous collection of and knitted hats in existence on film for all of eternity this alone should warrant someone be put on wardrobe probation for a decade br br the acting wasn't awful but not really believable either and in the end the only thing that i did care about was the two hours i'm never going to get back don't waste your time go catch up on a dentist appointment instead
<START> minor spoilers br br if there's something in the world of silent clowns that puzzles me it is that charley chase never got his well deserved break through in the movies oh well maybe it isn't that strange really inasmuch as he never starred in any full length features but when i think of it such an explanation makes it all only more mysterious because why the heck didn't chase get any offers to play the leading lead in features one explanation is that his character no matter how amusing was simply too realistic to suit a longer story without the burlesque elements that chaplin keaton lloyd langdon and other comedians possessed it can be assumed that the comedy he made and which worked so well for twenty minutes would get repetitive after a few more reels i don't quite buy this though as chase's gag construction is magnificent and could i believe at its best maintain the interest of viewers alone for a longer period at least i am tempted to think so when mighty like a moose runs the show br br mr moose isn't extraordinary handsome and mrs moose is hardly a classic beauty he possesses the truly biggest front teeth of any human being on the planet and she has a remarkably large nose both of them takes plastic surgery without the other's knowledge and when they meet by accident just a little later he doesn't recognize his wife and she doesn't recognize her husband a number of hilarious misunderstandings begin with many clever gags all the way through i don't think i'll reveal anything further to make the viewing more enjoyable for you because if you're a fan of silent comedies or even if you aren't mighty like a moose offers so many memorable moments within such a short time that i would look upon it as a downright shame not to see it silly indeed but no less extremely funny
<START> my 5 year old daughter is very into the barbie series of movies i've had mixed feelings about that not wanting her to buy into the whole barbie doll image of things and recognizing that the movies are a marketing ploy to convince young girls to buy more dolls and make more money for mattel this morning though she asked me to watch this movie with her and it being a lazy saturday morning and with not much else to do i agreed i don't know if the movies have been made to help market the dolls which seem to be losing their appeal a bit from what i've heard or if the dolls are there to market the movies or more likely a bit of both but whichever is the case i have to admit somewhat to my surprise this wasn't half bad br br it's a fun and imaginative story full of magical places and people and memorable characters both good and evil essentially played by barbie has to find a way to build a wand of light to reverse the evil spells of the wizard who among other things has turned her sister into a flying horse and her parents into stone the animation here was pretty good not disney calibre if one thinks of disney as the standard to aspire to but generally pretty good and while the movie is obviously tailored to young girls rather than middle aged men i still found there were enough twists and turns to make me wonder how it was all going to turn out it's true that there were some holes in the story or at least some logical inconsistencies but again one must remember the target audience who wouldn't really think of such things this is an all around decent family movie 7 10
<START> 20 years later and this movie still has echoes of its greatness floating around never has a movie surpassed valley girl's incredible soundtrack the movie completely encapsulated the 80's to such a perfect degree that it could only be realized this many years later nicolas cage at his best a movie that just has so much character to it that it makes you realize how sad hollywood has become as far as quality goes the special edition dvd is loaded with tons of extras and well worth it to purchase it as you'll have plenty of material to sift through for sure
<START> no this has nothing to do with the sitcom seinfeld or its eccentric and hilarious character cosmo kramer in reality kramer vs kramer is a fine drama movie without a doubt one of the finest of its kind and one of the greatest movies ever i'm glad that it won more oscars than apocalypse now because it really deserved such glory br br kramer vs kramer is an excellent film so well made and so perfectly balanced that i wouldn't change anything about it in any way there is nothing wrong with the film it's film making of the highest quality and it stands the test of time too not only it doesn't look any dated but also its cultural impact is long lasting and its realistic story remains just as significant as it was when it came out in 1979 a timeless classic they don't make movies like this today br br this movie is dramatic realistic simple but brilliant intense powerful sweet and even tragic and depressing sometimes yet it has fine humor as well it has no special effects but who cares this is not the movie or place to discuss such thing for a movie like this such thing would be pointless and absolutely unnecessary br br the story is very interesting the actors's chemistry is just perfect all of the actors are great but the 3 main ones are the very best dustin hoffman a brilliant actor has his greatest performance ever here as the lovable but distant workaholic ted kramer meryl streep is great as ted's wife joanna and cute little justin henry is terrific as the loving but sometimes stubborn billy son of ted and joanna br br the soundtrack is all instrumental and wonderful the opening song by the guitarist frederic hand is brilliant the rest of the soundtrack is mostly antonio vivaldi's classical music and is simply dazzling br br this motion picture has also an incredible development of the characters see the character ted kramer a workaholic who becomes an amazing father after being left with no choice but to take care of his son trying to adjust these new responsibilities with his job after being left by his wife joanna with this ted learns about the most beautiful things in life but also realizes how though life is with the problems in his job and the return of joanna who wants the custody of their son but even joanna changes for better and the ending is an unexpected surprise when one sees this for the first time br br this movie has also some though things such as courtroom scenes where both ted and joanna face brutal character assassinations unleashed by the lawyers another though thing to see is when poor billy falls off a jungle gym with his toy a plane and gets seriously injured on his face but then again the scene is very well made and what comes next is very intense his father runs quickly and crosses numerous blocks ignoring the traffic to take his son to the hospital br br overall this is a movie which is a good lesson of life br br this should definitely be on top 250
<START> having grown up a mormon and grappled with the church's bigotry towards blacks they were not allowed to hold the church's priesthood when i was a member i wasn't aware of the organizations policy of gay men and women until after i left the church in 1966 i was 20 i was stunned when i learned that friends who were gay were excommunicated even after serving on missions latter days exposes the mormon's persecution of gay members the film is long overdue it does an excellent job of showing how the two lead males come to terms with one another while managing to grow up and develop more fully as individuals latter days has great heart wonderful original music and an added touch of class from jacqueline bisset the film brilliantly tells the story of an individual who leaves behind the confines of organized religion and reclaims his very soul
<START> i love so much about this movie the music the cinematography the acting the story and all the mormon clichÃ©s just because they are clichÃ©s doesn't mean they aren't true this is not perfect it is a movie after all though are held in well lit rooms with nice big desks and chairs it was totally appropriate to portray it as the dark cold scene they did in this film i also liked the scene with the angel waiting at the bus stop smoking a cigarette i thought that was so cool i mean i believe that angels do watch over us what is one supposed to do while waiting smoking is a way some people pass the time while waiting i loved the irony cause mormons make such a deal about smoking i saw this movie 7 times in theaters in salt lake and cried every time it blows me away and i've watched it 3 times on video now and it still makes me cry every time i would jump at the chance to see it again on a big screen i hope the tower theatre in salt lake will bring it back regularly at general conference time as a cult movie pun intended but no offense intended
<START> this could have been a good tv movie but the flashbacks do not make it easier to understand the movie as they give the viewer informations on the way will the movie proceeds i found myself wondering why she never said or mentioned that in the beginning then the whole trail would probably not have been necessary br br when the movie ends you understand why she shot and of course she is not guilty too bad that the producer director used the flashbacks this way but on the other had the movie would not have been worth while at all br br nice movie for a rainy day big bag of chips to kill the evening
<START> this film is enjoyable if you like poverty row public domain films from the first half of the 20th century or are a fan of amateur film making the film splices together public domain thrillers together along with newly shot scenes in which the actors with the sole exception of redfield doing a near dead on lugosi rip all of the performers are simply dreadful attempt to interact with the stock footage the new footage is covered with digitally added film scratches as is some of the already substandard old footage as near as i can figure out the plot has something to do with a bunch of strangers being brought together on an island for a will reading this film while boasting a creative premise ala 'dead men don't wear is a technical and creative wreck in one dreadfully over long sequence and injured sailor on a ship describes an abortive trip to island' whatever that is the flashback then incoherently weaves together old footage from totally different eras and of totally disparate film quality unrelated scenes from 'the lost world' 1925 the most dangerous game 1932 white zombie 1932 bela lugosi meets a brooklyn gorilla 1952 and some other poverty row productions this is done over an incredibly bad voice over which seems to have too much room echo as if the audio was recorded on a cheap home video camera br br the filmmakers seem to think that they are paying homage to the great actors of yesteryear by giving characters the surnames of famous actors carradine zucco etc etc this tactic was done cleverly as well as subtly in 'final here it's just obnoxious bizarre and painfully unfunny jokes about spiderman dracula and superman abound even the old as dirt and lawyer reference is used here this was old and tired when the three stooges used it in the 1930s br br the film stock and audio don't match scene to scene and dozens of different sources are used for lugosi the finale effect is that he seems to be getting older younger older thinner heavier younger and older again minute by minute oddly the film didn't use this as a comedy subplot and squanders a good chance for comedy br br truth be told though it was great fun to watch this late at night in bed maybe thats what they wanted to happen
<START> very cliched quite corny acting gets worse as the show goes on don't believe anything that folks say about the realism that this movie is supposed to portray it's just a shoot'em up interesting twist in that the vc the base were given a human face and weren't portrayed as evil incarnate
<START> well this was my first imax experience so i was pretty blown away about that primarily although with hindsight i can't help wishing that it had been some other less monochrome film br br magnificent desolation very much had the programme for schools feel the way it listed all the astronauts and this made it feel a lot like reading national geographic magazine in 3d weirdly it actually had a very two dimensional quality that only occasionally exploded into reality and a lot of time it felt like some presentation there was a moment in the film when an unnoticed abyss opens seemingly at your feel that had a bit of a wow factor but to be honest that may have had more to do with me being an imax virgin br br the commentary provided by tom hanks i personally found very what's a nice way to put it flag nationalistic which didn't go down too well in central london judging by remarks overheard as we left br br over all i loved the imax experience but dearly wish a different film had been on on that day the moon isn't a particularly colourful subject and to be honest a lot of the 3d effects were lost in the monochrome scenery all that would have been well were it not for the documentary inserts and distractions like the interviews with american schoolchildren which spoiled it a bit
<START> not only do i think this was the best film of 1987 it's probably in my own amorphous list as one of the 10 20 best films i've ever seen for whatever reason i really connected with this movie and it is one of the most personal films i had seen at that point in my life i was 26 for better or worse i strongly identified with the holly hunter character and i'm a guy she plays an extremely bright loyal and intense woman who couldn't figure out romantic relationships there were so many things that she said in this movie that were things that i would say or have said to others in similar circumstances and the ending of the movie i find to be so very very sad br br obviously this role was the big break for holly hunter clearly i was not the only one to think so highly of it
<START> this is film is probably one of the best i've seen so far i would put it only second to all about lily chou chou because it kind of gives me the same vibes '9 souls' is about 9 prisoners who have just escaped prison to go and find some counterfeit money stored in a time capsule at mount fuji primary school they later find out that there wasn't much there and set off on their own ways the first half of the movie is just a time for the characters to be introduced and for the main points to be stated it is a comedic yet serious part of the journey the second half moved me to tears as the movie progresses each character goes and tries to fulfill their dreams but unfortunately ending somewhat badly in the end only 2 of the 9 escapees are left the way that each character left the scene was very sad and you will probably feel tears in your eyes a beautiful film directed fantastically this is a movie for people who have enjoyed other films such as 'blue
<START> honestly on the subject of the death penalty i could take it or leave it the problem i have with this documentary lies in the fact that it is a complete love fest for the murderer with absolutely no sympathy for the family the execution of wanda jean with it's completely one sided view only reinforced my view that she should have been executed for her crimes it tried to argue that she was mentally retarded but nothing in the video supported that view she seemed uneducated but so did her entire family but that doesn't mean they were all retarded i can completely understand if someone is opposed to the death penalty but to completely ignore the crime as if it didn't happen and try to put wanda on some moral mountain top is offensive in nature and that's not the side of the issue i would be associated with
