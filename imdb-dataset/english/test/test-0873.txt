<START> look as being anglo irish i assure you this reviewer is anything but bias but i assure you this is very much an irish film and not english as the last comment seems to have suggested this film was written by neil and conor mcpherson and directed by conor mcpherson too both irish the cast is almost entirely irish it was shot in ireland with an irish crew even michael was born in ireland i remember him joking about it in an interview about this film br br michael cane was evidently brought in to boost box office abroad br br loved the film i just wanted to correct a totally uninformed comment br br now on with the review i loved dylan moran have always been a fan of his himself and michael cane formed a surprisingly good double act it was great to see range as an actor as he plays several different made up characters during the film i would recommend this film to anyone with an interest in comedy as it represents a fresh quirky and inventive turn in irish feature length chuckle films i laughed a lot what more could you ask for
<START> the threesome of bill boyd robert armstrong and james gleason play coney island carnys vying for the hand of ginger rogers a working gal who sells salt water taffy with the outbreak of world war i the threesome enlist and pursue ginger from afar the first half of this rko pathe production is hard going with the three male leads chewing up the scenery with overcooked one liners and 'snappy' dialogue that quickly grows tiresome the second half concentrates on action sequences as the us navy pursues both a german merchant cruiser and a u boat these sequences are lively and well filmed but overall this is an overlong and unsatisfying comedy drama with a flat ending for fans of the stars only
<START> julie delpy stars in this horrific film about a sadistic relationship between a father and a daughter in france of the 14th century the film attempts to shatter the romantic chivalry image of the heroic medieval knight by showing a rather dreary image of the period defined by psychological dysfunction and violence br br the movie opens with a child franÃ§ois growing up in the shadow of the hundred years' war told by his father to keep his mother safe and to wait for his return franÃ§ois takes action when he discovers his mother with a lover in bed franÃ§ois murders him in the name of defending his father's honour like father like son franÃ§ois grows up and leaves his family also to go to the same war this setting is somewhat of an explanation for the events to come as on his way home we already notice that something is wrong with franÃ§ois the war has not done well with him he has changed br br the daughter bÃ©atrice de delpy awaits her beloved father to return from captivity of the english she is pure of heart and she was left to take care of the estate while her father was gone in her father's absence bÃ©atrice needs to deal with financial difficulties which strengthens hope that her father will return to save her but upon his return she notices that he lost the will to enjoy life and he tortures and humiliates everything around him even his own daughter from this points the film depicts various ways how franÃ§ois torments his family starting with humiliating his own son and ending with the rape of his own daughter bÃ©atrice br br setting the film in the middle ages supposed to soften the blow as the viewer may tell himself that these kind of violent acts were held in difficult times and indeed many films on the topic of incest such as tim roth's the war zone 1999 which are contemporary were more shocking because of that br br delpy appears in this film in several daring nude scenes indeed she appears to be angelic and beautiful br br i was annoyed when i saw some animal torture scenes i believe and this is not confirmed that some birds were killed for the making of this film which really upsets me the quality of a film drops when real violence is used towards animals i would hope that this movie will be re released without those cruelty scenes those scenes do not contribute much to the film storyline br br overall the movie is too long the script is problematic we don't get to see franÃ§ois and bÃ©atrice before the war we don't really get the answer why is he changed to such extreme i would have pass on this film however i have to mention a few scenes that made this film worth watching br br scenes of a young child being able to murder in cold blood is truly shocking i saw it first time on city of god 2002 here franÃ§ois murders his mother's lover while his father away at war excellent scene and very graphic the scenes from bÃ©atrice being raped by her father till she finds out she is pregnant from him are truly shocking and interesting the scene after the rape where delpy burns her cloths and cleans herself she asks her brother to kick her in the stomach with hopes to have a miscarriage br br the brother humiliation scenes where the father dumps his son's head into the food humiliating him then ranting about the war later dressing his son with women's cloths br br the film won the cÃ©sar french oscar for best costume design i agree the costumes here really make the film look authentic for the time period the movie location is chÃ¢teau de a real 12th century castle and a historical monument located in south central france beautiful castle and mountain view really helps you set into the period of this film the film also nominated for 3 more cÃ©sar awards but they were all snatched to the widely successful french film au les enfants goodbye children 1998 br br released as beatrice in new york city march 1987 only to be screened in france on november 2007 watched it on on 3 may 2007 17 45 at work
<START> alien was excellent many writers tried to copy it they all did a bad job or almost but dead space is the worst alien copy because of the bad actors the bad special effects the bad scenario and other bad stuff it would take about 3 pages to tell everything that is bad in this film the movie wasn't very long and this is a very good thing the only one you cannot laugh because it is too serious that is a bad thing because in almost each b series sci fi film you can laugh during the whole time it can be terrific sometimes but instead of watching this stupidity just watch alien or event horizon these are much better i give it 1 out of 5
<START> a few thoughts before i get to the heart of the film 1 i have never seen so many bare breasts in a film before displayed in so many non sexual scenes it was weird 2 joseph fiennes where have you been you charmed us in elizabeth and shakespeare in love and then you went away for awhile mainstream american wants more okay i'm a college english professor i have read this play many times and this is probably the best film version i've seen of it while individual aspects of other productions may have stood out this is the overall package put together well pacino is no olivier but he doesn't need to be so get over it the film's cinematography is stunning and not just because of the bare breasts venice is portrayed amazingly and you do get a feel for really being there residential island is amazingly beautiful and the lighting is always tinted the proper way for the scenes' appropriate moods br br the anti in this film play is hard to watch especially at the end pacino's dropping to the knees and clutching his religious artifact is perhaps the most powerful moment of his on film since the godfather part iii when michael's daughter is gunned down on the opera steps is the play anti sure is othello racist sure take it for what it is a commentary on the elizabethan era not a commentary on today br br fiennes is underutilized in the film but still a pleasure to watch the women in the film are alright no one really stood out here but they do blend in nicely with the scenery jeremy irons and pacino are excellent in the two roles adversaries until the end i've always felt irons was underrated i still get chills when i hear his voice from the lion king and pacino is pacino
<START> cleopatra the delicious monica bellucci is challenged by cesar alain chabat in order to prove that the egyptians are better than the romans she promises to build a fancy castle for cesar in a period of three months without any delay she calls the one arm architect and gives him two options to be covered by gold if he accomplishes his mission or become crocodile food if he fails will ask for help to claude rich asterix christian clavier and depardieu with this movie is very funny specially the parts where and the pirates leaded by red beard participate however the screenwriter and the director should have noted that french is not an universal language as english is therefore the jokes with words like in austin powers movies for example does not work well for people strange to french language french people and persons fluent in french language will certainly like these jokes but they do not make any sense for me that do not speak french my vote is seven
<START> this is the most difficult movie i have ever seen the emotional content is horrific yet unforgetable a woman who is accused of being a political activist is brought in for questioning the whole movie revolves around her interrogation alan rickman and madeline stowe have intense and powerful roles for which they deserve oscars for their performances
<START> be very afraid of anyone who likes this film they probably inhaled too many paint chips as a child its so awful i refuse to relive a plot o yeah there wasn't one this movie is a true definition of what hollywood creates for people who don't want to think at a theatre do the bad guys win do the good guys win who cares
<START> viewed this great classic film of greta garbo and thought her performance was excellent however the german film version which had english captions was her greatest performance greta garbo even mentioned to the press that the german film was her favorite where she had to make the change from silent films to sound greta had a high pitched voice and had to take lessons in order to lower her voice for her future roles in films this story was very sad because greta garbo anna christie ninotchka '39 was abused on a farm by young boys and her father left her years ago as a sailor and then as a coal barge captain there were many scenes of old nyc the brooklyn bridge coney island and the sky line of manhattan charles bickford matt burke days of wine roses '62 a classic veteran actor gave a great supporting role
<START> you know that commercial where the guy has a mouth full of listerine or whatever it is and he's trying really hard to keep from spitting it up into the sink that's a great metaphor for this movie i kept watching even though it was really difficult but keeping in your mouth will leave you with a minty fresh feeling this movie left me with a bad taste in my mouth i should have spit it out when i had the chance br br the premise is corny enough to be fun for the first time in like a thousand years gargoyles have returned to romania and all of the priests who knew how to fight and kill these things are long dead it's up to michael pare and some other secret agents to get to the bottom of things before the gargoyles run amok unfortunately the premise is completely lost in bad dialog and less than enthusiastic acting on the part of the human leads the best acting is done by the cg gargoyles br br in the end this movie feels like a poor man's van helsing if you check your brain at the door this might get you through a dreary monday night i gave it 3 out of 10 stars
<START> i didn't see this movie until it appeared on television because i was doubtful about comic flicks ever since the batman series spawn judge dredd and many other pitiful p g 13 bombs i dodged everything at all cost i would question in my mind why can't someone make a movie that is rated r and stays true to the story how difficult is that and finally my prayers have been answered with blade this movie pops right out of the pages onto the screen with sheer violence blood martial arts weapons fire the good against evil etc yeah sure a lot of action flicks contain all these goodies and most of them have bombed but not blade the movie was filmed just right not going overboard delivering a good length and never a dull moment blade ii is cool but not as cool as the first blade is indeed one of the best real comic flicks i've seen in a long time
<START> denis leary can indeed be funny and clever at times and is always likable but this takes the cake this show showed leary's genius br br the job is set in new york leary plays mike mcneil a hard nosed detective who is married has a occasional drug problem and has a girlfriend mcneil has serious attitude so much he's dripping in it the precinct is filled with funny interesting and likable characters besides mcneil an excellent cast too all of the episodes in this show are really funny and are addictive the one liners in this show are everywhere you'll be in stitches after hearing them and still laugh about them a few minutes after and then some the cases the precinct deals with are something else to stripper nuns a bathroom hostage situation and more are over the top this show was too good could have grown legs to last many more seasons br br the last word a great fantastic show i miss this show dearly all episodes of this show are great you get even belly laughs a lot abc made a huge mistake by giving this the ax too bad leary did not revive the show for cable tv still i give this show one of my highest of recommendations truly a one of a kind show
<START> the sort of little film which studios used to excel at but seldom make anymore sort of a soul version of the more well known the last of the blonde bombshells ian mcshane is excellent as a dj and aficionado of soul music who becomes obsessed with the idea of re uniting the members of a classic soul group and the film follows his exploits as well as those of the group members a cast which includes such genuine musical talent as isaac hayes as well as acting stalwarts derrick o'connor and antonio fargas not meant to be an epic by any means this is nonetheless a chunk of solid gold
<START> i must say out of all modern korean martial arts movies this one is worth checking out it wasn't as epic as musa the warriors and didn't develop the characters as well but it had many nice ideas simple story a elite soldier thought dead returns after years to end the reign of the japanese in korea in medieval days his counterpart was formerly the best friend he had and now he is out to stop him the fight scenes are all with sword or different weapons and very entertaining to watch the motives of the figures are discovered first near to the end you might need to watch it again to get all the connections right and me personally i loved the end i could watch it over and over again maybe a little pathetic but a real freedom fighter story people can be killed but not the ideas they stand for
<START> dumb excuse for a thriller with absolutely zero chemistry or reason in relationship between lewis and hurt why is she dating a man old enough to be her father anyway the suspense is laughable lewis is very good but a script is needed and there isn't one my score for this trash 2 out of 10
