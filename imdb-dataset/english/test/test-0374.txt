<START> i know that guts of a beauty and guts of a virgin are crap films and are hated by many but i'm gonna put myself under the bus here and say i like 'em especially guts of a beauty aka entrails of a beautiful woman watched it the other night with some folks at the pad and i was surprised how well it actually went over br br entrails is the type of madcap cheapo horror softcore sleaze epic that you really just don't find too much of outside of asia specifically japan in this case it's basically a rape revenge flick with a reincarnated monster instead of some silly shotgun murders or a motorboat propelled noose or even a ticked off daddy with a chainsaw that stuff's just silly wouldn't you rather see a monster with a hilarious little snake monster for a br br perversion factor this movie is high in graphic sometimes wacky rape sequences fake pop shots and satisfying masturbation and monster sex sequences that you oughta like if you like corman nuggets like humanoids from the deep i dunno maybe that's a stretch but i personally didn't think entrails of a beautiful woman let me down as an avid fan of asian sleaze and bizarro b pics br br yeah i know sometimes some of my recommendations are not always everyone's cuppa tea even for those of you who like the same kind of garbage as i do but i stand behind this one 8 10
<START> my girlfriend wanted to see this lol this is the case a lot so i rented it then i saw how acclaimed this was nominated for 10 oscars great this should be good ol' drama this movie had a lot of potential the direction and the way everything was paced was very well but once the movie ended i couldn't help but ask myself if this story was really worth making a film for virginia hill annette bening was extremely annoying i just couldn't tolerate her character at all warren beatty was excellent in the film acting wise but again i just found it hard to have sympathy for his character he just came off essentially as a idiotic loser of a gangster who had no place in 'the life' in the first place how'd he get in with the likes of meyer lansky and lucky luciano anyway this film just left me with a bland but uneasy feeling what was the big deal with this movie i just didn't feel a completeness with bugsy beatty's antics although acted quite well just seemed too random and illogical i'm guessing that's how siegel really was but it was just too much of that there just didn't seem to be much of a real story here my basic assessment of it would be br br a hot headed playboy underachieving gangster falls in love with a loser of a woman comes up with the idea of 'las vegas' but his failed attempt at the casino he builds along with having no regard for his mob bosses' money gets him killed br br what else is there besides that i just didn't see the big deal with this and it was a big disappointment there must've not been many movies to come out in 1991 how this was nominated for 10 oscars is beyond me although the two it won is justifiable 1 5 4 stars
<START> i'm not even going to comment on what piece of trash this film is since that has already been established however watching this with my friends we all laughed out loud when the lead girl made a shelley hack reference while on the phone we sat there trying to figure out why the writer would throw her into the mix we can only assume he had a charlie's angels fixation at one time based on that reference we assumed this film must have been made around her charlie's angels run in 1979 or 1980 but from what i've read here it was made around 1987 you sure couldn't tell that from the poor production values it seems as though it was made by a college student for a film class and while by no means would i expect a low budget trash fest like this to be politically correct the rednecks in this film sure did like to direct derogatory gay remarks to each other even so i'd still only rank this as the 2nd worst horror film ever made second only to nail gun massacre
<START> after reading previews for this movie i thought it would be a let down however after i got my region 1 dvd the dvd was available before the film hit the uk cinemas i was pleasantly surprised strong performances from all cast members make this a very enjoyable movie the fact that the script is quite weak means that you dont get bogged down in story and therefore the repeat viewing factor is greater i recommend this movie to one and all br br
<START> beyond the clouds is an over the top artsy group of four vignettes each a offering a glimpse into a man woman relationship from the tenuous to the turbulent although the film offers superb cinematography some exquisite visual beauty and a cast of fine performers there's little meat on the bones of this fragmented work a taste of a relationship cannot impart the fullness of it and suggests that much more can be accomplished with one story in 2 hours than with four nonetheless beyond the clouds will be fodder for and a visual feast for the all albeit superficial stilted and lacking in substance
<START> i wasn't sure on what to expect from the box i am a huge fan of darko but also saw the mess that became of tales whether or not that was a studio botch up who knows with the box i was pleasantly surprised it was a throwback to classic sci fi paranoia films that hint at much larger devious happenings but center on an intimate character base br br the slow build and creepy tension was very effective to the tone and theme of the entire film any change in such pacing would have lead to the typical hollywood or style that just wouldn't have served this story's purpose correctly everything from the strange looking acting extras littered throughout to the low end score to the minimal explanation of what exactly was going on added an entire focused thread of underlying dread and the shrinking sense of hope for our greedy though well meaning lead characters this was something well thought out and put into motion by richard kelly from the first act through to the end richard matheson's short story which this was based on not the twilight zone ep which was another take on the story was one of morality and greed which were still the central elements of the box being only some 8 long expanding it into a feature with substance would have been no easy task but was done so with style originality and leaves the viewer with lingering thoughts about the film many have and will compare this to darko for whether or not it is as profound but i found it to be an entirely different film thematically and emotionally it's tone is completely different as are the messages and intents of this film where darko left us with questions internally the box leaves the viewer with more external questions involving the world around us such as knowing human nature would the test of the box ever come to an end decent acting great creepy visuals and looming atmosphere add to the slow chilling ride its not for everyone but for those who get where its coming from its a treat
<START> this is not your typical indian film there is some great sense of humanity and the characters are pretty realistic there is great dynamism in the interpersonal relationships and there is a sense of guilt grief passion passivity among the many characters while seeing this one gets a feel for the heavy burden of the 5000 years of layers and layers of history of social existence of one of the oldest civilizations the final scene of an elephant walking away in the rural area was a great footnote to such a ancient civilization and yet human relations are still preserved and nurtured saw it on dvd the two interviews with the director and the main actress are very interesting was surprised to learn that the movie has not done well or not being shown in india but maybe not too surprised the artistic of rural societies is being slowly lost and its inheritance not picked up by younger generations as some of the older musicians in the movie are no longer living today great film
<START> it's rare for a film to sweep you away within its world and leave you wanting more once the credits roll hayao miyazaki's is such a film br br the film is the story of a young goldfish named who wishes to become human she swims to shore and is found by a young boy named who promises to take care of her course father an ecologically obsessed sorcerer named fujimoto tries to keep from becoming human in order to maintain the balance of nature which is eventually when finally transforms into a little girl causing a massive typhoon br br is a very rich film it is full of wondrous fantasy lovable characters and genuine heart what director hayao miyazaki has done here is tell a simple little story and while so doing creating authentic movie magic br br is an enchanting experience the love between and is very pure and true as well the environmentalist within miyazaki is still as evident within this film as in all his previous works miyazaki shows the filth and grime that fall into the ocean in an almost startling light not to mention father is on an obsessive mission to clean the world's oceans while the story is simple miyazaki manages to add this extra layer to provoke thought with expert proficiency br br the film is a beautiful work of art each hand drawn cell looks like a wondrous pastel painting the film looks very different than many other studio ghibli productions but the artistry is still just as spectacular as ever before the scenes underwater are simply beautiful to watch fujimoto's fortress under the sea is highly inventive and the sequence where runs across the jumping fish within the typhoon to reach is iconic br br course it is thanks to its wonderfully executed characters that makes this film such a memorable experience is a young boy who acts older than he actually is and the energetic is a laugh a minute every character is just so enjoyable and highly memorable br br overall is a wondrous experience enchanting in every single way while the film may be sold as a children's fairy tale i believe many adults will be swept away within its fantastic world along with their children while the film may lack the density of some of miyazaki's previous works here he keeps it pure and simple being true to himself delivering a film that is funny heartwarming and entertaining all in one this is a magnificent film br br i give a perfect 10 out of 10
<START> yesterday as a movie is hard to rate the cinematography is excellent and deserves a 9 10 the story is gritty and real and does not compromise but the translation of the story to the screen through the actors did not match the camera work br br as a person who was born and raised in central africa i appreciated the authenticity of the film's look and the honest depiction of daily life for the zulu but this and the camera work are not enough to recommend the average viewer should see this film it takes an appreciation of true cinema and not just a love of movies to see the purpose and strength of yesterday br br unlike the 1980 film the gods must be crazy which was a comic look at one african culture encountering modern technology yesterday has no intention of appealing to any crossover audience the movie simply is not fit for the common western mind and i doubt it was intended for the western mind the scenes are long and slow the editing is not paced for a 60mph instant gratification world the dialog is not cleaver or witty it is real movies about health crises do not make the best entertainment and this movie is not entertainment it is education br br this movie is best viewed by those who know appreciate and love the way of life and the culture in sub sarah africa if you lack a broad enough world view to understand other cultures especially african cultures should skip this film do not waste you time with it go see talladega nights or larry the cable guy instead for your cross culture viewing br br i give it a 4 for most who might want to see the movie but have no accurate understanding of african cultures for the viewers with an appreciation for films about the human experience anywhere in the world i would give it a 7
<START> i have to admit i have a particular penchant for the humor and story telling style of british movies though not all of course succeed br br this film made me think and left me in the end with a quiet smile on my face its about character development and relationships truth and lies and whether love is sometimes simply not enough some very nicely understated acting from all the participants especially the two leads tom wilkinson and emily watson br br there was a lot of fuss made about gosford park but with this piece i feel fellowes has actually produced a better movie though it has not been a mainstream release br br an intelligent mature story about real people who are undeniably flawed but also capable of acts of genuine graciousness
<START> i never want to see this movie again br br not only is it dreadfully bad but i can't stand seeing my hero stan laurel looking so old and sick br br mostly i can't stand watching this terrible movie br br frankly there is no reason to watch this awful film the plot is just plain stupid the actors that surround stan laurel and oliver hardy are really really bad and laurel and hardy have been funnier in any of their earlier films br br i warn you don't watch it the images will haunt you for a long while to come
<START> aside from the discotheque scenes that epitomize the swinging sixties especially with everyone dancing to instrumental versions of monkees hits i am surprised how well this lightweight farce holds up 37 years later but indeed it does thanks to the breezy execution of its deception based plot and the sharp interplay of the three leads directed by the redoubtable stage to screen expert gene saks this 1969 comedy is about julian winston a successful manhattan dentist and confirmed bachelor who pretends to be married in order to avoid long term commitment with his young girlfriend of a year toni in response to half hearted suicide attempt julian agrees to marry her but toni first insists on meeting his wife to alleviate her conscience enter julian's devoted nurse stephanie to play the wife and the inevitable complications ensue with white lies growing into major whoppers that lead to presumed couplings and de couplings br br as julian a relaxed walter matthau plays the deceptive dentist in his typically sardonic manner but he lets his two female co stars walk off with the picture in her big screen debut a 24 year old goldie hawn is still retaining her giggly laugh in persona but provides unexpected savvy and depth as toni she and matthau have great unforced chemistry in their scenes together screen legend ingrid bergman still serenely regal at 54 is obviously having a ball playing stephanie initially starchy and quick witted but blossoming into a liberated spirit as the story evolves i particularly like how casual she appears after her overnight romp there is nice supporting work from rick lenz as bohemian neighbor igor and jack weston as julian's smarmy actor buddy harvey billy wilder's longtime collaborator i a l diamond provides the sparkling screenplay and opens up the story beyond its stage bound origins for saks who is not the most cinematic of directors other than a couple of trailers there are no significant extras with the dvd
<START> this is an excellent movie and should be presented every year during the holidays christmas beautiful with great acting john denver at his best i e sincere kind talented and natural the town is georgetown colorado and every bit as lovely as in the story
<START> the idea is not original if you have seen such kind of story before you would know what the ending would come out after watching for the first twenty minutes the script the positioning of the actors and the screening is too obvious if you haven't seen such story before it is definitely a good experience you will enjoy the twist at the end don't forget to watch it again after you know the truth you will even more enjoy the plots even though i have a right guess at the very beginning i still couldn't help stick on my seat till the end br br conclusion a must see this one from korea is better than any recent movies of the genre from japan forget hollywood br br don't miss it
<START> i'm a massive fan of prison dramas which is reflected in oz being my all time favourite american tv show i guess the appeal lies in a type of smug voyeurism of wanting to see bad things happen to bad mens' bottoms but i found don siegel's riot in cell block 11 to be rather disappointing okay i knew since it was made in 1954 it would be devoid of bad language graphic and gang rape but even so it's a rather weak film compared to prison portrayal in earlier movies like each dawn i die and white heat the problem lies in the preachy tone of the movie with riot leader dunn being something of a prison reformer yeah that sounds ridiculous since he's a violent anti hero rather than some limp wristed tree hugging do gooder on a salary but that's what he is in essence he wants to see prisoners rehabilitated to rejoin society rather than being made to suffer there's also a problem of making a b movie with such radical themes quite ironic that siegel would later make dirty harry where the only good criminal is a dead one and that is the cast isn't very good with emile meyer as the being especially irritating in his performance like i said a disappointing movie
