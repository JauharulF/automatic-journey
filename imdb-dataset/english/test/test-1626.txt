<START> not a film of entertainment but of real lives limited ambition for the working class in 60's enjoyable because of my upbringing not sure it'd work for most people typical loach full of tv actors actresses of 70's 80's 90's
<START> my brother plays moose in this film although most of his scenes were left on the cutting room floor the funniest line is the movie is nothing wong with stat so anyway this is filmed in portland or where we grew up the dance club is was called up front fx what i loved about this movie is that the main character who is not named on the box because bolo brings more clout is supposed to be a police detective a great opportunity to drive around in a red convertible porsche i need to get a copy of this preferably the director's cut so i can see all the scenes my brother is in the only scene he is in is the beginning when they are in the dance club he got the spot because he was dating this cheerleader from a semi pro football team called the oregon it is interesting because his name comes up as the first entry in imdb fame has him fortune not so much
<START> an example of genius filmaking the epic story of three major stages of life for a young boy told with eloquence and raw fearlessness rarely does a film come along that causes me to out loud say during most of the viewing this is a really good film again and again that is exactly what happened when i watched this film i really do not understand how anyone could not like it i found myself at moments crying and laughing at the very same moment unable to control how i felt about the scene the acting is outstanding eric why is he not all over movie screens he was really extraordinary his seemingly effortless attempt on the screen impacted me in deep visceral ways i thank him in my opinion eric schaeffer is one of the best filmakers around and i hope he continues to rise to the challenges that he faces while trying to give us art in the face of ferocious commercial filmaking br br
<START> a stunning film which brought into the open so much about disability that generally makes people afraid it showed how minds can be captured by less than willing bodies and how difficult it must be to witness things happening to others that are wanted for the disabled individual br br love friendship fear frustration joy humour and so many others things were so well captured the 2 lead characters were very well played by the 2 able bodied actors and invited your laughter tears concern joy and dismay br br i approached this film with a mixture of interest and trepidation worrying that it might be too much a play for sympathy or dwell only on negatives it was however a beautifully crafted story of 2 friends br br i loved it
<START> this movie is all about reality submarine warfare in ww2 was not a clean precise science there were no computers giving exact enemy details there was no precise instrumentation to 100 control the sub not all the crew went to fight with a song in their heart and a smile on their dial br br people with expectations of seeing a pretty war in this movie will be grossly disappointed good they deserve to be disappointed they deserve to have reality shoved into their face br br war is not clean exact fought by people about to break into song it is endured by scared cold burnt hungry desperate people willing to do anything to survive br br we dive at dawn is a fine example portraying a desperate situation needing desperate actions
<START> the play is cleverly constructed begin with the porter rainbow let the audience see the background unfold through his eyes the film follows the play with great faithfulness working no doubt on the simple premise that it couldn't be bettered now throw in a host of superb character actors the result is a resounding triumph a definite must see
<START> hero and the terror is a fairly dull thriller a la no real character substance predictable plot and boring for a thriller i found this movie slow in working up to its pitiful climax as it just seemed to drag along until chuck's wife's baby is born and then it drags on from there until it reaches the end which i can hardly remember already even though i only saw the film 10 minutes ago br br i give this film 3 out of 10 for the first 10 20 minutes
<START> if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made the film has great actors a master director a significant theme at least a would be significant theme undertone of fifties existential world weariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care it is about patriotism and about patriotism in a healthy way br br not quite ten years after the film i knew air force officers who taught my r o t c classes at university they were intellectuals they thought deeply about their work they has senses of humor one had been a crew member on the first plane to drop a hydrogen bomb i have wondered if any one of them died in vietnam i imagine that they flew missions there br br regrettably the film fails the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie her susan holland is a woman that one would flee not embrace col james stewart who as then a colonel makes a good stab at this role as lt col and later col dutch holland but the most interesting thing he does in the role is bite into a sandwich i'm not kidding stewart was good as biting in sandwiches as he did in the spirit of saint louis br br one might think of ted williams but i don't when i watch mr steward in the role i do think of william holden as lt harry brubaker in the bridges at ri the comparison is not good for mr stewart who seems wasted in this film br br footage shot from a b 36 looks like outtakes from commercials for an airline though beautiful the aerial shots are mundane for the time they might have impressed viewers the crash in greenland involves unexciting modeling you expect the outcome to be good br br the undertone the subtext for the film voices the tedium that air force flight crews must have felt during their long missions and the banality that the air force used to make its business well business like any other business one imagines how a la nouvelle vague director might explore this theme and then one begins to think about how someone with imagination might have filmed this movie little moments are missed when crews returned from long missions the members of the crew got a shot of scotch and a massage before debriefing the mission showing that might have helped br br banality was the image the air force wanted and mr mann accommodated the brass maybe in that sense the film works but not for me br br i mourn when i watch the movie because i think all of us director actors crew viewers and members of the armed services might have enjoyed giving and getting much more than we get here br br i don't think that this movie had to be dr strangelove or 2001 both of which it presages but it had potential never realized yet i enjoy watching it i think of the airmen on their long missions and the ground crews in isolated places there is a certain sense of honor celebrated here and i celebrate that honor br br i certainly understand why people who praise this movie here and other places appreciate it if there were no intentional fallacy it would get a 10 from me br br
<START> what starts as a homespun comedy drama and then halfway turns into a melodrama made a major star of john garfield and justly so but jeffrey lynn is not to be dismissed as the object of affection of the four daughters lynn is very handsome and is so charming it's easy to believe that all four daughters could fall for him although garfield received most of the kudos lynn became a major leading man at warner bros as a result of this film br br michael curtiz insisted on location shooting for the picnic scene making it the highlight of the film throughout the craftsmanship is enough to inspire awe a soap opera by fanny hurst has been turned into a cinema masterpiece
<START> i love this movie and i recommend it to anybody damian and jennifer tilly played their roles perfectly just the characters alone pull you in to the movie the directing was also magnificent the most creative shots i've ever seen i was stuck to the screen throughout the whole movie not one scene was slow the movie also has a lot of action packed scenes cars blowing up etc the movie is just an all around masterpiece if you like real entertaining movies then watch this because you'll be on the edge of your seat the whole time i put this movie on my top ten all time list because there is never a dull moment in the movie and that is my type of movie 2 thumbs up all the way up
<START> from director billy wilder double indemnity the seven year itch some like it hot i can see that this is a bit of an under shown and underrated film one to be seen this is the biographical story of charles augustus lindbergh james stewart who in 1927 wanted to be the first man to cross travel solo flight from new york crossing the atlantic ocean to reach paris in a small cockpit the first half hour or whatever is seeing lindbergh getting permission to do it and the construction of the plane named the spirit of st louis and making all necessary preparations then of course the rest sees his perilous journey crossing the journey overcoming tiredness near fuel loss and moments of losing sense of direction but he was successful also starring murray hamilton as bud gurney patricia smith as mirror girl bartlett robinson as benjamin frank mahoney robert as harry knight sheila bond as model dancer marc connelly as father arthur space as donald hall harlan as and greer as apparently lindbergh was a bit younger so stewart was a shade too old to play him but then again you can't think of anyone else that could do better it is a witty and emotional drama with stewart as always being fantastic great music score by frank waxman and good direction from wilder a good little known gem it was nominated the oscar for best special effects the only award it was ever nominated james stewart was number 12 on the 100 greatest movie stars he was number 3 on 100 years 100 stars men and he was number 13 on the world's greatest actor very good
<START> i have read and enjoyed many of james lee burke's mysteries when i read 'in the electric mist with the confederate dead' was being filmed and tommy lee jones was playing the lead i was thrilled after watching it last night i ending up turning it off with about twenty minutes left not wanting to see any more people shot or beaten up don't get me wrong i don't mind blood and gore i love 'the and 'the godfather perhaps it was just that i had previously seen and 'what just before watching this i know that burke's books are violent lyrical and especially in the case of 'in the electric can be like the cajun swamps he writes about full of things that are never fully explained in a book that's fine in a film that's confusing many of the previous reviewers are also ardent admirers of dave which makes it more understandable that they really liked the movie or they are admirers of bernard tavernier or both even as a fan of all the actors and especially vince i felt it was such a waste of their talents overall they gave good performances in a film that didn't hold together now i say this having only seen the usa dvd and hoping that tavernier's cut will make a huge difference on the plus side the soundtrack was wonderful the scenes at place were perfect just as i imagined the bait shop to look like mary steenburgen was excellent as as was walter as if you read the books you know why is an even tempered person in the beginning of the film and then starts whacking people with various instruments overall i wish that they had filmed more of the mist and the confederate dead' and left out large portions of methods of interrogation explaining gifts and his bond to dave as well as dave's to the general then i wouldn't be feeling today as i did last night when i turned it off what just happened
<START> for a teenager who has never read austen this adaptation might be fine but only for them this is a disjointed cliff notes version of mansfield park and if you have not seen another version or read the books parts of it would be head scratching br br why has it been so hard to do a good adaptation of this book the one in the 1990s took such liberties that it barely seemed to be the same book the mindset was completely modern and prurient br br here we have billie piper who looks like a pretty country wench she has a charming personality that develops nicely but she has flagrantly died blonde hair with black eyebrows and through much of the pic dark brown roots so much for unspoiled cousin it is incredibly distracting and the rest of the cast is in the greasy hair rumpled clothing genre that shows a real disrespect for period accuracy br br one thing is good here haley is the best mary crawford of all the versions she is note perfect flirtatious without being at all modern or suggestive flippant and completely without any moral or ethical compass henry here is actually good looking enough to be a slight temptation for our heroine br br redgrave takes one of the most interesting roles in the story and manages to make her actually boring until her last scene much too sensible this is just a production that really missed the mark a real low for austen fans br br the only serviceable version is the one with odd duck perfect for the role la despite the very very gay henry crawford he's just laughable
<START> the elite sniper team that has inserted or so earlier have instead of digging in and making them selves invisible decided to take cover behind a big rock in one of the first scenes when the hero runs to rescue his wife he actually jogs when inside a building and aiming for a target only some 20 30 meter away the hero uses his scope besides the fact that most non elite soldiers would make that shot from the hip and still hit there is also the fact that the scope probably wouldn't be able to focus that close there is a satellite that can actually look into buildings br br the list is endless and the film is the biggest heap of crap i have ever put in my dvd player
<START> this movie had the potential to be a very good movie in my eyes nicholas sparks is a great romance author and this movie had every chance to be just as great as the notebook but whats sets the two apart is the notebook had a dream team of leads in mcadams and gosling but here the balance is thrown miserably off by the inept acting of channing tatum br br i felt a lot of the scenes were uneven purely because of his performance a lot of the emotion in various scenes is lost because he cant act leaving an awkward and uneven situation amanda given a great performance only to have tatum drop the ball and the mood is lost and the scene cant recover br br this story deserved to be cast right but what it got was a pretty boy who cant act tatum should stick to what hes good at movies that are more about his physical ability albeit horrible like gi joe step up and fighting the less he talks the better br br try not to think of me as a jaded hater of channing tatum i went in to this movie with an open mind because i've been surprised many a time by the likes of adam sandler in reign over me i gave the same chance to tatum i didn't view him here as the sum of his past roles purely just by his performance in this movie which sadly was a letdown
