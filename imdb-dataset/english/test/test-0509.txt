<START> honestly this is one of the best horror movies i have ever seen i was captivated by the story petrified of captain howdy and on the edge of my seat for the whole ride i do not really understand all the negative reviews br br the set up has already been discussed in depth captain howdy is an on line predator who sets up meetings with teenagers abducts them and introduces them to his favorite pastime of body modification and piercing dee snider is captain howdy and he is one of the scariest psychopaths ever created maybe the scariest because he is so human and you get the sense especially if you are into body modification at all that there are really people like this in the world br br but the biggest reason i liked this movie and the reason it is so horrific is that captain howdy becomes the hero at the beginning of the movie the roles are clear cut the victims are innocent the cop is the good guy and howdy is pure evil by the second act however things have changed a little you want howdy to be evil but it turns out that he is really just a victim of circumstance and maybe the good and the bad are not obvious it is terrifying to find yourself cheering for the bad guy br br a couple people have mentioned that should have been broken into two separate movies to be sure there are definitely two separate acts but this movie works so well because the two acts are back to back the first act is the typical psycho thriller but the second act is the most disturbing because of the viewers reaction to the situation i do not think it would have worked quite the same if the second act were expanded and turned into a sequel br br as a big horror movie fan i highly recommend this film it is the first horror movie ever to give me nightmares
<START> i'm all about the walking dead but my mind is still unsure of the walking frozen dead sadly the chilling didn't help me make up my mind this is really slow with nothing happening for the first 45 minutes making me hit the film enhancement button several times by the time the well designed zombies show up it is too late and the director two are rumored to have filmed this has no idea how to shoot them haggerty blair and donahue all look tired embarrassed recovering in some fashion i will give the film credit as it predates the t2 ending with villains being frozen by liquid the shriek show dvd offers an extended promo reel from back in the day that runs 8 minutes long and i would actually recommend that over watching the flick in its entirety
<START> very disappointing 7th chapter of this slowly dying series very evident that the budget was extremely low this movie was made for one reason and one reason alone to sell puppet master toys fans such as myself of the series have decided from what i have read and heard that the only one in the series worse than this is curse of the puppetmaster in turn turning us away from the series br br opting to make this a pg 13 film for whatever reason did not work in the films favor the plot seemed almost to be there but was easily lost in the steady stream of nonsense br br the only film in the series worth watching also directed by decoteau is part 3 toulon's revenge br br granted i do favor the scenery in the film br br yuck
<START> this review is based on the producer's cut br br 'halloween 5' was a major disappointment at the box office way back in '89 personally i've always loved it and am proud to have it in my collection but because of it's failure and also because of rights issues it would be 6 years before we would see another installment the film had the makings of being one of the best if not the best in the series a hardcore fan writing the script the return of not only donald pleasence as dr loomis and george wilbur as michael myers but also the return of the character of tommy doyle from the first film a major studio backing the project and a fall release all made the film sound like a hit in the making so what went wrong i'll give you two good reasons re shoots and poor editing due to a bad test screening and also the unfortunate passing of donald pleasence the film was changed and not for the better the film like parts iii and 5 tanked at the box office and earned negative reviews from both critics and most series fans but then thanks to the magic of bootlegging the original cut leaked out and many fans including my self were very happy i will end this portion of my review by saying this this film is so far at least my favorite 'halloween' film and i'm not afraid to admit that br br pros the score is simply spellbinding has some of the best writing and dialogue of the series 'halloween 4' emulated the original in that it was more about suspense and mood instead of blood and guts and 6 is the same way great performances especially from the late and very missed donald pleasence moves at a breathtaking pace an interesting explanation for michael's evil and why he won't die some brutal kills some pretty chilling moments my favorite being the one involving kim character a lot of really cool nods to the previous films some good surprises like the previous two sequels this one has an awesome cliffhanger ending br br cons though the explanation for michael's evil is fascinating it does make him a little less scary since when can michael move around from place to place so fast br br final thoughts this was the first 'halloween' that i saw in the theatre i was so excited because i really had thought 5 would be the last and then i heard this was happening i enjoyed it at the time but over time i saw it for what it really was a great movie trapped in an ok one with a terrible ending why did the filmmakers have to listen to the people at the test screenings if they had released this superior version it may have done much better and the series might not be stuck in the mess it's in right now br br my rating 5 5
<START> this movie is bad br br this movie is really bad br br this movie is might as well be half a minute long and shown 200 times in a row because you'd get the same effect br br the phone rings man a answers the phone and gets annoyed by man b man a curses off man b and then hangs up the phone repeat br br this is the entire movie br br do not watch this movie trust me
<START> to view the fictionalized biography the city story i claim is to enter fields where u s filmmakers have seldom ventured director phil got his directorial assignment on the untouchables tv mega hit series largely on the basis of kansas city confidential and this film and it has become one of the most admired and most imitated movies ever made the rarest feat for us filmmakers seems to be the hero centered purposeful anti crime film or tv series i remind the viewer how mightily cain's hundred 's and hardcastle and mccormick 's and even the ' producers had to work to produce anything but episodes devoted largely to the activities of criminals rather than those of their ethical opponents this powerful seminal and very gritty movie has a style all its own and its lesson seems to be attention to detail about the opponents and victims of criminal organizations as well as their gang members there is a twelve minute prelude to the film in which reporter roberts interviews the real participants from the alabama city's who had struggled against its corrupt vice gangs the problem grew out of the presence of fort benning across the river and the nearly century long existence of vice dens in the area the film details the return of john patterson from germany where he has been a prosecutor his father defeated for attorney general of alabama refuses to join his pursuit of the 14th street despite several provocations including a beating of his son avenged by patterson on his tormentor there are several well developed characters including ellie who works in one of the clubs and her honest boyfriend the leader of the syndicate the and john's wife ed gage the operatives and zeke ward an honest black man victimized for his opposition to them the cinematography by harry neumann and the art direction by stanley fleischer are in b w and are very much like news film adding to the film's realistic power music by harry contributes to the film effectively writer daniel and crane wilbur produced a swift paced and straightforward story that divides into parts part one illustrates the empire from inside one of their clubs showing the fate of a victim who is beaten and then picked up by police in the pay of the mob in part two albert patterson refuses to oppose the leader of the mob the intelligent rhett tanner in part three young patterson returns and after several incidents including his having to beat up the head goon to avenge his own beating decides to run his father for attorney general of the state his wife is horrified and the mob kills zeke ward's daughter and dumps the body at house with a warning his children will be next a few more such incidents including the loss of a trial in which the prove the goon killed a friend of theirs who had found the car implicated in the murder of the little girl and watch the inquest declare the death accidental convince patterson to run and he wins the democratic nomination despite the tactics and is promptly assassinated john patterson stops a vigilante crowd from starting open warfare with the 14th street mob and uses their voices to call the capital and demand martial law for city the clubs are closed and equipment confiscated but not before the girl inside is murdered by the goon and patterson has to be stopped by zeke ward from killing tanner instead of delivering him to the law the drama's ending is upbeat but the for the town is less sanguine than painted the mob in fact tried to come back then moved to tennessee in this well acted classic of anti crime film making richard kiley is young but very strong as patterson playing it without an accent john mcintyre as his father is very good while edward andrews as boss tanner is award caliber others in the cast include kathryn grant as the girl inside ellie jean carson and kathy marlowe as the women john as their goon biff mcguire as the young victim james edwards as zeke ward lenka peterson as john's wife and some good character actors as townsmen and mob bosses it is i suggest hard to say enough good things about the realism and lack of posturing in this film it is certainly one of phil best directorial efforts also did the scarface mob later did walking tall as well a sobering and inspiring look at the ease with which complacent citizens of a public interest democracy can acquiesce to tyranny and how a few honest men can teach them the need to fight for their rights
<START> this one surprised me br br i read a few reviews beforehand that called it a good b grade movie and was prepared for the worst halfway through it i suddenly realised i was completely wrapped up in it and enjoying it a lot there were some really tense moments that had you sitting forward fiddling nervously with the remote control or any other object in reach overall this movie definitely doesn't deserve the b grade tag br br credit must be given to director gary ellis and writers bill todd king for their movie debut i hope these guys continue with bigger budgets and some studio backing
<START> worst pile of drivel to date everyone involved with this production should be ashamed of themselves not one single element of the movie was anything slightly like an original idea a first grader telling you a story about nap time is more entertaining
<START> well the hero and the terror is slightly below average in my opinion yes chuck is a real martial artist and kicks some butt in this film but it is rather slow and the acting in my opinion is for the most part subpar although i think steve james does a decent job like my friend ryan i was confused as to why the psychopath chose to go to the theatre at the end of the film rather than to go after norris's girlfriend until than the killer had only killed women oh well i guess it wasn't as predictable as i thought definitly a film you can pass on
<START> there's lots of ketchup but not a whole lot of sense in the supposedly explanatory third sequel which piles on the naff visuals to no effect good old alan smithee directed this one in which various members of the same family all played poorly by bruce ramsay are terrorised by pinhead doug bradley wheeled out of mothballs for the umpteenth time peter atkins tries to imbue his script with poetic touches but doesn't seem to realise that his dialogue is as deep and meaningful as a plate of sick the incoherent plot fails to adequately fill the movie's meagre running time although this may have more to do with studio interference than anything the filmmakers intended
<START> i first saw this when i was a teen in my last year of junior high i was riveted to it i loved the special effects the fantastic places and the trial aspect and flashback method of telling the story br br several years later i read the book and while it was interesting and i could definitely see what swift was trying to say i think that while it's not as perfect as the book for social commentary as a story the movie is better it makes more sense to have it be one long adventure than having gulliver return after each voyage and making a profit by selling the tiny sheep or whatever br br it's much more arresting when everyone thinks he's crazy and the sheep do make a cameo anyway as a side note when i saw laputa i was stunned it looks very much like the kingdom of zeal from the trigger video game 1995 that also made me like this mini series even more br br i saw it again about 4 years ago and realized that i still enjoyed it just as much really high quality stuff and began an excellent run of sweeps mini series for nbc who followed it up with the solid merlin and interesting alice in wonderland
<START> sometimes reading the user comments on imdb fills me with despair for the species for anybody to dismiss 2001 a space odyssey as boring they must have no interest in science technology philosophy history or the art of film making finally i understand why most hollywood productions are so shallow and vacuous they understand their audience br br thankfully those that cannot appreciate kubrick's accomplishment are still a minority most viewers are able to see the intelligence and sheer virtuosity that went into the making of this epic this is the film that put the science in science fiction and its depiction of space travel and mankind's future remains unsurpassed to this day it was so far ahead of its time that humanity still hasn't caught up br br 2001 is primarily a technical film the reason it is slow and filled with is because the aim was to realistically envision the future of technology and the past in the awe inspiring opening scenes the film's greatest strength is in the details remember that when this film was made man still hadn't made it out to the moon but there it is in 2001 and that's just the start of the journey to create such an incredibly detailed vision of the future that 35 years later it is still the best we have is beyond belief i still can't work out how some of the shots were done the film's only notable mistake was the optimism with which it predicted mankind's technological and social development it is our shame that the year 2001 did not look like the film 2001 not kubrick's br br besides the incredible special effects camera work and set design kubrick also presents the viewer with a lot of food for thought about what it means to be human and where the human race is going yes the ending is weird and hard to comprehend but that's the nature of the future kubrick and clarke have started the task of envisioning it now it's up to the audience to continue there's no neat resolution no definitive full stop because then the audience could stop thinking after the final reel i know that's what most audiences seem to want these days but kubrick isn't going to let us off so lightly br br i'm glad to see that this film is in the imdb top 100 films and only wish that it were even higher stanley kubrick is one of the very finest film makers the world has known and 2001 his finest accomplishment 10 10
<START> who do you dream of hoot gibson howdy doody i'm talking about the theater harry crystal br br nothing beats a great stage show nothing and harry crystal lives that belief a stage actor still waiting for his big break harry brings the magic of live theater to a small town and to artie shoemaker tom hulce a young man who has big dreams but just didn't know it until he met harry br br with scenes and songs from many of america's classic musicals those lips those eyes conveys both the ups and downs of the people that for 2 hours take us to a fantasy land but who manage to keep that magic alive in their hearts all day long br br like artie once you've seen those lips those eyes you're hooked kid harry crystal
<START> i have not read the novel from which the film is based on so i cannot comment on what is missing or if there were changes made br br as i stated above i had a wonderful experience watching the kite runner i find that when i see films about other cultures than ours here in the usa i learn how other peoples live exist br br the actors in this movie are from afghanistan other countries in that area there are 3 young children in this near epic movie in there first roles they were marvelous br br the scenes that was supposedly in kabul were shot in various parts of china i assume that the area is similar to the actual places in the book br br mark foster directed he did finding he has created the same magic here br br all aspects of production are first rate br br i found this a better movie than those nominated won oscars br br the film is sub titled it is very clear to read it has a proper pg 13 rating spoiler alert the child rape scene is very well handled br br i cannot however give this a 4 star rating as the general plot story line we have seen many many times non the less this is a very worthwhile movie to watch br br ratings 1 2 out of 4 95 points out of 100 imdb 9 out of 10
<START> why a film maker with a track record like wes craven would want to lend his name to a tedious collection of cliches like this is anyone's guess and if he did stump up any money for it all of Â£50 judging by the looks he should have been banging on the director's door for a refund the minute the film was released there are many alien rip offs and this is one of the worst even the reliable lance henriksen saddled with a character dumb enough to allow his kids to wander around a dangerous government lab can't save it as a cure for insomnia this rates a 10 as a piece of quality film making forget it
