<START> gilmore girls is my favorite tv show of all times they only aired the first 2 seasons in india but i've watched the rest on dvd or read it online it's very refreshing to find a show where the protagonist isn't sneaking around her mother's back but has an open relationship with her the chemistry between lauren graham and alexis who play and her daughter rory is really great all the acting is excellent and the characters though extremely quirky are still believable the residents of stars hollow show all the amusing bizarreness of small town life which is contrasted by the endless snobbishness and social norms that make up the high society life of parents on one hand there are dance and firelight festival's while on the hand you have dar meetings and cocktail parties all the character's develop a lot and there's a happy ending for more or less everybody there are dramatic elements but also a lot of very witty humor boyfriends are all incredibly hot as are her friend lane's basically it's a cool funny very satisfying show which encompasses all the aspects of life and gives you a feeling of if you work hard enough and wait patiently you'll get what you want even if it wasn't what you intended
<START> the merchant of four seasons is a film about a lack of love the film starts off with the main character hans returning from a spell in the foreign legion he returns to his mother not to be told how much she loves him or how much she's missed him but to be told that he is worthless and even worse that she would have preferred the man he went with to have come back instead it is the character's relation to women that makes this film so hateful the fact that his wife is taller than him is symbolic of his relation to the other gender he is consistently humiliated by them and it is through his relations with them that his life isn't as great as it could have been this is also shown clearly by the way he treats his wife after a drink he lost his job as a policeman through lust for a woman and even his wife a woman that is supposed to love him never really shows any affection for him even at the end his wife is more bothered about what her and her daughter will do than the state of her husband br br the merchant of four seasons is a thoroughly unpleasant film there isn't a scene in the movie where someone is happy and not only that but the movie seems deliriously blissful to wallow in the misery of it's central characters the movie is certainly not recommended to anyone who is currently having a hard time that's for sure despite all the misery the film never steps out the bounds of reality every event in this movie can and most probably has happened and that only serves in making the movie more shocking the film is of course helmed by rainer werner fassbinder the cult german director that committed suicide in 1982 this is only my second taste of the man's work but through just two films it is easy to get an idea of the type of art that he creates both films are downtrodden and gritty yet realistic pieces of art his characterization in this movie is subtle we only ever get to know the characters through their and not through their character this is a very clever way of showing the audience that it is their surroundings that define the people in the film not the people themselves and as nearly everyone that sees the film knows what living in an urban society is like it wont difficult for the majority of people to relate to br br the merchant of four seasons is not a film that is easily forgettable the movie is high on substance and low on style and that makes for a very memorable picture and one that everyone who considers themselves to be a fan of cinema should experience it is with that in my mind that i give this film my highest recommendations it's not sweet and it's not pleasant but you will not see a more realistic portrayal of depression and this is most certainly a movie that will stay with you
<START> sometimes you ignore that little voice in your head that says stay away from this movie we should all pay more attention to that little voice this may be the worst movie i've ever had the non pleasure of sitting through or it may be the best reason to remember that your dvd player has a fast forward button made on a budget somewhere in the vicinity of 1 99 the cavern is obviously a quick cheapie made to on the current bunch of scary cave lots of darkness claustrophobic unknown menace flicks like the cave and the descent a few years back there was similar rash of look alike movies that used sea going vessels instead of caves all had scary boats submarines lots of darkness claustrophobic adventurers unknown menaces same old same old the cavern is really the blair witch project only this time we're lost under the earth and not lost on top of it throw in a flashlight with failing batteries a cow skull with fangs glued on it for a monster and one of the stupidest twist climaxes ever put on film that being said let me urge you to listen to me the little voice in your head i'm your friend i want you to have a happy life stay away from this movie
<START> a disturbing film this climaxing as it does with an intensely intimate reunion between a naked man and his young son but in its confused structure it contains a poetically imagined visual exploration of the innocence of an idealised amnesiac br br the plot follows two threads the weaker of which is the gradual revelation of graham pablo's condition wound through this though is a beautiful description of his condition and his meandering path towards a partial awakening driven by his affair with irene br br the affair is the strong thread while the specifics of the plot are carried by a seemingly tacked on collection of characters graham's best friend who can reveal the cause of his condition in a clunking flashback his manipulative boss and his comic book mad scientist psychologist all of whom have an interest in keeping him lost and dependent br br the failure of the film lies in the conflict between the two threads one is visual meandering and sublime while the other is structured like an inept thriller all expository dialogue and unresolved patterns of symbolism br br nevertheless i enjoyed it keeps flirting with the abyss of taboo and shying away into something beautiful as in the quarry with the double bassist and the two women when a setup for a scene of cheap pornography becomes a segment of peace and rejuvenation i still don't get the tooth though br br odd clunky and a narrative failure but with an almost redeeming beauty
<START> why did i have to go out and buy yes buy jack frost 2 revenge of the mutant killer snowman maybe it was a burst of temporary mental derangement but i'm guessing it's because i kind of enjoyed the first jack frost it was a silly but funny horror comedy which had some okay effects by screaming mad george that and the fact that on the back cover of the sequel there was this nice picture of this guy impaled by this giant icicle coming out of his mouth with a lot of blood and all so i thought if it's as idiotic as the first and has some nice splatter gore in it it should be fun right well i was so dead wrong br br let me first say that the movie deserves some credit for having an immensely insane and retarded plot i mean a mutant killer snowman on a tropical island that spawns mutant killer baby snowballs which can only be killed or harmed by bananas as much as i love the premise i really hated the movie first of all while the first jack frost looked like an actual movie seemingly being shot on real film and all this sequel has the look and feel of a third rate soap opera it has this way too slick shot on video look the lighting is just plain awful bright white spots for the day look and stupid colors like blue and green at night the acting well don't even go there the dialogues range from stiff to extremely senile that jamaican man was just moronic saying man after every sentence and when it comes to the voice of the killer snowman all i could think of was a seventh rate chucky from child's play spewing dumb and supposedly witty one liners before he kills someone br br the best joke was were one guy asks why are you talking to your watch and the best scene was undoubtedly the one with that beautiful asian chick popping up out of nowhere and taking a swim in the pool totally naked thank god for that oh yeah and that little scene over the end credits with those two japanese dudes on a miniature ship being badly dubbed had me laughing too but the worst thing about this movie was where was the gore and splatter action everyone is talking about there were plenty of occasions to show some decent gory killings a lot of people were killed off in original ways here but all off screen like i've read in many other comments there were indeed nice set ups to a head explosion a crushed body eyes being poked out tongue ripped out but on the crucial moments the editor cuts away to some blood splatters on the floor or nothing at all that frontal shot of that british guy being impaled from the back cover of the dvd wasn't even in the movie i only saw that particular killing filmed from the back meaning i didn't see sh t i was waiting throughout the whole movie for that to happen and then i get to see nothing what a let down could it be that i saw a cut version of the movie that would be a shame 'cause only a decent amount of splatter fun could have saved this movie if you ask me seeing a lot of killer snowballs reduced to bloody pulp just didn't cut it for me speaking of those snowballs they were done very poorly they made munchies look like state of the art 'animatronics' but i guess that was the whole point of it at some point the special effects crew even turned to some laughably bad cgi boy you really have to see it to believe it best is to not see it actually 'cause this flick is just too bad okay i did laugh with it for it kept getting worse and worse just stick with the first jack frost 1996 and you'll be okay just bare in mind that it's a pretty silly horror comedy but fun in it's own right br br it's funny but writer director michael cooney somehow must have realized that he was a pretty bad director after jack frost 2 and then focused on writing turns out he then wrote two pretty good thriller screenplays for the i inside starring ryan phillippe and identity starring john cusack so the man seems to have some talent after all br br now it would be far too easy to give jack frost 2 the lowest rating possible so i say one point for that naked asian babe doing the skinny dipping and one point for those completely retarded snowball babies way to go mr cooney
<START> the main portion of this lightweight musical story is located at fictional college which peter peter lind hayes attends due to the largesse of stage actress grace hayes his real life mother who fills the same role here and who manages to supply his love interest through her secretary mary healy who is his real life wife directed from a weak script and additionally hampered by excessive cutting and poor editing this film does provide some treasures among its eight songs including the title number and has nice turns by soprano healy benny rubin as a snack shop proprietor and the dynamic tap dancing roland dupree
<START> for native mongolian speakers the film lacked emotion and emphasis used too many non native speakers especially too many diversions from the actual history terrible terrible subtitle i wonder where and who did that subtitle it was both in english and thai i wonder how bad the subtitle was in thai if the english subtitle was soooo bad described the one of the greatest leader's life very uninteresting there are better films made by mongolian directors with very low budget from 1980's honestly i'm wondering if the film critics of academy award is that lenient or what only good thing was some good cgi in some fighting scenes only moderately not over the top cgi
<START> this critique tells the story of 4 little friends who went to watch angels and demons the movie on the first night it came out even though it was a school night because angels and demons is worth it two of the four had read the book of those that didn't a guy was wearing pink skinny jeans this was the least eventful part of the evening after watching the abhorrent angels and demons br br the movie starts out in a lab where the antimatter is being created while another process is going on and apparently someone knows about it or something notice how very confused i am i don't get what happened they were just making the antimatter finds her own father dead what the symbol sent to langdon is a printout not a burn on someone's chest they take out the x 33 scene they take out kohler they pretty much take out and the connected to it they take out the and replace him with some religious british dude they take out the diamond they take out near rape scene they take out fight with the now british dude on crack they take out the press dude following them around they take out the death of the fourth cardinal they take out the fact that the becomes pope they take out the grand scheme they take out langdon's being in the helicopter and landing on that island toward the end they take out the fact that father was a scientific priest they take out langdon's fun and most unfortunately they take out sexual appeal br br other than the movie completely losing focus of the details the movie is acted horribly one must admit though there were some good things for example the sistine chapel recreation must have been extremely difficult and it was extremely well done the explosion scene was mind blowing other than that screw this movie for ruining the book for the people who didn't read it
<START> really average is the only word that comes to my mind when you see this br br the acting was average maybe a bit above average the camera usage was average actually below average the picture was so shaky and the colors were grainy and blurry the plot was a good one but moved at such a slow pace and wasn't put to good use br br this could've been so much more if it didn't go at a snail pace and we saw more into the characters backgrounds br br all we see are flashbacks here and there of alice and how her home life is so bad her mother is a working class woman trying to make end meet for her and her daughter we see a flashback of her of when she was in high school and her friend says to her tell your mom to make some better food and everybody says it's your mom yeah that's embarrassing but why would you run away from it br br i could definitely see if her mom was a drunk or somebody was abusing her but nothing was her home except she was embarrassed by it how immature br br we're not even given a glimpse of what the couple's lives have been like except that they've been prostituting for awhile and the woman forgot her name gave her baby up when it was 9 months old this really could've been so much more it could've had alice who was abused by her drunk mom go down to florida with her friend but then becomes a prostitute or something along the lines of that other then the real plot of this movie that is alice a girl with a home life of probably 90 of america's population working class runaways to florida but then gets sidetracked by turning into a prostitute br br i don't see why it won an award at sundance it must've been up against some really weak competition to have won that one award br br also to me alice's boston new england accent seemed forced it didn't seem genuine i should know i was born and raised in boston but now live in georgia br br 4 10 not really worth your time in my opinion
<START> angels are a bit of an american obsession but are often rather boring they are the of god and also the arc angels are great warriors lucifer being the toughest and best looking until he was kicked out of heaven br br so what happens if you don't believe in anything let alone angels and you are sent to investigate an angel story only to meet one with wings and less than angelic attitude br br maybe that is what america needs being a puritan is different from being good michael is a rude obnoxious womanizing messenger of heaven who will fulfill your wishes and make you care enough about the world that you will be touched br br funny but not greatly so touching but not overly sentimental intelligent without being clever it is just a good simple small comedy watch on a lazy sunday afternoon
<START> oh my started out with such great potential a bunch of cute sorority girls walking around practically naked check then off to a bar where the 80's cheese gets turned up a notch check off to a woodsy state park the next morning check a bunch of girls and their professor rowdy bikers a general store guy and that dood from they live acting as the local drunk makes for a nice body count check and speaking of body count notice the strong resemblance on the dvd cover to the foreign horror flick body count aka camping del terrore a whacky indian in the woods doing some sort of ritual hmmm ok i'll let it slide check and then oh brother all downhill from there terrible the monster head in the pond had me cracking up though
<START> if you like poor se some bad acting and a total lack of credibility this is a movie for you so a really cheap looking movie but i liked it anyway why because i like those kind of movies i can't help but smile when i see these kind of movies what were the producers actors director and se people thinking when they made this film don't expect an abyss or alien just a very low budget horror adventure movie br br there is one nice splatter moment when a guy's head is shot off but for the most the horror is pretty tame the final monster is pretty cool too br br it's only 73 minutes long so you can t go wrong there maybe you can pick it up at your local videostore or watch it on tv i'm sure you will have a good time watching it br br but don't say you weren't warned
<START> george sanders playing the saint for the penultimate time does a good job out of a good script with the usual good rko cast around it's a non story too bristling with murders and good clean fun br br thread 1 in new york police inspector fernack friend is framed in a corruption scandal and disgraced st comes over from london to try to put things right nice and simple so far but is there really more than 90 000 in the world thread 2 another tale of a woman taking revenge on the people who murdered her brother wendy barrie does well in bumping off some nasty men and having the saint fall in love with her to boot including a baddie who was under their direct protection and in cellar there's a creepy shot of him dead and staring and them in a car when they're taking him back to where they'd got him paul as pearly gates must have supposed to have been homosexual in this witness the dressing gown at the beginning and the later beguiling comment by st that he was thinking of keeping him as a pet and did too for palm springs fernack was played by jonathan hale as usual but this time with such a beaten deflated attitude that what he really needed was a good slapping from templar to liven him up br br the hays office also made sure you got the picture right all threads are tied up with no bits well worth watching for all of us who like this kind of thing but if val kilmer's version is your yardstick then don't bother
<START> i was so let down by this film the tag line was something like 'the story of a girls sexual awakening' you can only imagine how disappointed i was i was seventeen at the time and i took my girlfriend to see it i thought we were going to see a sexy movie that would leave my girlfriend gagging for it sadly that was not the case i guess we just weren't ready for a deep and meaningful movie that required an element of sophistication that we just didn't possess at the time i'm not so sure i possess it now and i have long since parted company with that particular girlfriend pity really my first love we left the cinema half way through the film my friend who should have known better stayed for the whole thing i still got the required result with my girlfriend the film just didn't help much it would be interesting to see it again so that i can make a more informed critique though i feel the experience has left me scarred for life
<START> this is an excellent example of an bad b movie there are worse movies than this one titanic for example but this definitely shares the pile of steaming crap movies br br ok this was apparently shot in kansas city which explains why everyone is so lame the main guy looks like steve guttenberg and is even more lame than him i didn't even think that was possible in fact him and the main girl in the movie are responsible for the worst drama ever its not just that there acting was waaaaaaaaay over dramatic well actually it was of course the script was terrible which combines for a deadly one two punch in bad terrible utterly unwatchable drama br br the scarecrow lets talk about him the whistling you hear every time he's around is stupid and obviously dubbed in now his costume i cannot get over that its a guy wearing burlap sacks and a stupid mask i simply am dumbfounded maybe if your 3 years old with brain damage you'd be scared of him it br br one of the characters the token black guy actually used the line this might be a chance to earn my red wings when referring to trying to score with one of the girls on her period wow um yea that is the kind of dialogue you can look forward to br br oh in the beginning when the scantily clad girl is running through the corn why is it roped off i'm pretty sure its not supposed to be evident just one of the many obvious mistakes made throughout this 'film' another is the bad dubbing for the musical number yup thats right there all at the beach and the one gets up the courage to sing a song and play guitar for everyone and its so obviously dubbed its funny thankfully the scarecrow answers all our prayers and throws a spear right through the guy's chest when he's done singing overall the gore like that is pretty good this is one of those films when you rooting for these people to be killed by the killer br br ok there's a scene where the 2 guys bury one of their friends in the sand then stand up whip out their and urinate all over the guy in the sand who does this really imagine it hey lets bury joe in the sand then stand up and take out our genitals like its no big deal and pee on him in fact this brings up the homo eroticism in this film what the hell a good part of the beginning of this movie is the jocks standing around in there underwear in the locker room and corn field while there doing the hazing what the hell is with that traditionally in film and real life jocks get the girls and nerds don't that really doesn't make sense as all nerds think of is girls and sex and apparently all jocks think of is sports and being around each other in their underwear i don't get it br br lets get to the sex as someone who watched this movie with me put it i've never been so disgusted by heterosexual sex in my life and its true if you like hot a cup action or ugly old woman boobs then this film is for you i swear they found a girl with the smallest breasts ever and this is who they get to do the nude scene then the ugly old woman nurse shows her bouncy ones a couple of times and man i just didn't want to see that br br now i have to talk about the timeline continuity to this film thats what really is just bizarre it starts in the daytime then they all head to the cornfield and within like 2 minutes its instantly dark middle of the night when they drive off from there saying their going to the beach its instantly day again and apparently they stay at the beach until night again and until day the next day so basically these events in the film cover 4 days without any of the characters needing sleep or anything its really weird br br after the main killings have taken place it flash forwards to weeks later' and apparently none of these people actually care that they saw their friends brutally murdered the surviving people literally pop some champaign and thats when i realized the budget didn't go to the script directing or acting it all went to that freakin bottle of champaign br br the ending stop reading now if you don't want the ending spoiled for you it truly is enjoyable br br ok so the end takes place in a church and the scarecrow put his soul inside the diabetes kid body then he fights with the steve guttenberg lookalike guy and he fights him with a b movie version of the power the emperor had in star wars i'm not kidding its so stupid so somehow in the middle of the fight the scarecrow's soul jumps bodies into the guttenberg jr guy and then with the last amount of will he has of his own he impales himself on a cross in the church its awesome some blood but whats even better is that the cross is obviously cardboard you can see the bottom move off the ground wow yea have fun watching
