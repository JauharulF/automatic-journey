<START> are very good movie she happen on a mental home in iceland e is in a leading role and is good other good actors in this movie are and i like this movie she is very good i voice with this movie
<START> wow it's hard to put into words my feelings for this episode ice is one of the best episodes of season one for sure it's my favorite of the season six people and a dog in a claustrophobic structure isolated in the middle of the arctic with an unknown organism that causes murderous aggression the drama can't get any better than that paranoia reigns supreme as even mulder and scully have doubts about each other's sanity i've heard people complain about this episode's similarities to the movie 'the thing' i haven't seen it so i wouldn't know ice is more than worth watching just to see mulder and scully truly testing their still developing trust of one another this episode is intense and suspenseful to the end you won't be disappointed
<START> i have a completely biased point of view mainly because i live and enjoy the club culture lifestyle being a dj and frequent club goer i see the honesty within this movie and i love it if you don't know the club rave culture then it will be a great foray into that culture for anyone that doesn't know it first hand the honest portrayal of human emotion and issues in the part of jip i loved the characters were well constructed and i thoroughly enjoyed this film i really don't enjoy the fact that you have to write ten lines on this web site i will write at least 6 or 7 but i feel that i can portray my point with fewer than ten here are some extra lines to make the imdb gods happy
<START> i am very impressed by the reviews i've read of this film generally well read thoughtful and informed obviously by people who like and think hard about films i couldn't add a thing to the excellent reviewing job that imdb members have already done if i may i'd like to correct a small but widespread misunderstanding that appears in many of the reviews mr baseball was american and behaved in an ugly fashion but he was not an ugly american the original ugly american was homer atkins one of the heroes of the eponymous 1958 novel by and lederer and the exact opposite of mr baseball homer was an archetypal american and an archetypal engineer he went to vietnam to work with people he respected and liked the people he met he used appropriate sustainable technology in cooperation with his hosts and he was liked and respected by them precisely because he exemplified democratic values and american virtues his ugliness was purely facial merely skin deep his personality and his humanity were deep and genuine br br mr baseball exemplifies all the crass ignorant insecure that we europeans and americans so often inflict on other cultures homer atkins the ugly american was the other side of our coin representing our humanity and decency i believe that the ugly americans still far outnumber the mr baseballs they are still our last best hope
<START> i've seen many horror splatter monster movies in my life and of course also a lot of monster movies from the 50's and 60's when i first stumbled over this one i thought this is from the 60's until i recognized it's from 2007 br br in fact the character of jack brook is interesting and the acting all in all is for a splatter movie quite good but i expected a splatter movie and not a drama story about a aggressive plummer the movie runs 80 and i think the first kill is after 65 minutes although it takes hours to explain the story the reason where are the monsters come from takes at least 3 minutes the we have another 20 minutes boring dialogue and finally a in my opinion not that well managed splatter sequence although we have robert englund starring here i only recommend this one to real hardcore horror fans
<START> yeah that's right if i were to ask my friends this question what's the worst movie you have ever seen they might reply something like armageddon can you drill the hole shriek plan nine from outer space the medallion scooby doo etc no don't get offended by this by thinking you have seen something that might be in the same department of naturally produced human fertilizer that this movie is in if the worst movie you can think of is let's say so bad it really pisses you off then you know nothing my friend br br crazy six i remember the day me and a buddy of mine went to the local video store to rent a movie both of us had already been through most of the movies in there and on the new movies shelf we see it staring at us wow there's some good actors here man says something about mafia lets just get it and get out of here this was without doubt the worst movie mistake in my movie loving life it was also the worst mistake for everybody else movie lover or not br br watching this movie is as fun as watching a glass of ice cold water or ice tea until it reaches room temperature watching this movie will make you dream an eternal dream of death if death is just blackout light and nothing and then you realize you are just staring at your tv monitor not staring you are actually paying as much attention that is humanly possible this is no joke br br this movie is the perfection of making a bad movie it's not the kind of bad you can watch point and laugh of its the kind of movie that is so bad you actually have no chance of ever get out of your memory unless perhaps you use electric shock therapy to clear out the brain hey that might be something similar to how i remember me and my buddy felt after watching it br br best regards from me to you albert pyun br br
<START> irvine follow up to trainspotting hits the screen as three short stories set in edinburgh all with a few of trade marks drug culture depression the working class and football club uneasy to watch in places it is no less than very well written 2 of the stories having a darkly comic twist to them while the 2nd story a serious and shockingly realistic plot to it will not appeal to most including myself to a point but will no doubt adopt a cult following
<START> my take yet another lame pg 13 horror movie with predictable scare tactics and a derivative plot br br the spirits move the walls creak there's something wrong in the basement these along with several other horror movie clichÃ©s haunt the walls of yet another house in the country in the sam raimi produced the a lame pastiche of the most predictable scare tactics thrown in on a plot savagely recycled from better and sometimes even worse horror movies of the past br br when the solomon family moves into an old south dakota farmhouse in yet another attempt by dad dylan mcdermott to reconnect with the family especially with their formerly drunk driving daughter jessica the underrated kristen stewart in the more subtle countryside than their home in chicago the horror ensues when jessica begins to get little surprise visits from the house's thinking she's some teenage girl who cried wolf her parents don't believe her how could they the real horror in the is waiting for which horror movie it will savage next will it be an angry flock of crows wanting more than the family's crops a direct rip off of alfred hitchcock's masterpiece the birds will it be the haunted house with a history dating back from the amityville horror or poltergeist or will it be the grotesque phantoms taken from your familiar recent horrors like the ring and the grudge heck the movie even manages to rip off a scene or two from some truly bad horror movies like amityville 3 d and the mediocre cold creek manor perhaps all the pang brothers really wanted to do was a b level horror movie but did it have to be this bad couldn't they rip off from the best avoid it br br rating out of 5
<START> i have never seen the first killjoy film and i have also never heard a good thing said about it so i see killjoy 2 in the local blockbusters and pick it up and look at the back starring trent haaga and debbie rochon it boasts now being the massive troma fan that i am there is no way i'm not going to rent this film out how can it possibly be bad with these two in it oh how wrong i was even trent and debbie cant save this excuse of a film from being as bad as it truly is trent quite frankly stinks as killjoy although this probably is more the fault of the writers giving him some of the worst one liners in the history of film debbie does put a solid performance in but it isn't enough the kills are terrible as are the gore effects for example check out when the guy is supposedly impaled on something or other and just to top it all off the ending is just amongst the worst i have ever seen in movie history the film doesn't even work on a so bad it's good level avoid like the clap br br 2 10
<START> this movie is from the 80s but it looks like it was made in the stone age the effects are way too cheesy my copy has sandra bullock on the cover which was why i bought the movie she was in the movie for about 5 minutes of total screentime she would most likely deny all involvement br br in short there is no part of this movie worth seeing except to laugh at how bad it sucks rent this to see the worst film ever made bar none
<START> so when i first saw commercials for greek i did have a few questions to how they were going to approach greek life if they were going to give away sacred frat and sorority secrets if they were going to focus on the brother and sisterhood a fraternity or sorority brings or what most college kids think of greek life as a huge party br br luckily it covered everything the story plot was great it gave you a character to love hate someone you want to be like someone you don't want to be like and of course a crazy roommate br br it was one of my first looks at what writers believed greek life to be like and i can honestly say they hit the nail pretty dead on br br i love how one of the biggest things they covered throughout the season was the relationship between rusty and his crazy roommate its hard enough moving away from home and being forced to live in a small room with someone you don't even know then come to find out you have nothing in common probably every college bound worst nightmare br br sister casey was pretty much the typical girl on campus everyone is jealous of what didn't she have oh thats right evan all to herself rebecca and evan had an affair early into the season which made you feel fairly sympathetic for casey her character evolved and her relationship with rusty became more and more loving and outgoing br br is one of the most fun loving characters and absolutely insane one of my favorite episodes included him getting completely trashed at a strip club and rusty having to call casey to bail them out i like how they addressed the issue of gay people in greek houses calvin was a very real feeling character and i really respected him because he stuck to his standards so jen k was fairly crazy but she actually liked rusty it was surprising and i continued to question her from the start but of course i did want it to work out between her and rusty br br i am definitely looking forward to the return of greek it takes you into the truth of greek life something that a lot of people look past one of the biggest things that frats and sororities are known for is parties and drinking greek is a great show and the characters are easy to relate to
<START> i was geared up to not like this movie and the first 10 minutes or so did nothing to allay my fears it starts off with 2 high school gangs squaring off against each other with bad kung fu a scenario found in countless other korean films ho hum add the fact that the story was written by the same guy who wrote he was cool which was barely passable and well i thought i was in for a nondescript 2 hours br br but don't give up so quickly a romance of their own was directed by tae kim who also did volcano high which i thought was loads of fun anyway romance of their own soon takes a turn much for the better a high school girl just having moved to seoul finds herself in the middle of attention from two prospective suitors each guy has his own merit and it is not clear which one if either would be the right pick br br what follows is not your usual teen love triangle the emotions are complex and while you may not agree with certain choices or actions as the film develops you can certainly understand why the characters make them br br the movie asks questions of the characters and the audience who does one choose at what point is one obligated to even make a choice and is it unfair to one if it seems he is being strung along after you or your heart has made a choice how do you react and how should you react when new information comes up that sheds new light on the situation there is one scene near the end that is very subtle but perfectly captures what i think would be a real life reaction instead of over the top movie reaction the subtlety is in a character in the background of the scene recent events and revelations have left him confused and emotionally overwhelmed basically he doesn't know what to make of things instead of having him act out something or look all gape mouthed dumbstruck he just stares off at some fixed point unable to react or say anything at all it's like someone just pulled the plug on him his reaction rang true to me and i appreciated the scene br br like most korean films there is a mix of action bravado slapstick and melodrama korean films often take abrupt turns see sex is zero for a great example which can be quite a shock for the uninitiated go ahead and initiate yourself with this one like it love it or hate it i think most viewers will be able to relate to and appreciate the characters' actions and reactions
<START> there's potential in there with tell no one a curious and intriguing plot and a french take on a very american story but for me the opportunities were not exercised here br br although i liked aspects of this film there were three prominent failings which pulled it right down to four out of ten br br firstly it's a silly clichÃ©d murder mystery a particularly contrived murder she wrote or bergerac being french doesn't eliminate this problem it's just silly and in french at the same time it's full of implausible coincidences br br secondly the transition from the us to france seems to have failed chronically this french doctor hanging out on the streets of a french city with his new homies and their suvs and then there's the car chases br br but thirdly and mostly it's just too darn long to me a film needs a good reason to be significantly over 90 minutes and over two hours takes some serious justification this once didn't have it
<START> thorn bmi is out of business before they stopped making films they made a chiller of a movie using e s p and telekinesis as the basis of the daughter whose father mastered a terrible power only in the death of her father did olivia find that her father dubbed from had really murdered 6 girls and was planning two more by using the technique of vampirism br br our picture starts with 6 coroner wagons pulling in and music to match the discovery of the 6 girls dead all with their eyes wide open in a closet in the walls were all kinds of objects the men were pulling up an old man when blue lightning hit the ceiling which caused a circular hole to form only made the film more bizarre br br if you like extremely chilling scenes this for you unless you can see dead bodies from years ago in each level of decay don't view it without a friendly companion like the changeling it has some heart stopping horror in it i gave this a rating of 7 it's in color actress meg tilly debuted in this film if you can find it see it
<START> 30 years after the original film goodbye mr chips was made over as a musical peter o'toole and clarke starred in this wonderful remake of the beloved schoolteacher who is referred to as chips by his beloved wife br br o'toole was excellent here and received another oscar nomination you have to wonder what peter o'toole has to do to win an oscar he has lost the coveted award 8 times now you also have to wonder that he lost in 1969 to john wayne for true grit which was really a testament to mr wayne's long career and popularity this year was also marked by great performances by richard burton anne of the thousand days as well as dustin hoffman and jon voight for midnight cowboy br br surprised to see clarke cast as mrs however as this was a musical a beautiful voice came well through and she did a nice piece of acting as well br br who can forget the scene when chips carries on in the class despite the news that his beloved has been killed in a bombing he never got to tell her the wonderful news of his pending promotion br br the beautiful cinematography and music only enhanced a truly memorable experience
