<START> this movie had a very convoluted plot and very contrived setting that i frankly could not follow which is surprising considering the acting and dialogue could have only been the product of a writing if you like kathy ireland then maybe you'd want to see this the movie was probably made as a vehicle to try to get her into hollywood but if that was its goal i would have to say that i hope she didn't invest too much money in its production
<START> okay here's the deal there's this american pilot who's flying along minding his own business when suddenly he's outnumbered by evil cowardly non american fighter planes they're middle eastern types but suffice to say they don't like apple pie or elvis presley who proceed to shoot him down now this american pilot was doing nothing wrong but those evil non americans didn't care and before you know it he's banged up in a foreign jail and sentenced to death br br now what would normally happen here is that the us military would carpet bomb a couple of nearby towns until the pilot was released but not this time those evil peace lovin' types probably got involved and managed to stop any kind of massacre as you can imagine this doesn't please the pilot's family and the evil foreign dictator has this smug contented look about him he'll make those americans pay oh yes indeed br br but he didn't reckon on doug masters the captured pilots 16 year old son you see doug has been able to fly a plane longer than he can drive a car which can't be that long and decides to fly into that evil foreign country and get his dad back so with the help of his friends doug and his retired pilot sinclair doug launches a two man air raid on the foreigners br br now you'd think that this plan would be bound to fail but you'd be wrong sure those middle eastern types might be all veteran pilots but got an ace up his sleeve he listens to rock music when he flies after shooting down a dozen or so enemy planes and blowing up an oil refinery doug lands at an airport and gets his now wounded dad onboard the plane understandably the evil not quite so smug anymore dictator gets quite annoyed at these antics and takes to the skies himself in bid to shoot down doug but the young lad listens to some more rock music and blows the villain out of the sky hurrah br br after doug and chappy have shot down 90 of their air force the foreigners send up their last few planes in a rather poor attempt to shoot doug down but in the nick of time a flight of us turn up and scare them away br br i cannot recommend this film enough it was the first ever videocassette movie that i brought and until i was twenty i kept hoping that my dad would get shot down over a foreign country so that i could rescue him but he's doesn't like flying so it didn't happen
<START> i have never missed an episode david morse is a wonderful actor and i am hoping that this show can survive it certainly beats out that csi crap i love the storyline and would actually like to see him as a cop again someday i give the show a 10
<START> a heap of human flesh lies asleep on a red pillow this is the hunk of naked meat that is little joe a new york hustler who lives with his bisexual wife and baby child the film follows a day in his life after he's woken from sleep by his wife demanding that he go out and do the traditional male thing be a breadwinner but the use she wants to put the bread to is to pay for her new girlfriend's abortion we certainly aren't in the traditional family unit here br br after playing with his child joe hits the streets to cruise for johns the clients come thick and fast the ordinary gay man who wants to meet him again because they work well together the old english classical scholar who pays 100 to see joe pose like an ancient greek athlete the female topless dancer who blows joe then boasts about being raped the ageing gym bunny who doesn't think that what he and joe do together is queer after a hard day's work joe returns home exhausted only to be put down by his wife and the girlfriend he goes back to sleep as they harp and undermine him br br flesh is fascinating as it takes what is a traditional classical mainstream structure it has an inciting incident the money for the abortion and set up a confrontation and a resolution albeit a very downbeat one even a protagonist with a strongly motivated goal and then proceeds to concentrate on the details of the day to day routine of these people who are perfectly ordinary to themselves but extraordinary to most mainstream people it all seems very authentic and natural it's hard to see the acting the actors are so fully being their roles but yet the whole thing is a piece of cunning artifice a beautifully drawn portrait or an intricately carved statue director morrissey carefully plants every incident every encounter around his theme of human flesh become packaged commodity but with such cunning slight of hand that you almost don't notice him doing it the wife packages joe's sexual organ the old englishmen laments a long gone order of classical beauty which created art and poetry from human beauty the transvestite friends of the stripper package themselves as women whilst reading a hollywood magazine in which real women are packaged as products the gym bunny buys joe's friendship and affection thinks artificial porn is real and can't tell as we can't that joe is performing his friendship and intimacy for the cash the film itself presents itself as the ne plus ultra of cinematic realism but what we might as well be dealing with here is fine art or an early example of concept art br br the genius a word not lightly used of morrissey was to find a way of taking warhol's arty pretensions to film making which were interesting sure but boring as hell and making them into saleable products which remain amongst the most intriguing works of cinema art ever made commercial cans labelled flesh and trash and heat with a product label andy warhol which sells an idea about the product as much as the product itself yet just as you reel from morrissey's cynicism you are spellbound by his ability to still maintain the highest of standards and depth of meaning the constant what seem like camera flashes continually draw attention to the filmic nature of what one is witnessing yet you get drawn into the illusion all the same flesh is surely one of the most extraordinary pieces of cinema magic to ever spellbind an audience
<START> the original psycho 1960 is widely considered as alfred hitchcock's best work and certainly in my opinion is one of the best movies of all time the decision to film a shot by shot remake is therefore a little puzzling br br the cast in the original was flawless so the cast of this remake had a lot to live up to vince vaughn as norman bates was not a good choice for the lead he is too much of a pretty boy hunk and is not very convincing as bates i can imagine actors such as mark wahlberg or john turturro doing a much better job in the role anne heche as marion crane does a creditable job but one keeps mentally comparing her to janet leigh julianne moore is a much better actress than she shows here and mortenson merely walks through his role the best of this new cast is william h macy as the private detective br br although director gus van sant does an acceptable job he can't build the suspense the way hitchcock did and why did he change the scene in the basement of the house in the original the atmosphere is dark and damp and closed in whereas in this version it takes place in a brightly lit laboratory like setting and i think the black white photography of the original has a definite advantage over the color version br br maybe another flaw could be the fact that most moviegoers have seen the original and know what is going to happen and when br br all i can say is if it ain't broke don't fix it br br
<START> thought provoking humbling depiction of the human tragedies of war a small but altruistic view of one family's interactions with the enemy during the civil war in kentucky this movie lessens the glamor of war showing it's effect on not only the soldier but the entire family unit br br a lot of today's movies show war as an opportunity to highlight the hero's and other glamorous features of war but very little attempts to show the true effect war actually takes on a community this movie attempts this through a retelling of a person's memory of those days this movie is stated to be loose translation of an actual events when in reality this movie is probably a factual reality of hundreds perhaps thousands of actual events during the civil war i highly recommend those interested in our civil war to watch this movie
<START> maybe james p lay knows what do to in the sound department if a director him br br in 2007 ' however he cannot accomplish anything as a writer or as a director br br there is absolutely nothing in this film no story no character building no events no atmosphere no plot no twists no acting that deserves that name br br in any of those departments this movie is billions of light years behind any short film that has some actual thinking in it even a one minute one br br it has nothing to do with any of david lynch's works br br i actually think it could be used as mental torture or as negative propaganda material against the west br br recommend it only to your worst enemies
<START> i love this film i've seen it 1000 x on dvd and i cant say enough about it it has it all comedy awesome action and incredible stunts fx samuel jackson steals the show here big time i dont think there isnt a moment that he's in that he isnt funny everyone knows that when you make an assumption you make an ass out of you and the f x are great the bridge truck explosion is incredible although the sound isnt all that great when samuel drives out of the truck the sound is off a little i think and what he says is priceless for those of you who own it on dvd put the audio in french it's even emotional moments are great when the bad guy discovers that sam's charlie's daughter is his is great this is a great film that no action fan can do without i also reccomend cutthroat island aside from all the negative publicity it kicks
<START> what makes this documentary special from a film making perspective is its which engages the audience to in the delight of gypsy music it innovates the form of documentary while showcasing a tapestry of sound and movement that invites us to celebrate the primal similarity found within the traveling music of historically traveling peoples br br indeed the film itself is a single take of sweeping movement that travels the globe and transitions effortlessly from one rhythmic culture to the next br br watching this film one's breath is taken away by the simple beauty in our common connection to music rhythm and dance if there is a more deeply spiritual flowing homage to the sound and movement of gypsy cultures it has yet to be filmed
<START> this movie spends most of its time preaching that it is the script that makes the movie but apparently there was no script when they shot this waste of time the trailer makes this out to be a comedy but the film can't decide if it wants to be a comedy a drama a romance or an action film press releases indicated that shatner and hamlin made this movie because they loved the script what were they thinking if you like william shatner i do see free enterprise instead
<START> please if this is about technology and what man does to kill others and ourselves i think i missed his entire point because i walked out feeling like relied on cold war era footage of space exploration and had nothing new to add to the dialogue about fears of technology trails of 1 and 0 denoting technology and math and science done that anyone out there see the matrix and motion studies of people in motion ever heard of edward at least he uses exact clips of photographs of human motion studies br br this film was derivative and the score is just enough philip glass to sound like everything he's done in the past 10 years avoid this film at all costs
<START> what do you do if you're aishwarya rai coming off of a blockbuster film like with some skeptical critics still relentlessly unsatisfied with your astounding performance or convinced by your strong screen presence and stellar acting skills what do you do go home sit down and pout no if you're aishwarya rai you sign yourself up for the next strong period piece that comes along and continue to prove yourself worthy of all the praise kudos great scripts and equally great roles and that's just what she did with and in bali a passion where she stars and shines as a young widow who causes controversy way ahead of her time directed by who later goes on to direct her in the equally stellar chatterjee devdas in costars
<START> as a nice anecdote to one of the above comments in was in mumbai about two weeks before the release of this movie i was approached being white to dub some of the lines of this movie in a recording studio br br while i speak german as well i was kindly asked to do all dubbing scenes in english otherwise it would be too confusing for the indian audience so therefore all germans in this movie actually speak english funny enough i did multiple characters so if you would want to actually spoil some time by watching the movie again listen carefully br br all non indian characters are only done by 4 voices
<START> i must say every time i see this movie i am deeply touched not only by the most painful four years of life but also by how his family deals with his drug addiction it is also true that getting addicted to anything such as drugs alcohol or pornography cannot only hurt you but also hurt your most important people in the world your family since family is the 1 priority in the asian culture it takes guts for the circle to gather together and show one person how much the family loves him her this is actually the first chinese movie that i actually enjoy not for the fun of it but the elements surrounding it superb acting touching story great direction make this movie worth watching what stands out the most is that and his family act out the story themselves instead of having some b movie actor trying to imitate the real person it shows the genuineness of the movie
<START> because that's what hell ride pretty much is larry bishop and tarantino partying on the money with the promise to deliver a movie sometime down the line i'm all for fake boobage and booze as much as the next guy but did we really need the movie really there's nothing worse than the reheated second hand leftovers of an old trend and i'm not even talking about 70's grindhouse cinema because hell ride has none of the raw and unpolished feel of the era it purports to pay homage to no this is slick and glossy mtv hollywood through and through the old trend i'm talking about is the self consciously pseudo hip quirky cinematic world where tarantino meets guy ritchie and robert rodriguez all three guys were at least talented and found success for a reason hell ride is just a second hand copy fickle and uninspired polished to the max when it should be raw the aspect coming off forced and silly br br there's no reason for example why such a simple and utterly inane story has to be told in convoluted back and forth in time fashion it's just a post tarantino quirk there's also no reason why the dialogues have to be so mind numbingly pointless people flapping their gums while saying nothing at least when travolta was talking about cheeseburgers in pulp fiction it felt fresh dialogues here amount to little more than pseudo macho posturing there's also no reason why a grating rock'n'roll guitar has to aimlessly over the entire movie perhaps the lowest hell ride hits is when it tries to be quasi existential there's a hilarious dream illusion scene in the desert where bishop eats peyote and sees colours i was half expecting an old indian to come out and offer nuggets of wisdom br br the only saving grace of this abysmal turd is the boobage and vinnie jones' monologue about his wings and maybe some of the desert exterior shots lots of boobage and hot scantily clad babes now that's something i can get behind but a movie they don't make everything else is just an empty shell an imitation of other infinitely more talented imitators
