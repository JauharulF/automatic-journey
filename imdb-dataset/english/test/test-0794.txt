<START> ignoring rocky 3 this is easily hulk hogan's best film and it still rates as one of the worst films ever hulk hogan essentially plays hulk hogan bringing his wrestling buddies in for a film with all the cliches to go along with it the crooked promoter the unstoppable monster the injured kid the sexy woman and dookie
<START> if you enjoy riddles and suspense you will enjoy this movie truth be told it was mostly the adrian paul part that got me to pick it up i knew almost nothing about the movie beforehand plot is sarah carly pope a student of philosophy and metaphysics starts playing a mysterious riddle game trying to figure out the reason and gets involved in the game by solving riddles vern adrian paul is a shop owner also a riddle fanatic and also gets entangled in the game myth has it that if you solve the game the meaning of existence referred to as the design is revealed brendan character is a village idiot type hanging around the shop who turns out to be more than he seems all in all i thought the movie was pretty well done and it's definitely an original concept a rare find these days i personally happen to like riddles and puns so while most of them weren't very difficult it was still a fun movie well worth the rental br br so if you haven't seen it get it d br br
<START> rendition presents a very topical matter in the form of a very tense thriller it's a gripping and not a preaching movie seeing it in an arab country with a mixture of arabian and european audience gave it an extra level of atmosphere the audience was totally gripped by the film and gave it a loud applause afterwards the story of an egyptian married to an american picked up on the suspicion of links to terrorist organizations and shipped to a friendly with us arab country for enhanced interrogation as meryl streep's character states in the film we have no torture in the us seems to be from the front page of todays news there is a very neat link between the various characters which appear in the movie and the pace of the film never drops the seems to be as stated by jake character in the film that by abducting and torturing suspects you create many more terrorists the acting is uniformly excellent with streep and reese witherspoon the stand outs not to be missed
<START> i didn't like watching ds9 compared to other star treks even enterprise but i didn't like babylon 5 and now i know why they are the same show i just read the old news that paramount stole the idea from the creator of babylon 5 but they chose not to sue for a reason i don't know or care but seeing as a star trek series is based off another even nerdier show is just to much to bare now i will condemn anyone who even mentions the ds9 when talking about the series original tng and voyager are my favorites in that order before i didn't understand why everyone thinks ds9 is great and i didn't but know i know it's also because the captain has a real anger problem and i hate people that act cool but freak out out of no where and he seems to on every episode
<START> you can only describe this with one word and that would be wow wow i really did not think piece of crap like this could ever be released if you watch a movie titled ninja then you expect to see at least some cool martial artists right however none of these guys know any martial arts whatsoever and it seems like they went to china and picked the first people they saw on the street and trained them for a day in martial arts that's the level of their martial arts skills the actors are way overacting the special effects are ridiculous and there is not any plot that makes any sense this is the worst martial arts movie i've ever seen and i have seen plenty
<START> wow i love this movie this is definitely added to my list of ghetto movies br br juice starring tupac 'i don't f ' menace ii society o dawg 'i'll smoke anybody i just don't f ' new jersey drive hey they steal cars in broad daylight they obviously don't f br br new jersey drive is the best hood movie ever it is at the top of the list menace ii society is second and juice is third clockers is really stupid br br the soundtrack for new jersey drive is too mac mall young lay all about my is heard through out the movie br br lords of the underground burn rubber another good song and so is ill al scratch don't shut down on a player br br if your a fan of gta sa you'll freaking love this movie and the amazing soundtrack the soundtrack is basically rap about stealing cars movie
<START> don't watch this movie expecting the jane austen wit crisp dialog or clever social commentary this time around the premise of northanger abbey has been updated in a very sensual way br br in this version catherine's erotic daydreams are not just silly fantasies but a connection to the world of adult sexuality she is just peeking into with her daylight adventures by day she is very prim and demure and her swain henry treats her with the utmost courtesy but as her own sexual nature awakens her daydreams shift every so subtly from mild to steamy to lurid br br at the beginning of the story catherine's visions of sex are based entirely on the gothic novels she devours in bed it is both heartwarming sexy and provocative to observe the way her dreamy picture of handsome henry dissolves into a lurid dream of being carried off and ravished by romantic villains at the same time it is wry and touching to cut back to her bed in the morning catherine sleeping peacefully looks so innocent one would never guess what really goes on in that pretty little head br br later after being invited to henry's castle catherine overhears a family argument and totally misunderstands its meaning jumping into bed she covers herself up with the bedsheets and lies awake listening fearfully her striking blue eyes the only visible sign that she is alert little by little however those pretty blue eyes and close as she drifts into another heated dream of innocent desire this time catherine dreams she is in elizabethan times waiting fearfully outside the castle for the approach of the it's pretty clear she is more excited than terrified by the idea of being carried off by bandits she all but shudders with excitement and anticipation but then after a shot of her running frantically to escape we are back to the daylight world where the maid is scolding her for having made a mess of her room before falling into a sound sleep it's worth noting that catherine's heavy eyed yawning in the morning light is itself a rather sensual symbol of how passionate her dreams have been br br ultimately of course catherine's stern and unimaginative lover henry the nature of her fantasies and gives her a stern lecture it's interesting that catherine's immediate collapse into tears symbolizes not a retreat but an advance into adult relationships in the next scene she tearfully burns her gothic romance and throws herself and sobbing onto the bed significantly this turning point is also marked by catherine falling into a deep sleep except that this time there are no dreams of make believe passion presumably catherine has matured enough to be ready for the real thing br br though katherine schlesinger has lovely blue eyes and a lively expression and all her performance is charming it must be said that outside of the heated dream sequences this movie adaptation is excruciatingly dull i'm giving it 9 stars only because the truly romantic may enjoy it purely on a daydream level br br if you'd like to read a book about a genuinely strong willed young heroine who overcomes real darkness and danger in a real gothic setting i highly recommend the perilous gard by elizabeth marie pope
<START> the stepford children is the second best stepford movie in the stepford series i saw the original the stepford wives in the theater when it came out in 1975 i was absolutely blown away it was terrific i have seen all of the stepford movies and i like all of them i think that the stepford children is such a campy and fun movie i just watched it again recently on tape and i enjoyed it immensely the cast in this movie was real good to watch barbara eden did a bang up job as usual every role that she has ever played has been very good barbara eden is very good at playing roles where she is a kind and nurturing type of person don murray as the husband and father was just perfect in this movie he was particularly effective at being the irritated father to his two teenage children i made sure that i have all of the stepford movie on tape to enjoy if you get a chance to see this movie you should
<START> alexander nevsky 1938 is a brilliant piece of cinematic propaganda the people of russia are threatened by two major enemies the mongols and the teutonic knights of the holy roman empire in ordered to unite the warring rival princes in the russian realm nevsky takes charge and fights the lesser of two evils the this influential film was copied many times over and it still holds up to this day the soundtrack by composer and direction are a sight and sound to behold many years later john milius used many of the movies scenes set pieces and costumes from this film and incorporated them into conan br br one of my favorite lines from conan was taken from this movie it's not the strength of the iron in a weapon but the strength of the person that wields it is what matters the comparisons are unmistakable the armor that james earl jones and the leader of the teutonic knights wear are virtually identical a true tribute paid from one director to another br br i give alexander nevsky one of my highest recommendations the movie plays like the final act of richard iii the presence of prince alexander on the screen is truly amazing
<START> a very strange disturbing but intriguing film i don't think i ever needed to see what a human being can do with his butt and i doubt if i'll ever want to see it again that said there is much to be amused by like take on jayne classic walk in the girl can't help it and putting slabs of meat between her legs in a grocery store a gritty feel very much like a russ meyer film generally poor acting with the notable exception of divine
<START> meatballs has been a main staple in my family for over 26 years we saw this movie when it first came out and have seen it dozens of times since bill murray is at his best and is most touching in the scenes where he reaches out to a lonely pre teen boy and befriends him while leading his into once mischievous scheme after another the cast of characters are fun and zany and you really come to care about them and the relationships they have with each other this is not another sleazy dumb teen sex fest it is funny and sweet and just all around fun anyone who sees this will enjoy themselves it is a must see watch out for spaz he is by far the best character especially during the camp social while bill murray hams it up for the camera just watch spaz behind him dancing with the poor girl he picks to dance with by far one of my very favorite comedies of all time
<START> the willies starts late one night as brother's josh joshua miller kyle jason horst are camping outside with their cousin michael sean astin they decide to pass the time by telling scary stories br br first up is michael with a story entitled 'bad in which a young boy named danny hollister ian fried is bullied at school however the sinister new janitor mr jenkins james karen decides to help him out br br next up is kyle as he tells a strange story called in which an overweight bully with a worrying fascination with dead flies gets what he deserves in a horrible twisted way br br written directed by brian peck the willies didn't do much for me i doubt it'll do much for you either the script is strange as far as episodic anthologies go instead of the usual three or four stories it only has two main tales a few bizarre 'urban type mini scenes at the start these consist of the person who orders food from a fast food restaurant only to find a dead rat in her chicken a man who dies of a heart attack on a ride someone who tries to dry her poodle off in the microwave only for it to explode i have no idea what the purpose of these scenes are but they add nothing to the film as for the two main stories they are both weak for a start they are too long which is a huge mistake in these types of films usually the stories in anthologies are short sharp quick with a nice twist at the end usually involving people getting what they deserved however in the willies the stories last for the best part of 40 minutes each which is longer than the average tv episode i must admit i found both stories very boring they have very little going for them seem to be aimed at children the first story is the better to watch as a whole but it has no twist ending as far as i could see while the second one has a nice 'just ending but the build up to it is weak drawn out for no good reason i really like horror anthology films so the willies comes as a disappointment frankly it lets the genre down br br director peck was obviously working on a low budget as a whole the willies is pretty tough to sit through there's plenty of continuity errors it's poorly made there's no atmosphere there's no scares there's no gore the special effects are poor it features unnecessary shots of a dirty toilet several times overall it's a pretty unappealing film to sit through br br technically the willies is rough around the edges to say the least the effects are far from special it has an extremely drab grainy look to the picture the acting is poor no ones going to win any awards thats for sure br br the willies is a poor film it's not scary it's not fun it's not entertaining it only features two overlong stories definitely not recommended
<START> i saw this on the shelves at the rental place and i have rented everything else so i said why not why not is because it's one of the worst movies i have ever seen it looks like it was shot with home camcorder i guess thats all the budget would allow there was less boobs in it than i thought there would be some people made it out to be soft porn with a few killings the funniest part of the whole movie to me is in the extra stuff there is a spot with deleted scenes well there is only one but it is the dumbest and i think it may have brought the rest of the movie down the girls get in a hot tub and find some chocolate syrup in the bathroom yes it ends up all over them great stuff this movie is very very bad don't bother
<START> oh dear what can i say about half past dead i was really disappointed in it i was thinking a steven seagal movie cool we'll get to see him kick people and flip people and break bones we might even get to see him have a stick fight with somebody excellent br br however i was in for a rude awakening this film can be summed up as follows br br take an episode of the a team remove the lovable and roguish characters such as murdoch hannibal mr t and face then get a writer director to pen a plot even ed wood would be ashamed of and who's too big a fan of the matrix and john woo movies for his own good throw in a bunch of people with really bad acting ability and who don't have real names finally add in a main star who's getting saggy around the midriff and doesn't appear to be able to do his own stunts anymore br br the result half past dead an action movie so ridiculous that it at least made me smile right the way through the plot holes are stupendously glaringly large for example prisoners who when the jail is invaded fight the invaders rather than attempting to escape or how about the prison itself which has an armoury that contains heavy and rocket propelled grenade launchers you also have a helicopter bearing a striking resemblance to a huey with some kind of video game mounted in the nose br br then there's seagal himself i like the guy he can fight he's even witty in a way that jean claude van damme will never be but all through the movie i kept hoping for that one great defining fight scene never happened instead we got people firing guns a lot and not hitting a whole hell of a lot i mean when someone runs down a narrow corridor and you fire a sub at them there isn't a whole lot of places the bullets can go other than down the corridor and into the target yet somehow they miss even the a team would cringe at this foolishness and then when it gets to any kind of one on one physical stuff we get treated to a shabby matrix rip off without the benefit of bullet time people getting kicked twenty feet through the air and sundry other ludicrous acrobatic nonsense br br c'mon steven you're better than this your career can't be over say it ain't so br br this is instantly forgettable except i'm forcing myself to remember for the purposes of this review and if you watch it try to find it amusing in an a team kind of way but i doubt it'll be high on anyone's re watchable list out for justice this ain't more like out to lunch
<START> in a lot of ways this film defines the essence of everything i love about cinema in terms of capturing those strange elusive moments of unguarded truth in other ways it is undeniably an amateurish unfocused result of junkies self indulgently fooling around with a camera ultimately it comes out somewhere between pure brilliance and unwatchability thankfully much more so the former than the latter part of me wants to reward it solely for it's absolute and moments of pure sublimity but at the same time i can't completely ignore the occasionally downright awful acting and overtly bad production values at first the editing seems overwhelmingly sloppy and needlessly distracting or maybe just innovative but after a while i got used to it which is in the end the true sign of whether a film succeeds on it's own terms or not i guess that answer basically sums up my all around feelings for the film that is despite it's in flaws on a whole it does work very well and if nothing else a film like this really shows how false and contrived the faux documentary shaky cam style can sometimes be when it so obviously applied purely for effect such as in films like the otherwise admirable roger dodger here the aesthetics are plainly derived from the necessities of the filming situation and are not just used arbitrarily to make it look cool
