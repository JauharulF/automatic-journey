<START> everyone knows that late night movies aren't oscar contenders fine i mean i'll admit that i was a bit tipsy and bored and figured i'd get to some skin a max it's pretty bad when the info on the tv guide channel makes fun of the movie in the description it even gave it half a star to be fair i did sit throw the whole thing cause man it was bad i couldn't stop laughing i mean the words coming out of these people mouth and how they were trying to be serious most of the time i think the people on the screen were trying their hardest to not to laugh in fact i think in one scene they did laugh anyways the movie didn't make sense it was like that one sopranos episode with the fat gay guy only the sopranos is great show but it was terrible i mean no nudity just sex scenes out of the 90's you know the kind that use shadows and silhouettes instead of flesh i gave it a two cause this flick makes for a good drinking game movie i mean with all the cheese it helps to get the wine out if its late at night and all that is on tv is this and that tony little guy and his exercise bike then i suggest tony little
<START> film follows a bunch of students in the nyc high school of the performing arts there's coco irene cara a black singer who will make it to the top despite everything she's helped by bruno lee a white musician then there's doris maureen who wants to be an actress but she's shy and scared she becomes friends with paul purportedly the only gay student in the school and is romanced by raul barry miller then there's leroy gene anthony ray who sadly died in 2003 who's homeless and a great dancer but can't read then there's various teachers albert hague anne meara stand out trying to teach the kids br br the songs are great the title tune and out here on my own were nominated for best song fame won the dances are energetic and the young cast shows plenty of ambition and talent but this film misses the boat in the drama department many plot lines are brought up and completely left open ended by the end of the movie why did coco do a porno did doris and raul remain together afterwords did either make it how about montgomery what happened to him and did leroy ever graduate and how there are too many long speeches raul has two and moments that just lead to nothing i'm assuming there were cuts in the script i can't believe the movie just left all this open br br still it's worth seeing for the acting and again the music there's basically not one bad song and the dances go full force and at one point stop traffic literally my favorites are fame out here and i sing the body electric which is a great closing song so i recommend it but can only give it a 7 the script really needed to tie up loose ends and it didn't br br trivia they wanted to shot this film at the actual school for performing arts but couldn't get permission the dean of the school read the script and said there was way too much swearing in the film that is true there is a lot of foul language but that's how high school kids talk avoid the tv version which abysmally overdubs it
<START> because of the depth of his character studies and complexity of story lines james joyce's works do not easily translate into film yet john huston in his last film before his death achieved a perfect translation of joyce's story he received great support from his son as writer and daughter as actress
<START> i'm going to recommend putting this one in the skip it pile as well i was mildly excited by the concept when my fiancÃ©e rented it and a bit more excited when i saw that milos forman directed it ah well br br the costumes were nice sure but they were typical there was nothing about them that said they were from anywhere but the period costume department of any major hollywood studio there was no distinction between spanish british and french everyone dressed like they were at court in versailles the sets somehow didn't evoke the qualities of the settings the prison didn't feel like a prison the mansions didn't feel like mansions and the outside scenes looked like they were filmed on a back lot for all that they were probably practical locations br br the score was dramatically less than it could have been i have been a fan of film scores since my youth noticing appreciating and collecting them by which i mean more than john williams my fiancÃ©e is a professional film composer an award winner who has had her works performed at lincoln center and a rising star in the industry at the start of the film we had high hopes for it and it did indeed start off nicely it rapidly deteriorated and at several points including the scene of the release of the prisoners it actually reached a level of annoyance i actually reached for the remote to turn down the volume the score was never anything more than the most obvious choice for scoring a specific tone of scene and didn't integrate itself into the soul of the film think of the music in babel and you'll have an idea of what i mean it never attained the grandeur it wanted to but then neither did the film br br javier bardem as talented as he is was awful for the first part of the film his mannerisms are so distracting that it takes over his performance during the second half everything that was his character in the first half is gone replaced by an entirely different set of annoying mannerisms and he looked like the love child of keith richards and stuart lestat i never got the idea that he cared about the role which is to say that the character cared about his life and actions or that the character was ever drawn by the writers as anything more than an opportunist who for whatever reason changes his mind and decides to stick by his principles at the end br br natalie portman was very good although her performance lacked the shades of increasing insanity between her release from the prison and taking lorenzo's hand at the end that i would have needed to call it truly an effective performance the character of alicia was never defined enough to truly discern and if it weren't for the superb makeup on her eyes and cheeks someone seeing the beginning of the film and the end wouldn't know they weren't the same character the prosthetic teeth were horrible artificial and distracting but that's no knock on ms portman br br stellan skarsgÃ¥rd was fine as goya not oscar worthy but serviceable and generally believable i don't know much about the life of goya or his deafness but it seemed to be tacked on to the movie as a requirement of biographical information rather than anything that was utilized in the film i am sure it affected life much more than just requiring the need of an interpreter but you'd never know it from watching this for the record words and sounds can only be correctly interpreted roughly 30 of the time through lip reading br br don't get me started on randy quaid at least he was a minor character br br the script reads like one of the choose your own adventure books i used to read as a kid at several moments through the film several outcomes are possible and none of the actions preceding them lead with any certainty to the way the film actually plays out ironically the film is also predictable especially its meager attempts at the mood through small bits of humor the joke about the hands maybe it's because i paint not well as a hobby and know what a pita hands are to draw paint but i saw the joke coming a mile away as well as the reprise in the second half was the baby ever there for any other reason other than to be taken by there might as well have been a line of bread crumbs br br disappointing br br note this review is a copy of a reply i made to a thread in the forum
<START> the late shift was an interesting made for hbo movie that took a detailed look at the power struggle that ensued between david letterman and jay leno when johnny carson announced his retirement and both wanted to replace him this struggle is now part of hollywood folklore but for those who don't know the story and are aware of where letterman is now it might be interesting to learn that david letterman wanted to replace johnny carson as host of the tonight show more than anything in the world but letterman found his dreams being derailed as frequent guest host leno had one of hollywood's most powerful agents helen in his corner and working tirelessly to get her client the job it's not often that we get to see behind the scenes hollywood machinations recreated for entertainment value but for fans of these two late night superstars this movie provided a fascinating look at a very turbulent period in late night television according to this movie letterman was practically promised the job by carson himself while nbc had promised the job to leno and that's where helen came in the movie presents leno as sort of a milquetoast who allowed his career to be manipulated by and feigned ignorance to some of helen's strong willed manipulations of some of nbc's biggest power players and it presents letterman as this smart and savvy businessman who despite having carson's support was railroaded by nbc and john michael higgins and daniel roebuck credibly recreate letterman and leno respectively but it is the razor sharp performance of oscar winner kathy bates as helen that keeps this movie bubbling bates commands the screen in one of her best if not so well known performances as the venomous hollywood agent who eats television studio executives for breakfast there is also a wonderful turn by impressionist rich little as johnny carson but it is primarily a fascinating story and the powerhouse performance by bates that make this one worth checking out
<START> i have searched for this movie for years i have great memories of the first rate acting and singing in this movie i never knew that the reason the movie was unobtainable was because of the actions of the gershwin family shame on them for trying to suppress at american classic i can only hope they will and allow this movie to be release and enjoyed by the american public br br sammy davis jr is at his absolute best in this film the only other performance of his this is it's equal was in another terrific film that i wish would be released on dvd br br bess contained a first rate all star cast hopefully one day you'll get to see for yourself
<START> this movie is about london and it's an amazing movie it will be released on dvd in april 2003 and i will buy it when it gets out so if you have not seen it until then buy it the music in the movie is even better saint etienne have done the soundtrack
<START> i thought this to be a pretty good example of a better soft core erotica film it has a reasonable plot about the madame of a bordello caught up in a police scheme to nab a wealthy crook br br hardcore porn star chloe nichole again shows her genuine acting ability she will occasionally appear in soft core such as body of love and lady stories nicole on the other hand leaves something to be desired in her role as the female cop
<START> people please don't bother to watch this movie this movie is bad it's totally waste of time i don't see any point here it's a stupid film with lousy plot and the acting is poor i rather get myself beaten than watch this movie ever again
<START> excellent plot line makes this movie one of the classic cult ninja flicks of all time the plot being that this woman's soul is possessed by an evil ninja spirit i mean to be honest if i could obtain ninja ability through possession i would furthermore for being in the 80's and such the fact that the ninja aspect was far greater in this particular decade is evident and despite all that ninja 3 the domination manages to keep it original from the american ninja cookie cutter molds that plagued the 80's for so long this chick is definitely michael dudikoff on steroids i mean the first american ninja was great but let's get real folks it has nothing on ninja 3
<START> i rented this movie for about 1 50 the most complete waste of money and time i have ever spent it's lame i couldn't believe how they could come up with something like this br br the plot there is no plot everything you'd expect to happen it does only in a worse way the acting was horrible my dog could've done better the special effects have no effect whatsoever except inducing complete disbelief and the cheesy lines i mean why even bother br br the only credit i can give this piece of sh t are the opening scenes they were actually quite pretty and one of the reasons why i decided to rent this the graphics shown there are probably the best and most realistic cg of the entire film br br total reality gets 1 out of 10 for not being able to mark it lower
<START> i've seen a lot of bad movies in my life date movie that was bad but this this is just it's not good house party 4 is the worst movie ever it's as simple as that it's basically ferris bueller with black people in it oh and it's not funny it's awful so awful chris may be a superstar on bet but he's an idiot he can't write a comedy or a horror movie i like to refer to him as a blacker lesser known uwe boll except uwe boll's films are funny awful if you know what i mean you can invite some buddies over pop in alone in the dark and have a great time laughing and eating snacks with your buddies chris is like that except if you invite friends over to watch house party 4 with you no one will be laughing not even the biased token black guy or the illiterate jock i'm serious i didn't laugh once throughout this whole movie the acting is terrible and the movie looks like a bad indie film what was the budget for this movie 5 damn dollars i mean what the hell this movie just sucks don't waste your time with this crap it's disgusting
<START> never having seen an oliver stone film before nor any films starring eric bogosian i didn't know what to expect from this film having toyed with the idea of buying it for a while i finally got it for free as a supplement with a sunday newspaper and i was hugely impressed br br it tells the story of barry a talk radio host who can be incredibly rude towards his callers often putting them in their place before they realise what's going on though this is what has made him a popular radio show host it has also earned him numerous enemies br br the acting in this film was hugely impressive with not one dud actor in it eric bogosian is brilliant as barry the troubled talk radio host with alec baldwin turning in a strong performance as barry's boss dan it also features the voice of and cameo appearance by michael wincott my reason for wanting to see this br br the story was really well written as despite his arrogance you feel for barry as more about his troubled life is revealed and you see how vulnerable he really is br br i'd recommend this film to anyone as it is captivating and more importantly real on numerous levels two of which being that is was inspired by the life of an actual talk radio host and the fact that you do actually get radio show hosts and callers like the ones featured in the film in reality br br high recommendation and 10 10 br br aye yours cat squire
<START> as many know this is the feature film debut of edward d wood jr as as a writer producer director actor i have been a fan of ed wood for several years now while i don't like this as much as some of his other films it was probably the largest insight that the cinematic going public gets of wood during his life everybody knows that he was a transvestite this film is about changing one's sex and how being a transvestite can create conflict in relationships with loved ones this film is way ahead of its time in dealing with this subject matter and how it deals with it however the film still contains wood's usual pitfalls of bad dialog meaningless stock footage and hokey special effects throw in wood's usual overdose of bela lugosi hamming it up and you have wood's first attempt at being a director br br the plot is that a police inspector goes to a doctor after he discovers the body of a transvestite who committed suicide for advice on how to avoid further problems along these lines the doctor tells him the story of glen who is also a transvestite glen wants to marry barbara but can't bring himself to tell her about his secret he also tells the inspector about alan who undergoes a sex change because he is really more suited to being a woman bela lugosi plays a scientist who seems to add some kind of running commentary on what is going on lugosi's part really isn't well defined and proves to be most likely a vehicle for wood to have a star in his film and lugosi to get some cash br br all in all the movie shows the hallmarks of wood's career it was obviously shot on a very low budget and has quite a few things thrown in rather haphazardly it definitely has the it's so bad it's good feel to it however i do have to applaud ed on his progressive thinking in making this film transvestitism and sex changes were not extremely open subjects in the early 50s wood took a big risk in making a film that portrays transvestites as people who are not sexual deviants and putting a more human face on cross dressing
<START> writer director robert downey sr a pioneer of the underground film movement in the 1960s satirized the new york madison avenue advertising world with his avant garde comedy downey doesn't confine his ridicule to advertising but tackles black militant culture the dynamics in hollywood's portrayal of race the elite white power structure and character of corruption in any power struggle as audacious and ambitious as strives to be it qualifies as a terrible film amateurishly made on a shoe string budget with a no name cast and humor that lacks hilarity everything about this movie reeks with improvisation stirred up controversy during its initial release with its politically incorrect handling of race issues and consumer culture like most marx brothers movies the plot is thin providing an excuse for downey's anecdotal gags most of which are terrible br br the chairman of a prestigious madison avenue ad agency dies during a board meeting before the body has been removed the board holds a secret ballot vote to determine who will replace him each member understands that they are forbidden to vote for himself sheer accident occurs when everyone votes for the token black member arnold johnson since none thought anybody would cast a ballot for him pink slips all but one of the white executives surrounds himself with black pistol packing employees and renames the firm truth and soul advertising decides to alter the face of american advertising he refuses to accept clients whose products are alcohol tobacco or war toys clients stage an exodus after he becomes the ceo and attracts a new line up of clients that show up at his office lugging bags of money and prepared to suffer abuse from militant employees exploits his african american staff too ruthlessly appropriating their ideas after he fires them and conjures up a number of offensive advertising campaigns all of which are hailed as a 'new wave' of marketing genius incredibly conservatism proves successful but the agency becomes the target of government operatives who argue advertising tactics constitute a threat to the national security the high point of this black white 85 minute comedy are the television commercials shot in color unfortunately downey doesn't know when to cut off these ads that consistently start out cleverly but wear out their welcome the funniest part of involves our eponymous protagonist's dealings with u s president in washington d c pepi hermine a marihuana midget with a kissinger like teutonic adviser larry wolf spouting tasteless jokes while trying to convince to come up with an advertising campaign for his new car the 6
