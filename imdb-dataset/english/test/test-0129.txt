<START> whenever hayao miyazaki does the tri writes directs and animates a movie he makes a classic film for the ages he has done it again with no no br br the story is about a girl fish who is kept on a very tight leash along with her younger sisters by her father a bitter ex human wizard named fujimoto the fish escapes from her father and rides a jellyfish to shore where she is caught up in a operation and finds herself stuck in a bottle this underwater sequence must be one of the most elaborately drawn animated scenes ever undertaken and stands on its own as a reason to search out the theatrical release miyazaki who shows no fear of having a busy scene has outdone himself there were literally hundreds of individually drawn sea creatures of every imaginable size all in motion at the same time br br when the fish escapes the operation while still trapped in the bottle a five year old boy named spots her in the water and is able to break the bottle saving her since she is the result of her father's magic she is capable of magic herself and her father actively tries to retrieve her the boy names the fish just when learns that can speak her father successfully retrieves her back into captivity br br after a war of wills with her father manages to escape again with the ability to change herself into a human she meets up again with in a storm and the story continues from there in many interesting ways there is a cuteness factor in this film rivaling and arguably surpassing that of no totoro joe hisaishi once again provided outstanding musical support br br the story itself is simple as are miyazaki's films in general and should appeal to a broad spectrum of viewers while i haven't viewed it enough to be sure the film doesn't seem to be one which will keep scholars in long discussions as sen to chihiro no did nonetheless this is the ultimate feel good entertainment movie i gave the movie a ten out of ten rating
<START> was garbo's 14th film and the first in which her husky swedish voice was heard she plays the lead character anna who has struggled with being abandoned by her father chris a drunken barge owner played by george f marion and with the misfortune of the life she has has to lead to keep her head above water br br meeting irish matt charles bickford may mark the turning point for her or does it garbo looks and sounds great in this drama which although looking rather clunky and moving at a slow pace still manages to interest and engage an audience nearly 80 years later marie dressler makes an impact in the role which gave her a second flush of movie success in films such as min and bill dinner at eight and emma while marion and bickford are more than adequate br br an interesting slice of movie history garbo would do better talkies in the years following but will always be remembered for the first time she talked on screen
<START> not only have i read the book and watched the movie but i was stationed on the uss john f kennedy when they filmed this needless to say film crews and actors can be trying to people trying to do their jobs now about the movie as a career navy man i was pretty upset on how they showed life on board an aircraft carrier i could pick apart the inaccuracies throughout the movie anyone that has lived on a carrier could but that would take pages one scene that stands out in particular was when they were in the cic combat information center and they were watching a radar contact move across the screen each time the contact moved it beeped unfortunately that equipment doesn't beep like that i was a technician on that equipment the book was based upon fact the movie wasn't the follow on tv series was just as bad and the navy finally realized that support for this series would just make them look bad if you're a navy person watch this to see how a movie about carrier life is seen from the eyes of hollywood if your not a navy person watch midway or top gun at least those movies are entertaining and based upon fact
<START> sings david in this movie but it is it's all about america so don't be ashamed to watch it just think if you can to prevent more damage you know you're just the same regular guy next door so be careful one of the best critics of common mind and friendship still don't care go for it for the music it's worth a try just close your eyes and pat and david bowie will touch you so deep you'll start to scream and while watching if you'll dare to open your eyes please don't do the popcorn stuff you're gonna miss quite a lot you may think that it's not worth but think twice and don't look at your neighbours lawn you never know what to find there is it worth try it just don't die or over it
<START> riotously cheesy lunacy about lava spewing from the la brea tar pits in los angeles even if you attempt to suspend disbelief by ignoring this ludicrous premise you'll still be howling with laughter at the inane dialog nonsensical plot contrivances and wildly reckless scientific plot holes that parade across the screen br br i have a theory every successful actor is doomed to appear in at least one bad movie at some point in his her career this was tommy lee jones's turn although he makes a decent effort the script is just so pathetic even he goes down in flames oops sorry about that most of the supporting cast is also choked by the hackneyed writing a few of the actors simply phone in their roles anne heche deserves special hall of shame recognition for her awkward portrayal of a scientist she is about as convincing in this role as pee wee herman and even he would have at least done a better acting job br br since the scientific plot holes are too numerous to list here i would instead suggest that you screen the film with friends and have a game of find the scientific absurdities the loser could be forced to listen to tapes of corny lines from the movie like everybody looks the same over and over here's a sample of the kind of nonsense you can expect a scheme to blow up a building is devised engineered and the dynamite set and detonated all within a space of about 20 minutes br br let us not forget the obligatory disaster movie clichÃ©s divorced dads scientists who get ignored by everybody obnoxious cops tough street kids bratty teenagers greedy investors etc all are present and in abundance the film also bashes you over the head with a relentless barrage of political correctness br br for fans of cheese and silliness only all other viewers beware
<START> the questions and answers of the human spirit are all here in this masterfully crafted historical documentary the shear beauty and horror of one mans walk through life are revealed in totality dieter and herzog are combined and connected through a mental maze that has been transformed into a single straight hallway which the walls have been plastered with images created by one mans characterization of himself by the vibrations of his own vocal chords this film for about 80 minutes have discovered a new dimension of storytelling what do i call this apparently new sense only god knows after all isn't a miracle something that god does for us but chooses to remain anonymous br br this is a requirement to see if you like to experience the lovely horror of war this documentary will cleanse your soul to the marrow
<START> it's a shame that asterix and his buddy do not get the world wide recognition that other cartoon comic characters get br br this is another funny asterix cartoon jammed with entertainment the animation is excellent and the voice characterization good even if the synchronization is a little out the music and score fit well within the story and the in of some modern musical numbers is a nice touch br br the running time seems short and while it's not the best asterix story or the most developed cartoon it's good clean fun the modern disney like animation will capture children asterix fans and new comers enjoy the adventure
<START> this movie has the look and feel of having been put together in a matter of days kind of like plan 9 from outer space in spite of this it's still a classic ranking among my favorite creature features possible spoilers ahead count dracula and larry talbot aka wolfman arrive at the laboratory of dr edelman seeking a cure for their nocturnal anti social behavior such as killing people in the meantime kindly dr edelman discovers the body of the frankenstein monster becoming obsessed with bringing it back to life a common character trait among scientists mad or otherwise he goes against his better judgement resulting in monster mayhem and madness one of the final universal classics of it's time abbot and costello meet frankenstein followed 3 years later it rates a 10 with this reviewer onslow steven steals the show as good doctor gone bad after being infected by the blood of dracula and becoming a half werewolf vampire creature coming to a tragic end at 1 hour 7 min it packs quite a punch a worthy addition to my video collection br br rating out of
<START> i would have to say that in general barbie movies have impressed me i have a 5 year old barbie fanatic niece and she watches them all the time so needless to say i have seen quite a lot of barbie these holidays but i am not sick of them br br this film visually has a lot to offer especially the backgrounds and the animation of the characters has improved with each new movie one thing i noticed in particular was a vast improvement in the animation of hair in this film it has a lovely range of excerpts from classical music and i think that this is great as it exposes a new generation to the classics this film is well worth ago especially if you have young they will be entertained for hours
<START> this film really misses the mark on most fronts the accents are laughably weak the acting amateurish and the comedy weak at best br br they've got a great idea it could have been particularly enjoyable but for the reasons mentioned above br br the writer seems to think by putting the word f ck into every sentence it'll make it funnier and the main character just seems to try a little too hard he's no brick top thats for sure br br next time at least get a cast that can keep the accent for the whole film br br it's a crime to compare this to films like the business lock stock and snatch
<START> if you have ever shopped at wal mart then you probably know about the 5 dvd bin that sits by the electronics department well that is where i found this movie however i was tricked you see the cover of this particular dvd had a big picture of sandy bullock on it and even listed her name as a headliner i picked it up thinking wow i didn't know sandra bullock did this movie so i was pumped to go home and watch a cool sandra bullock movie much to my surprise ms bullock had a small role very small role she plays the girlfriend of the son of the cia agent talk about supporting actress she may have had no more than 2 lines in the movie besides being deceived of this being a bullock flick i looked past that and i continued to watch an action packed film negative at one point for special effects a gun was taped to the camera you gotta watch it to laugh at what horrible really is
<START> altioklar master of the thieves br br watch some movie steal some parts of them write a script it must be very easy to be a director in turkey i think altioklar watched identity 2003 saw 2004 a few series which is about crime murder etc then he said eureka eureka i have found it after that he wrote the script of the movie br br you can guess the murderer at the beginning of the movie it took only 10 minutes for me he shouted i'm the murderer i'm the murderer there is no mystery br br tamer karadagli is same sux exaggerated mimics funny macho man br br there is only one good thing in the movie the performance of is very good you may see the movie just for that
<START> the vampire craze has in my opinion actually proved its worthiness of such infamous there were many sub genre films last year from a multitude of countries i've reviewed many and have a few more to discuss forgive my indulgence but since i've recognized the trend as a phenomenon which it is and coincidentally features my favorite horror staple i'm going to now move outside of north america for a bit and introduce you to hopefully meaning films that you didn't see as of now br br of the many effects of twilight is the creation of guy and girl vampire movies i hate this sexist which has the effect of polarizing an entire generation of fans into sides i think men are prone to hate meyer's work and its offspring to some degree because they feel some sense of betrayal that an archetype which was always theirs is now liberated women may be unlikely to enjoy future neutral pics since they grew up with ironclad expectations that were enforced four times we need more directors to create vampire films which either gender is capable of enjoying unequally if vampires are going to survive the craze and remain relevant cue thirst this korean film was directed by park chan wook of oldboy fame there are two ways to dissect it either it between gender expectations and is universally marginally enjoyable or it is a floundering mess that doesn't decide which target audience it prefers and should therefore be viewed by no one don't let me convince you that the film has no inclinations its director is a man whose fame is story driven action films its protagonist is male and has a passive aggressive interest in his lover more on this later still his desire for a woman he has known both before and after mortal life is not contrived and his attention is returned there is a male slant to this picture yet it is not so one sided that women could not enjoy it the same cannot be said of or new moon br br the plot follows an emile zola novel called which i have not read according to wikipedia the novel is about an affair that develops between a married woman and a single man he kills her husband during a fishing trip and begins dating her the two of them are incapable of having sex because they picture the dead man's body between them they are thus driven to insanity but care for the woman's ailing mother at the novel's conclusion they try to kill each other discover each other's plans and commit suicide br br now this nearly 150 year old french novel into modern south korea and you've got thirst chan wook doesn't embellish the story enough to elevate this to must see he often ignores many of his own ideas in favor of following his inspiration i think the most memorable parts are when his scruples are unhinged by narrative his use of the mother in law as the foil for their bad romance is just perfect see it br br the protagonist is originally a devout christian who becomes a vampire after a faulty blood transfusion following his volunteering for a new medicine he thus becomes the god he once was smitten with people flock to him and view him as a grand healer ok that's really cool and could have provided a great basis for his relationship yet this idea is given little idea screen time as he changes into a realistic christ figure who tries to maintain his virtue even though his lifestyle demands that he relinquish it instead of confronting the delusional people he instead blood out of comatose hospital patients br br let's continue with the christian allusion the woman tricks the vampire man into killing her husband her overprotective mother in law suffers a stroke and eventually warns friends of the family of her daughter in law's treachery finger the man kills her but resurrects her the two of them invite former friends over and the woman begins mercilessly harassing the humans the man says enough is enough and decides to drive to a beach and forces her into waiting for sunrise with him they both die but he for her crimes and his own but the film portrays her evil more prominently br br the woman character is a caricature and her profession offers an explanation for her behavior she is a housewife with no education while the man is a priest whose mortal life was restrictive vampirism magnifies their characteristics she becomes a monster like one would expect of someone without knowledge he becomes a demigod with a spirit his life is how atheists view themselves and her life is how religious people view those without divine intervention
<START> the third entry in the stepford franchise but apparently the three made for tv obscure sequels are incredibly obscure and hard to trace down whereas the 70's original as well as the blockbuster remake with nicole kidman are commonly known and very popular i haven't seen either the early 80's revenge of the stepford wives or the mid 90's the stepford husbands but this the stepford children is a quite charming and highly entertaining little film it's basically the exact same film as the original obviously less mysterious yet much cheesier and incredibly 80's to the nth degree the main difference here like the title implies is that not just the liberated wives but also the rebellious and punk teenage offspring in town undergoes the typical and highly effective stepford treatment licensed by the local men's association for some reason the scenario attempts to uphold the stepford mystery until late in the film even though nobody is likely to watch this sequel before having checked out the original and presumably everybody also knows about the denouement the harding family is all packed and ready to move from the grisly city of new york to the small and peaceful community of stepford particularly father steven is excited about their new life because he already lived in stepford and always wanted to go back ever since his first wife whom his new wife laura and adolescent children mary and david know very little about died under mysterious circumstances the town is almost too perfect with picturesque neighbors and model students and especially the modern teenagers face huge difficulties to adjust their efforts to modernize the place and take the local youth of stanford in tow cause confrontations with the eminent townsfolk particularly the members of the men's association and put the familial relationships under a lot of stress david meets and falls in love with the last normal girl in school lois but when even she transforms into a domestic dummy overnight david can convince his skeptical mother to investigate the sinister stanford secret the first hour of the stanford children is slow paced and rather tame but the finale is trashy and cheesy like the vhs cover promises and like a late 80's thriller ought to be in fact the modus operandi behind the stanford secrets is illustrated in greater detail and i think horror fans and lovers of the original film will appreciate that at least i did the overall plot still doesn't make a lot of sense and the script is chock full of irrational aspects but it's nonetheless an engaging formula and undoubtedly one that evokes an atmosphere of suspense and fear the acting performances are far above average especially the arrogant and obnoxious members of the men's association depict plausible characters and even teenage players tammy lauren and randall give away impressive performances recommended without hesitation
<START> this is a teen movie and while u watch it expect some nonsensical stuff added here and there but overall the movie is effective very effective it makes you question and leaves you thinking the story is kinda far fetched but is believable and makes you feel good in sequences its not like its the usual done and tried path the characters are pretty well defined and are convincing justin long stands out among all the others and watch out for his speech in the end he will convince anyone with that speech he is simply brilliant in that speech he needs to take on some more serious roles he is worth more than just teen movies etch this movie and get liberated
