<START> i can't say if the cavern is a ripoff of the cave because i haven't seen that i've seen the descent and that's not terrible but it is very hard to watch and so is this one hard to watch as in there's very little light and lots of fast motion so you're hard pressed to say what you're looking at there are times when i guess you're supposed to be scared judging from the music but scared of what bad camera work poor lighting if that's the case than this should be the scariest movie made the story is that a bunch of cave explorers go to a cave in kazakhstan home of borat and make their descent but something is of course in there with them and what is it one guy says it's a wolf bear hybrid that is just before he gets ripped apart but whatever it is you can't see it and just when you think or hope the film is ending since the screen goes dark for a bit you see the two remaining the two women wake up somewhere in betty and attire and start trying to find their way out of wherever they are they do drink some water and start eating something until they figure out what it is and start puking and then the mystery of what's in the cave appears and you'll just be astounded maybe maybe not dumb dumb dumb i think i'm pretty well done with cave movies at this point 2 out of 10
<START> i bought this movie for a couple of dollars at a clearance warehouse sale one day when just looking around the cover looked pretty good in colour but the movie is b w i wish they wouldn't try to trap us with coloured covers on b w movies but it's a common thing to look out for br br when i watched it i was pleasantly surprised it turned out to be better than i expected i was disappointed that it was a b w but the effects are pretty good certainly better than say invaders from mars which has crappy effects and it is great to see john banner in something else apart from hogan's heroes br br overall this movie isn't too bad for a b grade and certainly worth the two dollars from a nostalgia point of view it isn't my favourite sci fi but it's not my worst either it's o k
<START> larry bishop the writer actor director focuses too heavily on the camera music and visuals the film resorts to meaningless ramblings and vulgar monologues which seem to have no purpose other than boring and irritating the audience the actors experience a bumpy ride from the film's start to finish and are caught in one terrible smoke screen the hell with the ride the film is a bomb br br the victors are presented as weathered vigilantes who seek their own form of justice for what they see as lawlessness they are bikers anti heroes and protagonists played by larry bishop is the leader of the pack the gent michael madsen is trapped in his own crossfire of chaos and psychosis br br comanche eric balfour is loyal but mysterious deuce performed by david carradine should have passed on the ride and so should the ticket buyers if you decide to see the film you'll be sorry but you'll find out why billy wings vinnie jones is a lewd and venomous character completely filled with disdain br br what puzzles me is how this film with all of its continual ramblings and vulgarity ever got anybody to invest in a ride that absolutely goes nowhere ticket buyers take my advice don't pay for the ride please don't make the same mistake as the investors br br the first fifteen minutes or so of the movie is confusing and unintelligible the dialog which rapidly turn into meaningless monologues doesn't make any sense the entire film is hell bent on going nowhere poor dennis hopper is caught in the middle of a real mess he too should have passed on the ride there are decapitated heads slashed throats and nude females wrestling it is clear that bishop doesn't know where he is going with the film he gets entirely lost but by the end of the ride you just won't give a damn mama mia stay home and by all means don't take the ride i rate this film a 1 out of 10 but this movie is so awful it deserves a zero
<START> i have to rate this movie at a 10 i'm sorry but i think it's classic comedy then if you're rating it to other madonna movies well what you wanna tell me it wasn't her best movie ever didn't mira sorvino win an oscar for almost the same performance not ten years later please this movie deserves much more credit than it gets plus i like to think of it as an a sociological study into the lifestyles of the 80's remember when you could from sam goody and in the same day remember when women wore bushy eyebrows proudly so it was no last emperor it was still good there are certain movies i'd be willing to watch everyday three actually that pep up my day and make me smile if you like who's that girl then i'd also recommend party girl and romy and michelle's high school reunion
<START> brilliant acting excellent plot wonderful special effects this is what i would say about this movie if i had been watching it with a bag of on my head for the entire film instead i endured a 2 hour crap o rama our brilliant story begins with some billionare who has nothing better to do than look in volcanoes in a vain attempt to find his lucky charms instead he finds a man in a cheesy rubber dinosaur suit and some queer cave folk br br in his infinite wisdom along with his infinitely large nose he decides to go inside this volcano with a team of special people to travel to this underground land they go by plane no boat no they use this giant soup can with a solid metal drill on the end that i swear i saw wobble in summation this movie was faker than oh that's right this was the fakest movie i've seen for those of you who haven't seen it and are thinking of sitting down on a sunday afternoon with this wonderful movie i warn you if you watch this movie you should be prepared to cut of any shred of your manhood and give yourself a full frontal lobotomy br br the rating system only allows for a minimum of 1 10 i give this a 10 10
<START> a wonderful story about the consequences of obsessive love with the beautiful romantic back streets of paris as its location we're transported through time and see the plot develop from the perspectives of the three main characters as the mystery unwinds
<START> we still really love the movie and soundtrack valley girl i have owned it on video for eons and wore out the original soundtrack i have several friends with whom i get together and we have 80's raves parties where we get together and play 80's music and run valley girl on the big screen and we're all in our 30's now we have an awesome time br br it's all in good fun like ya know
<START> where to start some guy has some indian pot that he's cleaning and suddenly skeletor attacks he hits a woman in the neck with an axe she falls down but then gets up and is apparently uninjured she runs into the woods and it turns out there's the basement of a shopping center out there in the woods she meets a utility worker and skeletor attacks again luckily like any good utility worker he's got a gun and shoots at the guy doesn't work everything starts on fire br br cut to some people walking through the woods even though they've been hiking together for some time they sit down and introduce themselves to each other wouldn't they have probably done that when they first met anyhow they're undercover delta team members undercover i suppose because that way they don't have to pay to dress them in uniforms the cute girls are various things such as a sniper school instructor and oh i can't remember the rest it doesn't matter eventually they all take their guns out and immediately start aiming them at various things anyhow they meet an old indian who is sitting out in the woods he wants beans you know like pork and beans he mumbles some stuff i can only assume that it's the premise of the movie i relied on having heard the premise from the commercials because you can't really understand anything he says br br so they walk around the woods some more all the dialogue is a load of quasi military macho bs i mean all of it as in every single word like this reminds me of when we were in kabul or this reminds me of when we were in skeletor attacks again let me give you a rundown of a basic attack one of the female characters is behind a tree and she aims her gun at the approaching guy on the horse for some reason she doesn't fire but yells several times for someone else then as skeletor approaches she jumps out from behind the tree so that skeletor can stick her with his spear then everybody starts shooting the bullets cause sparks to fly from the trees apparently the folks who made this movie never shot a tree with a bullet they don't make sparks br br then casper van diem is all of a sudden driving a semi truck trying to run over skeletor he misses and the truck slides to a stop van diem is injured apparently he slid across the seat and bumped his hip on the window crank or something so he crawls out of the truck and it explodes later he's in the woods dying and everybody says a bunch of quasi military macho bs they meet a couple guys in the woods and blow their undercover status by immediately identifying themselves as being from the army they beat on the guys for some reason then they go away br br some other stuff happens people mumble the camera shakes etc br br i think it comes to an end eventually br br my theory is that the sci fi channel is getting a little annoyed with everyone bashing their movies so they put this out to remind us all how bad movies can really be like you think our movies are bad well you haven't seen bad here's bad okay now that we've got that out of the way the rest of our movies are pretty good in comparison right br br well it's just a theory
<START> glenn ford a new york boy who has been saving his cash thumbs and hobos his way to the arizona ranch he has bought where he hopes to find heaven with a barbed wire fence br br a film with a dalton script and story directed by villain extraordinaire ricardo cortez and starring the frequently twitchy glenn ford and the restless richard conte just shouldn't be so bloody nice though the system mostly seen as mean cops and railroad bulls and real estate con men is as awful as one might expect from the mr every single proletarian is just so sweet and nice and salt of the earth that one feels nausea it doesn't help that the heroine a sweet blonde thing who is an illegal alien refugee fleeing franco's spain is annoying for reasons of both scripting and acting br br so why watch richard conte in his first role already has his persona and a pretty good part and there are some moments of 30s leftist camp that are pretty astonishing did dalton absolutely have to set a major portion of the movie in the russian worker's mission all that was missing was a portrait of a beaming joe stalin also this is glenn ford's first substantive role though his performance isn't good br br why not watch essentially the movie offers an unconvincing vision is wedded to a political viewpoint that is risible and the two leads have made much better movies also the strengths of dalton as a screenwriter are nowhere in evidence instead we get a film that the coen brothers barton fink could have written in a flash and avoided that hellish bout with writer's block
<START> watching the is not likely to result in deep thoughts unlike many other great ford films like the searchers my darling clementine the man who shot liberty valance and the grapes of wrath among others but it is likely to produce a feeling of awe and deep satisfaction the story is very simple two cowboys decide to help a wagon train of mormons get to california along the way they run into a medicine man whose mules ran away a group of bank robbers and some navajos there's a lot of adventure and excitement on the trail and the film is imbued with fun and beauty the music is absolutely beautiful the scenery again from monument valley is as beautiful as it ever was plus how can you go wrong with james arness the might not be one of john ford's better known films but it is nonetheless a must see if you get the chance 9 10
<START> i'm not one of those folks who bemoans everytime a film based on an old tv show comes out rather i usually run out and see it if i had watched the show and try to get nostalgic but if anyone feels like running down films based on old shows this is exhibit a so you can actually say something more than just navy mod squad is dreary tiring and lethargic at least the original series was angst riddled long before anyone knew teens could be so glum making it groundbreaking this is just tedious claire danes is nice to look at but does nothing else but mood swing and sneak around spying on the baddies giovanni ribisi's acting extent in this flick is that droopy the dog look for an hour and forty five minutes and omar epps looks like he wants to flee the set but the script's has trapped him sure the production is nice with the now seemingly rave nightclub opening action sequence and shootouts galore oh and the kids yell and get mad at each other and their superiors a lot too it's kind of like deciding to use the scooby doo mystery machine to go on a family vacation to hollywood with your teenage kids who you and your spouse know need heavy therapy and prescription drugs i really wanted to like this movie and there were promising moments but the next scene would suck the life out of it you can knock another spelling remake charlie's angels all you want but at least that film knew it wanted to have fun with itself the mod squad makes you wonder where the inspiration from the original series went
<START> most of the films i really like are art house fare and seldom appear on the box office top ten lists that said i found northfork utterly incomprehensible i have no idea what it was even about writing in the new york times about a different film stephen holden once observed that some people seem to think they can throw just anything up on the screen and have it work as a fairy tale i thought of that review several times while watching northfork br br on a scale of one to ten i gave it a two
<START> robin hood men in tights is worth watching i recently watched it because i've just become a cary elwes fan and this is one of of his lead roles some moments really made me crack up so hard i didn't expect them you know it was so funny even the 2nd time around you'd still fall off your chair the cast is great of course especially robin of himself cary but and the sheriff and little john don't let the name fool you it's big lol and everyone else br br there were some moments of course the film tried to make a comedic scene out of but you don't necessarily laugh at it but ok br br this is the second time cary elwes and patrick stewart appeared in a film together by the way they both worked on lady jane in 1986 and it was fun to see them 7 years later older awwww br br it's definitely worth watching quite hilarious indeed
<START> the whole shorthand for supposedly being more aware in this weird time is that you are blue the blue state mentality this is supposed to get us off the hook for what is was happening during the last few years in our country the usa it doesn't get anyone off the hook but it makes us feel better as though we aren't benefiting in any way from living here and getting all the good stuff that a us citizen gets just by being a us citizen br br but i'm so sick of bitching about this it doesn't do any good i haven't taken much action lately and i wonder how many people have maybe i'm just down because my job was outsourced last month and now i'm looking for work in the shrinking tech support field where most of the jobs are quickly going to india and other places overseas i'm thinking that soon it's not going to pay off to be a citizen here with the screwed up infrastructure and the shrinking job market and the obsession with war these days it seems like anyone who speaks out gets jumped and questioned about there patriotism anyway back to this review usa the movie is an obscure dvd that makes me realize that some people have taken action whether it's through politics protesting or arts or media the filmmaker is obviously passionate knowledgeable willing to go outside the norm frustrated unique astute etc br br i looked through the whole site that's linked to the dvd and got lost in all the articles essays etc that are there the dvd does that too has references to different times views and historical points sometimes someone does something out there
<START> if corky st claire in waiting for guffman had directed the citizens of blaine in a horror movie with comic undertones the result would have been very much like the monster br br to be generous this was the longest hour and twenty minute movie i've ever seen to call the pace glacial is to be kind br br almost nobody associated with this project ever made another movie with the exception of ben who did the really admirable considering the budget special effects he went on to do sound for movies like munich and several other big budget projects the narration is by veteran voice over actor paul frees who probably donated his efforts br br when you're watching the opening titles and see the unified school district listed as one of the producers you know you're going on a long strange trip br br pollution at the down dump in california becomes so toxic that it creates a monster remember that this is 1975 and ecology was a hot topic just a few years previously moviegoers had been treated to godzilla vs the smog monster br br so far so good the monster is a winged creature at least fifty feet tall and has the capacity to tear the town apart instead it steals garbage cans br br central to the premise is the idea that this monster can prowl a small city and leave eight foot long footprints behind but not be noticed by anyone there's a nicely conceived scene where it walks through the middle of a carnival at night but somehow nobody notices br br the only person who sees the monster until the final scenes is george the town drunk all through the movie i hoped hoped hoped that george would be torn to shreds on camera but this didn't happen drat in fact nobody gets killed george supposedly sacrifices himself to save priscilla he's tied to a helicopter to lure the creature george smells worse than garbage and the monster is attracted to the scent br br the nominal leads are a group of high school students there's pretty priscilla and her nondescript boyfriend and some bad boys who surprise surprise whip themselves into shape to help defeat the monster in the final scenes br br the monster is involved in four main set pieces he attacks a browning ferris garbage truck and leaves it beside an elevated highway but nobody notices he walks through the carnival again unnoticed he tears up a building nice miniature work and nobody sees him but george then he attacks the high school during a dance and grabs priscilla and carries her off just like a certain very tall ape has done several times most recently this past winter br br there are plot ideas that come out of nowhere and are dropped local citizens picket at city hall because they want their garbage cans back an elaborate secret weapon for tracking monsters is flown in by private jet examined and forgotten br br so why did i watch the whole thing because these people were having so darned much fun i had the idea that the firemen were firemen the businessmen were being filmed in their own offices priscilla may well live in that suburban tract house and scenes of people in their yards may well have been in their own yards br br they may not be great actors but they are real people nobody is stunningly good looking in fact i'd estimate that four out of five of the adults on screen wear glasses since this is the mid seventies we see some really bad clothes and some of the men have awesomely bad facial hair one dignitary being interviewed before a meeting at hall has such a loud tie and that you think he's on his way to play in the music man br br and that got the movie two extra stars zero for the story two points for the sometimes decent special effects and two points for the fact that people in the community actually got together and did this they can actually say they've performed in a movie despite lots of stage experience and working behind the scenes in live television i can't say that and i'm happy for them br br remember those great old movies with mickey rooney and judy garland at some point somebody would say let's put on a show aunt edna has all those old clothes in the attic and we can use uncle ned's barn then they'd do shows' with sets and costumes that would cost well into seven figures if duplicated today br br that's the spirit that the good people of had for this project and bless them for that
