<START> at times the mainstream news media seems to be driven by a bunch of no brain reporters in that they just listen to each other and report what others report br br this documentary shows what can be found if some more effort is put into the task of reporting about something br br true journalism should be about providing the people with different perspectives on things that happen so that they have a fair chance of creating an own opinion br br this documentary together with mainstream media reports will help you with this at least for me it provided a lot of relevant information regarding the purpose motivation behind the nowadays frequent world wide protests at different political
<START> i was lucky enough to watch this film in the recently concluded international film festival here i was actually able to watch another south korean film the power of kangwon province but christmas in august caught my attention more the story is simple enough the usual boy meets girl or shall we say girl meets boy what made it special for me was how it was rendered we can say that the movie was quiet and endearing we don't have flashy and contrived romance here only two ordinary beings made wonderful by their friendship and unexpressed love for one another i also loved how the movie used pictures as expressions of relationships past and present i wished that this was shown here as a regular film i'm sure it would call out to a bigger audience
<START> wow where to start br br this adaptation of sarah waters' third novel is one of my all time favorite movies br br i'm not to big on fiction novels seriously i never read fiction but the book is just as fabulous as the film or should i say the film is just as fabulous as the book i just love this story br br anyway i put off watching this three hour long film 2 part series on dvd 3 part series on tv book for about a year and half it simply did not look that interesting boy was i so wrong br br i became immediately immersed into the rich and suspenseful plot utterly enthralled just like the book you cannot stop watching reading it grasps your attention for the entire 3 hours and when it does end you wish it hadn't br br the story just flows so beautifully and you'll be wondering where the time went br br the lesbian subplot was just icing on the cake the parts i love most are the subtle facial expressions and glances eye contact between the two characters you really feel their desire for one another and yet they cannot act upon it until they must br br may i point out that the lesbian theme is an important part of the film obviously at the heart of the film is a genuine unexpected love story but it is most certainly not what the whole movie is about for me that's what makes this story so unique and intriguing i've never read or heard of anything like it sarah waters is pure genius br br the twists and turns it takes leaves you hanging on the edge of your seat seriously my hands were on to my couch with every surprising plot twist and i even yelled out several times oh my god no way that did not just happen did it i never do that br br the only negative thing i have to say about this film is that i wish they'd added more from the book but obviously having the adaptation be restricted by time they couldn't add everything that i would've liked how awful it is though i think i'm just being brutally selfish now forgive me br br the last 20 minutes does seem a little rushed however they put all the important bits in where even if you only watch the film and choose not to read the book you will be most satisfied with the outcome br br the actors are just superb brilliant even sally hawkins sue and elaine cassidy maud have such great on screen chemistry they steam up your television set simply electric the emotions the desperation the struggle each of them feel is expressed seemingly effortless by these wonderfully talented actresses rupert evans plays such a good bad guy as gentleman i found myself seething every time he came on screen but loving it because he's just so damn cute and somehow still charming even though you want to wring his neck imelda staunton gives yet another fantastic performance as mrs she's such a warmhearted actress you cannot help but love her even when the character she's playing isn't as delightful everyone else in the cast were perfect they really represented the characters well and were just as i imagined them to be after reading the book br br this is a must see for any film buff actually anyone and everyone should see this movie and read the book chances are you won't be disappointed br br 10 10 stars from me there are only four other films i have given that same rating too its very rare for me to actually enjoy a film so much that i give it 10 10 this is one of those films is truly a masterpiece
<START> the spirit of st louis is billy wilder's film tribute to one of the best figures in aeronautical history remembered for the first nonstop solo flight across the atlantic ocean in may 1927 with james stewart a little too old for the part playing charles lindbergh br br as a tribute it is eloquent enough and although a few nice liberties may have been taken with historical fact the motion picture describing the detailed odyssey before and after the paris flight on may 20 21 in the spirit of st louis br br although the lengthy internal monologue employed during the journey may be disappointing to an audience the truth is that it helps keep the picture focused tightly on its essential point stewart dignified the portrait of one of the greatest adventurers in the air the world has ever know departing in a highly modified single engine from long island new york to paris france br br no action is depicted in the trip only some flashbacks to break up the monotony of the long flight but there is superb determination of the ordeal of a brave and talented pilot decided to fly alone his equation is simple less weight one engine one pilot would increase fuel efficiency and allow for a longer flying range but with so much risk claim to fame was doing something that many had tried and failed br br even though wilder has bravely put it upon the screen in a calm unhurried fashion it comes out as biography of intense restraint and power but it is james stewart's performance controlled to the last detail that gives life and strong heroic stature to the principal figure in the film br br from it there emerges an awareness of a clever firm but truly humble man who tackles a task with resolution plans as much about it as he can makes his decisions with courageous finality and then awaits with only one thought in mind to get to paris in his efforts to cut off the plane's weight any item considered too heavy or unnecessary was left behind br br the record setting flight proved not only to be a fight with the elements and a test of navigation but also a long battle against fatigue a busy schedule and an active mind kept lindbergh up all of the previous night still he managed to stay conscious enough to keep the from crashing and landed at le near paris 33 hours and 30 minutes after leaving new york br br stewart gives an able portrait of a brave pilot who attains legendary status emphasizing the intention and dominant resolution to fly nonstop 5 kilometers 3 miles across the atlantic br br photographed in cinemascope and warnercolor and backed by franz waxman's beautiful music the film effectively captures the pioneering spirit of the era and the hero's ultimate achievement since he takes off that day from roosevelt wet field and clears telephone wires at the end of the runway
<START> eros and thanatos love and death command the dialectics of life by the end of 19th century in a remote japanese village a young man and a married woman older than he fall in love with each other and decide to kill her husband to be free to enjoy their love but they never enjoy that freedom since remorse begins to haunt them beginning as usual at the time by the weakest member of the couple the woman of course henceforth in an atmosphere where dream nightmare mixes up with reality the ghost of the murdered husband appears first to the woman but then also to the man it also haunts the dreams of the other villagers creating a climate of suspicion and gossip around the couple which is aggravated by the arrival of a police officer that comes to investigate the disappearance of the murdered husband but which makes this movie more interesting besides this almost common story of adultery is the evolution of the couple's feelings in a shakespearean deep psychological and dramatic development of remorse anguish and fear which turns their love relationship into a nightmare until their final doom the expressionism so dear to japanese theatre or movie acting is also present in the players' performances but not in an exaggerated form just only in the necessary measure to show more effectively the most deep feelings of the depicted characters this is indeed a solid good movie
<START> i absolutely loved this series and was very sad to see it go yes it's christian based and traditionally as well it deals with some tough issues as the other reviewer points out but i guess it depends on your viewpoint on these matters and as a teenager growing up and now as a mother myself i was so happy to see a tv series that was clean and well quite frankly wonderful i unlike the other reviewer was heartened to see how they dealt with the condom deal instead of hearing the typical wishy about condoms they showed the son actually working at being chaste and applying it to his later relationships which were pure and godly because of it and a lot safer because of it 100 br br after watching this entire series you become extremely attached to all the characters in the family and outside the family once they settle down more permanently and the moral values they teach in each episode are just priceless i found touched by an angel made by the same producer to be cheesy here and there although overall i liked it but this series in my opinion was a lot better made and had better acting and was more interesting as well it was good for the entire family and was interesting for the entire family which was a huge plus the family wasn't outstanding they had their own faults but in the long run they did what was right and you saw them grow and change and struggle like any true family does it was my favorite show at the time and will always be near the top of my list i hope it comes out on dvd
<START> people don't seem to agree with me that movies can be bad and good at the same time the same type of people that see a movie with carrot top on the cover surfing through a frickin office and continue to watch the movie with serious expectations is carrot top funny of course not was this movie anything special of course not it was a dumb movie and everyone assumed so simply based on what they know about mr top movies like this or kazaam or killer klowns from outer space and pretty much any movie pauly shore has ever been in are not meant to be taken seriously and because of this they really shouldn't be considered some of the worst movies ever made you watch them either expecting a dumb movie that's hilariously bad or you are like six years old and genuinely think carrot top is hilarious br br please people if you ready know carrot top is retarded and you want to watch a serious movie and bother writing a serious review don't watch this picking on this movie is like picking on a 5 year old for not knowing the alphabet
<START> pep squad is at a very low point with its confusing plot line and horrible acting br br first let's tackle the characters cherry brooke continues to hold an outrageous boiling anger throughout the entire film which is due to her overwhelming passion to become prom queen however it becomes completely unknown to the audience why cherry wants to become prom queen in the first place before the nominations are even read off she storms around the school with a constant disinterest upon being there and shows no interest in the place or its students to begin with why does she care so much to be their prom queen brooke apparently presents an acclaimed performance but in reality just spends the entire time with an angry face stomping around killing people maybe it's just me but i think if you handed any young actor actress a script that only requires him her to act insanely angry you're not asking for much you're also not allowing the character to develop very well br br beth's character played by jennifer is even worse shows absolutely no emotion and no connection to her character whatsoever when being harassed by her principal she knocks him down after several seconds with no feelings of disgust or shock or anything equally traumatizing her lines are read like she is reading trivia off the back of a cereal box br br throughout the rest of the film the students in charge of his kidnapping sound more like they are planning a barbecue than deciding what they will do with their principal sitting tied up in their basement br br meanwhile cherry is off killing several female prom queen candidates and no one even notices or cares yeah i get it i get it the whole town is worried about prom very realistic at least you could throw in some funny scenes with the cops but that might be asking too much for example right after cherry drives by the school and shoots down a handful of students beth is found being interviewed by the local media the reporter mentions the shooter in a way that makes it seem like no one knows who killed these innocent students but then one second later asks what do you think about guns in the hands of minors or something to that effect where did the reporter jump to such conclusions br br at the end of the movie after cherry kills the winning prom queen and prom is deemed over with the media showing up again beth simply adds that she understands need to be heard and walks away with her friends smoking cigarettes in a calm unaltered mood no one is even strayed by the fact that they just witnessed a murder br br not to mention the students constantly parking in a yellow zone and no one seeming to care that there is a sudden rise in violence in the town julie living in a large house with no parents present and the bizarre party at her house maybe i'm a little left out of the scene but last time i knew high school parties did not involve naked women artistically dancing in a pool of water while men bob for marshmallows and everyone basks in their i'm so indie and mod attitudes beth's parent's horrible acting with her mother acting over the top and her father simply nodding at everything the mother has to say and not in an entertaining way either along with stupid scenes such as the new black principal running after cherry as she tries to shoot her with a gun yes very realistic br br the only compliment i can give this movie is that the photography is wonderful the angles are flattering and the screen is very clear and crisp with each shot br br too bad the acting and script aren't
<START> i really don't know why i'm this i think most people agree that this movie is bad well let me say this br br when i first get done watching some movies i like them then as time goes on my opinion changes about the movie this happened with end of days i liked it the first time i saw it i thought it was entertaining but a few weeks later my opinion has changed so to resolve this i watched it again at a friends house well it's bad br br i'm a logic person if i see a logic hole in a movie i try to ignore it if i see two then i start to get annoyed more than two and i'm p ed off end of days made me p ed off after my second viewing br br first off the movie is a bit depressing everything about it is sad everything from arnold's acting to the movie's colors but dark looking movies don't bother me but some thing else did br br if satan can regenerate his wounds how can you possible kill him in his mortal form if you shoot him his skin grows back if you cut off his head a new one should pop back up so question what's the point of even trying to kill him i'll tell you why because this is a stupid movie that has a recycled villain this isn't the devil my friends this is a human being of those bond villains who give away there entire scheme to the hero br br like i said it's worth a look but don't see it twice because it's crap
<START> this movie is filled with so many idiotic moments that you wonder how it ever got made for example they get into the sewers from the capitol and while they're in the sewers you can see signs pointing to various government buildings and then they come up in the middle of the street i highly doubt that government buildings would provide public access through the city sewer system anyways i gave this a 2 instead of a 1 just because of its comic value i laughed the whole way through at the idiocy of everyone involved in this movie
<START> ten years before the matrix and hot on the heals of they live came this brilliant piece of low budget science fiction film making if you like bizarre unconventional intellectually challenging david lynch meets john carpenter style movie making you'll love split there are moments of true genius in the framing and cinematography look closely at a sequence shot through wine glasses in an art opening party and right after that a scene involving cue cards the plot involves a man named who lives outside of society who wants to wake us up from the dream similar to they live 1984 and the matrix it is based on the premise that we are all constantly monitored by shadowy big brother type government agents that know everything about us and have invisible robot probes constantly patrolling the city this is all revealed pretty early on in the plot possible spoiler has invented a drug that when placed in the water supply will wake everyone up from the illusion of reality along with the cinematography and the ingenious ways the director makes do with his shoestring budget the other highlights of this film are the monologues i challenge anyone to not be rewinding memorizing and quoting the classic quotes from this movie for years to come
<START> i really couldn't get into this movie the plot is some old woman has been torturing someone so long that he is deformed she dies and he is left in the basement to starve months must pass and a family moves in the daughter is blind because of an accident caused by the father well anyway this guy in the basement who for all rights should be long dead is still around he eats a cat and now is superhuman he now wants to eat people and have sex and when a hooker dies father gets the blame i always dislike movies where someone else is blamed for the killings because you always here the typical lines i didn't do it i could never do such a thing blah blah blah and the family storyline could be a lifetime movie storyline
<START> i rented this pile of sewer waste hoping for a few good laughs with a title like zombie bikers from and with dead alive productions stamped on the front cover you would think that this could be a funny gruesome film but no this is the worst movie i have ever seen and yes i have seen all of the police academy movies the story this is a joke within itself and the dialogue are atrocious the make up of the so called zombies looks like they used one of those two dollar make yourself look like a zombie' kits that you buy at k mart br br i would rather watch beverly hills 90210 while listening to the backstreet boys and be whipped by a novelty birthday card model than to sit through another single minute of this pathetic excuse for a dvd honestly i could make a better movie with 3 some popsicle sticks and a slinky i feel as if 90 minutes of my life were stripped away from me and taken to the land of i know that tagging on the dead alive production doesn't guarantee a great flick but you do expect to get your moneys worth br br the only thing that made me happy save returning the horrid mass of elephant feces was that it wasn't titled biker zombies from i feel for detroit folks that wasted their hard earned money on this one unless you have been lobotomized Â do not buy rent if you must Â but Â you will regret it
<START> it's a short movie for such immense feelings the last 20 or so minutes are among the most intense in the recent years of the industry huston john is dying and only love can make the difference the actor's work in the long evening scene is absolutely marvellous
<START> okay i just had to sound off on this one like a tremendous mental gimp i've just sat through this film in its entirety br br you'll note that the trivia section of imdb points out that portions of the raising of the 747 were borrowed from airport 1977 this really doesn't scratch the surface virtually all exterior shots of the plane skimming the ocean landing in sinking and even the at rest shots are borrowed from airport '77 all of the raising shots are pulled from '77 including most of the interior flooding clips with the exception of dennis weaver's drowning i couldn't help but wonder if olivia dehavilland might come floating by at any moment or maybe a dead tom sullivan another eye roller dennis weaver's name in this film is stevens which is to compensate for the fact that airport plane is owned by the stevens corporation headed by jimmie stewart of course br br this is a veritable of actors who don't work much or at least haven't worked in a while which might have been the first clue that it was going to be a real stinker br br i've rated this film a 2 it's quite worthy of a 1 but if this film can't offer any other redeeming quality at least somebody helped coolio max caulfield eggert and dennis weaver make their car payments that month
