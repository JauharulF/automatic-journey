<START> to be totally honest i wasn't expecting much at all going into 9 souls even after reading heap upon heap of praise plied upon it but to say i was surprised would be a major understatement in short i was totally blown away br br the basic plot is as simple as they come nine prison inmates ranging from a drug pusher all the way up to multiple murderer's escape from prison and go in search of a secret stash presumed to be forged money hidden by a tenth inmate who cracked and was dragged away by guards shortly before their escape but it's the direction that director takes this simple story that is so brilliant and original perfectly blending drama comedy and violence creating a truly one of kind movie that to be seen not only fans of asian cinema but cinema in general br br superbly acted emotional funny violent and at times very surreal this is a movie has it all
<START> this episode introduces us to the formal dress uniforms worn here by captain picard commander riker and lieutenant tasha yar the plot of this episode deals with 2 groups of separate alien delegates the and the who try to capture and eat each other at every turn the 2 sides really hate each other and it is up to riker and tasha to contain them and keep them out of trouble br br meanwhile a mysterious spacial anomaly goes around the ship injuring and killing a few of the crew members but at the end of the episode this same spacial anomaly possesses a valuable member of the crowd will they be able to rescue him so that they maybe able to continue on with their on going mission of space exploration br br note this episode marks irish actor colm meaney's second appearance on tng after encounter at he portrays one of tasha's yellow shirted security guards
<START> the all i have is 5 dollars and my wedding ring scene was a riot i also guffawed at the scene in the bar where hyde the horse radish and flipped the bird to the japanese guy and said pearl harbor buddy i think my iq is higher than 115 but i'm not sure because i can't count that high br br funny thing this 10 line requirement seems as though they would bash you for making your comments too long not too short i hope i don't make it to 1 000 words before i get to line 10 br br i'm still two lines short pardon me while i think and drink or drink and think it depends on whether my hands are faster than my mind good i think i've made it to the 10 line limit thanks for reading
<START> i am a history teacher and overall i was pleased with the movie my teen agers enjoyed it over the holidays is it 100 accurate and is it a little sappy in places yes but it took my kids away from the computer and play station to spend four nights watching it all br br the battle scenes were impressive and we met plenty of historical characters throughout lloyd bridges as jefferson davis and hal holbrook as abraham lincoln stand out we all thought phillip casnoff as bent was evilly and charmingly brilliant we all thought charles stole the show from orry and george br br we will enjoy the movie again
<START> planet earth has suffered a terrible environmental disaster so humanity now survives underground split in to different religious cults what caused the catastrophe i have no idea why is humanity split in to different ecclesiastical factions i have no idea since the surface of the earth can no longer support human life how are the humans able to grow crops in order to feed the population i have no idea what sort of producer thought this screenplay deserved to receive funding i have no idea br br shepherd is one of these films that creeps up late at night on cable channels the sort of film where you consult the to see if it has any merits the number of people who've on shepherd on this page hasn't yet reached double figures and this is a film that was released nine years ago perhaps the people who have never seen it are the lucky ones br br as for the rest of the plot it's very routine grumpy former cop boris dakota whose wife and child died several years previously meets a woman and her child and it's up to him to save their lives almost like a futuristic western throw in a former wrestler who now runs the god channel a fascist christian bloke who's trying to snuff out boris a ventriloquist some t a for the sake of it and you've got a mess of a film i guess after seeing this neil marshall's doomsday is possibly a masterwork of cinema in comparison
<START> after all these years i am puzzled as to why julie brown west coast isn't a household name or a hugely famous comedic star she is one of the funniest females on the planet in this spoof she takes on madonna who is one of her favorite targets she is medusa a hugely successful singer like madonna who also happened to have documentary truth or dare julie brown spoofs madonna as medusa who came from wisconsin the land of dairy and beer i remember the segment where she went to wisconsin to visit her family and a grave i don't remember if it was a parent or her pet i remember somebody saying that medusa did nothing original she was just copying others i have to say that i hope this spoof documentary is available on dvd somewhere julie brown was at her best mocking and spoofing others
<START> i saw this movie with my mother and i loved it it was such a sweet story not to mention funny because of the supporting cast they never make movies like this ever my favorite part is when grace minnie driver finds out about her boyfriend's wife's death and that she has the deceased wife's heart and she screams what was god thinking i do believe everyone no matter who you believe in has thoughts like that once in awhile but while it's very sappy it just might make you believe in true love and destiny for once and for all sigh br br the comedic timing between bonnie hunt and jim belushi will just make you crack up especially in the aforementioned scene it's terrible and yet so funny they make a good pair and i hope to see them again in something soon 10 10 stars
<START> this is more than a sat afternoon special well written if very low key there is a lot here if you look for it catch the cat companion scout for instance it not only could have been a comic book it should have been a comic book the comic industry as well as the film's publicists missed the boat on this one of the least know really great films a great script by john sayles is a strong point but the acting is good as well probably the best super hero film i've ever seen short on special effects but long on believability this one's a keeper i have never seen a dvd of this film but i used to own a vhs version good hunting
<START> this movie is pretty predictable nuff said from the delayed kissing scene to the inevitable coming around of grandpa this is a great movie for the 10 12 age group but beyond that it has no market i give it 4 10 only because it achieved exactly what it set out to do and nothing more
<START> this was a pretty good episode though no trapped in the closet or cartoon wars it had a lot of things going for it the character of al gore and that bizarre as hell super cereal thing was pretty darn funny but the scene that made me adore this episode was one i'm sure everyone will agree was one of the greatest cartman kyle moments ever when cartman is superstitious of kyle that he'll be stealing his gold which of course is fake and he comes within inches of his face suddenly kyle wakes up and they have that crazy conversation where cartman tries to act like everything is completely fine cartman crapping out the treasure at the end though predictable was pretty funny
<START> the only reason i didn't fall asleep during this movie is because the seats were not that comfortable hannibal is boring boring boring and boring this film is just dreadful not because of any violence or graphic mutilations it's actually quite tame in that regard the story moves at the speed of a lazy snail i have the feeling that director ridley scott just phoned this one in the actors are all fine they just needed some direction the music score is also very annoying it's especially noticeable since so little is going on in the film it does look good but that's not enough reason to see it by the way did i mention that it's boring br br
<START> as a fan of the old doctor who and after the mediocre fox movie i was dubious of this new series of doctor who i gave it a chance though and am so glad i did br br yes some episodes aren't as brilliant as others but they are all enjoyable and yes eccleston's doctor is far from any we've had before but eccleston's doctor is just about the best there is his performance is at times comical at others dramatic sometimes completely crazy but always fantastic br br this and bille piper as rose make this series a cut above the rest camille is also fantastic as rose's mum and there is a depth to this series not present previously this series is incredibly powerful especially considering its sci fi i mean who'd have thought you could ever have felt sorry or even cried for a dalek prior to this how many times in this series' history have we had moments like those with rose's dad the emergency doctor and the 'you were fantastic so was i' final speech i advise anyone whether a fan of doctor who or even tv drama to buy this set on dvd it truly is fantastic br br now only 4 episodes through the latest series and looking forward to the new i have to say that david doctor is just not as good of course you may disagree but i don't think his doctor is capable of those emotional moments seen in the previous series i also have to say that in my opinion so far this series has not been as good as the last however the return of sarah jane was a fantastic episode a true gem not to say this series is not good just not quite as good br br so whether you like it or not and whether you prefer tennant or eccleston the doctor is back and he's here to stay fantastic almost as many fantastic 's as the doctor
<START> this is a true gem of corny sci fi peter cushing adds a great personality to this midnite movie classic br br i particularly like the sound design the weird choppy voices of the creatures and the rhino creatures all provide a bizarre backdrop of course the scantily clad babe doesn't hurt either br br
<START> a roger corman rip off assembled for what appears to be virtually zero budget all of the special effects were originally used in battle beyond the stars and i suspect a fair amount of the props costumes and sets were re used from other sources as well the story seems to have been written around these elements so this isn't really a movie as much as it's a recycling project third rate star wars junk wasn't needed then or now
<START> this movie sucked on so many levels ever seen the dentist this movie made the dentist look like a masterpiece i do not recommend this movie to anyone unless of course you are really really really really really bored then maybe it was so corny the killer reminds you of the grandpa from the monsters except he has goggles on when jessica said i want you to meet someone my inner bitch i thought she was going to kick his butt however all she did was throw a gen trash can at him i was very disappointed and when the ranger had the crying scene about his wife i so felt the pain behind his tears not so before watching this movie grab a blanket and a pillow get comfortable because it is very relaxing
