<START> every american who thinks he or she understands world war two should see this movie few hollywood films about the war have defied the stereotype of japanese soldiers as emotionless brutes obeying orders without thinking we like to think that every japanese man was ready and able to fight to the death right up to the day we bombed nagasaki fires on the plain shows a different reality troops pathetically and starved to the point of cannibalism they refer to human flesh as monkey meat the movie and novel on which it was based also put to death the myth that japanese soldiers all preferred death to surrender they had good reason to believe that their enemies were in no mood to take prisoners to me it raises a question most americans would rather avoid if the japanese military was so beaten down at this point in the war why was it necessary to nuke hiroshima
<START> not much to it but a validation of small town values and the embracing of a mentally challenged young man into its heart br br i read some of the reviews and was surprised at some of the hostility it engendered i felt cuba gooding handled the part with dignity and respect unlike sean penn's drooling fool portrayal in i am sam br br the fact that this is based on a true story makes it all the more heartwarming sports are taken seriously in small town high school america and elsewhere i suspect and i felt the portrayal of these competitive students opening their hearts to one less fortunate rang true at least for me br br the coach was never forced to choose between his daughter and radio but rather came gently to the decision himself under radio's loving and open ways very well done to all 7 out of 10 br br debra winger we need more of you in pictures
<START> by mistake i ordered a series from the bbc their new version of robin hood very disappointing in comparison with ros terrible costuming and backgrounds while i enjoyed the sheriff who took cues from the nick grace character the rest of the cast left much to be desired as a for instance marion's costuming looked suspiciously like it came from walmart and sir guy well he looked a bit like a character from an outer space movie ros has stolen the spotlight probably forever in the telling of this tale cast costuming story lines scenery filming and soundtrack by are all superb as is evidenced by all the continual feedback some 26 years on ros is a timeless classic my thanks to all who made the series
<START> the '80's were the best of times and worst of times for james karin he starred in one of the best cult horror comedies with return of the living dead and a year later he acts in this piece of this bad movie a sequel to but not really has a group of fairly unlikeable characters attempting to make a movie in greece through design or sheer laziness the line between the film and the 'film within a film' is not only blurred but throughly non existent from scene to scene which would be confusing if i were just interested in anything happening in the movie in the first place unfunny would be too generous a term br br eye candy nana and many numerous extras get topless brenda bakke shows some t a br br my grade f br br dvd extras just trailers for american high school strike virgin territory comes in a double feature dvd with the first film for the masochistic
<START> this was one of the worst movies i have ever seen the only advantage seeing this movie is that the next movie can't possibly be worse it's childish as hell but children aren't allowed
<START> this is one of the worst movie i have ever seen it's a thriller with a rather ridiculous ending i watched this movie hoping for the best and instead found something truly bad the movie starred two actors that i like very much rebecca and antonio banderas sure they had decent chemistry together but for what the movie's premise was bad to begin with and the execution just made it even worst br br miss plays sarah taylor a psychologist trying to analyze a convicted serial killer whose defense hinge on multiple personality disorder that pretty much will give you a hint to where the movie is going and the identity of the killer early in the movie she gets an unexpected visit from her father this being made in the 1990's when the bad daddy was the in thing in hollywood is another clue to the ultimate conclusion br br mr banderas plays a mystery man named tony ramirez who comes into sarah's life the whole first meeting and first encounter between tony and sarah is so badly done and so unconvincing it makes you wonder how it even got shot and there's a sequence where the two of them are supposed to be knowing each other that is so sappy it doesn't seem to belong here one thing that i would admit was that there was a sex scene that's very hot anyway creepy things start to happen after he arrives weird packages arriving things falling off the wall that could kill sarah incident that say things aren't normal anymore br br overall the movie was badly conceived the editing at times seem jumpy and the conclusion was laughable another thing that bugged me about this movie was the whole orchestral music playing in the background a more subtle musical score would have been better i have to say this no matter how bad the ending was miss was very good in that sequence it's sad that she never got first rate materials in her career she's that rare combination of talent and beauty
<START> let's get the flaw out of the way right off the top the movie should have been much longer ray charles was a brilliant fascinating man who lead a complex challenging life there was simply no way to fit it all or even touch on it all in a standard length movie given that the makers of this film did an admirable and i'm sure quite agonizing job of putting together a film that could not tell the whole story yet managed to set forth a representative sampling of the man and his music ray charles' strengths were evident throughout the film and his weaknesses were neither amplified nor sugar coated we could have wished for another hour chronicling his life after 1980 but i suppose that would have tended to turn the film into an homage and while it would have also allowed for the resolution of several things that were left hanging at the end on balance i guess it was better as presented br br now for the big question what are the criteria for an oscar the wife and i have seen untold numbers of films in our years but we immediately agreed that we have never seen a performance the equal of jamie foxx's the line between actor and character was not blurred but rather it disappeared completely we had heard much of the hype before seeing the movie but this was uncanny foxx was ray charles you didn't watch the movie with the feeling that you were watching foxx do an outstanding job of portraying ray charles you watched it somehow believing or understanding that you were watching ray charles himself i don't know how else to put it we were completely blown away i'll admit that we haven't seen all of the other performances up for an oscar this year but that really doesn't matter foxx took this to a whole level one which we've never witnessed before and doubt that we may ever see again i can think of no other movie i've ever seen in which a person playing a part so completely and convincingly became the person portrayed we salute you mr foxx we understand that the awarding of an oscar has to do with much more than the performance but whether or not you win we want you to know that you have done something that is in a class absolutely by itself and you should take enormous pride in your unparalleled achievement br br p s the music was naturally great i remarked to the wife that if there is one moment in the history of music to which i wish i could have been witness it would have been the genesis in kansas city wasn't it of i say the film did a wonderful job with it just wish i could've been there
<START> most of wayne's b westerns are kind of fun in a naive way but this one really stinks the editing is terrible and the direction and pacing is completely lethargic most of the cast stands around waiting for the mute guy to write down his thoughts on a pad of paper and i was bored sorry duke but this gets a 1
<START> i saw this movie last night at the berlinale as part of the competition it was billed as the world premiere of the movie by the host though it seems that people here have seen it previously i have to say i still don't really know what to make of the movie i am unfamiliar with the book purchased the ticket only two hours beforehand and had only limited knowledge of the plot not enough as it seems as i had problems getting into the movie the movie is sometimes being narrated by jones' character but somehow that perspective did not fit for me and i really cannot say if some of the laughs the movie got were calculated or not the cuts were abrupt and disruptive the scenes seemed somehow slapped together and the storytelling did not always make sense right away even leaving out the supernatural parts the actors were really good but could not really save the movie somehow it was entertaining but sometimes only in the sense that i sat there thinking about technical details of movie making and what went wrong with this one i still do not know what kind of mood the director intended the movie to have it was a strange mix of light dark supernatural it sadly did not draw me in at all and i rather watched it with a technical eye but thinking about what is wrong with a movie while watching it is the best sign that a movie somehow has failed i would have definitely expected something else with these actors involved too bad
<START> some martial arts purists think that comedy was the worst thing that could have happened to the old school kung fu flick and it is true that the introduction of comedy into the genre signaled the end of the chop socky period in hong kong film but the fact is one can only carry on a primarily physical exhibition of prowess for just so long then everyone gets bored with it and that's really why the chop socky died and how the hong kong new wave action film was born the producers the actors the directors all just got bored with hitting people for ninety minutes straight br br given that and given the fact that liu chia liang is a professional director with a considerable list of films in his resume this film has to be seen as something other than just another kung fu comedy rather it is a comic film within the martial arts genre and in fact one of the best ever made br br what liu has done with this film is really a pleasant surprise he has taken a martial arts plot and re constructed it along the lines of a hollywood style musical complete with episodes of singing and dancing it was around the time of the making of this film that some film makers and film fans began to recognize that the cinematic performance of martial arts really derived from the acrobatics of the chinese opera has more in common with dance than with fighting i will continue to point out this connection until most americans realize what they are actually supposed to look for when watching a martial arts film well choreographed body movements using the plot of an action film as an excuse for their performance at any rate quite clearly liu chia liang made this connection and decided he would explore it close to its limits br br the result is an incredibly charming entertainment filled with marvelously human characters attempting miraculous kung fu and tripping over their own as often as not when they do so and the film being set at the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries allows liu the opportunity to explore the nature of the and modernization of china that contributed so greatly to the making of the china we know today so the film has considerable historical import as well br br also fans of stephen chow's recent kung fu hustle should really watch this movie carefully as chow clearly learned from it before the making of his own film br br a very amusing well made film oh yes and the kung fu in it is really really good br br purists won't admit it but this is probably director liu's best film
<START> this movie is not very bad but one cannot find anything new about the personality of marquis de sade from this movie the movie tries to stay on the borderline between erotic and insightful and it cannot succeed at either the cinematography is really bad to video quality br br
<START> this movie even calling it a movie is an overstatement is ridiculously horrible normally a huge fan of eric roberts in b list movies this tragedy of a flick makes me question his real b list clout and charlie please go back to hoping for a diagnosis murder revival rather than this you can't blame the nameless eye candy beauty pageant members for participating in this weak movie but you are a former tv star man pull yourself together don't even get me started on stuart pankin for the sake of all that is good stuart you should have seen this was not necessarily a real movie bryan michael exemplifies absolute genius only in the fact that he was able to dupe anyone into investing in this picture money or time br br really this was no parody or spoof movie although it tries on a 2nd grade level mostly it is poor writing and acting and camera work and editing and well poor everything i watched it because i read an article in some mag about agent mj's involvement and my interest was peaked due to the lawsuit in which he was involved i now wonder if the only reason they show him from the shoulders up in the movie is because he like at the trial showed up wearing bottoms and barely lucid wait a second is he ever really considered lucid i digress and agent mj is that the best they could come up with for a name for his character sheez what a startling piece of originality or maybe that was supposed to be funny putting marriott into the movie was a nice touch at first but overdone and annoying after all is said and done br br spare yourself the grief of watching don't say i didn't warn you
<START> hey all i just wanted to give you all a few crazy facts about this movie i was actually one of the make up fx artists that help create the beast for this movie and i have to tell you the original creature looked absolutely amazing i remember when we got the first photos back from the set we were all talking about how much of a shame it was that this creature was in a movie that would probably be pretty poor br br what actually happened though was that jason palmer did the original make up for the sasquatch but for some reason they had to go back and re shoot much of the creature the sad part was that jason passed away a few weeks before that and so the re done creature was no where near as awesome as the original one br br for me it was quite sad because this was jasons final movie and he sort of got cheated out of his final fame due to the bad re shoots anyway i thought you guys may find that a tad and if you would like you can head over to com and check out some behind the scenes photos br br later jeff
<START> seeing that this got a theatrical release nowhere around the globe it only serves as a reminder of were the careers of those talent free ladies denise richards and milla jovovich went it also is a particular grating kind of movie the kind that think they are smart funny and original while being poor in every aspect full blame can go to brian burns who wrote and directed this potboiler his script takes a quite unoriginal situation and goes exactly nowhere with it the situations develop completely without any inner logic besides that of a desperate scriptwriter characters are thinner than cardboard cutouts behave stupid and without any real motivation nowhere is this more obvious than in the inclusion of mrs richards we don't believe her relationship with david character for one minute and the way she is brought back into play after the one hour mark is particularly pitiful why would anyone fall for a egocentric self obsessed arrogant b ch like this in the first place much less a second time especially after having supposedly found his erm true love and if any of these things aren't enough to completely sink this movie than the central couple is the coupling of and jovovich is only slightly more believable or developed than the richards one but it is to no avail there is no chemistry no spark nothing that we might loosely accept as a credible couple worse these two central characters are particularly annoying and irritating doing annoying and irritating things the viewer finally has no interest in whatsoever br br overall a very poor showing even die hard rom com fans might want to pass on this one as there are dozens of movie made with more skill or more charm
<START> i have seen a number of horror movies to know that this one was one of kind full moon pictures has a knack of giving this fan an entertaining night for all the cheesiness of most vampire films this is the one that has not only a good premise but has two good sequels a must see
