<START> chen kaige gives us magnificent depth of atmosphere yes it's a but chen's artistic use of imagery makes it something more the actors often behave like players using the stylized diction postures and facial expressions of peking opera all the actors in a scene play to the 'back wall' even when addressing each other they are like spirits of the past enunciating with powerful clarity a story with urgent meaning for those in the present combined with close attention to scale and masterful cinematography indoors and out jing ke ci wang is a stunning tale told with great reverence in its own idiom that captivates completely
<START> finally other people who have actually seen this show it is the funniest anime i have ever seen but most people have even heard about it it is just hilarious 'and so kintaro will continue to ride his trusty bike and maybe one day he will save the world or maybe not' tare just some classic bits in it 'and so he will ride onto the next city because he has no choice since his brakes are broken study study study ' and some of the lessons that he writes down in his little notebook 'today i had a very educational experience i tried to look backwards but unfortunately i was already looking that way it hurt todays lesson the human head cannot turn 360 degrees '
<START> man was this hard to watch it was not at all funny not well made and it had no point or plot to it whatsoever the acting was horrible it was not well made at all it looked like a bunch of kids my age were just screwing around and making a pointless movie it is by far the absolute worst broken lizard movie if you are a broken lizard movie like myself you will disappointed and bored to your death please skip this pointless movie about ugly guys looking for chicks you will not regret m advice by the way don't say you didn't find this review helpful just because you didn't agree with it thats stupid like this movie the only ok scene was when the main guy was playing rugby and got beat the crap out of i liked that cause i found his character pretty damn annoying
<START> i'd love to sit down and write an intelligent well thought out review however i feel i'd be spending more time in the writing process than the filmmakers did i live in los angeles and i'm sorry to say that the characters seemed just so much like underemployed and overly ego inflated actors there was not one moment in the film when i could escape the feeling i was watching the drivel ridden conversation of unemployed actors at a hipster la coffee shop one of the worst indie films i've ever seem with so little to recommend it that hearing it won at sundance has effectively removed any prior interest i may have had in attending much less considering a sundance review to be meaningful watch at your own risk
<START> i watched this movie purely for the setting it was filmed in an old hotel that a friend owns shares of the plot was predictable the acting was mediorcre at best the scares were all gross outs not true scares br br i don't remember much of the plot and i think that's because there wasn't much of one to remember they didn't even use the hotel to it's fullest potential the beaches are fantastic and the hotel is situated on a peninsula at low tide you can walk almost 1 4 mile into the bay which is actually an eerie sight first thing in the morning or late at night when the wind is howling through the cracks br br the best way to see this movie is with the remote in your hand so you can fast forward through the action and i'm using that term loosly scenes and pause at the beauty of the surroundings
<START> don't be fooled this isn't yet another tired example of the girls from outer space pretending to be the french ski team come to earth to collect as much sperm as possible genre though the synopsis may suggest otherwise this movie is a gem an absolute jewel that has enriched my life from the moment i laid eyes upon it hilarious exhilarating action packed and stunningly erotic mir is a euro madcap tour de force a grossly underrated bavarian classic br br stop everything you are doing and run out to rent or better yet buy this movie immediately
<START> the story and the characters really really needed work the world idea is kind of neat but no one bothered to develop any of it either through exposition or through the plot despite the cheesy notes at the beginning of the film it makes sense that you wouldn't use exposition since no one is new to this world and yet when matt owens bill paxton and byron bob peck stray off course and get lost and get introduced to the wind worshipers and the fat lazy rich people in the museum we don't get any real idea of who these people are or why we should care about any of them smart films have ways of developing this simply by having the characters live in the world simple things like ordering a drink at a bar or talking about something in the past these are the kind of things that make the film world memorable not endless shots of crappy planes and cheap cg effects of someone trying to do loops in an br br if this is too difficult for you here's a little tip pare down the multiple locations if everything's becoming disjointed because you're pulling up to often stay in one place for a little while and have the characters talk a little all the superfluous crap should be removed get rid of the entire wind worshipers scene get rid of the stuffy museum people get rid of all the crappy flying crap unless you can make the wind relevant to the story have the entire thing set on a big plane or something just get people talking about something we care about br br hey get rid of bill paxton have the film center around character and his relationship with the robot byron br br indeed the biggest problem of the film is that we don't care anything about anybody because no one takes the time to either explain their motivations or delve into their characters we don't like matt well because he's played by bill paxton among other things he's a scoundrel who doesn't redeem himself enough except to let the android byron go and this action has even less meaning than most because of three key points br br 1 byron is a murderer 2 byron is indestructible 3 byron can leave any time he damn well pleases br br we try to like byron because there's a kind of pathos there but it's largely undeveloped all we're left with is a whiny glassy eyed robot guy who's acting is subdued and wooden one moment and practically zany the next we don't know why or how he develops emotions but we do know for a fact that he's murdered someone we don't know why he murdered someone or the circumstances of this grisly event because it isn't developed we can't feel pity for him if we don't know the story all we know for a fact is that he murders people and he likes bill paxton br br we don't hate enough partly because he's played by good guy mark hamill since while gruff and ruthless doesn't do anything out of the ordinary for his character a post apocalyptic peace officer sure he kills robbie coltrane and his team but they are drug dealers on their way to grow for heroin and they shoot at him first he doesn't kill anyone who doesn't get in the way or who does not try to physically harm him first that goes equally well for the final confrontation in the museum he uses a of police brutality against a lazy dilettante f murray abraham is wasted in this role and everyone else draws a gun on him br br i really don't understand what's the deal with kitty aldridge partner after only an accumulated 10 minutes with matt she's ready to switch sides despite her shouts of loyalty and despite matt's trash talking her and punching her out if that's love then i'll choose hate any day br br really paxton's character is about as lovable as simon in true lies or pvt hudson from aliens does anyone fall for him in these movies no why because he's a loud mouthed idiot and a loser why put him at the helm of this film
<START> this overheated southern gothic has a few decent moments but is too often spoiled by a novice director piling clichÃ© upon clichÃ© and a star who apparently decided to take it upon himself to turn the picture into his personal showcase rather than allowing writer director gabel to update inge or williams as a sort of contemporary midnight cowboy meets lolita tearjerker br br close your eyes listen to the exaggerated southern accents and try to decide if you're witnessing a feature film or an acting class full of eager amateurs br br johansson is for once tolerable i e less pouty than usual though by no means good is decent though a little too pretty boy cute to be believed and travolta chews the scenery as never before with the help of a decent editor and some directorial restraint his performance might have been really touching as it is he and almost everyone else is too unlikable to ever move us past the point of boredom or revulsion kara unger is perhaps best of all had her role been developed beyond a few lines she might have even found herself with a best supporting actress nomination br br pic is almost saved by leonard cohen style growling theme song decent production design and locations and continual reference to literary works which has earned the otherwise standard screenplay reviews such as poetic also helpful are a few old pros in the cast like sonny shroyer and perhaps most importantly soderbergh cameraman elliot davis whose fine work will no doubt be credited to the first time director who ten or twenty years from now may actually learn how to direct br br but probably not
<START> 1956 was the 20th congress of the communist party and the soviet premier made a speech denouncing stalin and the stalinist and the gulag labor systems revealing information that was previously forbidden publicly revealing horrible new truths which opened the door for a new soviet cinema led by mikhail once head of film production this film features a red army that is not victorious in fact they are encircled in a retreat mode with many people dying including the hero in a film set after 06 02 41 the german invasion of russia when germany introduced the barbarossa plan a blitzkrieg invasion intended to bring about a quick victory and the ultimate enslavement of the and very nearly succeeded actually getting within 20 miles of moscow in what was a red army wipe out a devastation of human losses 15 to 20 million russians died or 20 of the entire population historically this was a moment of great trauma and suffering a psychological shock to the russian people but the red army held and prolonged the war 4 more years until they were ultimately victorious br br during the war stalin used the war genre in films for obvious morale boosting introducing female heroines who were ultra patriotic and strong and idealistic suggesting that if females could be so successful and patriotic then russia could expect at least as much from their soldiers stalin eliminated the mass hero of the proletariat and replaced it with an individual bold leader who was successful at killing many of the enemy an obvious reference to stalin himself who was always portrayed in film as a bold wise and victorious leader but changed this depiction as the cranes are flying was made after death causing a political thaw and creating a worldwide sensation winning the cannes film festival palm d'or as well as the best director and best actress reawakening the west to soviet cinema for the first time since eisenstein's ivan the terrible in the 40's br br this film featured brilliant breathtaking and extremely mobile camera work from his extraordinary cinematographer sergei using spectacular crane and tracking shots images of wartime battlefields moscow and crowded streets that are extremely vivid and real another brilliant scene features the lead heroine veronica who hasn't heard from her lover boris in the 4 years at war so he is presumed dead but she continues to love him expressed in a scene where she runs towards a bridge with a train following behind her a moment when the viewer was wondering if she might throw herself in front of that train instead she saves a 3 yr old boy named boris who was about to be hit by a car another scene captures the death of boris on the battlefield who dies a senseless death and his thoughts spin and whirl in a beautiful montage of trees sky leaves all spinning in a kaleidoscope of his own thoughts and dreams including an imaginary wedding with veronica this film features the famous line you can dream when the war is over in the final sequence when the war is over the soldiers are returning in a mass scene on the streets veronica learns boris died all are happy and excited with the soldier's return but veronica is in despair passing out flowers to soldiers and strangers on the street in an extreme gesture of generosity and selflessness revealing cranes white and gray floating in the sky br br the film was released in 1957 in russia and according to some reviews the silence in the theater was profound the wall between art and living life had fallen and tears unlocked the doors br br br br
<START> like another reviewer i really wanted to like this movie i went with my father who was the biggest lover and booster of classical music but neither of us could stand this movie i wouldn't even call it a movie a better description might be a record of a few chamber concert pieces as i recall the camera never even moved rather i just sat on a tripod for the entirety of each piece the only attempts at dramatic effect were at the very end of each piece when the movie would cut to trees waving in the wind or little lapping at a beach i'm sure the director would have preferred to have used footage of some really big crashing waves but the best he could find were a few inches high at some nearby lake and again using a stationary camera truly pathetic i can't imagine how anyone could justify rating this movie higher than a five when we walked out my father and i were completely mystified as to how it was possible to make such a bad movie i don't know of of any good movies about bach the world really does need one but just because it doesn't exist is not a reason to see this one someone will make one someday until then just keep rewatching amadeus
<START> for the most part romance films were never my cup of tea but valley girl is one of the few romance films i not only could sit through but actually enjoy nicholas cage is great in his first role and deborah foreman is cute beyond belief there are some side stories that tend to become muddled but not enough to diminish this film
<START> first off what are some of you thinking this is the best movie i've seen in ages br br secondly i don't think of it as a british movie as it is set in dublin and has mainly irish actors moran aisling o sullivan rita deirdre o'kane etc br br thirdly i thought that moran was excellent he was hilariously funny through out micheal caine seemed only to be there to get moran context each character he took on he perfected br br abigail i thought was better than any other child actor i have seen she was believable as the smart kid and also as a kid and an adult yes i know that sounds strange but hey even she managed to upstage caine br br and moran worked very well together and were very funny in the preparation scene br br was very funny in his ineptitude
<START> i found this movie to be okay br br on paper this movie has everything a person may want romance comedy drama a bank robbery a unique cast great music and storytelling br br in reality this movie ended up being mostly garbage and i'll tell you why br br a this is my biggest problem the editing this movie has by far the worst editing i've ever seen short of local car dealership commercials the editing could've been done better by a deaf patient tapping away at imovie with a a dead cat there are scenes where two characters are talking to each other and you can see their lips moving and the audio video isn't in sync because its clearly dubbed why was it dubbed i don't know its english dubbing english the voices were done in a studio elsewhere in certain scenes could they not find a boom mic they're not expensive jesus even i own one and i don't make films br br b andrew performance lacked it really didn't seem like he wanted to be a part of this project and his acting was the equivalent of a skit performed by d a r e for schoolchildren at least john showed some enthusiasm br br yes john is the only reason i rented this flick and its the only real reason worth watching he's did a good witty performance and he was the most three dimensional character dean edwards' character was quite thin as was whats her face br br final word if you're a fan of john this is worth your time if not don't even bother the editing
<START> wow jeez i don't even know where to begin commenting on this thing they called a movie i seriously don't know what the hell david bradley began smoking after making hard justice which in my opinion was quite a good movie after the american ninja features i hadn't seen any of this guy's latter movies after cyborg cop lucky i saw them on amazon for like 5 pounds each and i can safely say the following if i had thrown down the drain the 5 pounds i spent on total reality crisis and expect to die i would have ended up happier than having to sit through the 90 minutes that each of them lasted my god how the heck can anybody label these as movies and why do action martial arts actors fall knee deep into the horse dung when they've like reached their peak i mean david bradley's no oscar but his first movies were pretty entertaining tough cool guy with pretty good martial expertise who delivered corny lines but at least entertained action and martial arts fans to a certain extent but i seriously would love to know what went through this guy's head after making hard justice his final 3 movies have to frankly be the worst i have ever had to sit through as i mentioned before i'd love to get my money back on the 3 dvds i bought crisis was the epitome of sleepiness total reality was harsh but this expect to die is just utter nonsense i bet the director was either mega stoned when he made this or he was just taking the pee out of every david bradley fan who would sit through this heap of crap the plot circles around a doctor bradley who develops some type of virtual reality game in which he's just killing different people off one by one sorry but i just couldn't take this guy seriously playing a baddie with that posh hair do glasses and gray slacks and doing absolutely no physical fighting whatsoever frankly his best asset the film is even worse than any of those saturday afternoon b movies because the acting is laughable the directing is horrendous and the few fights in the movie well what can i say the actors look like they're training with their gym buddy we get a dumb muscular cop who starts to show off his fighting stuff like one hour into the movie and fails heavily a french hairy version of van damme who just can't fight act or speak to save his freaking life and bradley the supposed protagonist playing the evil doctor who i was really happy for when he stopped making this type of expendable rubbish i even reckon he didn't throw a kick in this movie probably due to his heart condition already playing up on him for a b actor i must admit i really liked this guy his style physique fighting skills but i'm really really glad he stopped acting after this monstrosity because i honestly wouldn't have been able to sit through another ninety minutes of pee taking material like this one avoid at all costs even if you're family of david bradley you'll be glad you did word
<START> if you liked this movie be sure to check out others directed by you are in for a treat this is unfortunately not his best but still million times better than an average movie from the mainstream cinema it explores relationships especially the abusive ones has some powerful as well as sweet moments and great acting some plot inconsistencies clichÃ©s and hollow moments spoil the overall effect to the previous reviewer and his comments on the czech psyche an interesting approach but i do not see this movie becoming a czech blockbuster those folks are rather spoiled by their movie makers check out also stuff by sverak and this one lags a bit behind
