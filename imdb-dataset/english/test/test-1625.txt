<START> never have i seen a movie like this didn't plan on seeing it but it was worth the turn of the tv channel i am mostly a scifi movie watcher but i would be more than happy to add this one to my collection it starts out as a one sided film with a simple love triangle then became something a little different can't tell more then that but it does involve two guys and one girl juts not the way you would expect also this movie starred hugo weaving from the matrix and the lord of the rings in a role i would not have expected very funny guy this movie is playing on here tv but if you do not have satellite it is worth a rent so give it a try you won't be disappointed
<START> i caught this on late late mexican cable and i have to rant about it the title was translated as secrets well there's a secret that has an important part in the movie but come on we are not stupid we know there's a novel behind this br br anyways the movie is pretty interesting and it's carried by it's solid performances the always beautiful and stunning jordana brewster and christopher eccleston deliver great performances and have such great chemistry between them cameron is also good although she has minimal on screen time blythe danner is perfect and his last appearance in the movie is touching sad great performances br br character and her sister's ex boyfriend travel to europe in order for her to deal with his demons and understand why her sister died through flashbacks we learn the sad truth and we can't help but feel sorry for the whole family the ending is truly moving br br so there's nudity but it's minimal in fact the sex scenes are artsy and do not intend to be steamy or sexy br br to be honest i kept watching it for brewster's on screen charming and beauty and i ended up liking the story and the dramatic presentations br br give this movie a try if you like solid dramatic features great movie the last last scene was very sad the two little sisters through flashbacks
<START> i found it charming nobody else but kiarostami can do so little and yet get so much you might think i'm weird but i was so charmed that i couldn't speak during the movie while during other movies i comment a lot the short movie made by him for lumiere et the one with the eggs that one is unbeatable in my heart but this is wonderful too i liked it better than ten kiarostami is maybe the best director in my opinion because he can see things he doesn't need to use a lot of stuff brought from home to illustrate his images he simply grabs a camera not many can do that maybe i don't know to much about movies but i don't care about complicate stuff all someone has to do is touch my soul kiarostami does
<START> director mikhail film the cranes are flying is a glorious piece of cinema from the screenplay by viktor based on his own play shows us a vision of the heroism of war and the suffering by those left at home inundated with countless war movies showing us the and the carnage the topic itself becomes tedious and avoidable however this russian gem shows how the tale of hardship can be told in a different way by telling us straight from a soldier's mouth how war is hated by all that they hope those who died did so for a cause that will allow for peace and the end of fighting we see a new vision of wwii we have young men volunteering to wage war for peace to keep their families and loved ones safe at home rather than draftees fighting a battle they don't believe in with so much hatred towards our current situation in the middle east and how people are dying for no reason against their will it's nice to see a film that shows just how selfless and heroic these soldiers are as well as those awaiting their return br br communist russia shows how involved all were in the war while boris may have volunteered to go to the his father is head doctor of a hospital aiding in the of soldiers injured and his sister is helping him there as well as his girl veronika doing all she can to keep her mind off the fact that no letter has arrived from her love an entire city comes out to send the boys off in celebration even the factory that boris and his friend work for send representatives over with gifts of gratitude whether this is all a glorified look into russia at the outset of wwii or not i don't know there are no protests or badmouthing of these boys risking their lives for a country it is all praise and thanks some in america could learn a lesson from this because whether you agree with the war at hand or not protesting and wreaking havoc in its name only sullies what these men and women are sacrificing each and everyday br br the acting is top notch throughout but some deserve singling out i really enjoyed in a small role as boris' grandmother she is the one family member he can trust and her sadness at his leaving is very evident on her face and through her body language as the patriarch fyodor brings what is perhaps the best performance as spoken at the end about fathers needing to choke back hidden tears epitomizes those sentiments he puts on a tough exterior especially cracking jokes and riding his son hard when he finds out about his volunteering just hours before he must leave but when boris exits to go to the assembly station we see the true pain of the man seated in sorrow at the table he loves his son dearly and although he may not be able to show it to him his actions throughout the film express it to the audience is effective as boris a happy go lucky young man and idealist doing what he believes is right and aleksandr is good as the villainous mark staying home due to his talented piano skills or maybe just to steal his cousin's love that love played by really draws the audience in to her grief and slim glimmer of hope the true star of the film she must go through many emotions on a journey where she does lose her way needing to steer back on course hoping that she did so soon enough for boris' return br br besides the realism to the story as well as being unafraid to use tragedy to get the theme across i also loved the visual style of the film sergei cinematography is amazing especially when considering the movie was shot in fullscreen it is one thing to create stunning compositions in a widescreen panorama it is completely different to do so in a square frame right from the beginning we get a beautiful static shot of a winding along water a bridge in the background at the top as our two lovers skip their way up the screen and into the distance there are multiple instances of the camera being behind barriers yet still allowing for the action to be seen creating unique spatial depth and interest at all times sharp angles are utilized as well as careful blocking to allow for overhead shots and exaggerated juxtapositions of characters in frame together br br the real feats however are those instances of the long shot used well towards the end to follow veronika through the mass of returning soldiers it is magnificent earlier on as she roams through those saying goodbye to their loved ones while she searches for boris her own farewell needing to be said the planning for this shot must have been extensive because while she weaves in and out of people the camera focuses on couples kisses people yelling to one another and more all purposely in frame at specific moments while the camera moves through everyone needed to hit his mark precisely and it leads to a brilliant piece of cinema it's just one part of an overall masterpiece of tone and style the cranes are flying shows how successful placement and mise en can be in showing the audience what it needs in as simple a way as possible composition and professionalism from the actors and crew can work wonders adding something that huge setpieces and special effects can never do
<START> i just cannot believe the low scores for this movie probable reason has to do with the low number of votes meaning few people have seen it this is simply a fantastic movie there are so many stories inter within but it's not complicated each character grows with the movie and we experience with them undergoing life changes the scenery is simply amazing and the end credits are the best ever in any movie i have seen just like a shakespeare play yes it's a little dated filmed in 1982 but the issues the characters face are very current it could have been filmed in 2002 without modifications to the story line raul julia is amazing best role ever in a movie this is his signature piece a young molly ringwald is excellent as she matures from girl to young woman susan sarandon is perfect as a young carefree woman and john cassavetes is the force that puts this all together do yourself a favor find this movie view it enjoy it come back to imdb and score this movie into the top 250 of all time where it really belongs
<START> perhaps i was just in a really good mood when i watched this film but for whatever reason i really liked this film was it terribly original no was it a bit predictable yes and so what it was still a really nice movie i've always liked bruce willis well almost always there was hudson hawk and the fifth element after all and he portrayed a selfish sarcastic b perfectly maybe this movie isn't academy award material but it sure is feel good material go rent it
<START> the title leads viewers to believe that this is a fun movie to watch and probably much better when watched under the influence but it is not good at all one 15 minute sequence with jack black beautifully playing one of his songs and tripping on acid while venturing through the woods does not save this movie at all every actor in this movie has gone on to do better things except for the main girls i could not think of one movie where i had seen them before i hate to bash movies but i also hate not being able to find something decent in movies the film is sad not very funny and had such potential with its awesome cast if it were redone and written over it could be awesome if you want a good movie to see stoned watch grandma's boy or half baked or dazed and confused but this is not a movie to be seen at all
<START> this is a wonderful new movie currently still showing in cinemas in my country its director the gianni is in my humble view perhaps the only contemporary italian director along with nanni moretti to deserve being called great that is apart from the old masters who're still around and occasionally still churning out movies it's one of my greatest regrets that contemporary italian cinema has been ailing since the mid 70s mostly due to a dire lack of funding and nurturing of new talent something which can be transferred to most fields and which makes italy one of the most static countries of our time production wise both in an industrial and cultural sense unlike say china and this among other things is precisely the subject of latest movie few directors can speak to me about the true present state of my country and the world as can yet his pictures also have a precious timelessness and universality and for those already worrying that they may be slow ponderous and worthy rest assured of the ones i've seen they most certainly aren't at least not if you're used to quality european cinema br br the basic plot outline vincenzo is a technician at an obsolete steel plant factory somewhere in italy probably the north he is played by sergio castellitto one of contemporary italy's most versatile and talented actors when a major chinese steel company purchases some of the italian steel plant's industrial machinery vincenzo who struggles to make himself understood with the non italian speaking chinese director tries to tell him that the machine is defective and its needs substituting an element he's working on custom building himself he warns them that not doing this might have very dangerous consequences meanwhile a young chinese woman called liu acts as interpreter between the two men but seems to struggle to find adequate translations for some of vincenzo's technical jargon the italian eventually loses his patience with her virtually pushing her aside and asking her to hand him the chinese italian dictionary so that he can do the translating himself br br despite vincenzo's warnings the following morning he finds that the chinese factory director and his employees have returned to their own country while not heeding his advice about the adequate use of the industrial machine at all thus vincenzo equipped with his great integrity sets off for china and here begins an endlessly fascinating road movie through china a very topical 21st century odyssey through the asian giant a latter day marco quest for the secrets of the mysterious nation not quite as in all of movies the journey itself becomes far more important than whether its ultimate mission is carried out or not in fact the way in which the point is literally brought home not without a touch of humour is a lovely poignant paradox and irony which made my eyes well up while i was simultaneously smiling the spectator is let in on the secret that vincenzo's trip was ultimately completely useless but he himself doesn't know it and goes home a satisfied man a deluded innocent at least you figure he's happy sort of br br the journeys that characters embark on totally and strips them down to their bare human essentials they are momentarily without name status or someone to put in a word for them these theo angelopoulos like themes are also explored in actually my favourite movie closely followed by la stella che non in order of personal preference in the 1994 movie two italian racketeers travel to albania to do business just like vincenzo they intend to go there do what they have to do and then go back home instead one of these two italians accidentally ends up on an almost homeric journey through this devastated land just after the fall of communism br br but let us go back to la stella che non once vincenzo is in china he predictably discovers that the seemingly simple task of handing the to its new owner is anything but straight forward the piece of new location is seemingly almost impossible to determine unless he embarks on an arduous journey through china when he comes across liu the young interpreter he'd mistreated now working as a librarian he tries to speak to her but she reacts in a hostile manner informing him that because of him she'd lost her job as interpreter back in italy played by the relative newcomer ling tai liu soon becomes a virgil to vincenzo's dante when she grudgingly figures that she could do worse than to act as guide and interpreter for the italian on his trip obviously for a consistent sum of cash this young chinese actress may not have the beauty of ziyi zhang nor the movie star glamour of gong li but her charming expressive and pretty face oozes a combination of defiant strength intelligence dignity and wry humour that'll make her features difficult to forget once you've seen the movie furthermore she and castellitto have wonderful emotional chemistry as co stars br br weaves dramas that are serious poetic mythical post neo realist and humorous all at once while maintaining a heart warming ability to explore the fleeting essence of humanity in everyday commonplace circumstances a documentary like naturalness conceals what is actually a meticulously conceived tapestry of faces and places a vista which also manages to incorporate a cinematography of breath taking beauty the photography here is functional yet gorgeous as befits a movie on the displaced in an industrial and emotional wasteland br br observant eye is a grown up disillusioned one yet also never a cynical or misanthropic one the masterful camera angles also often gives a sense of vincenzo's alienness in the eyes of the chinese bringing home a sense of objectivity and cultural impartiality that's very rare in movies about a familiar westerner exploring an unfamiliar non western country i cannot recommend this movie enough
<START> this movie has got to be one of the all time lows of michael j fox's generally respectable career i should have known how awful this movie was when i rented it and found the movie only half viewed and not rewound by the previous renter never a good sign fox plays a grown up child star who's now an agent for other show business kids his character is delusional in that he still believes that everyone should love him for being mikey his big break comes when he meets angie vega a talented child vega is abrasive and not at all likeable in fact the only likeable character in the whole movie is cyndi lauper as a brooklyn accented receptionist for the agency one of those movies that makes me want to stick a post it note to the box warning others not to waste their time
<START> for us an abbott and costello movie is something you have to be in the mood for i'm very happy i recorded this my wife remembered it from when she was young but i had never seen it the family wanted to watch something not too serious before bed and this was selected br br our daughter has watched many of the old movies with us always complaining in the beginning but most often coming around she mostly ignored this in the beginning preferring to check her email but she started enjoying herself many times laughing out loud to the zaniness br br it's wonderful to think you can have a fun evening with a old the mono colour introduction that blends into the full colour fairy tale it's a fun twist of a story that everyone is familiar with that includes a little song and a little dance along with everything you expect lou and bud to delivery br br watch it with your children and have a very fun evening
<START> a great production that should be revived rebroadcast i doubt that it would be out of date i'd love to hear from anyone who knows whether videos exist of this series or any other information about where it could be found or viewed
<START> i have to agree with the other two comments i waited over a month to see this great new show a e had been hyping what a disappointment the show is pretty much all about ryan his voice overs are campy not creepy it sounds as if he is talking into a can as of the second episode which is roughly 30 minutes or so if you take out the commercials he is being chased or followed by something that he knows is demonic he can't say the name anytime someone needs to convey that name they write it on a piece of paper and hand it to someone else not particularly informative or entertaining or believable for the rest of us why can't he say the name supposedly it would give the demon more power funny i always thought demons wanted to hide their true identities if you know the exact name of the demon doesn't it make it easier for you to cast them out now the next episode which airs in just a little while is titled exorcism so is ryan in need of an exorcism already not to say that it couldn't happen but the show so far has not given any evidence or proof of anything i can tell ryan that if i were a small child hell if i was an adult and someone gave me a little bottle of holy water to chase away something that was terrifying me i would look elsewhere for help besides which if you don't use holy water blessings etc in the right way don't you risk just further infuriating whatever is already mad at you i will probably watch tonight but if these episodes are as ridiculous as the first it will probably be the last time i watch it
<START> i'm seen this documentary in its feature form in a movie theatre and the pictures are astonishing one really wonder how by jove did they manage to film those waves those animals those is that a plant a predator a creature from the movie anyway it's remarkable sure we've seen a lot of such documentary on tv with weird animals and so on but none with such a beauty a precision a deep emotion the only downside is the commentary in french it's narrated by franÃ§ois usually good and familiar with beautiful documentaries but the text is not good at all not enough informative of too much
<START> this has got to be the worst case of over acting since the silent era not just one or two actors but virtually the entire cast lee majors and bo svenson were fine but the rest of them look like their first time acting br br so the budget was not tremendous much of the costumes and set were believable but there were many things that jump out at the viewer to let us know that they couldn't double check or get all of the props to match the period br br i can't think of one aspect of the film that i liked or didn't shake my head your time will be better spent burning lint collected from your
<START> this is a wonderful film taking place during the romantic period of the civil war this film is a must see for eastwood fans and eastwood claims this is one of his most favorite films that he did i couldn't agree more watch out this is a spoiler eastwood does die in the end eastwood and director don siegel rightfully argued that the ending should be unexpected and should be unhappy for a few reasons they wanted to stick to the book for one secondly there can't always be a happy ending thirdly this was written during the vietnam war they wanted a negative statement to this terrible struggle of war where people were needlessly dying i agree with all of this it is a wonderfully shot film and i love most films involving the civil war it is more of a portrait of how deceptive women can be that they can be more dangerous than men hence the title has much to do with the statement of the film beguiled to be deceived the song sung by eastwood at the beginning and the end of the film is another statement against not just the civil war but the vietnam war and maybe indirectly the women he comes across during the film wonderful story of love and deception and many memorable scenes note this film is rated r for no reason there is hardly any language it is probably some of the subject matter involving sex but there is no nudity really excellent film 9 10
