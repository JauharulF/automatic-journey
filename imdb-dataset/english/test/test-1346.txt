<START> one of starewicz's longest and strangest short films follows a toy dog in search of an orange after becoming animated by the tear of the mother of a girl who longs for an orange the dog comes upon an orange after falling out of the back of a car on his way to be sold but at night must protect the orange when he comes enters a devilish nightclub featuring many bizarre and scary characters with the help of a stuffed cat the dog gets the orange back to the little girl and she is saved from a terrible death the mascot features new techniques i have not yet seen in starewicz's films the addition of sync sound and a mixture of live action with the stop motion animation makes for a new twist on starewicz's old style of puppetry live scenes of moving cars and people's feet walking by as a puppet sits on the concrete sidewalk is impressive and fresh the honking of cars and cries of street vendors is noteworthy due to the fact that small studio shifts to sound were costly and starewicz's of the new technology seems like old hat new puppet characters in this film are frightening contributions to the devil's club scene and newspaper shreds come to life skeletons of dead birds lay eggs which hatch skeleton chicks characters come flying in from all over on pats and pans and rocking horses a new editing technique uses quick zooms which are accomplished through editing to speed up the pace of what before might have been a slow scene overall starewicz is able to update his style of film making to meet the demands of a new audience making this film one of the best examples of his work
<START> we all know bits and pieces of gulliver's travels tiny people yeah sure giants too some of us may recall some might remember the word yahoo comes from here that's were it stops for most people br br swift's book is omnipresent in school libraries that's were i first read it and there's were a lot of people read it for the last time it is treacherously lightly written like many of the old adventure books children can read it still it's dripping with satire black and uncompromising that's something i think most screen writers forget when they adapt this movie br br this movie remembers however our hero ted danson gives a credible and serious performance as the world adjusted man who's thrown to mysterious countries so like our own gulliver's travels criticizes everything scientists government ethnicity humanity itself few are spared and most of the satire is just as fresh today br br while very faithful to the story the movie also dares adding new angles all which work very well the screen writer deserves all credit for managing to balance so well between time and activity it's not boring that is br br production values are way beyond a tv movie with some marketing this movie would have done well at the box office all of the fantastic worlds gulliver visits are well made explained in detail and often very funny much like swift's book br br actors are all pros since this is a british production mary steenburgen stands out along with james fox's dr bates the chillingly cruel doctor who much like nurse only wants the patient's best br br so a modest proposal if you ever get the chance to get this movie do so it's a real treat
<START> there was nothing else on tv yesterday afternoon so i thought okay let's watch this i didn't know the plot and i had no expectation whatsoever i was thinking in a few minutes or so i will channel surf again but then story started to unfold and the characters played beautifully by the two boys the story did have unrealistic parts and scenes but overall it was a real good movie very well worth watching
<START> as talk shows go larry king live is not bad and since he occasionally gets good guests it's a show to turn on once in awhile but not compulsively when bill maher carl bernstein a former president or other substantive guests sit across from him it's not too bad other times he tends to host guests involved in the latest celebrity scandal which contributes absolutely no intelligent information to the country and feeds a largely uneducated public that wants to hear the latest gossip about movie and tv stars during the oj simpson trial it seemed like every other guest on his show was related to the case but is this really journalism or the national enquirer on the tube sometimes it comes off a little bit like trash television jerry springer in a sit down interview with phone calls instead of a live audience br br on the other side king's show is definitely much better than bill o'reilly whose show is nothing more than a political platform of the rush limbaugh variety that said larry king is not a bad interviewer but alas he is not a great one king does not always come off like he completely when intellectual material is being presented especially if it is by a scholar or historian with a new book on subtle aspects of politics always seems like the minute king can't quite deal with the issue at hand that's when he turns to the phone calls maybe hoping someone out in the country will have a better question than he has he might interview someone like david but may not have read any of his books sort of like the movie producer that never bothers to read the script br br when it's an entertainment celebrity no problem he can come off like he's thoroughly knowledgeable since the material is not that substantive anyway talking to elizabeth taylor about her relationship with richard burton is not exactly rocket science and i notice he usually has seen the star's latest movie watching a movie takes much less time and contemplation than reading a book however if it's the likes of john dean or bob woodward king comes off a little like he didn't quite finish his homework so off to the phones br br if you are looking for real in depth interviewing terry gross of npr is probably the best interviewer in the united states she reads and or researches everything written by or about her guests beforehand and has a working knowledge of those areas i don't see king quite doing that granted he probably has an audience 1000 times larger than terry gross which may say more about the american audience than king in short larry is better than bill but not as good as terry
<START> i've seen various hamlets and i've taught the play as i watch jacobi i'm tempted to think that he's every bit as intelligent as hamlet himself so alive is he to every nuance of this character's wit he deepens rather than solves every puzzle regarding hamlet's character he illuminates line after line word after word shining light into this sparkling mind at the same time however we cringe at the horror hamlet feels at his betrayal far more than with any other actor because jacobi feels the pain more profoundly than anyone else and we shudder at hamlet's own betrayals because jacobi is not afraid of the baseness to which hamlet can descend in short jacobi gives us hamlet in full and hamlet in full is the greatest character in literature that's why i'm satisfied that jacobi's hamlet is the finest performance i've seen by an actor
<START> the core message is strong the cast has given it their best shot the packaging is excellent but the screenplay is seriously over dramatized and every cliche in the book on women's suffering in india has been over used to the max
<START> not a stunner but a good movie to see once or twice bill macy shows he can do more than just act his writing was pretty darn good great supporting cast especially jamie cromwell as the extortionist private eye br br the movie's greatest strength is the work of macy who reminds us of his jerry role from fargo he has numerous scenes where he is extremely funny as a slimy manipulating and deceitful character it's enjoyable to watch him be a weasel and for a while i was happy that things were turning out well for him out of four
<START> the violent men is pretty good western that certainly benefits from its excellent cast br br edward g robinson is the big rancher trying to squeeze out the smaller ranchers one of whom is glenn ford ford is ready to sell to appease his fiance may wynn until robinson's ambitious brother brian keith murders one of ford's hands then you know what happens next br br barbara stanwyck is along as robinson's scheming wife the kind of role in which she specialized dianne foster plays their daughter who comes to admire ford br br the violent men is nothing more than a b plot with an a movie cast but it is very well done
<START> if you're a north american looking for a here it is was this trading spaces visits tuscany there were way too many stereotypes little attention was given to character and plot development yawn highlight of the film the flag throwing poor guy i thought he was going to loose an eye
<START> this film was a new direction for natalie portman a much more adult role though she comes to it from the traces of a child in the movie itself ann portman and susan sarandon who plays her newly divorced mother adele travel from a small town in the middle of nowhere to beverly hills there these tortured souls try to come to terms with their new life and their new relationship as portman's character grows up unknowingly at first to adele she grows up and becomes a better mother for it br br ann sees her mother telling her she wants to be an actress or so she thinks adele uses that crutch every time there are problems in their lives we see their struggle as mother and daughter come to terms between themselves and with being alone having left their old lives behind br br the acting is top notch from both of them they seemingly become mother and daughter before your eyes you can almost feel there is a bond there beyond the actual movie br br though this movie really doesn't take us to any new ground in these types of films the fact that the acting is well done and the story isn't too flawed let's me recommend it br br i will say however it will probably go away soon i don't believe it can have the staying power needed for a huge christmas season of movies starting in a week or so see it now before this happens if you like either of these actresses
<START> the dead truly is a work of art clearly john huston meant to show that he was still in the full glory of some passion by making it even as his body was failing him this movie is powerfully affecting and lingers in the mind long after it is done reading the joyce short story certainly adds more depth to the characters especially gabriel's inner turmoil but the essence is all there in this film as a statement by an artist of his love of life and his craft the dead stands alone
<START> here's what's good about the slaughter rule br br ryan gosling clea duvall and david morse all give great performances gosling is as always pretty darn outstanding the locales are often breathtaking br br here's what's bad about the slaughter rule br br everything else the script is horribly muddled and while i can certainly appreciate a non feel good movie this movie is just boring great performances can't make up for a movie with a stupid premise and a script that is filled with throw away lines that often don't even make it sense just getting through the first hour became a chore br br i stuck with it because of gosling but eventually i did myself a favor and changed the channel spoilers on here relayed the ending to me i didn't miss much do yourself a favor if you want a good gosling flick check out the believer br br my score 2 out of 10
<START> this is the best movie ever but that is my opinion some say it's cheesy but i think it is truly a beautiful film the chemistry between jennifer grey and patrick swayze it's like no other i have ever seen and that is what makes the film so perfect i always wonder what would have been of this film if these two actors never existed because not just one them did it for me they both did if you have never seen this film when you do you will understand what i mean dirty dancing looks like it was done from the heart and it feels so real for some reason like magic and the soundtrack love it besides the 2 lead actors the soundtrack makes the film the beauty that it is as you can tell i am in love with this film and i know you will be too
<START> i'm bout it 1997 br br developed published by no limit films br br pros absolutely none br br cons i don't even know where to begin br br plot summary master p plays a drug dealer that looks talks and acts more like a live action cartoon character that's all the plot i got out of this movie br br review i remember back when i was in the ninth grade during its release and everyone in my class praised this clown called master p this movie is so bad it's not even funny all the characters in this film are extremely tired stereotypes the audio is only audible when music plays and the movie looks like it was videotaped off a public access channel luckily i didn't buy this film like all my other inner city degenerate classmates br br my rating 1 out of 10 br br my verdict avoid this video like its a sexually transmitted disease
<START> years ago sara a young girl witnessed her parents being murdered now as an adult she suffers from various mental ailments did i mention she has an imaginary friend this film lulls the viewer not into a sense of tension mind you but rather a sense of sleepiness deathly boring i found it hard to sit through as i could feel my eyelids growing heavier and heavier with each endless minute of mindless prattle and supposed 'mystery' is sara going crazy or is it the paranormal a better question would be who cares and the answer to that no one no one at all skip this film save yourself some time better suited to do other more worthwhile tasks br br my grade d
