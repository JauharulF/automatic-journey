<START> the above profile was written by me when i used the nick of which is still my email address i still believe andy devine's character of frisky is the best twilight episodes ever and i watch this episode at least once a year as i consider to be a fortunate man as he has many friends who love him dearly br br in case many of you are too young to remember i'm 61 andy devine hosted a children's entertainment show in the 50's i believe called andy's gang on it he had three assistants a cat named midnight who played the violin a mouse named squeaky who played an a hand organ and a devilish toad named who's could appear and disappear at will embarrassing many of andy's funny guest stars like billy gilbert
<START> on halloween a town is terrorized by a lunatic with a big pumpkin for a head bad acting compromised mostly of local talent and laughable special effects makes this one baaaaad b movie queen linnea quigley looks embarrassed to be a part of this one and even her considerable charm which has helped so many of her other films can't help this one pass this cheesy flick if you are looking for a good halloween horror film and rent night of the demons which also stars ms quigley
<START> house of the damned also known as spectre is one of your low budget haunted house horror flicks filled with mediocre performances and cheap effects it is about a family that inherits an old irish mansion and after moving in begin to experience strange phenomenon and ghostly apparitions including the ghost of a young girl who was murdered and buried within a wall in the mansion's basement the couple's young daughter is then whisked away into some other dimension and they seek help from a group of paranormal investigators for help br br the ideas this film borrowed from the 1982 haunted house film poltergeist are obvious i will say that this movie does have some slightly creepy sequences but it is sometimes very very boring the acting here is nothing special the mood is alright the score which was mostly this dramatic irish opera music was somewhat annoying and the cgi special effects are really horrible i mean it was 1996 you would think they could have done a little better than they did the ending where the house was on fire was the poorest special effect i've seen very very cheap but hey this was a cheap movie br br also the translucent monster wolf thing that their daughter sees looks horribly fake and what was it's significance in the film anyway what the heck does a wolf monster have to do with a haunted house the special effects in here are what really ruined this movie the acting was pretty bad too i usually enjoy many low budget horror films but not this one house of the damned is nothing special at all only consider watching it if you have nothing better to do but you'll probably want to pass on it 4 10
<START> early talkie feature based on a popular stage play a murder has been committed and a bunch of people hire a medium to conduct a sÃ©ance to see who the murderer is while the lights are out there's another murder so it's someone in that room br br what follows is an obvious dull and creaky murder mystery most of the cast overacts to a ridiculous degree they act like they're on stage where you have to overdo things and it looks silly on screen most embarrassing is bela lugosi two years before dracula who really overdoes it as a police inspector static direction by tod browning who was always overrated doesn't help br br for browning and lugosi completists only i give it a 3
<START> i can't understand why imdb users would rate this movie 5 2 10 it really is great very funny i would strongly recommend this movie for all of you adults teenagers and especially children br br the story is about a 14 year old kid who always tell lie at home and school one day he had his homework of writing a 1000 word story but he didn't so the teacher told him to write it and gave her in 3 hours or he would have to go to summer school yep he wrote it in 2 45 big fat liar i think it was a story of himself on the way to the school he hit a limo of a famous hollywood producer and he gave him a ride but the kid forgot the story in the limo he told his parents and the teacher but of course they did not believe him and the movie producer he took the kid's story as his new movie big fat liar when the kid saw the trailer of the movie he told his parents he had written it but they didn't believe so he and his friend had to go to l a to prove one thing the truth is never overrated br br enjoy this great movie you won't be disappointed don't trust the 5 2 10 rate it should be 9 10 believe me br br p s so sorry my english isn't good enough to make a better comment
<START> first of i should point out that i used to love winnie the pooh as a child and i really enjoyed the movie even though i am in my 20's br br but this movie was so bad i was ashamed to have been a fan in my youth br br ok ok i know this is a movie for kids and isn't aimed at people like me anyway but this is my thoughts on the movie for other people of my age br br the main downfall in this film is the itself it has to be the most annoying character i have seen in a child's movie possibly even more annoying then the young child in monsters inc it has the most annoying voice and prattles around singing stupid things and making even more stupid comments i know pooh movies aren't exactly high brow but this was insulting to even a 2 year old's intelligence br br secondly where was the story previous pooh outings had a least a point to the story yes i can see this was about accepting people who are different to you into your hearts but really it ended and i felt like i had watched a 5 minute cartoon on kids tv br br i don't have children of my own but when i do i fully intend to show them quality children's movies like the movie toy story and finding nemo even though they are too childish for me these days i can see how they would be of great appeal to young children not so with this appalling attempt at a movie br br oh and one more thing not enough eeyore he should have his own movie
<START> i just read an extra long review on the front page of this movie on this site and he explained in full detail that this movie is only worth watching on the television show mystery science theater 3000 and yes i do find that advice really helpful i mean a movie that tries to be this good and this exciting just really is not what that movie wants to be so yes do watch this movie as seen on that show and instead of giving this movie a single star out of ten stars you can give this a ten out of ten stars until then my one star review is for the real pure untouched version of this movie only got that now
<START> i had always wanted to see this film and the first three fourths proved i hadn't waited in vain but what the hell happened in the end i mean don't get me wrong i liked the film it definitely made me nostalgic of the realistic unique nyc of the 80s that we have lost thanks to giuliani but it's missing another half hour
<START> henry thomas and robin are a couple of the most underrated performers in the business it's beyond me as to why they haven't received more recognition than they have this movie is a perfect example of how boundless their abilities are br br acting out the lives of folks who could be referred to as a bit odd seems to be their speciality and if these characters ain't odd i'm at a loss to find anyone who is br br the story is funny romantic dramatic complicated and tragic i hated the ending but if i hadn't i wouldn't have loved the story as a whole so there ya go
<START> it plays like your usual teenage audience t a movie but the sentiment is incredibly bleak if it was made today it'd be considered an art house movie it goes through the usual routine of a guy trying to get laid but the results of his efforts are harsh and cruel and unsatisfying br br the whole teen flick formula is adhered to but nothing turns out the way you'd expect imagine a director's cut of 'it's a wonderful life' where at the end james stewart wasn't allowed to return to the real world an incredible film that subverts all of the expectations of the genre it makes you feel dirty afterwards there is no redemption for the characters i'm amazed it ever got made the eighties version of detective story
<START> this is a special film if you know the context antonioni in his eighties had been crippled by a stroke mute and half paralyzed his friends who incidentally are the best the film world has arranged for him to a last significant film the idea is that he can conjure a story into being by just looking at it so we have a film about a director who conjures stories by simple observation and the matter of the four stories is about how the visual imagination defines love br br the film emerges by giving us the tools to bring it into being through our own imagination the result is pure movie world every person except the director is lovely in aspect or movement some of these women are and they exist in a dreamy misty world of sensual encounter there is no nuance no hint that anything exists but what we see no desire is at work other than what we create br br i know of no other film that so successfully manipulates our own visual yearning to have us create the world we see he understands something about not touching no one understands van morrison visually like he does morrison's celtic space music is predicated on precisely the same notion the sensual touch that implies but doesn't physically touch br br antonioni's redhead wife appears appropriately as the shopkeeper and she also directs a lackluster 'making of' film that is on the dvd br br ted's evaluation 3 of 4 worth watching
<START> i was very disappointed when this show was canceled although i can not vote i live on the island of i sat down to see the show on tuesday and was very surprised that it didn't aired the next day i read on the internet that it was canceled br br it's true not every one was as much talented as the other but there were very talented people singing br br i find it very sad for them br br that they worked so hard and there dreams came tumbling down br br its a pity br br
<START> if you loved the 1993 erotic sci fiction cyborg film nemesis then you'll love this one i loved it the minute the elvis hero pulls out a samurai sword during a shoot out like nemesis its takes place in a post apocalyptic slum of the future both are police thrillers where the well armed hero must take on well armed rebels to solve a conspiracy by the powers that be against the unwashed masses but thats where the similarities ends the ambiguous mayor in dead or alive tries to keep the masses sedate on the drugs he sells them the rebels aided by mercenaries and a cyborg try to brake his suffocating hold on his subjects after several failed attempts to brake the rebels back he sends his top cop to assassinate the rebels this movie follows the track of most action adventure but isn't afraid to color outside the line
<START> in chicago four electricians leaded by dean richard grieco come to an old building to disconnect power they accidentally activate a portal and arrive in another dimension where chicago was destroyed by a spider queen and inhabited by mutants the group meets survivors leaded by crane david and elena kate greenhouse and finds the inventor of the portal dr richard colin fox who has been living in this dimension for thirty years they join forces trying to rebuilt a portal to bring them back home webs is a watchable of sliders only worse most of the dialogs seem to be written by a person who has not concluded the elementary school so imbecile they are further the story is illogical and seems that chicago is the only city in the world the scientist trying to start his sophisticated machine with broken wires as if he were stealing a car is very funny the face of richard grieco looks like a white version of michael jackson and is horrible if the viewer shuts down his or her brain he or she may like this forgettable tv movie my vote is four br br title brazil na do terror in the web of horror
<START> oh how awfully this movie is i don't know if it is a horror film or a drama cause the story and the both genres are not established very well the story is not moving it is slow boring and sleepy from the beginning to end this movie really bores me but i really liked the camera work it is authentic fresh and clear the acting is great too the little boy was the great performer in this movie but it hasn't made me to jump from my seat but this movie makes me grab a pillow lay on the bed and sleep until the credits roll br br boring not worth watching i tell you this movie sucked br br 1 10
