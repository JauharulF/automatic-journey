<START> it's a bit unnerving when a studio declines to screen a film for the press before it goes into wide release that many movies suck is no surprise but when a studio itself admits as much ahead of time the process of movie going becomes a passion play of sorts consider it an early christmas gift from hollywood then that aeon flux isn't nearly the affront to taste and decency one might expect given the above though ultimately overwhelmed by its flaws it at least has sort of an idea with which to toy around too bad director karyn kusama seems to have little clue how to execute it all br br it's the future there's been a plague there is a dictatorship and there are rebels the latter are known as the and far from being a cult of beret or tennis racket worshipers they're into attempts to overthrow the former called the regime the regime is occasionally mean to the citizenry which is more than aeon flux charlize theron and her pals can stand through some sort of biochemical virtual reality technology the receive orders from their dear leader frances a mystical priestess type who appears to have been cross bred with a carrot it falls to aeon to strap on some form fitting futuristic spandex get ups to carry out the high orders which are of course some version of destroy the regime having years earlier watched her sister get liquidated by the she needs little convincing br br not surprisingly things get complicated the might not be quite what they seem and aeon herself might have an unexpected history with them though occasionally muddled the film's central conceit of which i won't reveal more contains some neat notions about the nature of human existence and survival there's room for much more examination of which the film doesn't take advantage but the ideas are there at least the big problems of aeon flux are technical kusama has made the baffling decision to film nearly all the action so close that we can rarely follow what's going on to make matters worse it's edited in a flurry of jump cuts that leave us completely lost the result is some serious spacial disorientation that takes over the film aeon flux 's aesthetic is one of sleek costume oddly angled architecture and nimble characters much of the action occurs in minimalist open spaces that beg for some unbroken long shots that might convey the grace and athleticism implied by the above instead we get split seconds of flying limbs breaking glass and accompanying sound effects br br there is a pretty good movie trying to get out of the morass of aeon flux put this stuff in the hands of the wachowski brothers say and the results could be quite different as it is though i felt like aeon flux was willfully pushing me away from a movie i wanted to enjoy this film is unattuned to its own strengths like a novice poker player dealt a royal flush it somehow finds a way to lose in spite of its potential
<START> this movie is so cool it told me to enjoy every moment in life to its i think that bonnie hunt jerry maguire writes well and i am so happy that she gave aging actors opportunity to have such big roles in the movie that is really neat in a society that worships wealth health and youth it was nice to see a movie about normal people the movie reminded me a lot of while you were sleeping which i really love if you don't like this movie you should work on your sensitivity skills br br favorite quotes megan dayton i'm just saying for safety don't shave your legs because then you definitely won't let it go too far grace briggs megan it's a first date megan dayton i married a first date i'm sure you plan on being level headed but once you're in the moment the male brain seems i don't know everything they say suddenly seems brilliant hairy legs are your only link to reality favorite scenes megan good will hunting riding her bike all the scenes in the garden the conversation and comradery among the grandpa and friends in the restaurant please do not miss this movie it will warm up your heart
<START> if i could rate it a zero i would coming from someone who likes shock exploitation films of the time and waters overall i must say this is useless br br it does nothing serves nothing an idiot with a camera and a urge to prove his cleverness by against social standards is all this comes off as br br its entirely amateur both in principle and execution it doesn't have a point its for the sake of disgusting obscene with the wit of a neanderthal its useless br br someone said waters was probably chuckling over all the bad press and disgust others gave with this film but why if i made a short film depicting a man in a bathroom taking a sh t for ten minutes straight surely it would receive the same but why would i be proud or chuckle at that br br would it be because i am so unintelligent that i have to resort to this so i can say ha take that censors and mainstream im so rebellious ill do whatever i want and film it no br br waters shouldn't be proud of this mess fans of waters shouldn't watch it its useless that is without any use br br its doesn't even fit under the criteria of art for arts sake br br to like or defend this movie is to defend something that was designed purposely as being anti culture to be pushed for the mainstream audience in modern terms this film is the hot topic of films br br useless and obsolete a poser film that demands it be acknowledged as rebellion
<START> i finished watching mandy lane about an hour ago and felt the urge to come straight home and get up here to warn anyone that's about to spend money on the dvd don't br br the supporting characters are shallow the failure of acting is higher than that of matthew mcconaughey movies and up until the end twist the plot is everything but obvious in nine out of ten you can see the next scene coming 5 minutes before it starts the whole movie is more or less without motive or message and the half way revealing of the murderer just plain out kills what little interest you might have left at that point what could have saved this shallow tedious movie is some decent splatter or at least gore worthy of the genre slasher it fails there as well br br if you need a background movie to a party that you can jump in and out of without missing anything i recommend buying all the boys love mandy lane br br if you're looking to sit down and actually concentrate your eyes on the screen for more than 15 seconds i don't
<START> kaige succeeds in this beautifully done film the pace matches the story the direction is superb and the casting acting is perfect the only draw back are one or two slight editing errors i love film and i am a confessed stickler
<START> you know sometimes you just gotta have it that's how this movie is with me i am almost embarrassed to admit that i like it it is so goofy in some parts but i find myself reaching for it when i'm down and just need a good laugh and trust me i am just not a goofy movie kinda guy br br you can read the synopsis so i don't have to bore you with that just rest assured if you like kelsey you will probably like this movie br br one more thing be sure to watch the end credits you don't need to read them just watch them and catch the performance of in the navy by the village people and friends
<START> i have just finished watching this film for the first time and i must say that i am very impressed br br how bleak how full of despair how nightmarish incredible br br visually stunning several scenes are embedded in my mind the first appearance of the phantom carriage the soul of david holm as it rises from his corpse his spirit on his knees pleading br br this film takes a simple story that of the ghostly driver of the phantom carriage doomed to collect the souls of the dead for a year brings it into the present setting of the film and then uses flashbacks as a means to explain how david holm ends up in his predicament br br i would love to see this released on dvd so that more might see it everyone should
<START> this landmark film can now be seen in two different versions on the grapevine video release which also includes the english translation of selma novel which she based on a swedish the first version is the swedish edit under the title of the phantom carriage the second version is a reconstruction of the way it was shown in the united states under the title of the stroke of midnight as released by metro before it was m g m the actual us release has long vanished but a detailed review in the new york times lets us know how the scenes were for domestic release and both are fascinating to see each version of this film was presented at the organ loft in salt lake city with live theatre organ scores provided by artist blaine gale a live recording was made of these performances and are included on the grapevine video dvd along with the novel and notes about the two versions while the phantom carriage follows the order of novel the stroke of midnight is in some ways easier to follow seeing the two different edits is an education in how silent films could be changed effectively for release in different countries br br some viewers look at this film as a horror film which it certainly is not this is a morality play with shades of the supernatural used to hit home its stark message the directing and lead performance by the great victor were way ahead of their time it's easy to see why m g m brought him to hollywood to direct such films as lillian gish in the scarlet letter and the wind as well as lon chaney in he who gets slapped in america he was known as victor he would also star in the lead role of ingmar bergman's wild strawberries giving a masterful performance bergman was greatly influenced by or the phantom carriage in his earlier days br br this is a powerful film that is well worth taking some time to discover and study the grapevine video release is an excellent way to do this
<START> the 1973 musical version of lost horizon is the most wonderful endearing and campy musical films of all time the 1973 musical remake of the james hilton novel about mythical shangri la is a real special gem music by burt bacharach and lyrics by hal david a strange mixture of straight drama adventure and musical sequences it has the distinction of being the only anti war musical fantasy ever filmed br br this film was a critical and financial disappointment in the united states but made a lot of money overseas only in america did it fail highly different and unique in it's approach as a film musical it deserves far better credit than it's given as a story lost horizon is an incredible adventure and both the 1937 frank capra film and this 1973 musical are faithful adaptations of the james hilton novel what i like about the 1973 version is the freedom in which the musical numbers are presented the film has a prestigious cast and a gifted director and cinematographer this is a burt bacharach shangri la and it's a wonderful place songs like the world is a circle share the joy and living together growing together evoke a happiness that hilton wrote about in his novel why shouldn't shangri la be a slightly goofy place the two love songs i might frighten her away and the deleted i come to you are the sensitive spots in the picture there's a peacefulness and soft spoken quality in both these songs that is very much keeping with the philosophy of the story moreover the things i will not miss is a good duet with a strong melody it's a nice exchange of different types of perspective and who can fault with olivia hussey and sally kellerman stomping singing and dancing on tables they're a wonderful team and the number is well staged br br i always found it interesting in this story how the high lama kidnaps someone from the outside world to take his place in shangri la the character of the high lama is a gentle soul but somewhat radical in his view of mankind as a whole he has no hope for the world outside of shangri la if this film were to be remade today it would be interesting to see more emphasis put on the leading character richard conflict with what he left behind in the outside world as opposed to what he's found in shangri la br br of course for the film to be believable the character of richard conway must be presented as suffering amnesia at the end like he was in the book neither film versions of lost horizon were faithful to the novel in that regard did conway find shangri la or was it imagined did they all die in the plane crash every man has his own idea of what his shangri la would be the conflict with conway wanting to believe in shangri la and returning to his old life in the outside world is powerful i like the melancholy on the faces of kellerman kennedy and van as they watch their friends leave the mystical valley interesting how conway doesn't want to leave paradise but is being pressured out by his brother both versions of lost horizon work in different ways but both are successful in probing james ideas of a hidden valley where money has no value and moderation is the rule so in a sense it's anti capitalism in it's theme where as money and materialism is not the motivation human kindness decency compassion courtesy etiquette and living harmoniously with each other is the rule br br lost horizon has a much stronger story than most musicals it attempts to answer the basic fundamental questions of life and one can hardly fault it for not succeeding one has to remember that lost horizon in 1973 was post cabaret it was no longer fashionable for characters to break out in song in a musical much less to be dubbed by other singers lost horizon was an easy target for jaded critics the expectations for it were high almost unreasonable there were two targets to be hit the producer ross hunter and burt bacharach and the critics were out to get both of them ross hunter had enjoyed decades of financial success as a producer and lost horizon was his follow up film to his 1970 blockbuster airport that film was biggest moneymaker up to that time and the success of that picture triggered a decade of disaster films for years airport was the most watched film ever to be shown on television it was nominated for 11 academy awards including best picture at the time burt bacharach and hal david were the most successful songwriters in the country the unabashed sentimentality of lost horizon hardly had a chance in the wake of the breakdown of censorship in films like easy rider midnight cowboy and the godfather sex and violence was a new frontier in the late 60's and early 70's audiences were flocking to films with content that they were not use to seeing on the screen lavish musicals were no longer well received no matter how well they were made today lost horizon can be enjoyed and appreciated on several levels it's the ultimate escapist film with a strong story wonderful music an expensive budget and some quirky humor it's unconventional in the sense that the music is not introduced until 45 minutes into the film it changes course mid way when the mystical valley is introduced and why not lost horizon '73 is a heavenly film that deserves rediscovering a lost and legendary treasure deserving far better than it's reputation
<START> kevin spacey is without a doubt one of the best actors of the 90s after his performances in the usual suspect se7en and american beauty you expect more and more from him that is why ordinary decent criminal is a huge disappointment br br michael lynch is the most artful criminal in dublin who is never in a bad mood his next heist becomes an obsession when his partners start questioning michael's ability to plan everything perfectly although this is the only thing he does when he isn't playing good father at home br br i guess it's partly my fault for not paying enough attention to the thousand plot details which sadly turn out to be the essence of the film i gave the movie a chance by calling it a parody and well parodies are always funny no matter what they spoof or how they do it so it wasn't after all a complete parody on purpose it's just a different con movie that desperately tries to be funny and fails br br unlike some of his colleagues ordinary decent criminal depends too much on story development and logical continuity forgetting what's the main reason the viewer has picked this kind of movie to be entertained this is definitely not entertainment it includes one of the most ridiculous scenes ever the introduction of michael's two wives i don't know whether it's some kind of a mindless metaphor or strange dark humor but the chicks are sisters remember spacey's character has kids br br ordinary decent criminal is complex and confusing you are not waiting for a funny scene instead you carefully follow the dialog because there is a big possibility of losing yourself into the boring pale universe the film has inhabited br br let's go back to spacey i wonder in what condition he has been signing for that movie it's not miscasting but something much worse an insult to his work in american beauty released an year before ordinary decent criminal the character michael is eccentric and talkative spacey is almost pathetic at times the only cure for this is thinking of lester and roger br br writer gerrard should definitely re consider his screen writing abilities and be more objective this time because the dialog is very weak and the scenes are often pointless and we are still talking about a comedy br br ordinary decent criminal is a really bad crime comedy which does not deserve your attention
<START> brit director nolan now has a career in america and a reputation for making movies both popular and critically acclaimed but this small film was where he started and it certainly showcased his talent with its striking black and white cinematography and storytelling that prefigures his later albeit in a less extreme way thematically and the plot reminded me of david mamet's 'house of games' but the film still feels fresh and sharp right up to the final twist of the ending whose flavour was expected but whose is unexpectedly delicious the acting on the other hand is not quite in the same class the film has a stylised quality and possibly to a greater extent than the director intended but it's still a fine debut simultaneously claustrophobic and beguiling
<START> i read on the web that this film is being remade into a theatrical feature finally it's about time hollywood got their act together the big studios always frown at edgy material with oscar written all over it go figure br br jericho mile was made ahead of it's time it's a masterpiece br br michael mann a true visionary found a way to engage an audience without overindulgence peter strauss' emmy award performance is probably the best character role i've seen in my film viewing lifetime any actor who touches this role will never be the same unless an academy award is already sitting on their mantle br br the gritty multi ethnic ensemble a backdrop for the jericho mile makes one understand the delicate social dynamics of our world this is about redemption without public validation and the power of the human spirit overcoming all barriers imagine a convict imprisoned since he was a teenager for life with no chance of parole that doesn't know he is possibly the fastest runner in the world what would you do br br this movie makes you walk away feeling you haven't been cheated on any level totally thrilling engaging emotional and a rolling stones soundtrack that ass br br i always thought this would be made for the big screen can't wait in the meantime i'll have to continue re watching my weathered vhs copy i've had for many years
<START> crazy director yeah you need to be crazy to make a near movie rob lowe was bad in his character ice t is always bad and burt reynolds had nothing to do in the movie crazy six is an unknown movie with some known actors this is pretty weird a bad movie with some good actors in it it looks like the bad movie did an influence to their performance it did crazy people i give it and a half out of
<START> i cannot see how anyone can say that this was a real good entertaining movie with a few well known actors i found it hard to believe that this was only made in 2005 it's crap the acting is tantamount to amateur dramatics poor amateur dramatics unless you want to laugh loudly at an amazing 100 minutes of pure corn don't bother to download it or rent it worst that i have seen in years it's from the bygone days of acting where cowboys are shooting 8 bullets from the six shooters the more well known the actor the worse they were drury was just sad i was extremely disappointed with lee majors has he actually stooped to this sort of garbage it was bad enough when he played the six million dollar man
<START> the deadly mantis certainly won't scare any one but as sci fi programmers go it is better than most a volcanic eruption at the south pole thaws out a giant prehistoric preying mantis at the north pole military men go missing dr ned william hopper hopper's son and best known as paul drake on television's perry mason is called in to i d the creature but by this time the creature has eaten up several eskimo and is en route to the washington monument br br about a third or more of the film consists of stock footage old government educational films military men in radar rooms air planes and would you believe eskimos putting out to sea which explains of course why a tribe of eskimo is attacked in the movie hey guys think we can work this in mix in some negligible special effects some clunky dialogue and some sexist attitudes and you're good to go not as original as the monster that challenged the world but fans of 1950s big bug schlock will enjoy it and the kids will have a good time throwing popcorn at the screen br br gary f taylor aka gft amazon reviewer
