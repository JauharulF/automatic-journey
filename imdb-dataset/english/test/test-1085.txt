<START> this movie could be a bit boring for some people but i find this film br br very interesting in terms of an attempt to reveal a tradition br br the director lim has made two films about traditional music in korea before this film the film before this one was showing the music throughout the film and this film is trying to achieve similar things by having backgrounds in the movie just like a painting br br another thing is that the story is written by both director and a philosopher kim who is well known scholar in korea holding a lot of degrees including doctor at i'm not saying that educated people make better films but that philosopher is an expert in traditional culture in korea so it gives more credit on this film
<START> i always think it would be nice if you could somehow have a 'sneak preview' at some of the old movies that are re released on dvd before you purchase them that way you could save yourself some time money and a certain degree of when you feel so utterly let down br br the buddy holly story is such a movie br br i do not wish to go into the characterizations or the holes in the plot or the messing around with historical facts that this movie encompasses for i had already come to terms with them twenty years ago when i first began watching it br br i had recorded it on the old beta machine back in the early 1980s and liked it so much that it became a regularly played favourite the best part to my mind was gary busey's performance as the young buddy and his near perfect vocals and guitar playing br br i looked forward to the day when i could have it in stereo and that is where the disappointment comes in br br this dvd version is supposedly re mastered in both audio and video according to the shell information but i'm afraid it left me sadly let down and glancing at my watch wishing for it to end br br the sound is murky bordering on the unintelligible and so unprofessionally mixed that it had me yearning for the crystal clarity vocals of my old beta tape br br despite what you think of the images or the plot or the characters the real draw card here is the music and if you can't hear the lead vocals because they are drowned out by the or the backing harmonies or other then there's not much left is there br br i'm going to convert my old beta version to mono dvd for subsequent viewings and put this one where it belongs out with the rubbish br br extinction is the rule survival is the exception
<START> less than two hundred and fifty years ago the last of the great pirates wrote their names in blood and fire across the pages of maritime history this is the story of a buccaneer captain whose name for one short year struck terror in the hearts of and merchants from the ports of the caribbean to the trading houses of london br br hmm that opening to the film sounds like we are in for one hell of a swashbuckling pillaging ripper of a movie doesn't it well it's not tho it's not totally without value as a curio piece out of 20th century fox anne of the indies is adapted by philip dunne arthur caesar from a short story written by herbert sass direction is by jacques tourneur the score is by franz waxman and harry jackson is providing the technicolor photography jean peters is in the titular title role of anne aka captain providence and support comes from louis debra paget herbert marshall thomas gomez james robertson justice br br originally meant to be be based on true life pirate anne bonny the film ultimately turns out to be a tale of a woman seeking identity and finding herself in the predominantly male led world of piracy and sea based shenanigans filled with clichÃ©s and over familiar set pieces the film also suffers from a cast that is largely misfiring peters gives it a right good go and paget lights up the screen with effervescent beauty while robertson justice although underused actually looks the part and doesn't overact like the rest of the male cast does some reviewers have desperately tried to dig deep into the film to find intelligence and hidden meanings purely because it's tourneur in the directing chair but there is no depth here this is merely a job for tourneur a professional one granted but its thinly plotted and actually lacking swash to go with the buckle in the action stakes br br disposable at best 4 10
<START> drama about a reporter who discovers some flaws in the safety precautions taken at a nuclear is directed well and a pretty interesting film from the late 70s its not amazing but its solid the acting is pretty good especially jack lemmon but douglas and fonda were good too it was a pretty good screenplay and direction was solid and suitable this is definitely not one of the best films of the 70s but its one of the better ones a good early michael douglas film and lemmon in his prime imdb rating 7 2 my rating so in simple words solid but not amazing thats what this film is solid but not amazing 8 10
<START> this happened to be just starting on tv when i opened it and as i felt too lazy to change the channel i ended up watching it man was that fortunate br br this film is more of a fairy tale than a demanding drama and at times openly sentimental one it is definitely what one could call a feel good movie and i usually find such either boring or irritating yet this film is so very well done i could not help but love it the script will not twist your brain it is conventional but flawless the actors are brilliant every single one is a perfect fit for the role there is not much of a score but the bits of music enhance the movie beautifully br br if you can appreciate other things than expensive pyrotechnics vicious murders or saving the world in a movie do watch this if you ever have the chance 5 5
<START> if you get a chance to get a hold of this lost for many years gem i doubt you will be disappointed ps has an odd blend of social satire and ultra cool blaxploitation even hints of slapstick but it's so odd that it was not only ahead of it's time nothing has been seen like it since br br i strongly disagree with people who say that the film is dated especially with spike lee's sp a few years back which was a misfire of trying to capture the same message good filmmaking disjointed script br br robert direction is brilliant allowing many of his actors to improvise the film gets better as it goes along and the jokes swagger from hit or miss one liners that are as forgiven as those found in a mel brooks comedy to sheer non pc 'i can't believe they just said that' fun br br favorite parts the commercials the film switches from gritty black and white depictions of the ad agency to beautiful perhaps 16mm color and gets away with it br br i refuse to hint at any spoilers but if you get the chance to see the dvd version be sure and watch the downey interview but leave it until after the movie br br my vote 10 10 most underrated film of the late 60's early 70's thank you prince
<START> okay now i know where all those boring cop homicide tv shows came from i do believe they can be traced back to this movie scene of the crime feels more like a tv episode or an episode of a serial complete with stock characters and situations the hotshot cop who clashes with his superiors the aging cop who doesn't want a desk job despite failing eyesight the reckless rookie the double crossing dame etc br br i like many of the actors here and they do a good job but overall i found this movie dull as i'm not a fan of the genre i kept tuning out when they were discussing the case something about bookies and informers and oh yeah there was a stripper played by the previously wholesome gloria dehaven what i want to know is why did she keep calling van johnson uncle wiggly wasn't uncle wiggly a rabbit a character from a children's book what the heck does that have to do with anything i guess i just don't get tough guy film noir ish kinda jargon br br in fact much of the dialogue made me mutter nobody talks like that however i could relate to one scene where the cop's wife arlene dahl who worries every time he goes to work realizes that maybe she shouldn't have made her husband the center of her life yeah i know that feeling of loving someone so much being so dependent on them that there's a constant fear for their safety so there are moments of truth in this film underneath the stylized dialogue and atmosphere which is trying so self consciously to be gritty and real that it actually seems unreal to me br br a little background this movie was made when dore took over mgm from louis b mayer and began to put an end to the wholesome musicals that made mgm so great dore was determined to bring more realism to movies i kinda hate dore maybe we can blame him for all the pretentious bleak movies being made today wallowing in the ugly truths about life focusing on and in my opinion helping to perpetuate the worst of humanity rather than the best no longer uplifting us the way classic movies were designed to do providing a necessary distraction during the great depression and world war ii br br well damn it we still need that kind of distraction today there's still plenty of depression and plenty of war and what are people turning to nowadays when they want to escape trashy brain deadening reality tv thanks a lot dore
<START> i was browsing through the movies on demand and saw underdog for free and it was only 82 minutes long so i decided to watch it i wasn't expecting much but it exceeded my expectations of being awful everything about the movie was cringe worthy the dialogue was atrocious including many terrible puns the jokes were also terrible i found myself yelling and flipping off my television screen while i was suffering through this trash it hit its target audience very well but i don't see how anyone else could enjoy this film it made me very angry and nearly cry because of everything terrible this film had going for it br br the only enjoyable thing about this movie was being able to give it a 1 10 after viewing it i beg you to avoid it at all costs i understand the fact that its made for kids but there is nothing likable about it at all
<START> final fantasy advent children is and will remain a classic example of style over substance gone wrong instead of drawing upon the memorable characters and captivating mythology of the original game square enix has churned out a frivolous montage of incomprehensible battle scenes yes i said incomprehensible did you know that knows blindingly fast kung fu techniques that magically cause the camera angle to shift every second that cloud can effortlessly suspend himself in midair for a full minute while wildly swinging away with his 2 ton sword the english dub is mediocre while not bad it is far from well produced the quality is comparable to that of an average anime dub br br here is what i'd like to say to the die hard fans who can't stop gushing over this movie advent children is the best fan service you could have hoped for from square enix but even a trashy cg flick like had a better story you'll be embarrassed by this movie and its lack of thought in due time the days of its novelty are numbered br br movies like advent children make me question whether square enix recognizes the potential of its franchises after all and no offense it's a japanese company japanese developers can deliver fun games but most of their offerings are disappointingly shallow they are utter psychos however when it comes to production quality advent children features some of the most breathtaking renders in cg history but that doesn't save it from its convoluted plot and cardboard characters br br any fan who followed this film knows comes back bending the story to accommodate his resurrection was a big mistake br br note the one point i give this film is in honor of the 10 000 enslaved japanese animators who gave their lives to render each bleached blond hair on cloud's effeminate caucasian head
<START> there is no plot there are no central characters there are no moving cameras or close ups in fact this film does not follow any of the conventional storytelling techniques used by mainstream film however roy du is a remarkable piece of cinematic storytelling it is a touching look at the human psyche br br comprised of a series of vignettes roy gives us an intimate insight into what makes us all human in perfectly framed static shots added with the perfectly in tune yet quirky music roy introduces us to a host of characters as they undertake their daily existence some bordering on tragic others hilarious we are taken on a nordic journey like no other br br it is a journey into the little things that make us human instead of over the top storytelling or visual techniques everything is stripped down to the bare minimum so that our sole focus is on the characters themselves it focuses on the insignificant points of our lives that make us who we are our dreams our desperation it's through this simple observation of others that we can accept who we are as individuals br br the washed out colours and deathly pale makeup of the characters only seems to emphasize their individual stories and remind us that unlike them we are all alive there is no happy ending or light at the end of the tunnel in this film yet you walk out of the cinema with a sense of life much more accessible than his earlier film songs from the second floor du is a truly inspiring piece of cinema
<START> labyrinth of passion with the possible exception of matador is almodovar's best film it displays his unique personality at its best and least censored before he started going more mainstream almodovar is just about the only modern director that can approach preston sturges' wonderful brand of lunacy it's pointless to try and explain what the movie is about the real point being almodovar's willingness and skill in taking his situations to the outer limits of sanity and sometimes of plausibility and taste as well
<START> black scorpion is roger batman which is cool and there is a lot of cool stuff in this movie like the being a cross between doctor doom and darth vader that's kind of cool the mind control gas in the was worthy of the mad hatter the b movie style is all over this puppy which is not always a good thing there are plenty of stunts and hot babes to make any action fan happy this movie the good out weighs the bad but if you aren't one for comic book movies then i would advise not watching black scorpion however if you like comic book like movies and don't care if it was ever a comic before then check out black scorpion as for me i give it 8 stars
<START> this is the sort of unknown and forgotten film one dreams about discovering in watching old videos it is a superb comic gem with brilliantly funny writing embedded in the marvellous array of characters a wonderfully inventive and funny musical score and witty light direction from montgomery himself this is one to watch over and over montgomery is a bit part actor who finds himself assigned by his military reserve division to infiltrate a young home to discover the identity of her former beau a suspected jewel thief while the premise is rather preposterous the results are hilarious montgomery is the befuddled plant ann blyth is a marvel as the romantically obsessed terribly earnest debutante and the parade of comic characterizations from veteran stage actress jane lawyer mother to lillian randolph's take charge maid are all fabulous br br oddly enough this only earned an oscar nom for sound when it deserved top nods for direction screenplay and musical score br br do not miss it it's one of hollywood's best
<START> romeo and juliet had been interpreted in so many ways but very few of the versions captured the of the play the ones i can think of that really nail the romance's spirit were west side story and beleive it or not troma film's tromeo and juliet at first glance this is another mere splatterfest and many would think it the shakespearian classic however the film has an honest feel about it updated to appeal to the sick minded youth of today of course but not without merit yes the frequent dismemberments body piercings car crashes lesbian sex scenes masturbation and incest are in bad taste but what's the harm when you have such a sweet love story as the foundation as bad as most of the acting in this film is i mean it is troma after all the two leads have some genuine chemistry more so than in big budget monstrosities titanic and star wars episode two there's a great deal of modernization but much of the original text is in tact especially when tromeo and juliet are together there's a great scene where juliet utters the famous parting is such sweet sorrow and tromeo quickly follows in mid nineties grunge fashion yeah it totally sucks i think it's truly unfortunate that this film isn't going to get the recognition or the wide release that it deserves i hop that people who see this on the video store shelves won't be turned off by the in the movie because they'd be missing out on quite a subversive
<START> there are good bad movies and bad bad movies and enjoyably bad movies this isn't one of them this is a movie that doesn't realize just how bad it is br br i saw this at a screening on november 14 2006 at the new beverly theater in los angeles as part of the grindhouse cinema this theater puts on every month hopefully presenters eric co will think twice before letting writer director anywhere near them again what a con man the guy got up to speak before the film you would think he was orson welles talking about touch of evil or some other lost classic hardly nice of him to take up 20 minutes of the audiences' time with his incoherent rambling br br young warriors has been described as a cross between animal house and death wish but if you are expecting something along the lines of imitations like revenge of the nerds or the exterminator you will be in for one sad disappointment the script makes zero sense the direction is so poor the actors looked embarrassed and what can you say when the best thing about the movie is watching a car blow up br br poor richard shaft roundtree in this movie he plays another character with the first name of john but that's about the only similarity his character here has to the aforementioned classic i hope this film allowed him to pay the rent for another month other actors who look like they wished they could be anywhere else included ernest borgnine and linda day george br br this is a complete waste of time even the audience did not seem that into it except for the one spazz boy sitting in the back who yelled whoa every five minutes and his girlfriend who giggled with the fervor of a lobotomized talking barbie every time he opened his mouth br br for real films about vigilantes i would suggest the following br br death wish i ii iii exterminator i vigilante force ms 45 rolling thunder the no mercy man the latter two being a pair of films presented at this theater a couple of years ago probably the same budget as young warriors but both were a million times better
