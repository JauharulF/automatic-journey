<START> the reader is a perfect example of what a short film should be a poignant story told simply through well written dialog beautifully painted images a score that seamlessly weaves it's way through the narrative and characters portrayed with thoughtfulness and grace br br i saw this film at a festival where other interesting films and ideas were screened but none of the other shorts had all the elements of great film making coming together in one film as the reader did the reader commanded the attention of every festival goer in the room and for 10 minutes took us into the emotional lives of the characters br br duncan rogers has created a beautiful film and i hope to see more from this director be it more shorts or perhaps a feature length film
<START> i personally love this film amidst the halloween series i've found after watching it with many friends that you enjoy it completely or find it absolutely unbearable personally i've watched it dozens of times and it never gets old there is a great back story within the movie itself and a lot of different things are finally explained it's a rather short movie at just shy of 90 minutes but it's definitely a thrill ride br br the shape seems to be pretty brutal in this film but the acting is still there with the way he walks stalks and kills there are a lot of neat little screen shots with micheal appearing in the background which adds more of a spooky element to the movie
<START> this movie is awful i'm sorry i bought this to get star worms and actually expected this to be better after how disappointed i was in star worms oh just kidding turns out this is the worst movie i've ever seen the acting is garbage not that there really is any and the main character is a big stupid box who gets attacked by like stuff or something i can't really tell the special effects are so bad that you can't even see the warring dinosaurs which by the way do not war but just stand and kind of move their mouths or whatever those things are the movie is a headache it's very obvious the director is trying to establish a universe really this movie is just abominable even by troma's standards the only good thing i can say about it is that it's got a lloyd kaufman intro as he tricks us yet again into watching something that isn't fit for consumption
<START> and bess is an outstanding production of george gershwin's masterpiece it is tastefully done in muted colors the voices are outstanding although sidney voice is dubbed for his singing portion he gives a very touching performance there is a remarkable performance by sammy davis jr as life there is yet no dvd available for viewing and this piece begs for one all intelligent movie goers who enjoyed it in 1959 will appreciate the release of this masterpiece on the new medium the screen is filled with a dynamic presentation that rivals all other musicals including the outstanding ones by rodgers and hammerstein be sure to ask for it an your video supplier like songs of the south by walt disney it may be the assumption of racial overtones that is preventing the marketing of this cinema
<START> attend the tale of sweeney todd the strangest most off putting but most wonderful broadway musical it is chilling funny and moving all at once through sondheim's most memorable and incredible score and sharp performances george is incomparable in the title role bringing a strong voice and dead on no pun intended impersonation of the legendary demon barber while angela lansbury provides the comic relief as she cheerfully grinds up his victims into meat pies if you just allow yourself to enjoy it sweeney todd is a real treat
<START> i decided to watch this ultra low budget film from the poverty row studio prc because it co starred the exciting character actor lionel i really liked the title even though atwill often played in these cheap movies his excellent style of acting always made the films seem a lot better as his screen persona was great his real life is also quite of like a bizarre soap opera the reason i use the term poverty row is that this was a nickname given to the very cheapest and worst production companies of the era many of these weren't even real studios but production companies that rented space and sets from the major studios at night yes there is a good chance this was filmed after normal working common thing for such studios br br the story begins with lionel atwill telling his friends a story about something that he was involved with years ago a doctor falls in love with a lady but he's afraid to tell her about himself that's because his job is putting people to death on death exactly a glamor job the doc asks his friend atwill for advice on how to break it to her but regardless she won't have the man later you realize it's because her own parents were criminals br br later a man is killed and the lady is it's obvious to anyone with a brain that her sister was involved and is a bit of a nut and the evidence against the lady was poor but apparently the jury was filled with brainless people and she was convicted and sent to death row even more brainless is that her old boyfriend was the man who was responsible for her execution don't you think someone else might just be able to handle this case until this fateful hour her friend atwill spends much of the film trying to prove her prove that the flaky sister knows far more about the case than she'll admit br br overall the movie is only mildly interesting and a bit silly while it is watchable and atwill is good as usual the rest of the film never really rises above the mundane and some of the acting is pretty shabby it's sub par and about what you'd expect from such a low budget nothing more despite the cool title
<START> in london the venetian carla borin is searching an apartment to share with her beloved boyfriend matteo she meets the lesbian real estate agent moira francesca and rents a large apartment when the jealous matteo finds some pictures and letters from her former lover bernard mauro lorenz in venice he hangs up the phone and the upset and amoral carla has a brief affair with moira and intercourse with an acquaintance in a party when matteo comes to london he concludes that his lust for carla is more important than his jealousy and her behavior br br is another soft porn of the sick director brass with a shallow and ridiculous story where every situation is a motive to expose the intimate parts of the women in the cast the amateurish camera exposes the body of the beautiful in every possible angle and her character is abused touched and licked in every part of her nice body but without showing explicit penetration this flick is only recommended to fans of this director and as a voyeur experience seeing naked in erotic situations my vote is four br br title brazil a the pervert
<START> i'll dispense with the obvious review of factual inaccuracies they are too numerous to name a much shorter list would be what they got right 1 dude named noah 2 ark with animals on it br br if you want a much more accurate portrayal of noah's ark and the destruction of go rent the bible 1966 it depicts the story of creation through abraham attempting to sacrifice his son isaac it's a much better movie and it may be that the abomination called noah's ark 1999 drove you to seek just such a film http www imdb com title br br i really couldn't stomach watching the whole movie from reading other comments i can see that even the atheists found it grossly inaccurate as a christian it was intolerable to me possibly the worst movie ever made no real point to this movie either except maybe to showcase their sub par computer animation br br was it a complete waste maybe not god can use evil to work good br br romans 8 28 says 28 and we know that all things work together for good to them that love god to them who are the called according to his purpose br br genesis 50 says 20 but as for you ye thought evil against me but god meant it unto good to bring to pass as it is this day to save much people alive br br in the second example joseph's brothers meant to kill him but god turned their evil into a very great good he may have done the same thing with this movie br br people were so astonished by its lack of biblical foundation that they probably broke out the dusty old bible and read the story for themselves to find out about lot and they would have to go the whole way up to genesis 19 before god destroys and gomorrah by then they have read almost half of genesis so they might want to finish the next book is exodus which the movie the ten commandments was based on and much more accurately if they have seen that movie then exodus becomes an easy read so now they have read at least two whole books of the bible just because they watched a pathetic movie about noah's ark i'm sure this actually happened to someone out there br br god works in mysterious ways
<START> i finally received my dvd today viewed it and i'm pleased to announce this is the original theatrical version of the film as you may have read in previous reviews of rich and famous that the edited for tv version of the film that somehow made it onto vhs sometime in the late 90's but now wb has corrected the error and released it on dvd complete with the airplane restroom scene matt bare butt and the scene in the hotel room where liz jacqueline bisset calls merry candice bergen a c t it's all there and looks better than ever a crisp clear digital transfer widescreen and special features that include original theatrical trailer and a vintage 1981 featurette called on location with rich and famous with cast and director interviews if you love this film as i do you won't be disappointed with purchasing this dvd glad to finally have this on dvdÂ well worth the wait thank you warner bros
<START> thats what this movie really takes a big piece of cheeze this movie is about a sister and brother bonnie and clyde type of duo that creates their own party line in order to lure their victims in and trap them and kill them but for what reason just for the fun of getting away with it in comes richard hatch who comes across as a wishy washy ladies man a real bad version of a ladies man and he gets involved with finding who's behind all the killings across la he finally meets a teenager who helps him find the killer and rest is for your fun and amusement but there are parts in this film that really get me going like the scene with garret dressed in his mothers wedding gown acting like a sissy in front of his sister telling her that he needs her and can't live without her and watching as she slaps him across the face him i can't believe that was well i guess i could but it's worth watching but only to see one of worst films that he ever did
<START> while on vacation on northern australia gracie diana glenn her husband adam andy and her younger sister lee decide to take the blackwater barry tour in the swamp for fishing their guide jim ben uses a small motor boat and takes the tourist along the river to a remote spot when they stop they are attacked by a huge crocodile that their boat and immediately kills jim the three survivors climb a tree and when they realize that help would never come to rescue them they decide to try to find a way out of their sheltered location however in the muddy water their boat is flipped and the crocodile stalks the trio under the water br br black water is a tense realistic and dramatic low budget movie and in accordance with the warning in the beginning based on a true event the acting of the unknown diana glenn and andy is top notch giving credibility to this simple but scary story there are many similarities between this movie and prey but in different environments my vote is seven br br title brazil profundo deep fear
<START> as i said the idea itself was great and it had plenty potential i was truly sad of discovering that this was another typical american mass movie we are in this for the money if only the producers had had more time to actually make the movie this one was not finished when they let it out
<START> at last a great film that doesn't have to be edited for profanity or sex it's a fun film that the whole family can enjoy willis is great as always rusty was delightful just enough action to keep interest going
<START> i feel privileged to have accidentally seen this movie i actually ran across this movie by accident i was taping another movie on showtime one night overnight and this movie came on afterward so i sat and watched it and boy was i blown away the acting is absolutely superb kathy bates who has been my favorite actress since misery and fried green tomatoes gave an amazing performance as a domineering mother who tries desperately to hold on to her old school values religion family at the risk of alienating her family martin sheen is superb as the tough patriarch who is really not in control of anything in his life or family the one thing i really loved about this movie is how it tells what happens when the heroes come home it shows the true damage that is done to our soldiers after they fight pointless wars for political and financial gain this movie just blew me away and i feel blessed to have accidentally taped this movie and seen it this is a must see for anyone who wants a true drama this is not too melodramatic and preachy but pulls at your heartstrings like none other
<START> fame i think was the best movie that i have ever seen in ways it was funny and dramatic but that is what makes a movie true it has a few loose ends actually a lot but i still think that it is a terrific movie some of the funny things happen in the audition at the beginning of the movie i think it is hilarious when the girl tries to act out o j simpson in the towering inferno and raul ralph goes around to every art department saying that his father was great at every one he says that his dad danced with the rockets and left ralph his tap shoes the rockets as far as i know are made up of women and the tap shoes were just regular shoes with bottle caps on the bottom also the guy who read the lines of juliet in the romeo and juliet play was funny one thing about the movie that just turns me on is the music i have never heard anything like it my favorite song is i sing the body electric and my second is the theme song itself fame irene cara has a great voice and is a great actress i like the way the movie focused on many ethnic groups it showed all of the kinds of people there actually are in what is now called la school of the performing arts this movie showed the triumphs and trials of many young performers including angelo doris bruno coco montgomery ralph leroy hilary and liza they all had a hard time but made it their own way this movie could have added on about another 30 45 minutes before the graduation but it is still my favorite movie no matter what
