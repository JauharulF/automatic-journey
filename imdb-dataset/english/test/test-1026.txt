<START> i think it is great one of my favourite films as a kid and who said there songs were unforgettable they were mint i can still remember them now word for word the film remains a favourite with my family and my younger cousins are now addicted to it too they even know the songs this film is great and a enjoyable film for kids it has a moral lesson so don't say its not good because it shows how lying gets you nowhere ill leave with a parting comment this film is amazing love me xxx p s i would like the soundtrack but i cant and yes the animation is good the jokes are humorous and the action never stops this film will go down in children's film history and in my opinion one of the only remaining safe films to show children
<START> i've seen this movie more than once and it's worth it for those of you who like martial arts and overcoming internal conflict this is a worthy choice after seeing this movie i wanted to be a more productive member of society because i could relate to the inner turmoil of a girl looking for acceptance and needing a path to follow of course mr miyagi always provides his sage advice 2 thumbs up
<START> lance henriksen got paid something to appear in this i hope it was a lot br br former us national champion gymnast kristie phillips starts as charlie case a gymnast turn secret agent because it's very common that munchkin gymnasts become government spies br br there's a truly hysterical opening scene where charlie's uneven bars routine is sabotaged by an eastern bloc competitor what follows is one of the most ridiculous stunt scenes i've ever witnessed and they want you to take it seriously don't worry she sticks her dismount br br everything after that is just a messy dreck of a spy movie watch the first fifteen minutes for the campy gymnastics stuff then run for cover
<START> a high school track star falls dead after winning a race shortly after her older sister patch mackenzie returns home in time to notice that all of her sister's track team members are disappearing who could the killer be you may not care enough to want to find out br br crude cheap amateurish slasher is just about completely worthless although top billed christopher george as the nasty hard driving track coach tries to give it a lift with an intense performance not even the gore is worth mentioning the whole thing is lame from beginning to end starting with opening the movie to a track meet montage set to disco music and the casting of e j once a co star of the movie hello dolly as a character named blondie that's right blondie this may mean that we aren't supposed to take the movie seriously but in any case it's a shambles br br it's the kind of routine slasher junk that makes the friday the 13th movies look like works of art in comparison br br the only point of interest may be wanting to see an early film appearance by white of all people br br 2 10
<START> a not so good action thriller because it unsuccessfully trends the same water as early steven seagal films because there is not a very good set piece steven seagal plays the same kind of character that he has played since above the law in my opinion the performance of ivory wayans is wasted in such an average film and belongs in a much better film bob is okay as the main heavy the best acting in the entire film belongs to brian cox who is very frightening in the role of the murderer my favorite scenes are the fight scenes with the russian mafia one of the film reasons to see the glimmer man 1996 is for the brief appearence of the beautiful and nikki cox its too bad that there were not more scenes with her in them
<START> i just found out before writing this review that komodo vs cobra and another movie called curse of the komodo were both directed by the same guy jim wynorski that might explain why they are films of nearly identical premises they both feature a military governed island a colonel whose concerned more about covering his tracks than the lives of his employees people racing to get to a chopper that is conveniently lying in a field somewhere on the island and giant komodo dragons created through genetic experiments running amok what differences are there well the intruders on the island are now capitalists wanting to expose the government secret and there's a giant cobra on the island as well hence the title komodo vs cobra even though the conflict between the two monsters is hardly relevant to the 'story ' komodo vs cobra is more or less what you'd expect given its title and its channel origin the sci fi channel although every now and again you will find one that for one reason or another may appeal to you i liked a movie called komodo i hardly doubt this one will br br komodo vs cobra is not only a boring film but it's also one of the least enthusiastic sci fi flicks i've seen in a long time in some of these movies there is an air to them that indicates the filmmakers were giving at least a certain level of effort but i see very little here that's indicated again by it just being a rehash of curse of the komodo the cgi for the monsters look as if they came straight out of a second rate video game the cinematography and misc en scene is poor the acting ranges from passable to poor the action scenes are dull and then there are some parts that are frankly put unforgivably bad i see a lot movies where a person will shoot a gun many times without reloading and i can deal with this but in this movie where michael parÃ© takes a single thirty eight handgun and fires it approximately fifty times nonstop without reloading at first i laughed but even then it just became tiring that would be the 'action ' a monster appears people scream parÃ© fires nonstop without reloading his gun once throughout the entire picture and somebody gets eaten br br komodo vs cobra is a very bad movie the only thing in the movie that is worth mentioning in a charitable manner is an actress named michelle who is not only very beautiful but a surprisingly strong performer even with the trashy dialogue and lack of enthusiasm in the screenplay she was given michelle managed to pull off a surprisingly good performance and it just me that an actress as good as her can get stuck in a film as junky as this she obviously took it for the paycheck but it won't boost her career any i'm afraid

<START> how in the world does a thing like this get into my dvd player at home how does it even get to be packaged and distributed are there absolutely zero screenings a movie and i use that term loosely have to go through before it's put on a video store's shelf anymore i'm all for diy film making but come on that doesn't entitle me to get a group of my friends and relatives together a crappy camcorder an awful story and put it all together to create a heaping pile of crap and call it a movie and i wish people would quit using the words indie and campy to describe these types of movies they're not either in no other profession would something like this be considered acceptable if someone tried to sell you car that was as bad as this movie you'd take it back and say it was a lemon if it was a surgical procedure you'd be suing the doctor for malpractice i wish i could get my time and money back after watching this shame on the video stores who stock movies like these they're a rip off to the public you want campy go get any of the friday the 13th movies even the later ones or dead alive at least those don't make you want to kill yourself it's because of movies like this that make people automatically equate independent with garbage
<START> dr steven segal saves the world from a deadly virus outbreak this movie strikes me as foolish earnestness that has morphed into an unintended camp classic the best kind memorable lines include knowledge is like a deer chase it and it will run away from you and drink this it will make you feel better it is so sublimely bad they couldn't have made it any worse if they tried br br segal tries to convince you that he is 1 sensitive by saving a stricken pony 2 a good father by a saccharine cooking scene for his daughter 3 a man of science by looking at a fake spectrum 4 in tune with nature by using remedies 5 politically correct and multicultural by having indian friends 6 an iconoclast by opening a rural practice after a former life in a national research lab and 7 an action hero by being really fat but yet can still fight br br it's good to see on as a late night saturday flick with friends preferably but not necessarily inebriated
<START> wow that james purefoy looks exactly like thomas jane br br that's the most profound thought i took with me after having seen the rather underwhelming george and the dragon for a fantasy comedy the story was very dull and the effects unspectacular br br the problem wasn't the acting james purefoy makes a good knight and his various side kicks are not bad characters i even thought patrick swayze in this role was a pretty good idea too flat chested piper perabo also had some nice potential i even liked the kid br br but the story and everything that happens and the way it happens was just eh not interesting compared to another recent fantasy comedy ella enchanted which was actually funny this movie comes up terribly short i'm sorry for the decent actors who were in this yawn inducing br br 4 out of 10
<START> how could anyone who liked the previous jp movies even stand to sit through this 1 hour of drivel there are so many stupid things about this film it's mind boggling i remember when i went to see jp as a kid it was my favorite movie and franchise the acting the sfx the music the direction all fantastic in my opinion was ok pretty much the same apart from some really stupid moments like the gymnast girl kicking a raptor please but on a whole a watchable and reasonable cinematic experience br br but the the third one has no point it's supposed to be a sequel that carry's on from and yet it magically includes brand new things to the franchise that would have been impossible to miss on the previous 2 films for example 1 the new mega seriously what the hell this thing follows them everywhere they go they cannot escape it's presence and yet in the lost world the same island do you see it once do you hear it does anyone even mention it no its ridiculous the star character in the previous 2 movies was and always will be the t rex so what does the d joe johnston go and do kill it off as soon as you see the huge t rex in all its awesome roaring glory it gets killed and you never see it again a new dino on the town is the excuse where did it come from not a single explanation and don't get me started on the whole satellite phone in the dino belly thing 2 just when you start to get over how stupid the is you see the raptors aside from their new punk haircuts they seem pretty credible phew they will make this movie watchable right wrong now they speak to each other and the excuse for them speaking in this film and not in the first and second are wait for it evolution yes the process of millions of years in just a few months from when the second movie ended amazing surly they should have grown thumbs and created tools by now ok i am not going to say anymore about the plot because it's getting up my nose so i will close on this jurassic park is a classic is a lousy sucker punch to any of the original fans of the series my favorite franchise was well and truly dead after watching this monstrosity no pun intended avoid this movie like the plague
<START> is extremely boring this is the basis of the show mel or ask extremely easy questions that a 2 year old could answer at an extremely slow pace this show lasts for 2 hours and they probably only play about 10 games in that period people may like this show because the hosts are eye candy but they're hotness completely is destroyed by the fact that they are so friggin annoying br br during the show they mention that we need more players a million times the top 5 surveys that they do probably takes about 20 minutes out of the show this show is probably one of the worst game shows ever made one of the reasons they probably don't have callers is because the show is so cheap with the money the most money i've ever seen them hand out was 210 i wouldn't be surprised if this game show is canceled by the end of 2006
<START> it's really a shame there was so much controversy surrounding this picture in other words the infamous affair between ingrid bergman and roberto rossellini as this drew a lot of attention to a very forgettable film the story is incredibly slow cheap looking and uninteresting and to top this off the film is stuffed to the brim with amateurish actors who can barely speak any english i really would have preferred subtitles it would have made the experience less exhausting back to the rotten acting the neo realist movement was big in italy at the time this film was made many of these films are absolute masterpieces such as de sica's umberto d the children are watching us and miracle in milan because they got so much out of the non professional actors they behaved like normal people but in stromboli they act like normal people trying to be actors and come off very badly like kids in a school play br br by the way if you are hoping the movie has a good ending thereby making your time commitment to the film worth while don't bother the plot was just totally uninvolving and silly so much so that i really found that i could have cared less about the characters like the island they all inhabit the film is desolate and without color or life
<START> the green butchers anders thomas jensen denmark 2003 br br how do the danes keep coming up with these films that are consistently funny sharply written exquisitely filmed and filled with great performances the green butchers is a dark and wickedly funny comedy in many ways the danish counterpart of eating raoul and delicatessen but it has more on offer than just laughs or parody br br the film brings us the duo of chronic pothead nikolaj lie and chronic mads sick of their evil boss the two pals decide to open their own butcher shop in a small danish town but initially business is slow and customers stay away when an electrician is accidentally locked up and freezes in their meat locker decides to turn the man's thigh into he promptly nicknames this special dish suddenly has everyone in town flocking to their counter and unable to resist this sudden leap into popularity turns into a serial killer with acting as his reluctant accomplice but soon led by their ex boss many people in town are starting to wonder what special ingredients the two men are using br br without the extraordinary performances by and the film might not have risen above the level of the average black comedy on paper the character of might border on caricature but mads portrait is that of an earnest insecure and deeply twisted man but manages to make him frightening funny and moving at the same time actually plays a double role also playing his comatose twin brother when watching the film i never even realized it was the same actor the other performances are just as wonderful with every character in town refreshingly off the hook with some truly wonderful vignettes br br the subject material is naturally a bit morbid and the material might not be completely fresh considering quite a few predecessors that handled the same kind of material but director jensen gives it a fresh twist and manages to build some real characters with the strange duo of and with this wonderfully bizarre tale of two social misfits br br camera obscura 9 10
<START> this is the worst work ever of daniel day lewis i can not believe that in the same year he made this awful movie and my left foot please stay away from this movie this is a movie only for argentine people as a curiosity the plot is impossible to understand the writer thinks that in argentine all the people speaks in english of course the bring a very good frame for the photo shooting of the film but that is not enough reason to see this movie i repeat only if you are very fan of daniel day lewis or if you want to see the south of argentine part of the and you do not have enough money to travel yourself
