<START> there is somewhere in here the makings of a decent if routine sf story it is thwarted by several factors first the actor is just awful even the competent actors are awful the dialog is wooden and stilted the plot plods along predictably this seems less like a finished movie than actors going through a walk through extremely disappointing
<START> lead actor yuko tanaka fulfills so much in the exceptionally meditative the a tranquil on missed chances in the life of a 50 something woman charting her routine with sincerely poignant motives played out in the picturesque tranquil town of nagasaki akira unconventional romantic film so to speak is less a straight out melodrama than a deliberate introspection of its characters' surrender to their current lives as a result of a tragic past that forced them to a choice they did not call for br br perfectly embodying the requisite world weariness subjected to a spiritless routine tanaka plays a middle aged woman who before her work shift at a supermarket takes it upon herself to deliver bottles of milk among the residents of the hilly nagasaki one of the houses she constantly passes by to make such a delivery is that of a local government employee caring for her terminally ill wife and were high school sweethearts who courtesy of an ignominious event concerning their parents separated ways since then br br opening his film with the foreboding narration of a young vowing never to leave nagasaki does as such with the narrative patiently sticking with as he deftly aided by understated yet highly effective performance follows her whether she's having chitchat with her aunt watanabe on being single or when she jogs up and down the countless footsteps of their hilly town to distribute milk as she and gradually overcome the hindrances that kept them apart for years such unhurried development may not suit viewers weaned on fast paced narratives but for the rest it's a heartfelt introspection that affects powerfully and emphatically
<START> this movie is very scary with scenes where the devil uses horn to open heaven and pull the good angel dogs out and them on the devil sings and dances to a few songs about the joys of being bad and at one point eats a live rat br br we got this movie free with a pizza you get what you pay for
<START> when one considers that carson mccullers is one of the foremost literary figures of the 20th century it seems that it needs a very great lack of talent to be able to ruin one of her stories but this movie shows it can be done how do actors ingratiate their way to becoming directors wooden unsympathetic totally out of sync with the poetic compassion of writing my jaw dropped with horror and disbelief that such a mish mash of a movie could ever have found finance and backers the only redeeming features are some moderately good acting although that said vanessa redgrave seems to permanently render much the same performance whatever character she plays and some good cinematography in places but otherwise it is a bitter bitter disappointment and it could and indeed should have been a contemporary masterpiece simon callow should hang his head in shame and stick to acting
<START> has there ever been an angel of death like farmer in barbet 1960s heroin opus sort of jean seberg with a hypodermic pink floyd score despite some ultimately insignificant weaknesses a classic shamelessly ripped off by erich segal noel black for their inept jennifer on my mind 1971 although walker playing a similar character is herself very junkie appealing in the latter mess more though is terrific a great 60s drug movie and simply an important document of its time very much a cult film so join the cult br br no american movie then as far as i can remember charts the same territory an astonishing archetype elevating this into mythic realms not for the faint hearted great sex scenes too
<START> there won't be one moment in this film where you aren't laughing this is mel brooks at one of his high points and cary elwes carries off the part of robin with convincing humour every time you watch this film you will discover a new joke but the ones you have noticed before will never grow old highly
<START> now here is a movie that does something that hasn't been done in a long time it take ten or so different elements that we're already familiar with vampires martial arts a techno beat top o the line special effects etc and turns it into something that feels brand new in what could have easily been merely a combination of mortal kombat and buffy the vampire slayer wesley snipes no favorite of mine since and mostly because of passenger 57 gives a really good turn as the half human half bloodsucker he acknowledges the internal conflict but doesn't dwell on it more than necessary he makes blade as deep a character as michael keaton made batman br br i'll say that the only part of the movie that got me a little miffed was the always present horror movie cliche of that one person that the hero happens to know who happens to know exactly how to stop the evil guy on the other hand you sort of have to have that in a movie like this so it's easily excusable br br well snipes is good and steven dorff hyped in the previews makes a more than bad enough bad guy to snipes' hero he's got class presence and enough control in his little pinky to teach al pacino how to tone it down a bit who would ever think that a comic book movie would be a launching pad for an actor i sincerely hope this is and whoa where the heck did kris kristofferson get acting talent don't get me wrong but the prolific actor hasn't done anything memorable since millennium and how many of us watched that just 'cause of the cool video box well here he is folks in a very obi turn as blade's mentor and father figure and good job too br br the quality of the acting is matched by the quality of the choreography and special effects accompanied by a pulsing techno beat the fight scenes brings back and quickly banish memories of mortal kombat hey it had a script too i was wondering what had happened to all the good writers out there br br the two major indications to me that i saw a quality flick were these i had no feeling of remorse about paying full price to get in a la any schumacher batman the avengers mk annihilation godzilla or armageddon wow how many of those came out this year ugh also i look forward to the inevitable sequel as per the film's ending let's just hope they do as good a job with it as with the first one br br
<START> the is a weird little canadian b movie at first glance it would appear to be just another cheap extremely cheap terminator knockoff but strangely enough it also shares some qualities with the original robocop which hadn't even been released yet when appeared 1986 coincidence who knows anyway the story is thus scientist carl seems to be a pretty nice guy who works for a super duper secret government high tech research lab reporting to a sleazy boss named whom he butts heads with about project funding early in the movie carl's got a loving wife at home and a baby on the way which makes it all the more tragic when he is suddenly killed in a lab accident but wait carl's not really dead after all has extracted carl's brain and inserted it into his pet project some sort of experimental bio mechanical space suit when carl wakes up inside his new body he understandably goes a little nuts trashes the lab and escapes this is a problem because for reasons known only to himself has programmed the mechanical suit with a rage reaction program which will cause carl to kill anybody who touches him for any reason in hindsight that little addition to carl's psyche was probably not the best idea br br so robo carl wanders aimlessly through the movie for a while killing a couple of random muggers and other assorted background characters till he returns to his home and contacts his wife this scene is supposed to be heartbreakingly touching i guess but turns out comical because carl's robot voice is so heavily synthesized that you can barely understand a word he says he of course tells her to leave the city and never come back because she's in danger but she wants to stay and help him yadda yadda yadda eventually hires a gang of commando thugs led by hunter an apparent ninja assassin played by pam grier to hunt down and destroy his runaway creation using carl's wife as bait and predictable but laughably cheap looking mayhem ensues br br i'm a b movie kind of guy but the was so half assed that it turned into high comedy pretty quickly i'm assuming that a good hunk of the budget went into stan winston's robo carl suit design because that actually looks pretty cool but the rest of the movie suffers from a cheap made for tv kind of look the script could've used a lot more work but then maybe the filmmakers had gotten wind of robocop going into production and rushed to get out so they couldn't be accused of ripping them off either way judging by the other comments here on imdb i'm not the only one who's noticed the parallels between and robocop and obviously robo is the superior film so there's no need to waste your time sitting through this piece of nonsense unless you want to see a film that can best be described at best as a rough draft of robocop if it were made by an 8th grader
<START> gotta add a comment to this one br br first ironically one needs to add the alert to conform to imdb's parameters but there is absolutely nothing here to be spoiled br br there are six characters the good looking gal whose the a list mountain guide in the area of the climb and apparently among all guides including mt everest on the planet her lost love who disappeared from the titled pass two years prior whom the party is purportedly seeking but never find her store owner friend also a guide who may be better than a but no match for her the weird lead actor who engages her services and says they'll find her long missing love in the bargain his one associate a computer hacker with purportedly limitless expertise of a level sufficient that gates might seek advice from him and his other colleague a bodyguard who apparently has an iq not even near three digits br br there are of course nefarious goings on and the secret quest of the lead actor is to gain recovery of a satellite which has fallen in the pass and has world altering and unique data to bring them untold riches exactly what is never revealed br br overacting abounds the script looks like something which might get a c in a freshman writing class but an f if submitted at a higher level and the thespians gnaw every piece of scenery like a horde of beavers br br the most interesting aspects of this movie for me was juxtaposing portions with three other flicks or roles i've seen br br first the mysterious undisclosed secret data makes one recall the spanish prisoner an a list mamet film surrounding a valuable corporate process never specifically clarified but better for it definitely not so here br br second the lead biscuit proved perhaps even more resourceful then rambo in dealing quickly when menaced later in the presentation br br third i remember a steven seagal flick don't recall the title where he was semi conscious and for about 1 3 of the time and fully comatose for another 1 3 although i've not sought viewing a lot of his work i've seen enough to have noted that while comatose he provided the best work he ever has and most in line with his laconic persona in this opus while awake the young hacker may have been the most engaging personality on screen but while indisposed and incapacitated during the latter portion and unable to emote he provided the best acting during this seemingly unending two hours br br take the thin silly basis for a plot here imagine it being compressed into say a on snl with gilda bill murray dan aykroyd and martin short in the four roles they could get record laughs with few changes to the dialog here br br the most interesting aspect in the last analysis is contemplating what information could have been in the spy satellite to be worth even billions to any of many nations and yet rendered worthless according to the guru hacker if simply placed upon the internet with no apparent consequences thereafter even a turkey like this one should have at least a small trace of logic somewhere this one is totally devoid
<START> according to me a movie can be best rated by the number of 'best scenes' there are there are probably at least 80 90 scenes in the whole movie that is probably rated as 'best' by somebody or the other br br this movie is a masterpiece period i know many who have called it ahead of its time probably because it bombed at box office however i think any generation can relate to this movie and have a good laugh through out br br i am personally glad that is part of the movie too his role isn't that however its good to see that he is a part of the cast in the funniest hindi movie ever
<START> nicodemus is almost a copy of red in the odd behavior sense but this episode focuses on other people in clark unpredictable life when a poisonous flower finds it's way into smallville jonathan kent is the first to be effected by it the flower causes people to reverse their behavior and when it effects jonathan he becomes short tempered and violent however clark manages to stop him from doing anything rash until his father finally passes out okay so far so good next up is lana the episode was good up to that point for the flower causes her to attempt seducing clark at the last moment he refuses her but the damage has already been done this episode causes the wrong impressions and isn't suitable for people under the age of twenty due to it's adult content the first part was good the last part focusing on the effect the flower has on pete was good but the middle that was all about alternate personality was most defiantly not and that ruined what could have been a brilliant episode i give this episode two
<START> this is a very bad movie however i read that it was made by a high school teacher so maybe i should give it at least a tiny bit of praise for it's ambitious yet awful special effects here is the plot a monster emerges from a pile of trash and pollution in the town of california and embarks on a destructive rampage i'm about to spoil the big surprise about what the monster looks like so please read the rest of this at your own risk you have been warned the monster looks sort of like a giant two legged fly wearing a gas mask in some scenes the monster is an actor wearing a costume in other scenes the monster is created by stop motion animation the acting is terrible the dialogue is terrible the special effects are terrible the plot is predictable stay away
<START> ok i could only find three reasons to consider this film worthwhile considering the extremely low budget br br first there was linnea quigley and rachel carter actually the two of them gave me four good reasons to watch and watch i did br br the only other reason to watch is that a lot of was filmed right down the road now i didn't know this beforehand but i saw an orange county car tag and said wow this was shot in florida br br i was impressed by the flashback to the past and the ancestors of the young kid but that was really it the killings by the pumpkin man were pretty lame with the exception of the biker br br if you want to see quigley and carter ok but return of the living dead will give greater thrills
<START> i just had the opportunity to see hitherto known in the u s as 'the golden door' and was very impressed by both it's dreamy occasionally surreal tale of a family that from to the u s in the early days of the 20th century it also worked as a proverbial middle finger jammed into the eyeball of homeland security preferably all the way up to the 3rd knuckle in it's depiction of the ill treatment of foreigners who just want a better life than they were getting from their original mother land the mostly italian cast with a few exceptions works well this is a quiet understated film that is lovely to look at the occasional but tasteful use of surrealism is always a pleasure while the screenplay is well written this is a film for those who are sick tired of mindless escapism from hollywood that serves little more than to sell popcorn not that i have any burning issues with popcorn mind you i actually love the stuff you would do wise to seek out the golden door or whatever it's being titled in your area
<START> following on directly from the last episode of the previous series yes minister br br jim hacker now finds himself inside number 10 downing street as prime minister of great britain instead of a cabinet minister and a member of the government he is now leading her majesty's government br br all this after some scheming maneuvers by sir humphrey appleby after the previous prime minister resigned at the end of yes minister br br sir humphrey appleby is now the head of the civil service br br i thought that this series was better than the first series or though it did not last as long as the first series unfortunately
