<START> begotten is one of the most unique films i've ever seen it is more to me a study of sound light and dark and movement than a real story the type of thing you see as a video at the museum of modern art than a film enjoyed at the local theater i'm not going to try to interpret the images of the mother nature the beasts in cloaks the twisted and tortured body of her child some things just defy interpretation
<START> seems like a pretty innocent choice at first the name employee of the month might ring bells with office space and the show office clerk i think not this isn't even a dark comedy the director of this movie whoever the guy's name was a complete jerk and has a sick perverse mind there is no pleasure in being lured into feeling sorry for a complete loser who cheats on his wife steals from his top notch job and lies through his teeth 24 7 the second i walk in to the room when my family are watching it and believe me they were only watching it more because they were praying that there would be at least some relief perhaps even some fable in the end sending a warm message of good justice done and when the good guys look good all the good guys were killed so long ago that they had no time to look good no memorial was made br br this movie has borderline insanity it the elderly the dead and women and the director tries to make people to like it br br i gave this movie a two only because the soundtrack was good but not even that was all that memorable if you were lucky enough to not see this in theaters my friends do not do this at home
<START> this movie was very good i really enjoyed it tom performance was excellent and very believable as the consumptive son edmund i also enjoyed the set design house and the costumes
<START> bridget fonda has disappointed me several times over the years but she had my attention in break up it's true the story is missing critical details in several places but i just kept fonda for clues about what was meaningful in the story and she didn't let me down the look in her eyes in the last scene as she musters up courage to literally put one foot in front of the other toward her uncertain future is one of the most dramatic and significant examples of face acting ever i believed her completely possibly because i've known and admired several tough broads who survived similar abusive situations and they did this without becoming man haters but that's my own hopeful projection of fonda's character at the break up
<START> he seems to be a control freak i have heard him comment on losing control of the show and tell another guest who brought live animals that he had one rule no snakes he needs to hire a comedy writer because his jokes are lame the only reason i watch him is because he some some great guests and bands br br i watched the craig ferguson show for a while but his show is even worse he likes to bull sh to burn time i don't think either man has much of a future in late night talk shows br br daily also has the annoying habit of sticking his tongue out to lick his lips he must do this at least 10 times a show i do like the joe band carson daily needs to lighten up before it is too late
<START> i remember seeing the trailer for this movie when it was first released and it looked pretty cool i never got the chance to see it though when i went to blockbuster to rent some videos i figured i should watch it after all i did love silence of the lambs and se7en and if you enjoyed those movies you might get a kick out of the cell the whole story concept is very interesting going physically into the mind of a killer i can't imagine the world they live in the acting is actually pretty decent jennifer lopez is the only one i have to say that wasn't that great but she does a believable job i would recommend for a scary thriller br br 7 10
<START> this is the best thing burt reynolds ever did nice combination of suspense and humor with an excellent supporting cast this is a very well written and credible urban drama with a great sound track as well makes you wonder why reynolds doesn't direct more movies
<START> an old man is riding his bike down a village road when a car comes out of nowhere strikes him down dead and keeps driving the rest of the film is spent discovering who hit him why he was hit and what consequences this murder will have on the rest of the village separate lies is a very british movie indeed i'm not saying that hit and run car accidents are a particularly british phenomenon but the way everyone reacts to this tragedy is very british tom wilkinson plays james manning a hard working respectable citizen with a stiff upper lip attitude towards tragedy his wife anne emily watson who is twenty years younger than her husband is more emotional more impulsive and more prone to drama br br the man who really spices up life in this sleepy village is playboy millionaire william played by a deliciously devilish rupert everett most american audiences will eternally remember him as julia roberts' gay friend who completely stole every scene in my best friend's wedding in separate lies everett is cruel cold and selfish but he's an absolute blast on screen no it's not that exciting of a movie title separate lies Â how did they end up with that lame and forgettable title did they just not have a marketing team did they just now care about getting people to see this film but beyond the title is a heartbreaking drama about the power of forgiveness
<START> this comment may contain spoilers warning this does contain spoilers i have seen some pretty lame films in my day and that only stands to reason seeing as i see about 80 films a year i would have to say that out of those 80 films i see at the theater maybe 5 are really really good 15 or 20 are not that great 40 or 50 are okay and then maybe 5 or 10 are absolutely terrible here on earth falls into a category unto itself this is one of the most predictable vehement despicable films i have ever seen it is loaded with unlikable characters maudlin situations about after school special kinds of topics and enough fluff in here to make the young and the restless look like american beauty and i am not being unfair this is an awful film br br this is the story of a rich guy a poor girl a poor guy and a small town that makes fresh cookies every day for all of it's town folk are you getting warm and fuzzy yet let me continue one day the rich snot comes waltzing into town with his new graduation present that his dad has bought for him and he insults the pretty girl at the diner almost gets in a fight with her long time boyfriend and then races him and destroys the little diner that she works at so he is sentenced to a summer in the small town where he and the boyfriend have to fix the diner together what this does is gives us plenty of opportunity to see chris klein with no shirt on so we can understand why the girl at the diner would fall for him he has abs oh and he is rich and he is the biggest jerk with no respect for anyone he is james dean he is a rebel that doesn't give a damn he is rude to everyone in town he doesn't want to associate with anyone that is trying to be nice to him and he acts like a spoiled rich brat but leelee sobieski still falls for him there is no reason given as to why she does she just does oh pardon me that's right i forgot to mention that he likes the same poet that she does well if that doesn't get you wet then i don't know what will br br here on earth also has some of the most predictable moments i've ever been privy to in film there was one point when i left the theater to get some popcorn and read the graffiti on the wall of the bathroom and i told my fiancÃ©e exactly what was going to happen in the next ten minutes upon my return she just laughed and said i was right even when i said that there was going to be a dancing scene and furthermore the disease that she suddenly contracts is cancer this is the most beautiful cancer patient i have ever seen have you ever watched a cancer patient die slowly they lose weight they lose their hair their gums begin to rot it is not a pretty picture sobieski glows after she contracts cancer like she is pregnant what an insult to people that have watched love ones die slowly from this disease and how do you contract knee cancer from falling down in the field br br now i realize i have seen way too many movies and this causes my cynicism to run rampant at times but this is ridiculous there wasn't one thing to like about this film or the chris klein character he is a jerk he is obnoxious and he never once tries to make peace with anyone around him here on earth is not only a bad film it is an irresponsible one this received a 4 2 on the imdb voting chart and that is way too high this is an embarrassment to screen writing and whoever gave the green light to this being made should not only lose their job but he or she should have to promise never to step foot near a script again br br 0 out of 10 and that is being generous this film should be shown at film schools as how not to write and direct a film br br if you are bored and really need something to do and your choices are cleaning a farm full of cow manure or watching this film choose cleaning the cow manure it'll smell better and you'll feel like you've done something good with your two hours
<START> blew my mind the first time i saw it and it's held up quite well over the years the sets and monster effects work are some of the best i've ever seen nobody i know seems to have seen this film which i believe tanked at the box office because of the lack of interest in horror in the early nineties it plays like a dark horrific fairy tale and is a lot deeper then you'd think with a strong message against bigotry presented by a rich mystical past that clive barker created what sucks is the film ends on a really cool sequel note that we'll probably never see my only minor gripe is that craig sheffer is only a passable actor at best and the the project might have benefited with a better actor in the part just a minor complaint though as sheffer does alright i had a similar issue with scott bakula in barker's lord of illusions not really a terrible performance but i just didn't like him in the role as much as i would have other people
<START> robert langdon hanks is called to rome to help decipher the mystery behind the before a new science experiment blows up the city br br the da vinci code broke records in 2006 but for the vast majority of dan brown followers it did not do his award winning book justice and though running at a good 2 and a half hours seemed to bore many br br having read the book i was perhaps one of the few who enjoyed tom hanks and audrey tautou attempt to solve the mystery of the murder in the louvre but for angels and demons the scales were raised once more as lead star and director return br br having asked around most people seem to prefer angels and demons to the da vinci code for an entertaining read and it seems as critiques and fans whilst still not fully justified prefer this latest adaptation to the 2006 release br br this howard picture certainly has a more clinical energy and exercise to it as unlike da vinci tom hanks' robert langdon has only one night to solve the mysterious activities of the forgotten in the vatican and because of the time limitations the action and desperation up the ante and deliver an excitement that certainly beats the da vinci code but also generates plenty of twists and stunning murder sequences br br the interesting factor of this 2009 release is the constant elements being justified for the murders earth wind water and fire are all included in drastic and powerful sequences to pronounce a feeling of overall power to the situation br br this really does justify the tag of thriller with a constant tension and sharp drama with the issues and beliefs once more given a full working over br br just like 3 years ago there are many debates and discoveries of symbols once believed to be lost forever and langdon is again the key character to show everyone the light in and amongst the controversy of other pressing circumstances br br it is fair to say dan brown is a complex writer he certainly likes to cram issues and dramas in amongst his action and thrilling sequences as well as trying to discover the there is also the scenario of the election of a new pope the dealings with a new scientific experiment and the power of religion is again present all interesting to discover and listen to if occasionally the debates and dialogue tend to send your mind drifting but as there is so much in the novel this was always likely br br ron howard who kept a frankly ordinary type of direction rolling in da vinci returns in perhaps the worst way possible his jerky ever moving camera styling does nothing to keep the pressure up and we can never fully accept what is happening on screen thanks to this frankly awfully portrayed style he is certainly no paul greengrass and this is by no means bourne br br slick and stylized this is faster and more interesting than da vinci
<START> the idea of young girl who gets pregnant at the age of 16 is nothing new to the drama genre but it is pretty new if you take a look at the comedy genre there is this basic plot of and rory mother and daughter comes from a wealthy background got pregnant with 16 and ran away from her parents' house at 17 but this series does not start there it starts when rory is 16 and everything is just about the problems of a single mother who has terrible problems with her parents and about all those problems you have when you are 16 br br okay now again this sounds pretty normal but there is this little thing called joke the gilmore girls talk incredibly fast and they make like 60 jokes a minute even if you don't understand all of the jokes since they contain hundreds of references to films music gossip history literature and politics sometimes you even get confused but that really is the fun and not only it is fast it's smart and wonderfully sarcastic in addition to that it is not only funny it has great drama parts in it and you can take some lessons from it even home which is a thing that does not go for every single tv series br br so watch it it'll lighten your mood and help you through hard decisions
<START> i saw this turkey in the theater but i had a good time the special effects aren't worthy of a grade school production a toy boat representing a freighter moving at speedboat velocity on flat waters while wind driven fog blows in the opposite direction the red and blue flood lamps add that extra dramatic touch whatever cache vincent price was supposed to bring as narrator is completely overshadowed by dreadful production work calling this a documentary is like calling britney spears a musician about 20 minutes into this something struck me as very funny maybe it was price's overly dramatic intonation of the oft used line they vanished into the devil's triangle cut to black next story once i started laughing my friends joined in next time vinny said the crucial line someone in the back yelled out good after that it got almost as many laughs as a marx brothers film nobody stayed for the dreadfully serious second feature chariots of the gods
<START> the jaws rip off is the trashiest of the all the italian and director joe d'amato is second only to the great jess franco in the trash film production stakes put the two together and what do you get a gigantic piece of trash of course unfortunately it's not trash in the good sense of the word either as deep blood delivers more in boredom than it does in hilarity to the film's credit it does actually attempt something bordering on a plot but to take said credit away from the film the plot is rubbish it has something to do with a group of friends taking of an oath of friendship and then some indian curse that manifests itself into a shark or at least i think that's what was going on anyway the majority of the film is padded out with boring dialogue and 'drama' and the shark itself which lets not forget is the only thing we really want to see finds itself in merely a cameo role or not even that since most the shark is actually stock footage despite being a trash genre there are actually a lot of fun jaws rip offs but with this one joe d'amato makes it clear that he couldn't be bothered to even try and the result is what must be the worst italian shark movie of all time avoid this dross
<START> the first time i saw this film i wanted to like it for so many reasons but i simply did not it just seemed a little dull but there was a tiny question i had about something i saw near the beginning of the film so i watched it againÂ and then finally it clicked for me i first watched the movie knowing the surprise ending and while i definitely wouldn't recommend having the ending spoiled for you i have still thoroughly enjoyed the bulk of the film and discovering the many seemingly insignificant events that all unravel to point to a very sinister scheme br br i don't think that everyone will love this movie or even like it if you like any of the actors you'll like this movie because the acting is fairly strong and they all get a lot of screen time if you like mysteries namely hitchcock you'll like this movie if you like independent or psychological films you'll like this movie it really worked for me on all of those levels if you don't like the actors mysterious plots or psychological elements you might not like this movie but that's your loss personally the only thing that irked me a little was the accents good try alan rickman on the american dialect but it wasn't much improvement from the scene in die hard the wonderful voice makes up for the weird accent though the medley of accents in the movie was a little odd but it was not so distracting that it became difficult or particularly irritating also the camera change from scene to scene was evident and might bother some people but i actually think it added to the scenes or sceneÂ i can really only recall one scene where the change was severely different but it worked br br when you see this movie see it at least twice the second time you see it i hope you realize how intricate the plot really is every time i watch this movie it's under an hour and a half so multiple viewings are not difficult i seem to notice something else about it and find myself wondering why did that just happen or was that intentional i like movies that make me think this one does so just see it twice
