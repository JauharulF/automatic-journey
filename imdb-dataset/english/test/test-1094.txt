<START> i saw the movie after checking its rating on imdb back then it was at 8 0 and i thought wow that must be a good one i thought wrong the beginning of the movie actually keeps what the plot promises but then it goes exponentially down underneath its basement i think without the character of richie nix it might have been alright although he is the reason the story line takes the course it does the character is just too extreme for my liking and hard to endure also the journey the main character takes from the beginning of the story till its climax at the end is partly irrelevant and could easily have been omitted the alternative is i just did not understand the movie br br although i must admit that it is easy watching and i had no problems sitting through the whole movie when it had finished i was somewhat unimpressed by the ending all in all rather mediocre
<START> spoilers br br one of the worst films i've seen since last years the village an insult to anyone of any intelligence at all poorly written and astonishingly contrived nobody especially in los angeles talks the way these characters do no subtly at all if the point of this film is to say that we all have a little bit of bigotry in us he does a horrible job of stating the obvious not only was his point clearly base but every character in this film was amazingly stupid the car jacking scene almost made me walk out along with the rescue and oh lets not forget the white off duty rookie cop picking up a hitchhiking black thug and i could go on and on awful just awful
<START> think with testosterone instead of estrogen and you get the general idea for this picture a very lame story with mediocre effects and an anti climax ending to let the door open for a part 2 let's hope someone has the sense to spend their money wiser i'd suggest a the movie' because compared to this kicked ass and i only watched that show to please my girlfriend wait and watch it on dvd on a rainy sunday when you've got nothing better to do or better yet download it so you don't waste your money the first 15 minutes were alright but the funniest line from the movie and also the only highlight of this movie is when reid says kiss my ass harry potter while driving of a cliff although they are not worthy to kiss potter's ass because potter is way cooler and at least his movies have a story the goblet of fire was even scarier than this
<START> spoilers ahead i have a saying kill insects and kill morons the ghost in this movie kills morons several of the people who get killed in this movie are actually asking to get killed by running into abandoned houses going after ghosts etc br br on a strictly cinematic aspect this movie sucks real bad the three story lines are shown to be parallel and suddenly we learn they are separated by at least a few days it's a cheap shot br br also the thrills are so cheap they are laughable even nightmare on elm street didn't sink so low as to show someone being attacked by his own sweater it's pathetic br br save your money stay home and you won't have a grudge against the filmmakers
<START> i love this movie a lot i must get this on dvd i have 2 vhs copies but the quality is so poor that you can't read one written joke over the door of the ward i'm forever amazed that blankfield did almost nothing afterward he made both dr and mr hyde totally believable br br the movie is plagued by it's low budget one atrocious edit jumps into mid word and was described on siskel ebert but there are a thousand jokes sight gags to subtle references that more than compensate i often find myself quoting lines or singing i've got nothing to hide and from time to time completely describe a scene which matches some conversation there are at least six scenes which are among my all time favorite comedy bits br br viewers with no history of cocaine use may miss a lot of gags br br here take it visual of driving while waving butt out the window i said 'is this seat taken ' nice burn visual of chaps headdress swim fins yeah i'm right handed me me says the woman trying to sell bernie's going to love these that's my feet jack says the black feet why should we tell you she's at the supermarket ivy on supermarket pa loading whole shopping cart into ambulance etc
<START> like a twisty country road tough luck takes the viewer for a ride there is nothing wrong with plot curves as long as believability doesn't fly out the window unfortunately in the end the film does challenge an audience's belief tolerance nevertheless it is easy to forgive this fault due to the superior acting character development and wonderful carnival atmosphere do not expect to like any of the characters armand norman and play shady con artists not exactly the type of person easily admired the double crosses come fast and furious and the final cross is a bit of a stretch recommended merk
<START> i don't understand the many good reviews here i found the photography and scenery beautiful and the two lead actors appealing but there's little else here to recommend this movie most annoying are the fake southern accents and badly written dialog these do not sound like real people to me although it's refreshing to show men exploring various forms of sexuality without the usual labeling and stereotypical character traits most of the story is without motivation or logic the only thing that makes very much sense is the responsibility griffith feels toward his mentally ill aunt grossly over acted by karen black lee is an interesting character who would have been more compelling had the dialog he was made to speak been more natural and his motivations more clear yes i understand that he's a drifter but his actions as the movie draws to a rushed conclusion make no sense at all this movie is worth a look chiefly because it has a nice atmosphere about it but it's slow moving and deeply flawed a serious rewrite and better editing might have saved it as the premise and story outline are promising
<START> a really good australian film beautifully recreates the look and feel of sydney as it was in the 1950s this movie greatly impressed me when i first saw it during it's initial cinema release and it still stands up very well fine directing job by phil wonderful camera work thoughtful lighting and some fine performances across the board an absolute must see for any students of 70's australian cinema one out of the box
<START> obviously it seems many people really enjoyed this movie and that's wonderful it is certainly a very well intentioned film and i appreciate that in an era of heartless or emotionally damaging films unfortunately the film has a lot of problems and it was not something i enjoyed watching br br the primary problem is the writing it is just not very funny when something tries to be snappy or witty and fails that is far worse than when it hasn't attempted wit at all this film is to a great degree a series of snappy but gentle come backs between adult family members none of which seem imaginative or apt there is also a few central premises in the film that seem like too much of a stretch of coincidence or character motivation to be believable or really work some of the back story seemed more intriguing and did serve to decorate the story around the edges fairly well but it couldn't make up for the moment to moment flatness that pervaded almost all of the movie br br the directing editing doesn't support the film well either although i don't know to explain how exactly somehow things always seemed to me rather fake and that the actors were forcing there way through unnatural material for the most part they tried and i don't fault any one person here there were also too many small and charmless roles in it outside the immediate family br br not a good rental in my opinion though again apparently a number of people found it very charming i am 38 i suspect that perhaps people over 60 might enjoy this film more
<START> i've just seen this film in a lovely air conditioned cinema here in bangkok and since the temperature outside is hovering somewhere around with very high humidity my was not wasted br br failing that i haven't seen such a piece of extremely well made junk in a long time this is the kind of film that provides a test of taste as it were anyone who claims to like or love it goes immediately onto the same list of tasteless phonies who still go around talking about the superiority of british television at least the gormless old broad in the wheelchair was good for a few guffaws br br pseudo profundity and fat lips while characteristic of much french cinema really do not a good movie make i'd rather watch independence day 10 times in a row than sit through this stinker one more time
<START> i couldn't disagree more with those who says this is a lousy movie me and my friend went to see it during the stockholm film festival and this was actually one of my favorite movies during the festival dolls being used in horror movies aren't something new but i haven't seen that many movies were it has been as well carried out as it is in this movie the atmosphere the setting the actors the camera work everything is just beautiful and they really work well with each other now if you expect this film to be another grudge or ring then you probably won't like it but if your out for a good stylized scare then it's perfect even though it's pretty predictable and at some times laughable i still recommend this to anyone who likes horror flicks go see it now
<START> it starts off with a view of earth and jupiter aligned br br where do we come from and where we are headed br br the story starts with the dawn of man a documentary like view of the pre historic grass eater ape that was facing its extinction due to no physical ability that would let him hunt to eat and the lack of grass and water in the africa the monkeys hadn't survived if it wasn't for the god like intervention of an alien artifact that somehow transformed the apes that touched it and gave them the ability to use tools that were first used as weapons that allowed them to kill pigs to eat for super and to kill other monkeys in fights for water that ape was man an enigmatic start for an enigmatic film br br after the fast forward that leaves the movie at the present days we see a magnificent dance of spaceships at the sound of strauss the rest of the movie is about how tools got control of man the strange artifact appears once again to evolve man to his final stage the br br at 1968 the year this movie was released only astronauts had idea of what was out there in space after this movie that changed it's futurism took 7 years to be explored the special effects are incredible they are completely realistic even today br br the directing along with excellent taste in music good acting and the fantastic filmography makes it an epic br br the plot with its vision of the year 2001 and the evolution of man tools with an ai with the hypnotising end makes it the trip our lives br br if you have never seen this movie see it don't be scared with the lack of dialog sit back and enjoy it's a symphony of evolution it's terrific
<START> although not a big coen brothers fan i am an admirer of their dark humor films like 'fargo' and crossing ' i have been much less impressed by their other comic mode goofy camp or is that camp goofy unfortunately 'o brother where art thou ' falls into the latter category and isn't even as good as 'the big or 'the hudsucker proxy ' br br 'o brother' is basically an episodic series of in jokes without much point and not all that much humor or cleverness either as most reviewers have noted the film's plot is very loosely Â and as far as i could tell quite arbitrarily Â based on the odyssey its main character ulysses everett mcgill george clooney is an like his homeric namesake and has as his 'real' goal the return home to prevent the marriage of his wife penny to a suitor of course we don't discover that this is what the clooney ulysses character really wants until long after we've stopped caring and what does homer have to do with cool hand luke chain gangs ku klux klan meetings a la indiana jones cult gatherings a disbarred lawyer's vocabulary a talent for blue grass country music singing an association with baby face nelson a clark gable lookalike hairdo and other random and sundry character traits and encounters i leave that for others to discern br br the allusion to preston sturges' in 'o title is equally pointless yes viewers familiar with the sturges minor screwball comedy classic might find it mildly rewarding to recognize the title of the socially conscious depression movie sullivan abandons hollywood and comedy hoping to make and they might even be mildly amused by a couple of shot scene riffs e g hopping freight cars and the chain gang shuffle into view a movie but so what the coen brothers don't seem to have anything to add to the art for art's sake versus moral high seriousness critical debate about the function of art they obviously fall into the former school but that doesn't seem to motivate the reference in the slightest is it an homage if so why make it i like post modern pop culture reference and textual play as much as the next person but it's a lot nicer when it amounts to something at least tonally if not thematically consistent Â and not just an arbitrary concoction br br this screenplay is simply a silly mess the only consistent and consistently pleasing element is the folk country music soundtrack it doesn't have much to do with homer or preston sturges but considering the rest of the film that's probably a good thing on the other hand i'd recommend using the price of admission on the soundtrack cd
<START> after seeing forever hollywood it would be natural to want to see a john waters film at least one get to say that they have joined the legions of cinema cognoscenti who have experienced the unique cinematic stylings of perhaps the best known non mainstream director it's worth the effort and pf is a lot better than eraserhead and there is a certain campiness about his films which his followers find addicting
<START> one of my favorite westerns and one of john ford's best in my opinion no major stars but ben johnson shines in most everything he appears and here he gets a rare lead as the title character matching him is ward bond as the crusty mormon elder leading his people west john ford's stock of character actors including harry carey jr jane darwell russell simpson and hank worden provide ample support as does eerily silent james arness a member of the outlaw clegg clan that joins up with the wagon train the mormon trail into utah was one of the most arduous and demanding enterprises ever undertaken we can't really get the feel of that but we do see ordeals that had to be overcome by pioneers on the way west river crossings long stretches of dry desert encounters with indians and the like all set to glorious song by the sons of the pioneers the mormons actually did dig sections of the trail with picks and shovels as depicted in the movie my main regret is that it wasn't made in color but i believe there is a colorized version by the way those craggy rocks featured in various scenes are called the fisher towers located near highly recommended viewing
