<START> a fare to remember is a totally derivative almost ridiculous movie but has a warmth about it that makes it a very effective and upbeat holiday movie it stars a pretty newcomer as a high powered ad executive who right before her wedding has to rush from l a to seattle to keep a client who has rejected every other presentation she has transportation difficulties from the beginning and seemingly no money this is the first dumb thing were there no anywhere she must make a fortune at any rate she meets a cab driver warner who looks like a homeless man and he drives her to her presentation and when she emerges with a huge box of beef jerky the client's product he's there to take her to the airport all flights are canceled so in order to get to l a for her wedding she hires him to take her there br br along the way they bond and learn from each other it's a very sweet movie though there is absolutely nothing new in it it combines six days and seven nights and a few other films but the chemistry between the stars is good they're likable and the acting is good look for jerry springer as the head of the beef jerky company and a cameo by karl malden br br this is a nice film to take in over the holiday season it's on lifetime
<START> one of the most entertaining of all silent comedies is short a mad tale of how a rigorously intellectual board game could disrupt even the most carefully planned central economies such an unpromising comedic subject as chess found an earlier outlet in this delightful short two young men play the game earnestly against an artificial background a painted set this is in contrast to earlier lumiere shorts such as or du wherein the human activity was deliberately framed by a natural setting the difference in activities natural feeding baby watering garden artificial chess is possibly significant br br the main contrast in this film is between this background and the placid serene game of chess and the fierce passions this latter causes as accusations of cheating lead to a most melee the intellectual game becomes a gross physical scrap just as the pretensions of arty filmmakers are forever deflated by the demands of audiences br br what is most amusing about the film is not neccessarily this descent into slapstick but the way it is filmed its prolonging long after the initial joke has been made the way the camera refuses to dignify the fight with anything like attention focusing instead on the set while we catch glimpses of hurling feet and dislodged clothing the film's refusal to edit is audacious so that the humour seems to arise from something else other than the fight reflecting our need for physical contact over intellectual stimulation our to let go br br what is especially brilliant is the denouement as these upper class fops are caught by the valet who picks them up like two errant schoolboys as if he is about to box their ears if masters can't be expected to keep their place with decorum than somebody's going to have to do it for them
<START> this film was so bad it became enjoyable if you want to see a soap opera cast decide to do an action film this is for you overacting irrelevant incidents implausible dialogue it has it all the main character has a split personality and can not make up his mind whether he is thief a loving father or a hero who will risk his life for others he is plausible in none of these roles this sets the standard for many of the other characters the boss of the company whose building is set ablaze displays the same unpredictability and so does his wife and the punch line who has taken the chip beggars belief i found myself laughing heartily and for that reason i recommend you watch it
<START> by the time it opened heaven's gate had become to its detriment more a cultural phenomenon than a motion picture at a time when concern about excessive budgets and directorial arrogance were growing it was a convenient target as it was a far over budget work by the latest auteur to hit hollywood who had not yet established the track record that would have given him the benefit of the doubt among critics and the industry alike as someone pointed out at the time no one was going to jump on warren beatty's even more costly and dark reds because beatty was one of us while michael cimino had not achieved that status br br but heaven's gate was also affected by a cultural change taking place at that time the political move and toward a more patriotism and of the myth of the west and the western a few years earlier cimino's of the frontier might have seemed timely fresh and a necessary but by 1980 in the wake of the reagan revolution it was thought of as nearly un american br br which is a shame because the film seen from the vantage point of several decades away is a fascinating and thought provoking look at that particular time and place as a world where life was in words nasty brutish and short kristofferson plays james an upper class who in search of adventure becomes a sheriff in wyoming where he finds himself having to lead a resistance by the settlers and squatters against an attack by a mercenary death squad hired by wealthy landowners including lifelong best friend in a more innocent time and his rag tag army of poor farmers would emerge triumphant but this is anything but a traditional western and when the u s cavalry joins the fight here it isn't on the side of the good guys br br much like the deer hunter cimino's previous film heaven's gate spends a great deal of time building up the details of the lives of its principals giving the film an at times leisurely pace that nevertheless leads to a gripping conclusion with excellent acting a fine musical score and the visual texture that makes one believe one is actually seeing the old west through new eyes heaven's gate is a film that rewards repeat viewings i only wish that mgm would put out a new dvd with an improved transfer and a commentary by cimino nonetheless the current version is satisfactory enough to let viewers see what critics in 1980 possibly blinded by the film's cultural subtexts managed to miss that heaven's gate is a great film
<START> lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcock's black and white low budget original nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great master's stable
<START> i give it a 2 because of the beautiful mediterranean greece otherwise it would be 1 when nicholas cage came into with his first lines i thought he was just kidding cage as an italian i'm sorry but very wrong actor who's acting is also bad not to mention his accent the story is very loose it might have been good but with other actors and obviously with other screenplay the camera is great photography also but why the hell did you cast nicholas cage and penelope cruz for the role please don't get me wrong i don't have anything against cage he has some really great movies but he obviously isn't for every role it's really a pity that the cast wasn't better set because the story has potential
<START> kim basinger and mickey rourke star in this controversial story of a wall street exec and an art gallery employee who hook up and begin a very experimental sexual relationship while the acting by rourke and basinger is ok the flim doesn't allow their characters to truly form allegedly there was a lot of film left on the cutting room floor that delved deeper into the characters and the effects of the relationship on them basinger's character considering suicide that would have made the characters more involved for the viewer as is it is a glossy well produced with mtv style editing piece of soft core voyeurism 4 of 10
<START> this movie was sheer slow plodding torture not being a fan of slasher films and preferring classic horror i may not be the best judge slasher fans may enjoy this as an early entry into the slasher genre i really would like the 90 minutes i spent watching this back the only reasons to watch this are 1 a young white pre wheel of fortune who has about 3 minutes of total screen time 2 an early role by scream queen linnea quigley with nudity and legendary beauty ej as the school secretary who added a bit of humor and sex appeal otherwise an 80's band called makes an appearance which while interesting drags on way too long just like the movie i had to keep checking how much time was left and couldn't wait to graduate to a better film
<START> maybe it was the excessive weight gain seagal had put on or maybe it was the horrible acting of wayans in an action flick or was it the total lack of chemistry between the two leading characters these and other considerations lead me to conclude that seagal should have never made this acting nightmare true the story line was good yet as an avid follower of seagal's career and background his physical appearance was inconsistent with his genre of clean pure healthy zen buddhist living notably in his on screen discussions with wayans then again his real life affair with the nanny was inconsistent also br br if seagal wants to become a more diversified actor then he should do what a fellow action figure did in kindergarten cop put humorous material or situations in the script where the actor has no choice but to react in a comical way otherwise leave the wise cracks and the futile attempts at humor out of it while chasing a serial killer seagal is not a natural humor type of guy it did not work br br
<START> excellent performance there still are good actors around also great directing and photography very true to shakespear and a 'must' for all shakespear fans macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle out he gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting helen is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil if you love death and decay and lyrics this is the one
<START> i cannot believe this show was okay ed first off j p does a horrible job filling in for david spade and voice is too deep compared to john goodman's the theme song is so annoying and the plots of the episodes are so stupid the only good thing about this show is that eartha kitt and patrick warburton remain as the voices of and this show is a waste of money and a waste of your time half of the episodes are copied of the movie in my opinion the emperor's new groove was one of the best children's movies in years but they ruined by making new groove and this show you should watch such shows as spongebob fairly oddparents danny phantom or kim possible but not this show
<START> now i love italian horror films the cheesier they are the better however this is not cheesy italian this is week old spaghetti sauce with rotting meatballs it is amateur hour on every level there is no suspense no horror with just a few drops of blood scattered around to remind you that you are in fact watching a horror film the special effects consist of the lights changing to red whenever the ghost or whatever it was supposed to be is around and a string pulling bed sheets up and down oooh can you feel the chills the dvd quality is that of a vhs transfer which actually helps the film more than hurts it the dubbing is below even the lowest bad italian movie standards and i gave it one star just because the dialogue is so hilarious and what do we discover when she finally does look in the attic in a scene that is daytime one minute and night the next well i won't spoil it for anyone who really wants to see but let's just say that it isn't very novel
<START> world war i gets a glossy sepia tinted makeover in jean pierre jeunet's relentlessly whimsical a very long engagement jeunet's trademark style consists of mechanical almost clockwork like narrative construction garnished with lavish chocolate box production values and seasoned with faux naive humour it's an approach that worked pretty well with his previous picture the romantic fantasy amelie thanks in no small part to the inimitable contribution of audrey tatou in the title role applied to vastly more sombre material jeunet's method backfires rather badly br br tatou crops up again here in a variation on the same sort of sweetly off beat character as amelie she's an orphan who lives quietly with her aunt and uncle in an idyllic rural setting determined to trace what became of her child sweetheart gaspard ulliel several years after he went missing in the war was one of five soldiers court for self mutilation in 1917 at and sent over the top into no man's land as a punishment he's presumed dead by all but who cherishes the hope of finding him the film follows dogged quest to find out what really happened and as she delves deeper she uncovers a sad even shocking story of high ranking corruption and inhumanity must filter the facts from the fictions that arise from various conflicting overlapping or incomplete accounts of what seem to be final hours br br all this should be poignant and gripping but it's more often simply confusing thanks to the visual and verbal clutter with which jeunet pummels his audience there's simply too much going on at any one time including an intrusive narration that adds precisely nothing to our appreciation of the story and characters without a moment's respite from informational overload i felt denied the space to reflect on quest or the room to engage with it on my own terms jeunet's busy camera spirals and swoops and circles caressing every surface contour of his exquisitely designed production but it singularly fails to penetrate to the soul beneath the story's skin the result is deeply uninvolving and worse grotesque the first world war was a particularly dark hour in human history imagine it re created as one of those picturesque commercials for a well known belgian lager and you have the measure of this film
<START> i am a big fan of auntie mame with rosalind russell she really was the perfect actress to play that character br br i've heard angela lansbury was very good on stage in mame but it's hard to imagine anyone topping rosalind russell br br lucy was such a great comedienne that her comic bits salvaged her performance in this movie where i think she was miscast really they should have dubbed her singing voice hearing these songs sung at a faster tempo and with strong voices really changes the whole effect br br i just saw the stage revival in washington d c and i think christine baranski was very good as mame harriet harris the nasty chain smoking agent on frasier played vera and she was particularly good br br both would be good casting for a tv movie of this show maybe if that production makes it to broadway they'll consider filming it br br also i think tracy ullman would be good as agnes
<START> dad 78 and i 46 both had a good time watching the flick today for a guy primarily known for serious roles de niro is a heckuva comic actor of course it helps to have his past film images to play against consider that one of those roles 15 minutes was a cop having to deal with the interference of the mass media and you have an interesting set of compare contrast performances br br murphy plays another of his axel foley sort of characters shatner plays a burlesque of himself a parallel world self who was best known for tj hooker and not star trek br br it's interesting to watch how the film comments on the contrasts between the reality of police work and its fictional counterparts in tv and film shatner lectures on the proper means of sliding across a car hood de niro points out holsters scratch the hood finish ironically as the film progresses de niro's character begins to incorporate the illusions of tv cop reality into the real world case he's working br br the film draws its inspiration from a gamut of sources so one could make the comment it is derivative well so what satire needs to derive its humor in order to exist and besides the film does have quirky moments of originality for example i'm reasonably sure the method of the villain's death has never been done before br br one quibble about the reality of the weapons involved shouldn't those guns have had some kind of recoil in order to penetrate steel those bullets had to have enough inertia to penetrate and any highest level of inertia is at the moment of firing so firing a volley of these tank killer bullets should have driven the shooters back onto their butts oh what the heck it's a satire maybe the lack of recoil is itself a satire on the b f guns used so casually in thrillers br br
