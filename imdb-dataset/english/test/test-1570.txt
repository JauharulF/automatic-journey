<START> i could crap a better movie this is a waste of time and money it makes me sick that movies like these are actually getting made and the people making them actually think they're good i happen to like teen comedies when they're done well this movie however takes this genre to a new low with movies like this people think it's actually okay to make this filth and ask unsuspecting people to pay money to sit through it it's sadism
<START> during the final throes of the war our central character capt willard martin sheen is dispatched by the cia on an illegal one man mission to assassinate a renegade us marine commander colonel kurtz marlon brando who has allegedly gone but who is successfully waging a private cross border war from his base in cambodia a neutral and therefore off limits country br br the entire narrated story of what willard sees and does as he is ferried up the da nang river by an undisciplined and terrorised navy patrol boat crew to murder kurtz is a grand metaphor for the excesses decadence and ultimately the weakness of the anglo saxon psyche if we don't understand something and we are unable to control it exterminate it kurtz had eventually come to know this br br unless you pay complete attention to every emotional gesture to every word of the dialogue between the protagonists especially in the scene where the two of them are alone in darkened lair you will miss one of the central themes of this incredible movie subtle deal with his executioner his in return for willard agreeing did he nod to tell 'son' another metaphor for us the next generation the ones watching the movie the truth about all the horrors that they had both seen in vietnam is mind expanding stuff the bonding between the two men whilst kurtz cross examines willard interlaced with some of his own horror stories is incredible nay genius film the closing intercut scene of the ritual slaughter of a sacrificial bull is the single most powerful of symbols has made intentionally or not the ultimate anti war statement one that should resonate through the ages
<START> although little more than a pleasant 11 minute musical diversion it's rightly billed as a tabloid musical every sunday is one of the most famous and precious documents in cinematic history since it provides an invaluable look at the burgeoning talents of two of the screen's most talented and beloved musical performers deanna durbin and judy garland br br although often cited as an screen test of sorts produced by mgm to test the adolescent appeal of studio durbin and garland whose options were reportedly coming up for renewal this assertion is not entirely accurate by the time every sunday was produced in july 1936 deanna durbin's contract with mgm had already lapsed and she had been immediately signed by universal a month earlier in june 1936 br br however a provision in durbin's mgm contract permitted the studio to exercise an option on her services for up to sixty days providing she had not yet begun work on a picture at her new studio as durbin's debut vehicle three smart girls was still not ready to begin filming mgm chose to exercise its' option and although officially under contract to universal at the time durbin found herself back on the mgm lot filming this agreeable short subject with fellow adolescent singing hopeful judy garland br br this along with garland's far more extensive prior professional performing experience training which included appearances in several earlier movie shorts may explain why every sunday often seems to favor judy garland over deanna durbin giving garland more lines to speak and an original song americana to sing while durbin offers the popular classical art song il bacio by luigi certainly it would make perfect sense that mgm would want to favor one of its' own contract players over another from a rival studio br br ironically although garland's character is the more overtly pro active one of the two girls in this short it would be durbin's feisty and impulsive little miss fixit screen persona at universal which would propel her to instantaneous worldwide super stardom as the world's first teen idol with her debut vehicle three smart girls while garland's more passive wistful wallflower adolescent image would see her generally cast in supporting roles opposite frequent screen partner mickey rooney and in ziegfeld girl the up and coming lana turner not until her fifteenth mgm feature for me and my gal which was also her first fully adult role would garland achieve the solo above the title billing and solo attraction status of a true superstar that durbin had attained instantaneously six years earlier br br it is entirely inaccurate therefore to assert that garland was the only superstar attraction of the two girls as durbin attained this status with press 'n public almost a decade before her mgm rival literally in foreclosure at the time of her signing the on screen evidence strongly suggests that universal was much quicker to realize deanna's full superstar potential than mgm was with judy and it's worth noting that almost every notable accomplishment garland achieved at mgm from superstar billing to having starring vehicles specially written to showcase her talents and appeal to being invited to plant her footprints in the forecourt of chinese theater to receiving an honorary oscar in recognition for her talent deanna durbin received well before her gifted mgm contemporary br br in any case every sunday is a delightful utterly unpretentious musical short its plot line durbin and garland use their singing talents to save durbin's grandfather from being forcibly retired by the town council from conducting his sunday concerts in the park presages the plot lines of both garland's let's put on a show musicals with mickey rooney and durbin's 100 men and a girl unlike garland's later babes films the short never treats the insubstantial storyline seriously and consequently its' eleven minute running time flies by br br of course the true magic of every sunday is in observing the already remarkable performing talents screen presences of durbin and garland at the very beginning of their legendary careers both girls even at this early stage possessed remarkable screen presences and are utterly natural and unaffected in their presentation as both singers and actresses garland fairly explodes off the screen with vitality as she literally punches out the lyrics to the jaunty americana as she socks across the number with appropriate hand gestures judy literally seems to be chewing on the words of the song as she screws up her mouth and bugs out her eyes in her intense eagerness to show what she can do br br by contrast durbin's presentation of il bacio is far more demure and subdued although entirely appropriate for her classical selection durbin's delivery of waltz is much more of the traditional stand 'n sing variety than garland's physically emotive turn nevertheless though miniature diva deanna does nothing to call attention to herself with her candid eyes dazzling smile and artless delivery she easily holds the screen with jazz baby judy and their delightful duetting of americana in the short's finale makes one regret all the more that producer joe pasternak was never able to realize his dream of pairing durbin and garland in a musical feature film because universal refused to loan number one asset durbin out br br a priceless document of the nascent talents of two remarkable and utterly unique talents see this one if you get a chance
<START> when i first watched with my sister we thought it was a piece of garbage no one is that rich and lives at a dorm off the pacific coast in the show zoey is a mega popular rich girl that everyone always go to her for advice zoey is always the one with the good idea and everyone agrees with her no matter how stupid her idea is she is always perfect at everything including her perfect figure and she is such a freak she talks about like she knows what they are when she sees that her friends are eating chocolate she confiscates it and another thing that ticks me off is that she is always chewing a piece of spearmint every time you look at her and everyone wants something do with her for example in one episode that logan guy bid 4 000 to have her and her friends cheer for everything he does in his pathetic life and her friend nicole is an overly perky freak that screams a lot and lola dresses like a hoochie houdini lady 80s called they want there bushy hair back might as well shave off the hair chase this show sends a bad message to kids everywhere to make them think that if they don't have the latest i pods and designer clothes they will hate themselves br br this show is a big thumbs down br br we hate you jamie lynn br br best wishes ryan and kara l
<START> flesh is hard to describe with a solid summary because well there basically isn't a plot the film pretty much just shows the day in the life of a hustler named joe joe who is in the underrated louis malle picture black moon as he makes his rounds sleeping and modeling around to cash in the bucks to pay for his wife's lover's abortion br br not much and since the film is quite a lengthy eighty nine minutes you would think that flesh would be a slow moving and boring hour and a half you think wrong the film is made up of improv no screenplay and the angles of the film are pretty on the spot as well yet there is some kind of truth beneath every frame that gives the film its dementedly entertaining vibrancy everything makes sense and serves purpose in what happens to joe in this one day he meets a regular john that is obviously lying when saying he wants to see joe again a photographer who talks so much that it bores joe to tears two drag queens who read out of tabloid magazines as joe receives head from a mousy voiced addict who mumbles on later about how she wants to get a breast lift an old friend of joe who reads male on male rape stories to him and then a final scene with his wife and her lover that eerily echoes the scene at the start of the film one of the best openings to a film i have seen in quite some time Â and tells completely what the film is overall philosophically about br br it's astounding how the film's messages and styles feel almost timeless even though it's set in 1960s new york city in real time in real place and is filmed like an obvious independent flick from that era it's certainly not a film that could be made today which adds on to its delicious mystique br br fueled by unexpected jump cuts and absent of a score to advance its images Â flesh is about as raw gritty as a film about male prostitution in the 60s can get
<START> warning i advise anyone who has not seen the film yet to not read this comment br br this movie was on the shelf at a movie store and since i had seen a handful of very corny horror flicks there i had really low expectations for this one well i put it in and almost immediately i was sucked right in while watching i got deeper and deeper into the story and pretty soon i was staring in complete interest this movie is surprisingly spectacular and i loved every second the story is about a boat ride down a river in australia it seems safe enough until their boat is ambushed by a croc who's ready for some food when i looked at the back of the case i thought that this movie was going to have crappy visual effects like in lake placid 2 and a lot of others but when i first saw the crocodile it looked amazingly real don't laugh when i say this for i am being serious but this is one of the most creepiest films i've ever seen it really knew how to build up nail biting tension and suspense with it's intense situation i mean think about it your stuck in a tree nowhere to run nowhere to hide with a hungry predator in the depths of the water below you can not tell me that doesn't freak you out just a little it even managed to give me a few chills down my arms like when adam was taken by the croc and grace and lee are left baffled this is a very appealing movie there were maybe 1 or 2 parts where i found myself slightly uninterested but other than that i would say this is my favorite animal attack film that i have seen
<START> if only the writer producer star had the slightest inkling of the limits of his acting range and the way he is perceived on screen wearing glasses and a side parting is not enough to make you look gawky and quirky if your face and teeth have been sculpted by various medical professionals to conform to american ideals of generic characterless symmetry erroneously perceived as beauty in this obsessively superficial society he would have cast john heder as the main character instead of attempting to pull a good will hunting and create a vehicle to showcase his his well himself br br the excellent supporting cast lord knows they must be having problems to agree to this is wasted in an agonising perpetual struggle to react convincingly to a main character incapable of delivering even the simplest line with appropriate intonation and believe me he is not short of simple lines to choose from as the dialogue appears to have been composed by a five year old ah wait it's the same person pretending to be a writer as pretending to be an actor it's not often that i don't see a film through to the end but this ejaculation was irredeemable from the outset and showed no signs of improving after the first hour excrement
<START> i would assume that this film would get rave reviews in canada particularly in quebec that's because the canadians have traditionally loved hockey and the montreal canadians were like gods in canada for decades as an american the closest thing we have to them are the new york yankees if you are a fan then they are the greatest and team in history if you are not a fan then they are satan's team well at least that's how it was as i grew up in washington dc in regard to the dallas cowboys so i am pretty sure when this film was shown up north that everyone immediately had a strong emotional reaction their national sport and the closest thing they have to a national team in the nhl br br now the cartoon itself is moderately interesting when it begins and the main character talks about growing up around ottawa and rooting for the canadians and maurice the rocket richard however when his mother accidentally buys him a toronto maple leafs jersey and forces him to wear it i knew right away what a horrible and shameful thing this would be to a little boy this ability to connect to the character even though he lives in a far off land is what made this a very special short film the way the other kids treated him and his conversation with god at the end make this a lovely nostalgic film very clever and memorable
<START> a good documentary reviewing the background behind our societies oil addiction the problem concerning our present energy usage and finally discusses the effects of the coming energy deficit originating from the peak oil production problem br br this movie should be educated to all students as part of their education show it to your children parents relatives and friends they will thank you eventually br br after reviewing the contents of this documentary and comparing its mentioned sources i would say that the facts in this movie are well scientifically supported
<START> when a group of businessmen start dying in the presence of the mysterious mr fbi agent dick martin is assigned to the case as the deaths continue to mount mr martin obviously isn't having much success by the end of the movie the strange truth is revealed which i won't reveal here br br one of the other users commenting on this states this is a classic film and should be enjoyed and not picked apart i'm sorry but i have to respectfully disagree with this opinion it is classic only in that it is old not in any sense pertaining to its quality i've enjoyed a lot of low budget b movies from around this time period but this isn't one of them br br the pacing is unbearably slow the camera work is pretty bland most of the acting is fairly wooden even lugosi isn't great in this one in my opinion and the plot while it has an interesting premise seems to be thrown together in a very difficult to follow manner
<START> flashdance is one of those awful stupid movies that you actually kind of enjoy just because they're so crap i just watched it on tv my friend and i were amazed at how dopey it was it's true that don simpson and the other producers came up with the idea of a fairly cheap lowbrow flick with lots of sweaty bodies to help sell a soundtrack of admitedly catchy pop so flashdance is an odd sort of pioneer the first mtv movie adrian lyne started out in advertising and it shows because flashdance is almost a commercial for itself you've already decided to watch it but the movie has this weird panicky undercurrent as though it's frightened that you might change your mind at any moment it keeps selling itself to you over and over all the way through using slick commercial style editing and glossy close ups of jiggling breasts the story is wafer thin i honestly can't think of another film i've seen with less plot and it never makes much sense but its a very contrived calculating movie so it feels consistent people say it's dated but flashdance was always rubbish viewers in the early 80's knew it was just cheesy t a but it does work in its own silly fashion there's soppy romance for the chick flick crowd and stacks of oily writhing female bodies for their dates all set to a pumping disco beat how could it fail it helps that the dialogue is pointless so you can grab a popcorn without missing anything major and if this sort of thing isn't your cup of tea you can always laugh at the dance' on display the scene where a stand in for jennifer beals on stage in front of a tv with a fan in it and a face full of white clown make up had us in stitches a genuine guilty pleasure

<START> i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad i'm surprised anyone took it seriously characters are one dimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys the only merit here is that it's so lame it's funny actually for me there is the added benefit that it was shot in a state park not far from where i live so seeing some local sights on the big screen is a hoot br br the lead character is a off duty cop and makes a big point of lecturing a good guy that vigilante justice is not just a bad idea it's against the law imagine how long that lasts br br most of the movie's northern california characters are blown dried hollywood cheese balls looking like they've never actually been in a fight the story line is totally predictable this film is ripe for a mst 3k lampooning camp value only i'm pretty forgiving of films in general but seeing the old positive reviews i had to speak up this is a dog i give it a 3 out of 10 and then only for laughs
<START> i'm not a big fan of musicals but i was always enamored of ms hayworth's looks so i thought i'd give it a try br br this may be the best showcase for the multi talented ms hayworth she's never looked lovelier in a film with the possible exception of 'gilda' where she is sex symbol par excellence br br rita is more than ably assisted by gene kelly and phil silvers the comedy may be dated but it is still quite amusing kelly does one of his tour de force dances dancing with the image of himself from a window br br but rita drives this whole movie an excellent cast featuring otto kruger and the always wonderful wise cracking eve arden doesn't hurt br br rita sings rita dances all the while looking impossibly beautiful the music may be short of classic but the lyrics to most of the tunes are quite clever br br i find this movie works better than 'gilda' which i regard as a flawed film to ms hayworth's credit she also drives 'gilda' and gilda drives any red blooded male insane br br the film holds up well after all these years much leg candy for the male audience is a nice bonus
<START> i understand that this was kaufman's attempt to save a movie that was the pits the whole movie is voiced over since the audio reel was junk the voice overs were so bad and terrible quality as much as i love troma they tend to be a little heavy on the voice over work the acting was terrible one thing i did enjoy from this movie was the quick cameo of trey parker doing the aristocrats joke with a goofy wig on there are a lot of big director dudes in this movie like james gunn and eli roth friends of lloyd kaufman again i think this was attempt of saving a crappy movie and trying not to lose 1000s of dollars i won't go on and on but this movie was a mess check out other troma titles
