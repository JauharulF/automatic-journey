<START> five was an interesting viewing experience for me because of the question kieslowski seems to subtly ask the audience three men are the focus of this chapter and kieslowski present the two involved in murder with traits both good and bad in one's case almost overwhelmingly bad with such vile characters i found myself almost glad that they would receive some sort of punishment however when the time comes for the murder and it's subsequent effect on the murderer kieslowski takes an interesting angle and seems to ask those of us who shared my view are you not as guilty as this man this sort of indirect address of the audience makes the finale of five that much more profound as kieslowski as usual doesn't stay within the literal confines of his theme just as the other parts of the don't take their theme in it's literal sense neither does five it asks us what is murder who is more guilty of murder and what should be the appropriate punishment if any it's a fantastic film and typical of kieslowski absolutely stunning
<START> just saw it the story the plot the script makes absolute no sense its the brave part 2 without the ring its characters showing up out of the blue for no reason its hercules hated by everyone no one knows why its leelee showing her true talents two of them its crappy special effects its a few good actors wasting their talents did i mention two talents do i have to say more its just awful even for nbc tv standards its just the lowest what a waste by the way how can you people give this mini series so many stars its beyond me shame on you have to make 10 lines so this is my final word avoid avoid if u are considering buying it
<START> this is a low budget stop motion monster movie from brett a barbarian in dinosaur hell piper and it delivers just what i'd expect from such a production light hearted though cheesy dialogue some cute actresses and lots of stop motion critters that's why i've given the film 10 out of 10 because it delivers what i expected it to deliver and a bit more brett doesn't penny pinch when it comes to putting his critters on screen he hurls lots of bugs at his cast for the finale and anyway i love stop motion monsters which compared to cgi critters in bigger budgeted movies just seem to be that much fun to watch
<START> i was pleasantly pleased with the ending i just saw this movie yesterday and was going to turn it off but changed my mind it was not at all the direction i thought the story would end on thats about all positive i can say about this film all of the actors are especially the lead while she is an attractive young woman she'll never make it big the writing direction and acting are wooded sort of like what you would see on daytime soaps the filming locations were very clever in making you think it could be anywhere instead of blatantly tipping off it was in canada as this was shot entirely in canada i'm assuming the entire lot was which is not entirely bad as some recent tv productions cold squad stone are quite well done
<START> i thought this movie was too absurd for me to finish watching it the premise was too silly and predictable i didn't make it far into the movie br br let me see she is obviously older than the cabbie unless she is a lot younger than she looks he is black and she is white she makes more money than him he is only a cabbie that's 3 of society's most statistically failed unions all rolled up in one and we are supposed to pretend they have a chance in hell she would be better off marrying the guy she doesn't love br br i only watched it partially because i love as an actor his acting was superb hers meh it was ok but the premise is too silly didn't see the end couldn't make it there so i don't know if it ended differently from the way i predicted the ending would be i can't imagine any black woman liking this movie there is something sickening about watching a black man catering to a white woman like that and an old one at that please not in the real world
<START> i haven't seen so many people packed outside a theater since star wars episode iii both shows sold out and for good reason the man with the screaming brain was the best movie to see with a crowd full of geeks hey i'm a dork too br br bruce campbell was present and had the whole crowd in stitches the movie was cheesy in the best possible way it may be the funniest movie that bruce has done ted raimi steals the show with his bulgarian hip hop and zany facial expressions he is a laugh riot who knew that ted could rap br br i changed my mind the person who stole the show was actually a robot there is nothing funnier than a robot doing the robot br br as for bruce's performance i take the 5th thanks bruce thanks for being cool thanks for taking the time thanks for all of the fun
<START> eve is an eye opener because of the great sceneries and the tech no music in the backgrounds we hear this movie shows a good aspect on the human body being god's creation and to considerate about it viewers can earn better respect on the legendary story of adam and eve either if it's true or just a fairy tale depending on what we believe from watching this movie actress model inger impersonation of eve is so good there's no good word to describe her performance and i can't imagine having another actress being eve this movie to me comes in really handy for the type of therapy of stress relief we'd never fell so relax then before from watching this movie this movie is a masterpiece god supposedly wanted this movie to be made in the first place br br mr
<START> this is a film that in no way reflects the real world nothing in this film makes any real world sense or has any real world logic it operates entirely in its own little world and your ability to accept it or not will determine your love or hate for this film br br i love the film br br somewhere at the very beginning i bought into the completely unreal premise of the hit woman regaining her memory as the past comes back to haunt her there was a moment early on where i remember accepting that this was going to be one of those movies where the heroine was going to know nothing until it was needed despite all logic that it wouldn't happen that way oh its one of those films i said to myself and was hooked as the film took off on a wild two hour chase br br this is an action film with brain and brawn as things follow there own internal logic and you actually have to pay attention to follow some of the twists and turns i like this a great deal and am pleasantly surprised when i bump into people who feel the same way too people either love it or hate it if they've ever heard of it at all br br if you like action films this is a film to definitely try you may not like it but it certainly worth the effort to find out br br and as always leave reality at the door
<START> i sort of liked this movie not a good one but not the worst ever made though everyone else says it is one o the worst movies ever created i thought it was okay there are a lot of immature jokes it wants to be funny sometimes but fails br br the story is okay it may be a little hard to follow for the younger audiences though br br the acting is pretty bad jamie kennedy is a horrible actor at most times at some times it is even laughable alan cumming is probably the best actor in here he is funny when he is supposed to be but some of his lines are god awful br br oh and the main bad thing about this movie that i hated was tim voice when he is possessed by the mask the voice is horrible also the scenes that he is in are so unfunny that they are almost unbearable i am sure they could have cut him out and it wouldn't affect the movie at all br br overall you can live without seeing this it is a nice movie to watch if you have nothing else to watch though they definitely could have gone without making the sequel but it is a decent effort 4 10
<START> i didn't see such a movie where the creators put so much heart's blood into their work and paid attention to the finest details for a very long time br br everything was well thought and perfectly put into reality camera work editing and compositing worked so good together it was just amazing the titles were so fun and so perfectly choreographed br br this movie just blew me away br br the showdown could have been cut down by 10 or 15 minutes though br br it's a near to perfect homage to early silent noir films story acting scenery and costumes were perfectly fitting and believable to have com from the times of silent film making
<START> veteran tv director ted post treats us to a plodding confused and ultimately pointless story lifted from column b of the harold robbins big book of plots set against a smoggy phoenix skyline post charlies angles jaclyn smith takes a star turn as the woman whose eyes are mysteriously shadowed at all times while jfk impersonator james franciscus lounges around the fringes br br mannix goes western monkeys are abused models lean against classic cars and smith is constantly upstaged by sybil danning until a giallo style wrap up brings the whole sorry mess to a bitter end br br oh yeah and bob mitchum is in there too somewhere
<START> i really enjoyed this movie about a dog who becomes a duke it would have been very easy to mess this one up but along with the humor the script was filled with warmth and even some profundity about nobility and class it's a feel good movie that the whole family can watch even the adults
<START> if this movie had been directed by a man he would have been jailed while adrian lyne was shackled with a lawyer in the editing room to oversee the gutting of a classic piece of literature to appease the censors and to avoid running afoul of the child pornography protection act of 1996 a woman dumps ripe on us and everyone applauds did i miss a meeting in addition to the blatant pedophilia this movie is utterly preposterous has this woman never set foot on an active military base has she never met a soldier whose army is this the uniforms must have come from uniforms r us just throw on some patches who cares just make sure each and every one of them has a big red one there is a slight inside joke here that no doubt went over the auteur's head but might possibly have been slipped in by whoever furnished the military vehicles certainly there were no military advisors the u s army does not operate slums temporary base camps in jungle war zones are cleaner than this the u s army does not put 14 year old girls to work on military bases nor allow them to use the firing ranges or training courses there is much drama to be mined in the sexual coming of age of teenage girls this movie has absolutely nothing to do with that whatsoever
<START> there is a growing trend in the media to vilify and ridicule men one sees it in television adverts and program plots cheaters is a prime example they could find plenty of female cheaters yet the vast majority shown are men why the prime threat to any government's power resides in the male population they're less likely to abide by authority and are more of a physical combat threat a way to reduce the threat is to emasculate men in society via the media other examples of psychological propaganda are crime dramas full of self righteous cops including big jawed aggressive women accusing everyone they question trampling their rights and making those men feel like scum in australia many top male sports stars have been arrested recently for dubious assaults and drinking charges another example of the government controlling the male populous by arresting their heroes and asserting dominance cheaters aside from the political machinations is an invasion of privacy and a violation of rights furthermore most of these women assault the men if it were round the other way the men would be in jail if it were an honest show they would be finding women cheaters because they don't normally get caught due to the fact that their male lovers are quite happy to get in no strings attached and get out without rocking the boat men's mistresses want the men to themselves and want to own and control the men and thus get the men caught anyway
<START> i've heard a lot about porno holocaust and its twin film erotic nights of the living dead both films are interchangeable and were filmed at the same time on the same location with the same actors changing clothes for each film and taking them off if you are expecting the d'amato genius displayed in films like omega or death smiles on murder you won't find it here nonetheless this film has a charm that exploitation fans will not be able to resist where else will you see hardcore sex mixed with a zombie monster and his enormous penis that strangles and chokes women to death only from d'amato there is some amount of gore in which many of the men are bludgeoned to death the film is set on a beautiful tropical island as far as i know there is no subtitled version so if you don't speak italian you wont know what is going on but who cares right in all honesty gore fans will probably fast forward through the hardcore sex and if anyone is actually watching this for the sex only will for sure be offended instantly i can just imagine modern day porn fans tracing back through d'amato's output and coming across this atrocity out of the two i find erotic nights of the living dead far superior but don't bother watching either if they are cut porno holocaust is extremely low budget as expected even the monster looks no where as good as george eastman's character in anthropophagus the film is worth watching for laughs and to complete your d'amato film quest
