<START> a gruelling watch but one of bergman's finest films interesting to compare this with the hour of the wolf as both feature the same lead actors as artists or an artist and his wife who have taken sanctuary on an island in the earlier film it's largely inner demons that lead to von disintegrating personality at least that's how i read it whereas here it's very much circumstances beyond his control br br much has been written about the unsympathetic central characters particularly von sydow's for me there are flashes of a good if flawed man early in the film but one who copes badly with adversity the flaws become all that is left as his humanity is gradually eroded by one horror after another br br i watched a passion and von sydow on their island again soon after this and was amazed to recognise many of the same locations and then there's a dream sequence
<START> completely agree with other review br br i watched this movie for about 5 minutes i looked up the one review on another site and found that it wasn't even a real sequel this was after i slowly backed away from the tv with remote in hand jaw dropping lower and lower br br the quality of the filming is beyond low budget it doesn't even look like a freaking movie if i were watching 'home video' footage from a documentary i would expect it br br in summary avoid avoid avoid boooo lion's gate br br completely ashamed of myself for watching 5 minutes and i hope that i've saved others from renting or owning it
<START> kingdom county vermont 1927 noel lord rip torn lives with his indian mate cardinal in the area where a large dam is to be built noel however is not willing to give up on his land and he'll have to fight the dam company in order to prevent the county from any possible destruction br br where the rivers flow north is a gripping contemplative story powered by the memorable performances of rip torn recently seen in the small but juicy role of louis xv in sofia coppola's underrated marie antoinette and cardinal dances with wolves smoke signals director jay craven who also co wrote the script with don based on howard frank novel and cinematographer paul ryan crafted this powerful story with unique contemplative pace visuals which remind me of terrence malick's and john huston's best moments it's an underrated independent period piece of the first electric half of the 90's usually regarded as the rise of quentin tarantino's burlesque pulp fiction is a masterpiece indeed but the man suffers from orson welles' syndrome todd disturbing suburbia danny boyle's dark vision of the uk let's not mention that beach flick with dicaprio though jay craven should be more regarded on the lists of great indie filmmakers as well he's been leading a respectful discreet career and it's always a pleasure to see a constant talent like his br br my vote 8 10
<START> i wouldn't have given this film such a low rating 2 if its average hadn't been ridiculously high but someone had to bring it down to something more reasonable i sat through most of this film watching scene after scene of tagging and shoplifting no dialog just tagging and shoplifting finally the two kissed something happened but then back to tagging and shoplifting i left the screening i recommend this film only to those who are impressed by pretentious film making i disliked the directors previous film a self righteous defense of man boy love but at least that film had a story interesting characters dialog the graffiti artist had only scene after scene of tagging and shoplifting i want more from a film than this
<START> paul mazursky misfires on this film the writing direction casting and acting with the exception of gassman are all off the mark i remember the reviews from 20 years ago being mediocre but i thought it still might be worthwhile to view with notables such as susan sarandon raul julia who overacts in most of his scenes and john cassavetes i understandably expected much more the music picked for the film is jarring the cuts between new york and greece confusing and the overall pace all leave much to be desired why paul mazursky felt the need to update this story or add his touch to it is puzzling this retelling of prospero and his daughter takes very little of import from the play and adds not much more the play is not one of shakespeare's best anyway and to gut it even further seems not to be a good decision unfortunately there is nothing to recommend in this film
<START> this documentary traces the origins and life of the skateboard team using original film shot in the 1970s mostly by craig combined with interviews of the team members and other influential people today br br the first part of the film documents how the dogtown section of venice ca came to be starting back around the turn of the century when the town was created to be a venice italy like european city by the 1970's the one remaining local attraction the pacific ocean park had been abandoned leaving a beach with lots of exposed piers and other hazards the poor kids living in the area had nothing better to do than surf and they excelled despite or perhaps because of their surroundings because the waves dissipated in the afternoon they took up skateboarding to fill their time and the empty swimming pools caused by the drought during those years plus their surfing backgrounds led them to create the vertical skateboarding style that is mainstream today br br i found that the film covered much more about surfing than i expected which seemed like a bonus since i really didn't know much about surfing or skateboarding before i watched the film the soundtrack not surprisingly was good as well i also liked how these kids were just following their passion and generally ended up better off for the experience the parts that didn't work so well for me were the drama that they tried to create which seemed somewhat forced and the team's somewhat sense of self importance although this is probably just left over street attitude from where they grew up this is not to say that they didn't have significant influence but only that it seems extremely likely that there were other factors as well br br one note my wife is more affected than most to nausea when films use what we refer to as wiggling camera movements this film is often guilty so if you are so afflicted be warned br br i would recommend this film to anyone but especially to anyone with skateboarding and or surfing in their history br br seen on 5 11 2002
<START> this is a fact that this is the 1st saudi feature film to be shown in cinema theaters but not in saudi arabia for a simple reason we don't have cinema theaters in our large kingdom not only one cinema theater the government forbidden opening cinema theaters after the islamic extremists or the religious police or both asked for closing it in the late 1970s the early 1980s accusing the 7th art with encouraging wrong sex relationships and stuff like that i don't see a powerful reason why we don't open cinema theaters we have many videos stores throughout the kingdom we watch movies in the tv from some satellite channels we can install the showtime set channels and after all movies in general seems harmless in many ways i know many people how go to neighboring countries only to watch a couple of films i personally went to bahrain several times only to watch films in theaters because watching it there is big fun unlike watching a movie home pay the most expensive cinema ticket in the world we travel to watch movies while the rest of the world have cinema theaters around every town this is one of the problems that we are having br br the movie is produced and presented by filmed entertainment which is a major company belongs to the saudi tycoon prince bin the 8th richest man in the world br br the movie's title is a word means literally how are you but it is also a slang means what's up sometimes used as a slang to say bad about something and sometimes is used as a slang to tell someone politely to mind his business not to interfere in someone else's affairs anyway i think they meant how are you what's up in the same time i could be wrong though br br male actors are from saudi arabia like who is very famous and has some popularity after winning 1st prize in arabian realty show more like american idol he works in some tv programs like the arabian version of cash taxi the other famous actor is sami who is funny and has a very good sense of humor other actors like al al and ali al are less famous and they work on some tv series shows female actresses are non and they did a very good job speaking the saudi accent jordanian actress mais in leading role actress al not that we don't have saudi actresses but are few and not that good br br a saudi critic al who writes for newspaper the most popular newspaper in the kingdom wrote about it saying lets not expect much of the 1st saudi feature film it was born in unusual circumstances therefore we can't judge it under the usual standards like any other film it is a fact that the movie hit a huge financial success in its 1st opening days only in kingdom of bahrain the movie is fresh and is about a saudi family deals interacts with controversial fresh issues inside the saudi society like women driving cars the low shallow thoughts about the arts the of the society by a certain group the differences between being conservative and being an extremist the ideas are good but you feel you are lost in the middle of the movie one of the movie's advantages is the beautiful music score by which was good but sometimes it doesn't match or express what's in the picture al did a great job his performance was the best alongside with mais the biggest loser is the leading actor who came behind the supporting actors al ali al and sami who did a good job within the limits of their roles br br after all al hal even with all of its disadvantages still an ok movie and it is a very good 1st step of and the movie became the speech of people and streets which is a golden goal to make a strong debates inside the saudi society about movies in general until they become aware of the importance of the 7th art and other arts br br ps there is another saudi filmmaker abdullah claims that he directed the 1st saudi movie titled shadows of silence br br i haven't seen the movie yet i hope i've been helpful
<START> i loved this movie when i was younger and i have actually been looking for it again i would love to watch it again the information is all correct but the cover doesn't look like it would match i can't say for sure though from what i remember the movie was about these kids alyssa milano tina etc in a driving class and it also shows the mischief they get into outside the class edie mcclurg was alyssa mother in the movie i remember i really liked it so if anyone knows where i can get a copy preferably dvd of the movie listed above with those stars in it i would love to know thank you
<START> just what the world needed another superficial cookie cutter mary kate and ashley olsen movie this movie gives out horrible messages to girls everywhere complete with stereotypical junior high experience they make learning anything at all seem completely taboo i can't stand the fake french accents or those guys on the mopeds racing around who eventually fall for the twins why am i putting everything in parenthesis because its all stereotyped the twins even complain about not having a stereotypical grandfather they should be happy they even have a grandfather at all how does this fit the mary kate ashley mold this one has them fixing up a single guy who gasp isn't their father yes folks they actually have a mother who appears for all of five seconds i haven't even sat through thirty minutes of this and i can already tell how it will end up this movie is so pitiful it makes miss usa seem like an academic bowl really
<START> this is one of those movies that i watch every time it's on not because i like it but because it's so bad i can't take my eyes off it like battlefield earth or 3000 miles to graceland the first time i watched i kept waiting and waiting and waiting to laugh and didn't get my chance until about 3 4 of the way through the movie when they strip the harassing cops to their undies and handcuff them in the park in a unflattering position beyond that the jokes aren't funny the characters aren't funny their mishaps and missteps aren't funny add it up it's not a very funny movie not even at a slapstick level and what's with the reggae soundtrack it's a movie about two white garbagemen and the music is all reggae seems out of place don't it if you like a good trainwreck this is for you if you like a good comedy look elsewhere
<START> fascinating look behind the scenes about how a really good movie can get made if the producers director cast simply refuse to quit these guys encountered serious obstacles throughout the two years of the project miniscule budget trouble with the script and with the script writer so the finished product wasn't what was first envisioned but probably turned out to be more interesting than the movie they set out to make which goes to show that the punk mentality of just do it with or without any backing money or help figure it out on the fly and do what you want to do i really liked this documentary movie and know that viewers will see and learn things they didn't know before this movie is truly one of a kind it's hard to classify because it has pieces of sci fi and suspense and also how to make a movie it tells the truth about how films get made what can go wrong and how to overcome i especially liked the music written by ed these guys know how to produce a good movie on a shoe string because they're creative and know how to build props dollys staging lighting with what they can up pretty amazing stuff
<START> my website org lists michael as one of the worst films of the modern era the following is an excerpt br br everyone slums some time in their lives this was travolta's turn i still don't know what the point of this terrible film was nora has proved to be a competent writer and director so what the hell happened here the archangel michael takes a new spin here and is portrayed as a ham fisted chain smoking sugar addicted fornicating slob whose biggest contribution to humanity after sending lucifer to hell was that he invented standing in line yes how funny and charming i don't find this offensive i find it stupid in its defense i can say that the ending was ever bit unsatisfying as the rest of this painful attempt at story telling
<START> ok i'm italian but there aren't so many italian film like this i think that the plot is very good for 3 4 of the film but the final is too simple too predictable but it's the only little mistake the consequences of love in my opinion have great sequences in particular at the beginning and great soundtrack i'd like very much the lighting work on it the best thing on it is a great great actor you know if your name were al pacino now everybody would have still been talking about this performance but it's only a great theater italian actor called toni yes someone tell me this film and this kind of performance it's too slow it's so boring so many silences but i think that this components its fantastic its the right way for describing the love story between a very talented young girl the grand daughter of the italian actress anna magnani olivia and the old mysterious man toni one of my favorite italian films
<START> i have enjoyed both of the van dykes over the years and was glad to watch them again br br just as cute and funny and easy to watch and enjoy br br dick was good when he was younger but i enjoyed him more as he got older br br son berry has been a great one to follow in his fathers footsteps br br together they make a great team and work well together br br i am disappointed that i have not found another murder 101 listed anywhere br br i have seen both of the ones that have been shown i am hoping for more as it is really an enjoyable duo to watch br br you can sure tell berry follows in his dad footsteps they talk alike and have the same mannerisms br br would enjoy anything they do separately br br will be sure to watch anything they do alone and together
<START> leslie excellent book on the tells the whole story of the fleischer's big move of their entire animation unit to florida and their subsequent ejection by paramount br br mr bug goes to town didn't destroy the animation credit with paramount although it's often told that way and this was paramount's favorite version of the story according to the big studio more than anything wanted to get their mitts on the animation studio and ease the famously bickering brothers out of the picture altogether mr bug provided them the pretext to do just that the sad closing of a great quirky innovative chapter in american animation br br i wanted to comment also that the film actually debuted december 4 1941 not december 7 that may have been close enough to do the trick anyway in terms of national mood damaging the film's success but another part of the legend of this troubled little film is that it was killed by having the bad luck to be in the theaters at the same time dumbo released october 23 1941 was still doing very brisk holiday business i haven't done the research into box office numbers but i'd say that concurrent presence in theaters likely had an impact on mr bug movie going was at an all time high at this period and successful films could go strong in theaters for months something unimaginable in these typically short run quick to dvd days
