<START> before i begin let me get something off my chest i'm a huge fan of john first film project the film a b grade cross of both the terminator die hard may not be the work of a cinematic genius but is a hugely entertaining action film that became a cult hit spawned two sequels a spin off br br judge and jury begins with joseph meeker a convicted killer who was sent to death row following his capture after the so called bloody shootout which seems like a poor name for a killing spree Â meeker kills three people while trying to rob a convenience store being led to the electric chair there is an amusing scene where meeker talks to the priest about living for sex but meeting his one true love who was killed during the shootout expressing his revenge for the person who killed her Â michael silvano a washed up football star who spends his days watching his son alex practicing football with his high school team and ends up harassing his son's coach but once executed meeker returns as a or as kelly calls a hamburger without the fries whose sole aim is to get his revenge which basically means making life a misery br br let me point out the fact that judge and jury is not a true horror film it is a supernatural action film with meeker chasing silvano using his ability to change form which amounts to david keith dressing up as everything from an elvis impersonator a french chef with an accent as bad as his moustache a drag queen a clown a stand up comedian a shotgun which fires explosive rounds an invulnerability to death although that doesn't stop martin kove from shooting keith with a desert eagle to pay silvano back for killing meeker's wife br br director john does not seem interested in characterisations instead focusing solely on action scenes which the film has plenty of but that is the film's main flaw since there's nothing to connect the action scenes together the acting is surprisingly good with keith delivering the best performance supported ably by kove as well as paul koslo who plays the washed up cop quite well kelly is annoying as the cabbie who tries to help but makes the situation worse
<START> jason lee does well to give this doggy movie fleeting promise but it's not enough to distinguish it from any other bland family comedy br br this live action cg enhanced adventure sees a shamed police dog jason lee transformed into a super dog via an accident in the lab of scheming scientist dr simon peter underdog sets about saving the city while attempting to keep his identity secret a challenge given that he can both talk and fly br br the odd gag raises a smile but human sidekicks james belushi and alex as father and son are as dull as the predictable storyline one for kids too young to have seen superman or spider man or even shaggy
<START> are we allowed to interfere with our everyday's life is it possible to intrude upon their intimacy to penetrate the of their thoughts violating the privacy of their own home without being blamed the director raises some doubts about these apparently questions almost sympathetic towards judge jean decision of coming to terms with his own inducted self seclusion by means of fragments of lives embezzled by him br br trois rouge is based on the concept of universal communication conceived as the human desire of an open window on the world the phone may be considered the main character of the story after its performance in 9 it gives in the beginning the encore to kieslowski's onlookers followed step by step in its fast run across the world the director looks deeply into the faculty of communication of human beings without taking up a definite position about the ethical side of individual behavior once again he points out to us the unpredictability of future events venting careful descriptions about strange courses and of life separated from each other by a considerable number of years inexplicable combinations oddly converging in a series of continuous and upsetting situations some books falling to the pavement one of them opening casually on a fatal page the destiny of a future profession as in a past similar occurrence glimpses of daily life meeting fleetingly ideally joined by their fondness for the fictitious musician van den human fortunes marked by the most ill fated coincidence br br in this piece of work deserving to be seen with our heart's eyes instead of our mind's ones we can witness a dialectic game between judge jean jean louis trintignant and valentine irene jacob maybe the sweetest actress of our times together with the beautiful winona ryder in a generational conflict between the experience of a world weary old man and the self conscious immaturity of a nice girl on the point of facing the steepest path of her ascending way kieslowski talks about dialogue tests between a disappointed human life and a youth unaware of her future between a spiritless misanthropist and a spontaneous girl full of good sense of unselfishness br br and the final parade when the damp odor of tragedy still lingers in the air with all the main characters of the whole trilogy in full evidence saved by an accidental stroke of luck thank to the script cleverly written gives us the extreme greetings of this movie master fully used up by his great passion for cinema only a sense of bitter regret and emptiness is left to remind us the existence of a void impossible to fill good bye we miss you so much
<START> the first season told pretty much how all elements of the marine corps would operate i e ground air helicopters and jets as a team that's the season i give the high rating to true there are still a lot of liberties taken in season 1 but the stories were more believable br br the subsequent seasons were a gawd awful attempt of melrose place meets top gun br br i was a marine stationed at at the time and i remember them shooting the show around the san diego area i got to talk to rod rowland and james brolin br br rowland's character was good to go br br brolin's character was good in the first season only for some reason he slacked off after the first ep of the second season br br if you want to see a little of how the marine air ground team operates then season one is the one to watch br br if you're into melrose place and soap opera like plots with an attempt to merge them into top gun then see the last two seasons
<START> every now and then some amateur will come out with a tired piece of action film making this one is just so wrong i don't think i even need to comment about the plot acting script camera work because it have none if putting a muscle guy in cool leather jacket walking in slow mo and throw in a funky rap song is the main ingredient of making a great action movie then sayonara action movie
<START> i've seen several stage and film adaptations of alice in wonderland and this one has to take the cake as the absolute worst my family bought the dvd unsuspectingly and couldn't even make it through the first half i later went back and forced myself to watch the whole thing it had been a christmas gift to me and was just appalled br br the only redeeming factor and it's hardly redeeming enough to save the whole show is mark lin baker playing the mock turtle with a yiddish accent it's one of the few moments in the piece that has some real charm and can be taken somewhat seriously other than that the songs are half songs the melodies are half melodies and even meryl streep cannot make this direction look good
<START> let's summarize how dumb this movie is with two details arnold to antichrist let's see who is meanest said with a straight face and you can tell they were not trying to be funny br br how do you think arnold will battle the evil of all evils br br blessed water a crucifix a priest nooo with a bazooka yes not even satan expected it they're so clever br br after an engaging beginning which reminds you of devil's advocate it goes nowhere somebody get me those two hours of my life back don't ever watch it rent it lest buy it br br
<START> like so many other reviewers on here my memories of this show are universally warm in fact so fond are said cherished memories that i recently purchased the dvd box set in order to revisit that happy and carefree period of childhood whereby i used to sit utterly mesmerised as i watched the ongoing quest of monkey sandy and later yu lung a horse dragon man you'll really need to watch it to understand when the much loved show initially aired on bbc 2 on friday evenings as i recall br br well i'm pleased to say that even after all these years and now viewing this with adult i e more cynical eyes the show has lost none of its inimitable charm br br simply wonderful entertainment from the magical characters and their comical interactions with one another to the perhaps not so special effects which actually serve to heighten the fun and of course not forgetting the hugely memorable opening title sequence from the first season the passing of time has not in any way shape or form diminished any of monkey's spellbinding charm br br as monkey himself would probably say you there go out and grab yourself some nostalgic fun '
<START> hitchcock once gave an interview where he said he like to direct screenplays that had an ordinary person minding their own business who's accidentally caught up in an awful chain of events that they can't get out of until the dastardly plot that's behind their troubles is resolved that way the audience can feel more sympathy for the hero we certainly do in this fine film barry kane is only trying to help his fellow man out by performing acts of kindness and consideration like helping fry pick up the letters he dropped at the factory barry even returns a lost 100 bill to fry later on that was big money in 1943 it's barry's acts of christian kindness that get him into trouble and soon he's wrongly accused of sabotage and murder and will likely hang if he can't clear himself similar to the 39 steps in plot the hero travels cross country where he discovers plans for further acts of terrorism by cells an arch villain who nobody could believe to be a closet nazi and a beautiful blonde patricia martin who first suspects and hates then eventually falls in love with barry kane hitch's trademark touches of humor are here too patricia is a billboard model who's various roadside ads are a help and comfort to barry as he hitches a ride with the bad guys all the way from las vegas to nyc we meet a trucker who's a one man comedy act someone convinced my wife it was stylish to eat three meals a day field employees of the fascist spy ring about being forgotten or ignored by the suits just as if they were working for some legit enterprise during a chase scene into a cinema audience members laugh at the action of a schlocky comedy gangster flick as the saboteur cell shoots it out for real with the good guys and kills a guffawing movie patron awful for the dead old man but funny hitch liked to use famous monuments in his movies and this is the best instance with the statue of liberty as backdrop and ironic icon it works even better than the mt rushmore scene in
<START> the preposterous premise of this flick has to do with argentina reclaiming the falkland islands having failed through force in 1982 by impregnating the european women inhabitants with argentinean sperm thereby diluting the ethnic purity until it favored argentina yeah right the reconnaissance is done by our hero villan and cad fabian who his fish eye camcorder from pillar to post secretly filming his encounters with the including his courting and eventual conquest of one woman camilla an unfortunate indie and fraudulent documentary this flick favors us with lots of boring tourism shot from the hip yada yada yada the film has no plot potential and only begins to become interesting as fabian and camilla their way through the usual moments of awkwardness and uncertainty as they get from the handshake to the bed f is only for those cinema purists who can appreciate the bleak no frills austerity of dogme indies
<START> i found myself getting increasingly angry as this movie progressed br br basically dr crawford dennis hopper has predicted a meteor will hit the earth the powers that be don't believe him so he sets about building a survival shelter inside a mountain for a small collection of people br br jake lowe peter onorati is a down on his luck reporter for a trashy tabloid who gets a tip from a friend he thought was dead that something is going on in the mountains he sets out to investigate br br while trying to get into the secret survival shelter jake spends a great deal of time shooting people to death or beating them to within an inch of their lives he spends the rest of his time bitching at dr crawford about who gave the doc the right to decide which people should get to survive the meteor br br i found myself wishing jake would do the future a big favor and turn a gun on himself br br don't waste your time on this turkey
<START> well the movie was no terrible but whomever created the screen play did not do a good job of even creating the essence of unger this movie was slightly below average and did not tell the story correctly on one of the most interesting persons ever born i suggest reading the book one of a kind the real unger story they left out huge parts of his life they also at times did not understand the real that he was the actual facts of his life were at times out of order and in the end they really did not portray the actual personality that he did have so please don't watch the movie read the book by the way i'm not just some prick who feels you have to stay 100 to the real story but they did not even come close
<START> hollywood cavalcade is a mildly entertaining 1939 film starring two staples of the 20th century fox roster don ameche and alice faye and containing a couple of in jokes br br the film concerns a max sennett type michael connors ameche who brings an actress to hollywood molly adair faye and makes her a big silent comedienne eventually moving her into more dramatic roles he becomes extremely successful with her as his star obsessed with his work he's absolutely shocked when she and her leading man alan curtis run off and get married he's so shocked he dumps her she and her husband go off and continue to be more and more popular while connors' studio starts losing money at an alarming rate before you know it he's through molly wants to help and asks that connors direct her next film br br there's lots of keystone kop type footage which is quite funny and some fantastic slapstick by buster keaton who is wonderful the film also has a scene from the jazz singer when the talkies take over the in joke of course has to do with rin tin tin for whom zanuck used to write in one scene trainer brings him in as a potential contract player for connors' studio connors throws both of them out of his office a few scenes later rin tin tin is shown to be 1 box office the role of the famous german shepherd in this film is played by rin tin tin jr daddy having passed away in jean harlow's arms in 1932 one month shy of his 14th birthday fortune smiled on him even at the end br br alice faye is very pretty and does a fine job as does ameche who turns in an energetic performance j edward and stuart erwin provide very good support br br unfortunately this film isn't quite sure what it is history comedy romance or drama however hollywood cavalcade is still quite watchable
<START> this film powerfully demonstrates the struggle of two women in love in a culture so deeply entrenched in ritual and tradition all this against a backdrop of an india which itself is struggling for freedom from these same values this film is both political and personal and never too preachy or idealistic on either front it is easy to see why fire has caused riots in india but tragic nonetheless a true film such as this one deserves to be seen by all people of the world not just privileged westerners
<START> this movie was beautiful and touching it touched a place deep inside me and i'm not sure why i am a happily married woman and i've never had lesbian tendencies but my this movie almost made it something i crave the choreography the storyline the dialog the movie was a work of art br br the synopsis without spoilers is that a woman gymnast unsatisfied with her life and looking for something anything she is with a man who does not want a baby but she does he's not mean to her but he doesn't treat her the way a woman should be treated either i guess he doesn't really appreciate her all these years she has stayed in shape and decides to go back to the gym she meets another woman during her acrobatic training and an intimate and beautiful relationship unfolds throughout the movie she has another woman friend that she trained with in her younger years and they have stayed close friends br br the relationship that unfolds is i don't know quite the word but very understanding comfortable intimate but sexy something that could only exist between two women the kind of relationship that could really bring meaning back into your life someone that makes you feel special exciting beautiful confused even br br the relationship with her close friend is beautiful in an equally different way they have a close and intimate relationship her friend showed me what a true friend really is someone who is understanding easy going real fun to be with someone who is there for you no matter what someone who is supportive and you can huddle with and tell your deepest secrets someone who shares your past but does not share your secrets br br the story is simple in the fact that it was not overdone but not underdone in any way it leaves a lot of sensual imagery to capture it's moments the dancing and choreography was stunning i could watch it over and over the way the artist captured the main character's feelings and emotions was the dancing and the imagery was very dazzling and mesmerizing to watch what a cozy a wonderful story i fell in love with this movie if you have a chance rent this and watch it
