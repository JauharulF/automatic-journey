<START> the plot of open graves is very simple it's about a board game called where the players die in real life the same way they die in the game laughable death scenes include killings via computer generated crabs and snakes the characters are cardboard and deliberately annoying and there isn't even a tiny bit of suspense i liked eliza dushku in wrong turn but she is completely wasted and unmemorable here the climax with cgi witch coming from the sea is utterly laughable and stupid the only reason to see open graves are some interesting camera angles plus sexy eliza dushku if such movies are the future of horror then i seriously give up give me any 70's or 80's low budget horror flick over this modern piece of crap a generous 3 out of 10
<START> subspecies like many other horror films gets a raw deal on imdb the majority of movie watchers have a hearty contempt for horror and when they occasionally rent horror films they either want to laugh at them or cringe at excessively gory scenes unfortunately subspecies is not particularly laughable and not that bloody so it gets a low rating that's too bad br br of course there's plenty to criticize here the non actors are flat the subspecies are a poor special effect and the nighttime scenes are too brightly lit but what do you expect for a straight to video horror film subspecies boasts decent production values and more integrity than you might anticipate the film's romanian setting is virtually unique i believe it was the first american movie made in that country post communism and the locations both interior and exterior are beautiful the script has moments of intelligence especially when it delves into local folklore all bogus i'm sure somehow the location filming and script work well together subspecies has its own very distinctive world to risk damning with faint praise it could be a lot dumber br br fans of the more gruesome aspects of horror will no doubt get a kick out of the blood drooling vampire villain he's pretty effective in this movie powerful with a memorable raspy voice but i like him better in the sequels when actor anders gives a more self parodying campy performance a totally sincere is somewhat silly other silly aspects include gratuitous nudity and the subspecies themselves who are clearly only in the movie because producer charles band has a fetish for evil little creatures see also puppetmaster and demonic toys br br but i linger too much on the movie's flaws for what it is straight to video vampire horror subspecies is perfectly fine the sequels boast better production values more violence and somewhat more thoughtful story lines so i recommend them even more highly still this isn't a bad start for the series
<START> how do you make a totally unappealing movie out of a story by one of america's most famous authors watch this film and find out maybe i am author carson mccullers but i was impressed by the heart is a lonely hunter and was hoping for something memorable here too forget it br br vanessa redgrave looks like a man with her short haircut and clothing i never found her much to get excited about in almost any movie anyway rod steiger as a preacher how insulting is that unlikable characters one after the other well maybe that's the book too and i am being unfair to this film i am not familiar with the story other than what i saw on screen and this was so unappealing a movie that i could never recommend it to anyone br br it's just one backwards person after another in a backward town outside of some nice cinematography here and there there is nothing to recommend how anyone could sit through 100 minutes of this is amazing br br i didn't even go into how bad this is directed there is good news this was the only film simon directed
<START> in the groovy mid 70's a scruffy bunch of brash young venice california adolescents from broken homes and the bad side of town known as the z boys turned the previously staid world of professional skateboarding on its ear with their fierce punk attitude radical unconventional riding style and unbridled spirit of pure in your face aggression the sport in the process and paving the way for the many extreme variations on sports that popped up in their influential wake director stacy peralta who's one of the legendary z boys himself relates the incredible exploits of this amazing ragtag crew in a ferociously punchy and visceral manner that's both informative and wildly entertaining the snappy rapid fire editing ceaseless speedy pace and raw gritty photography deliver one hell of an infectiously kinetic buzz projecting a sense of sheer joy and full on bustling energy that's a total pleasure to behold better still this documentary neither sanitizes nor its subjects these lads were so fiercely competitive and out for themselves that they all went their separate ways when the lure of fame and fortune manifested in their lives the ultimate fates of certain guys is poignant and heartbreaking with gifted and spontaneous ace skateboard rat jay adams rating as the saddest and most tragic he blew his chance at the big time and wound up doing time in jail the other dudes are very colorful and personable as well charismatic ball of cocky and defiant fire tony in particular comes across as one arrogant yet impressive piece of furiously assertive work marvelously narrated with delightfully nasal nonchalance by sean penn the terrific rock soundtrack likewise seriously smokes but what really makes this documentary such a winner is its refreshing complete dearth of pretense it's every bit as dynamic exuberant and larger than life extraordinary as the gloriously outrageous z boys themselves
<START> it's out of question that the real anna anderson was not princess anastasia apart from very distinctive differences in physical appearance anderson's eyes are larger lips thicker nose larger and turned up at the end etc anderson's unable to speak russian was a ridiculous tell that's why i detest anna anderson and her confederates so much not a lot of swindlers have the audacity and endurance to scam for 60 years with such a blatantly untenable scheme br br yet to some extent i have sympathy for anna anderson life must have been hard for a young polish peasant worker in those days and to impersonate another woman for 60 years is an arduous task for anybody she had to hold back her fleshy lips all the time to mimic the thin lips of and had to occasionally go lunatic to make people believe all her chaotic memory was just a result of mental problem br br anna anderson was an awesome woman on a wrong track had she put her good looks learned elegance endurance acting skills into proper use she could of made a first class actress br br on a side note some main characters of this two parter seem to be loosely based on real figures prince erich could be a mixture of botkin believed by many the most possible brain behind the whole scheme duke george and of and several other figures and seem to be based on the gorgeous princess but unlike the real confederates prince erich was motiveless in this show and supported anna out of love for and sincere belief in her which is touching br br on the whole this is a great show fictionalised a bit but still remains faithful to the reality the power of amy irving's acting lies in that she successfully represented anderson's self assuredness the mixture of impersonating others and being herself is intriguing just as princess said about anderson she was herself at all times and never gave the slightest impression of acting a part highly recommended
<START> there are actually some good reasons why a person should take the risk of going totally insane by watching this show the breasts are nice even though some of them aren't that real but they usually come in pairs which is good watching the beach on your screen is also a very relaxing experience as it is an ideal place for just taking it easy and not worrying too much about getting eaten by a rubber shark it's always good to remember that david hasselhoff is a god not the god but a god it's not so much about his acting skills since there are none but his does a lot of talking also there's no kitt hanging out in this series which is good since mr hasselhoff told in an interview that he always thought kitt was gay naturally that might make him to look like an idiot but considering the other statements he has made lately it shouldn't be surprising to anyone br br in a nutshell this is the kind of show that is totally harmless to people it gives us a lot to stare at and a lot to laugh at which is something many intentionally humoristic shows really don't give us i have to say it's no wonder that borat fell in love with pamela anderson i enjoy watching the show no it's not a great show actually it's quite horrible but i enjoy watching it it's basically like a b movie stretched to last for a decade
<START> for his last film john huston directed his daughter anjelica in this adaptation of the story from james joyce's dubliners and he gave us one of his finest achievements to remember him by br br joyce is about as impossible to film as anyone but the dead at least presents a traditional narrative to work with much indeed almost all of the important information in the story lies in the spaces between the lines in characters' thoughts and expressions there are big moments but they're cerebral they're not the stuff of which movies are made but somehow huston gets it right and he manages a nearly flawless adaptation br br anjelica is magnificent and the movie is haunting and powerful br br grade a
<START> this was a very good show i enjoyed the construction of real time and flashback seeing the old diggers meeting again and recalling the terrors of their captivity in pow camp the main problem with the way the show was written is that the scenes of life in are more like a holiday camp than what the place must have been like i am old enough to remember film footage of the men being liberated from and other japanese pow camps no actor could lose enough weight to have a resemblance of the state of those men they made the jews of look like sumo wrestlers i have met several veterans from over the years many would never ride in a japanese car let alone own one the physical and mental torture those men endured was too horrific for them to even talk about what percentage survived john doyle might be ok writing comedy for roy and hg i hate that too but this is a serious sugar coating of history that should never have been tolerated i'm happy for to write the life of brian and make fun of the crucifixion because it is obviously comedy even if some consider it to be in bad taste is written as a portrayal of a real event and as such might be regarded by younger people as a true record great performances by a fine cast cannot redeem this lightweight screenplay
<START> if this awful film moved at a snails pace it would at least be moving watching grass grow would be more interesting it was painful to sit through and i only stayed in the theatre to see how all the cruel teens would die where is brian depalma
<START> boasting the title for the sickest film ever made pink flamingos is an undisputed classic sure the camerawork is shaky and off center the story is muddled and slow paced and every single character in the movie is repugnant and despicable but pink flamingos has a certain playful charm and brilliant satiric wit that no other movie can match br br while this film is indeed an offensive one reading descriptions of what goes on in the movie is much worse than actually seeing it only john waters can succeed in making rape murder sadism cannibalism coprophagia and just about every other form of human debauchery known to man seem absolutely hilarious this movie must be seen to be believed
<START> this film is a classic seventies cop flick that for some reason has been sadly overlooked it is basically french connection meets bullit br br roy scheider plays the head of an elite group of detectives known as the seven ups br br one of their men is discovered during an undercover op and is killed br br scheider and his team must find his killers they become involved in a battle with the mob br br the highlight of the film has to be the car chase obviously included to cash in on the success of bullit however this car chase outshines bullitt due to its length speed and sheer excitement it's a breathtaking roller coaster ride that ends rather unexpectedly and spectacularly don't miss this little gem
<START> there's nothing particularly unique or interesting about this run of the mill low budget sci fi flick regardless of its origin the film is loosely based on a novel by leo tolstoy the plot and overall themes of this film are in no way remarkable or original the science is weak at best and unfortunately the film fails to even involve compelling action sequences br br the plot begins with a manned space flight to mars and though the main plot doesn't really get rolling until the ship lands most of the most interesting scenes occur en route unfortunately as soon as our interplanetary travelers touch down their previously interesting interpersonal relationships speculations about and the meaning of life and everything interesting about the film all give way to an only remotely coherent plot concerning martian revolutionaries environmental problems and not very convincing webs of deceit br br there is nothing very remarkable about the production quality of the film either it's passable and most of the acting is though slow ok cameron mitchell is actually pretty good and plays a likable character i guess the best quality of this film from my perspective is its fashion sense the martians have very nice outfits if this film had a point it might have been much more interesting oh well
<START> although this small film kind of got lost in the wake of on the waterfront edge of the city can certainly hold its own with that star studded classic it's another story about the docks and the code of silence that rules it br br next to the corrupt union that lee j cobb ran in on the waterfront jack warden is really small time corruption but he's real enough as the gang boss on one of the docks who intimidates the other workers by being handy with his fists and the hook and he gets the rest to part of their hard earned money and it's all hard earned money in that job br br one guy warden can't intimidate is sidney poitier another gang boss and when he tries to intimidate newcomer john cassavetes poitier takes him under his wing the two develop quite the friendship and poitier and his wife ruby dee even fix cassavetes up with kathleen maguire br br warden is truly one loathsome creature and it's sad how by sheer force of personality and physical prowess he cows almost everyone else into submission in that sense he's tougher than lee j cobb who did have to rely on an impression collection of goons to enforce his will in on the waterfront br br edge of the city marked the big screen directorial debut of martin ritt who did a great job with a good cast of new york based players and spot on location cinematography the film's low budget does show but you're so impressed with the ensemble cast you don't really care br br cassavetes as the loner with a past and the hip and tough poitier are both fine but my personal favorite in this film is ruby dee she should have gotten some award for her performance her final scene with cassavetes is outstanding br br catch this one if ever possible i wish it were out on dvd or vhs
<START> i saw this film a week ago and i had to persuade my friend to come with me because this film seems to be getting such bad reviews sure it is no traffic' or 'lock stock ' but is by no means a flop i think the fact that there are so many big budget films out at the moment means it has been ignored but it shouldn't be i reckon it sets out to do what it wants to do entertain us for an hour and a half and leave us feeling happy and contented i would much rather go and see it that 'the which looks boring and no i'm not a teenager don't listen to the critics star wars fans didn't this film is well worth seeing if just to see the gorgeous luke de lacey and rupert penry jones go see it
<START> leslie nielsen hits rock bottom with this absolutely horrible comedy that is the worst mainstream film that i have ever seen there is nothing to like about this film as it is essentially a one joke film and the joke isn't all that funny how many times are we supposed to laugh at an almost blind man making a fool out of himself that's not funny that's just pitiful nielsen seriously needs to start refusing some of these pathetic scripts and stanley tong needs to stick to making jackie chan films because it doesn't get much worse than this
