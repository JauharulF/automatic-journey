<START> i just finished watching this horribly depressing drama and realized that in light of recent dramas such as these the only ones who could be considered abnormal are those who are least aware that life is nothing more than tragic i would suggest how nauseatingly defeatist and counter productive this conclusion is even if relationships and outlooks like those presented in this movie are grounded in fact to some degree but instead i realized that these films have made the very determination of the great tragedy trivial when the same boring situations the same suffocating dysfunctional families and friendships continue to play out just have they been over and over again in some sort of attempt to knock out previous distortions of family life much of it existing in the 1950s and earlier with personality and character aberrations being made ever so subtle supplanting it instead with the reality of how things actually are that in fact what we are watching is no longer the dysfunctional but in fact a normal existence and set of circumstances that has actually existed all along but of which we may have been previously been unaware and thus have ignored or at least denied br br only problem is that too many films have been trying to make this point and by doing so in nearly identical form when i had read the synopsis for the film i immediately thought of 'ice storm ' while watching the depressing of the travis family which seemed to endure repeated emotional berating i immediately recalled 'american beauty ' and in some regards the interactions between the parents and the middle child tim i drew similarities from goes down ' heroes' may be a novel experience maybe a refreshing one deemed so for an honest portrayal of character that as said before is often not permitted to exist in the films of family which is idiotic to think anyways considering we were already seeing these kinds of relationships displayed in films like 'ordinary people' as early as 1980 and which go back even further than that but to the well versed viewer these films may offer nothing new they have in fact become a rather tired testimony of too many filmmakers who may try to out do the other with the amount of trauma and apathy they can pack into one family and here it extends to neighbors and friends in fact heroes ' the latest in this genre i do think there have been enough films to accurately declare it a 'genre' crams so many disasters and surprises into one family that they would make prize finds for a daytime talk show host it is the story of a family who is tested by the suicide of the eldest son a talented and decorated swimmer who hated the sport with a passion the youngest son knew this the father was in a daze and blinded by the push for competitiveness in his all star son and it's not clear that the mother and sister had much of a relationship with the young man br br granted it is no less entertaining to some extent for those who find this material exhaustively depressing after a while and the performances are quite good especially by sigourney weaver and jeff daniels but i sure hope that filmmakers in the future wishing to add to the commentary of struggling familial relationships which coincidentally or not always seem to be upper middle class white suburban families intend to offer something new by way of material and insight i should see no distinction and consequently no purpose otherwise
<START> this one started excellently the photography and audio are the best i've experienced in years okay months especially the use of and colours in single sequences is astonishing also making jennifer lopez whisper most of her lines is an idea in itself but i'm not sure what singh wants to accomplish with that br br now for the minuses the screenplay was awful lopez's part turned out to be irrelevant or totally worthless to the plot she seemed to star the movie only to sell herself and the pic the three beds seemed just too obvious the of the child carl was a psychologically too underlined way to embark the motive which carl under and so on br br anyway the movie had great way of showing where singh comes from why is it that the most talented directors seem to emerge from india nowadays
<START> nana patekar once again proves that he is the best actor working in bombay without a doubt his recent movies involved shouting his lines that does not bode well for the theater trained thespian one wonders why he is always not given his accolades during awards season br br shakti the power was one of his flicks that was an utter along with a missed to create screen magic with amitabh bachchan br br but patekar exudes a cool calm in this film playing a cop on a sort of social justice journey ridding the streets of bombay of underworld dons in fake encounters character takes control of the screen and the viewers attention and never lets go the editing is tightly paced and there are no annoying songs to distract from the story br br along the same lines as the modern day cult classic company the movie is well acted directed and should have a long shelf life on dvd br br the final ten minutes that see nana and the main villain talk at his offshore haven are bound to be part of hindi cinema classics won't be dissapointed with this cops and robbers flick
<START> this film by director of children of nature is powerful it has great music by and good acting it shows how sad insanity as a disease can be there are many good jokes but the humor is dark if that is not a problem then you should see this film note though this is not a comedy but a drama
<START> no really im not kidding around here folks and i so cant believe how many people here have given it really really positive reviews oh wait its the imdb comments section silly me its interesting to note that at this date there have not been enough votes to give this film a rating out of ten yet there are dozens of comments that rave about the film what does this mean i wonder anyway the script is terrible character change their personality and motivation and actions every scene in order to keep the movie running along at something that vaguely resembled a pace it wasnt even dumb behaviour that was there too but the pure idiocy of the script transcended any dumbness the characters displayed for instance karl is disobeying an order because there are two dead bodies in the desert and the killer is out here somewhere so he forces everyone to travel in order to find the killer disobeying orders and p everyone off when the hero spots something nasty in the darkness and warns karl karl tells our hero to stop being an idiot and that there's nothing out there so they are all going home next scene he is refusing to let it go and must hunt down whatever it is it is just a joke yes the monster is very impressive but the crap that the humans say about it just tries to cancel out its interesting aspects and the predator and alien rip off moments were very tedious and the ending the ending jesus the worst film i saw the year and i saw bug buster
<START> i saw le on the 2005 rotterdam filmfestival it was the first of ten films i saw there br br le has left the most powerful impression of the ten films from the first shot you know the movie is going to be something special the beautiful cinematography left me in awe of what can be done with a camera the music is also on par with the visuals complementing the colorful and stylish architecture like images br br toni plays the main character in the film he's a tax expert gone wrong who lives in a hotel every week he brings a suitcase with money to a bank and the story plays around this br br he is always very controlled and shows almost no emotion to anyone looks calculated and well dressed he has a habit of ignoring people who are of no significance to him for example sofia played very nicely by olivia magnani who works as a barmaid in the hotel where he lives although she's been working in the hotel for two years he never greets her even if she does greet him on one day she confronts him with this and the next day he sits at the bar instead of his usual spot at a window from here the story really begins and will unfold in a strong tale of love sacrifice and the mafia br br i won't spoil the rest of the film see this film if you love stylish movies like ones from david lynch the godfather etc don't see this if you're an action buff
<START> whatever you do don't stop watching when you think the movie is over hang around for the first batch of credits or you'll really miss something we saw this movie at the film festival and thought it was the best of the bunch weber is a marvel really not only because of her performance but because she can pull it off so far above the ground at the q a she said there were no wires or effects so everything you see is really her going for it couldn't make it to the festival because she was dancing with madonna she was excellent and my gawd so beautiful i was amazed that the film went over so well with the blue haired lady crowd but there you have it isn't a backwater
<START> sick of the current cinema output particularly american cinema i've been making an effort to see the oscar winning foreign films that's when i came across this gem slow to start it picks up nicely once war is declared basically an old fashioned girl waits for boy to return from war story the performances the cinematography make this so very much more why as the young woman didn't become an international star after this is beyond me though she has remained successful in her own country you take the journey with her young defiant impetuous young girl who through the ravages of war becomes a very sober somber woman who keeps a glimmer of hope her final scene is devastating we love her as much as the camera does and the camera work was this the pioneer in hand held camera work it truly adds an immediacy to the story and the beauty of it like when character is running up stairs and next to a fence i am humbled and grateful to see this film
<START> hadn't really heard too much about this movie so i went and saw it i realized that this movie only appeals to someone who has not lived in the real world and even those people would think this movie moved too slowly br br when the movie opens up you see nicole kidman going to a nudist camp whoa shock that scene the dialouge were all great and then the movie went downhill br br while i respect the vision the filmmaker must have this movie sucked it was too slow too predictable and not moving enough robert downey jr is great as usual but this movie is not good enough to sit through it tries to be shocking and abnormal but makes poor use of the talents of all the actors br br don't waste your money even the sex scenes were boring
<START> all but the youngest americans are probably familiar with the iconic call of from little timmy or whatever the kid's name was wailing his little tow head off for his border collie friend these same americans may or may not be familiar with the fact that lassie made the leap from television to movies or was it the other way around i'm clearly too lazy to do any research here and the painted hills is one of those it is irresistible to make a this movie has gone to the dogs pun so i won't even though i technically just did but in a way it has lassie playing shep man's best friend gets top billing the dog gets top billing now i'm not familiar with how actors or their agents negotiate contracts but here's how it plays out in my mind br br movie mogul okay lassie in the credits it's gonna be and with lassie as shep lassie movie mogul ha ha kid calm down calm down lassie movie mogul okay i think i see co lead billing lassie movie mogul oh god let go of my arm top billing top billing for you now let go of my arm br br so the dog gets top billing and with the rest of this shell shocked cast i suppose it's understandable we get lovable old jonathan the prospector his young whiny and apparently orphaned friend tommy sketchy loser lin taylor and lovable old religious pilot pete the meat of the plot here could be summed up in a few sentences so i'll save you the actual pain of watching the movie jonathan is a prospector with a dog named shep and his partner dies while he is at his claim he gets a new partner named lin who becomes obsessed with the gold and jonathan for some reason gives shep to whiny little crybaby tommy lin kills jonathan shep sees it and lin tries to kill shep then lin tries to kill tommy then tommy whines it gets cold and shep carries out an elaborate plan to get revenge on lin which he or she does the end br br unless you have a deep unsettling need to see a lassie movie even then there's got to be a better lassie movie than this just avoid the painted hills when it's not dragging on marveling at lassie's limited ability to 'act' similar in style perhaps to keanu reeves always the same facial expression only the body moves setting up the obvious using several minutes of film or insulting native americans everywhere with its white actor in ugh how me running bear stereotypes the painted hills is fit only for lassie fetishists or people who have some kind of connection to prospecting through their days as a grizzled old prospector lookin' fer that vein of glittery gold
<START> a man unger is found floating in the sea among the wreckage of his destroyed boat just off the florida coast a helicopter him up only to reveal both of his legs are missing below the knees dr stella dickens valentine and her partner dr bob hogan lawrence are marine of some sort and are conducting research in the sea regarding dolphins while out at sea hogan hears a strange high pitched noise intrigued he and stella hire peter micheal and his assistant sandra iris to create a device to locate and track the source or something like that anyway as it isn't made particularly clear meanwhile a scientist named florinda de as stewart who works at a rival organisation called the 'west ocean is brutally murdered when she threatens to expose someone within the organisation more people are attacked and sheriff gordon gianni as john is on the case peter stella hogan and sandra all set out to sea soon enough they find evidence that something monstrous and very unfriendly may be lurking beneath the surface together with rival scientist professor donald west william berger sheriff gordon and the united states army they set out to destroy the monster but there are other sinister forces at work as someone doesn't want the genetically engineered creature to be exposed at any cost directed by lamberto bava as john old jr this is a far cry from the classic italian horror and splatter films of the 70's and early 80's the script by gianfranco herve and sacchetti is drearily slow and will put most people to sleep well before the 90 odd minute run time has elapsed the monster is barely used large portions of this film are made up of footage of boats and helicopters large chunks of the first half concentrate on the not so mysterious 'who's behind it' part of the story there isn't really any gore to speak of a guy with both his legs bitten off and someone with one arm is about it the special effects on the monster itself are generally poor and it is shown in very quick flashes disappointing the cast of virtual nobody's don't help make this any easier to sit through there really isn't much to recommend this film so i won't don't bother you can do a lot better
<START> first i must point out that the role wendell corey played was exceptional usually corey was relegated to supporting roles but here he is what helps carry this very limp film without him and the character he played the film would have been a lot worse hardly a 2 or 3 br br so why did i hate the rest of the film so much well one of my pet peeves is when characters act too stupid to live you can't base major plot points on the assumption that your major characters are completely stupid unless having a brain injury is part of the plot of course but this is exactly what happens in this film wendell corey is a crazed man who has murdered three innocent people and they know his next target is joseph wife so what do they do yep they provide really inadequate police protection and a plan that makes no sense at all no marksman and guys with shotguns that are so far away they probably won't stop this madman and if this isn't bad enough the marked woman inexplicably runs away from her hiding place and walks right into the worst possible place she could be is anyone that stupid i hate when movies have such dumb characters in fact i found myself rooting for corey since i felt the idiots deserved to die for their behaviors in addition to these clichÃ©d characters there was also a bit player who fainted sure seeing your husband shot might cause someone to faint however in real life this is a rare occurrence people rarely faint unless there is a medical reason so combining this with the above character problems is a real nightmare for people who are looking for realism something film noir movies must have br br all these serious problems are even more infuriating since wendell corey's character is amazingly well written and conceived it was his chance to shine as an actor too bad the rest of the movie was so limp that corey and the basic plot idea are sunk this is one film that could really use a remake but this time without brainless characters
<START> what do you get when you have a tenacious seasoned french police inspector by the name of maurice martineau is called to solve a murder case well simply a very entertaining fun film the re mastered black and white film quai des delivers the goods despite romance jealousy and marriage that seem to just get in the way towards the truth of 'who done it ' br br inch by inch technique by technique as seasoned by experience and intuition the patience of this master inspector etches into the truth but of course with the help of a bag full of dirty police interrogation tricks br br martineau is the centerpiece of this film the use by director henri georges clouzot of raucous background music to intensify the drama in grand film noir style is a wonderful wrapper around the visual experience br br martineau eventually solves the mystery and arrests the culprit hey he is good but alas martineau too can keep a dark secret in his past who is that boy that is perhaps not his son br br some things can never get solved even beyond the closing credits
<START> i just recently watched ed wood jr 's autobiographical movie glen or glenda for the first time after having heard so much about it for so many years nothing i had read or heard about this film could prepare me for what i saw this has to be the most bizarre movie ever made stampeding buffalo women in bondage satan prancing around and bela lugosi rambling only as he can pull the string pull the string it was totally insane the acting was atrocious and the dialog was unintentionally hilarious exactly what one would expect from an ed wood film having said all that as horrible as this movie was i have to give wood credit he was way ahead of his time you have to remember that when this movie was made transvestites were not even discussed in public much less the subject for a movie i have read that wood was a transvestite in real life and i'm sure this movie was based on his own experiences it was sad to see bela lugosi having to say the ridiculous lines he had to say for this film but it was kind of ed wood jr to at least give mr lugosi an acting job at a time in bela's life when he was penniless and a drug addict and no one else in hollywood would hire him if you have never seen this film then you have to see it especially if you are a fan of ed wood jr
<START> having lived in upper peninsula 30 miles from in the mid 1990s i was eager to see this film it begins promisingly enough with some superficial understanding of the values and quirks of u p life but jeff daniels apparently was not content with a low key approach that would have been fitting given the place and the people instead he introduces extremely crude humor and some wildly inappropriate mystical supernatural elements although there is a good movie to be made about this practically unknown region of the u s this is not it
