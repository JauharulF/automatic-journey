<START> conquerer of shows what happens when creators of an anime fail to understand what their fans want i as a fan did not want a 1920's evil nazi movie what i would have liked to see is a real final showdown between ed and dante as we don't really know what became of her i also would have liked to get ed back to his world much sooner and have him stay there to finally get a chance to be normal you know raise a family with a certain blonde mechanic that sort of thing no instead i got a convoluted plot involving nazi mystics fritz lang and about ten minutes of al a joke of a cameo by roy mustang and only one armstrong joke one short joke and no hitting ed with a wrench above all it just didn't feel like alchemist to me
<START> okay i grew up on who but haven't loved a doctor since tom baker christopher eccleston made me love who again and i'll be furious with him forever for leaving br br the writing is grand the acting superb the directing which was dreadful in the old days is just fantastic i was very skeptical about this programme and watched it merely out of being forced but am now a huge fan and love it i have a of a dalek screaming exterminate then br br a few of the things i love about the new programme 1 people actually notice when rose billie piper disappears off the planet some of the old shows an assistant would drop off for a while and then come home like nothing has happened no one noticed 2 chris eccleston's doc loves rose romantic or not will be debated but there is no doubt that 9 loves and cares about his companion he'd destroy the world if he had to to save her which the old show was lacking often a doctor wouldn't care if he never saw his assistants again 3 they talk and think like real people when rose is shown something outlandish or new such as aliens she acts like a real person would gobsmacked i never liked it when an assistant from the old show who never saw anything alien would just fit right in and adapt instantly i want to see the surprise on rose's face when she sees a plastic dummy come to life she gives that to me br br the few things i don't like about this series 1 nearly everything happens on earth london or cardiff and i was sort of hoping for a more off world sort of show 2 that eccleston left so quickly he really made the show brilliant br br but i can let those few things go i far more enjoy the series than i ever expected to so i don't mind if they have stuff set on earth br br just don't take this show seriously it's fun it's smart it's entertaining but it's not a super serious heavy duty show it's pure fun and pure british and i can't get enough watch it with an open mind and just put your brain into neutral and enjoy br br ps don't watch series 2 or later series 1 was brilliant the first few episodes of series 2 were good but don't watch it once it gets to love and monsters utter rubbish completely destroys the show
<START> i would probably not have bothered to comment on this film if i had not been disturbed by the constant references made to it here in north america as a porn film our obsession with what is or should be regarded as pornographic remains a relic of the provided to film makers by the hayes committee many many years ago and it is now really time that we relegate it to the past so far we have not progressed far beyond establishing a somewhat arbitrary division between what we now term 'soft' and porn with both carrying the same pornography label it is time for us all recognise that neither the r rated soft porn release version of this film nor the unrated version hard porn available on dvd were in any way pornographic br br in legal terms pornography is defined by its capacity to deprave or corrupt many classic books such as lady lover fanny hill women in love the story of 'o' or moll flanders have been prosecuted for pornographic content tried by jury and cleared on the basis of this definition but in practice most ordinary citizens are not interested in what they regard as legal and apply a simpler test that is rather too stringent when applied to books or films which are very close to the line but serves to quickly clear most others from any taint of pornography although the hayes code would have rated as unacceptable both for nudity and for its depictions of sexual activities in practice most people today accept that where the basic message of a book or film is clearly designed to encourage the development of long term stable family relationships in which the participants find real fulfillment it cannot be regarded as pornographic this does not mean that works depicting unsatisfactory or unstable relationships should be recognised as pornographic only that these may need a more sophisticated assessment in we have a film about a young female librarian who has had a rather sheltered upbringing and keeps her suitor at arms length because of a feeling that this is what morality requires her to do after he gets too frustrated by this and threatens to leave her she falls asleep and dreams she is transported to a wonderland closely based on that of lewis carrol where everyone she meets is totally uninhibited about their sexual needs she is shocked but is a kind person who takes things as she finds them so before long she finds her own prejudices gradually melting away she wakes up when her boyfriend returns to break off their affair but her attitude to him has changed so completely that their relationship is fully restored and the film ends with them living ever with their children in a home with a white picket fence and a family dog an ending clearly directed to those romantics who remain very young at heart br br pornographic hardly br br suitable viewing for children well probably not quite unless they have very progressive parents br br r rating pg would be more appropriate today br br entertaining for viewers in most age groups yes but the film has its faults these are discussed in many of the comments here on imdb however most commentators clearly appreciated and enjoyed it br br i believe the only pornography associated with this film was the reported claim by an anti pornography activist of scientific proof that a magazine picture of kristin debell was a photographic montage of images of the face of a ten year old with various body parts of adult models these and other comments seriously damaged the career of a very promising young actress but today the film appears to be on its way to becoming a cult classic several home video productions have been released in both vhs and dvd format the last was a dvd containing both the r rated and unrated versions of the film released by subversive cinema in 2007 copies of this were readily available until a few months ago now they are almost exhausted and the mail order vendors who still have copies in stock are selling them at many times their original price a situation which usually quickly results in a new dvd release appearing this continuing interest nearly 35 years after the original film was released points to near classic status br br commentators on this database are expected to provide fellow viewers with useful guidance on whether a film is worth watching or even collecting my comments here were intended to stress the ongoing damage to the industry that still results from pressure on major studios to respect self censorship recommendations originating with the hayes committee on this database such general comments are very quickly marked by readers as 'not and i seldom make them but fortunately i still have space to add that in my opinion this film is quite unusual and is well worth watching or even buying it is flawed but kristine debell gives a great performance and the film provides a fairly unique and rewarding viewing experience overall i would rate it at 7 stars and will be buying a copy of the next dvd edition if and when it appears if ms debell is still alive today i would love to hear her comments both on the attempts to suppress this film and on the late recognition that it has gradually achieved
<START> this is one of the films that killed the spaghetti western it not only loses something in the translation it is a total chaotic mess of editing as well either chunks of it have been edited out and or re edited for an english language version in any case it makes little or no sense period it makes the trinity and the eastwood man with no name films look like john ford john wayne by comparison nothing in this film is original somewhere in there is a beginning a middle and finally an end except for the end not everything is exactly in that order robert wood seems personable enough the rest of the cast especially the women should have made better career choices
<START> i don't know why all the previous comments are approval of this movie it is well not by far but the suckiest movie i've seen lately full of clichÃ©s bad acting actually no very bad acting and has a silly plot if i would have seen it in a cinema i would have walked out after the first 20 minutes i f you hate somebody make him her watch this movie that's how bad it is a girl who has an imaginary boy friend that gives up a relationship with a real one because her imagination is jealous but i think it figures she takes after her parents who also have some mental issues plus the character who is supposed to be i think the laughing stock of it the thing that should make you laugh cal's room mate is a serious nut case and just makes me feel sorry for him and the whole movie
<START> the opening scene makes you feel like you're watching a high school play but i've seen high school plays with better acting every line was delivered so obviously that i felt like i was watching actors work instead of seeing characters i found the character development to be poor and the acting very forced i found that 25 minutes into the movie i really didn't care what happened anymore because the plot was overly obvious and i was bored i kept hanging in there waiting for the film to redeem itself but it never happened sister theresa was overly sweet even for a nun yet appeared impulsive and slightly manipulative all in all i was mighty disappointed
<START> those people who told me this movie is good shame on them this film is for an audience who has no problem to watch everything especially when it's all about tough guys guns chasing heists i 'd compare this movie with the inside man the same loss of time i'm tired of copy and paste movies and i'm discontented but what can i do fans of that types of movies are much more if you want to watch good movie from that type i will recommend to you lucky number slevin i'm not mean i just dislike this movie weak actors weak script weak action probably someone else will like it many people many tastes however for me chaos is tasteless
<START> apart from the da james and a brief appearing woman who is convincingly sympathetic to ellen renee zellweger plight ellen herself is the only convincing character and likable character in the movie she is the one not her dying mother who should be and is the one true thing it's not only in the role in acting but also in the plot itself until the plot turns against itself and makes the mother the one true thing in the eyes of her weak willed shallow husband who can do nothing right for his wife or daughter the daughter perceives what the viewer perceives but such intelligent perceptions must give way to the shallow sentiment of the husband who is blanked out on both the realities of his wife and daughter br br to boot the one powerful scene in this whole movie when ellen confronts her father's cruelty is given the lie at the end ellen is just another young strong woman who must be tamed into conformity by a crybaby father a very flawed movie so flawed as to be called a bore and not worth the time
<START> alien body snatchers in the desert little blue rocks that look like they are made from cheap plastic the overall storyline isn't bad if you like that kind of thing but the acting is so far beyond poor that it amazes me that some of them actually entertained my in the x files and the special effects hello where did they get their fx crew from secondary school i mean come on there was so much more they could have done it was amateur and extremely basic i didn't particularly enjoy it and my dad fell asleep during it and of course our hero falls in love with the leading lady its so typical and highly predictable
<START> i thought this film was quite good and quite entertaining for a film heavy on emotion i agree with what another user wrote about the script being sympathetic to the three main characters i think that this is what what made the film good it didn't villainies either mr or mrs kramer and it was refreshing i think to see two people essentially work the issue out on their own and eventually do the best thing for billy and although it was a little strange i actually liked the music in this film as well for some reason the music seemed appropriate for the journey that the three main characters embarked upon this movie flowed quite well and didn't doodle like some emotionally heavy films tend to do it dealt with a serious situation but didn't take itself too seriously it simply told the story in a straight forward way and it worked quite well
<START> charles bronson has given the viewers lots of great moments on the screen but this movie lacks everything that a thriller action movie should have there are a few action scenes in the movie but they're really crappy and when the action scenes fail does the story save the film not at all is my answer to that the story is even worse than the action scenes it's very straightforward and boring and even though i'm a big movie fan i almost fell asleep several times i don't know how they came up with a failure like this a low budget maybe regardless of that it looked like all the actors had no interest in being in the movie at all when that happens the result is really bad
<START> i like movies but this one is the best i've seen at balancing animal warmth with sexual intelligence anne is electric and the script is amazing especially considering it's supposed to take place on the set of another of movies you don't have to agree with her take on everything to get a lot out of this it made me think a lot about vulnerability and power try to imagine a male director with openness not impossible but a little mind bending the unannounced sexual undercurrents that are always present when humans get together to make anything is held up to bright light here but not a cold light
<START> this is a brilliant lavish czech film from the sverak father and son team all about two czech pilots who flee to england to help the raf in the battle of britain but who also fall out over a woman the beautiful tara fitzgerald features some excellent and incredibly realistic aerial combat scenes Â probably the best ever and much better than pearl harbour or even the film battle of britain and a number of interesting general themes such as love war romance comradeship loss and servitude also the trials and tribulations of moving abroad and learning a foreign language though made easier here with the great stalwart anna massey br br the film has some great little motifs such as the world famous raf bullseye device shown throughout and at one point nicely reflected in the black vinyl record spinning around cutely music is another theme of the film of course plus all of the traditional icons of english life dimpled beer glasses unlike the post war straight glasses used in pearl harbour tea in a nice china tea set in an english country garden though shot in the czech republic the mascot dog a vintage bottle of hp sauce even a darts board br br of course the airfield and surrounding countryside is ridiculously unlike anywhere in the south of england though the aerial sequences make up for this showing and the seven sisters always synonomous with southern england and the battle of britain but best of all is the sensational musical score from ondrej as good as anything from hans zimmer yet all in the tradition of the late excellent ron goodwin who scored the original battle of britain film amongst other classic english war films there's even a nice little cameo role for the Â apparently Â famous czech musician and actor and kevin kline lookalike kaiser who plays on the piano the title theme song dark blue sky excellent br br it's got a few smutty yet funny little freudian devices too such as always showing an inflated condom floating by the ceiling whenever karel the callow but brilliant is stuck at the airfield while his love rival and fellow pilot frantisek ondrej is with susan br br another great english actor in this film charles dance is of course fine as wing commander bentley br br highly recommended and well worth watching hiring Â get the dvd with special features stuff like how they created the dog fights and stuff probably the only film ever to combine subtitles with characters speaking english german french and czech all at once
<START> in halloween three friends seek an ancient cemetery in the suburb for fun and remove a cross from a tomb where jack o was buried many years ago by the farmer arthur kelly the evil creature is unleashed kills the trio and seeks the descendants of the kelly family for revenge br br the cheesy jack o is a combination of a terrible story with awful acting i was curious with the name of john carradine in the credits and i can not imagine how a relative authorizes the use of archive footage in such a bad movie showing a total lack of respect with the name of this great actor it is impressive how bad the acting is shifting the film to a comedy instead of the proposed horror genre this is the type of movie good to see with a group of friends drinking beer making comments and laughing a lot my vote is three br br title brazil jack o Â do halloween jack o Â demon of the halloween
<START> i can't actually think of one good point in this film the story is absolutely terrible the acting is as blunt as a carrot and the script is so bad it makes you want to kill yourself ok fine if you love and you have to love it to understand you might enjoy it microscopically better as it has large mountains and some cool moves but apart from that it is terrible it has some absolutely stupid ideas and it is racist with both black and white people insulting each others races the only time you will laugh is when you are laughing at the stupidity or you are feeling embarrassed for the film i have seen a lot of films and i have to say that this is the worst film i have ever seen if you have this film i would suggest you take it back to wherever you bought it from and get you money back
