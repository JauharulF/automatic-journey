<START> i watched the 1st scarecrow movie and didn't bag out that one though i knew it was b grade it actually had some decent gore and the guy playing the scarecrow was an awesome acrobat and had some good skills going the effects were better and the costume looked heaps better then this movie br br i borrowed this one with an open mind i am also a fan of ken shamrock former champ and was hoping it was a decent movie br br boy was i wrong the movie sucked the monster was pathetic in both appearance and in actually being scary the storyline was so predictable it was like watching the movie in preview mode as i already would guess what will happen the music was so bad with a horrible lip sync song that made me wanna punch the screen br br overall avoid this crappy movie br br save some money
<START> empire strikes back director irvin never say never again a remake of the 1965 james bond movie thunderball doesn't surpasses the terence young original but this non harry albert r broccoli film is well worth watching if you call yourself a 007 aficionado nevertheless despite its shortage of clever gadgets and the lack of a vibrant musical score never say never again rates as an above average suspenseful doomsday thriller with top flight performances by a seasoned cast including sean connery kim basinger klaus maria brandauer max von sydow barbara carrera edward fox bernie casey alec and rowan atkinson the film bristles with surprises galore from the invigorating title credits sequence throughout its generally exciting but lengthy 134 minutes unlike the franchise james bond sagas with their breath taking moments of spectacle never say never again provides few of these scenes because of its prohibitive budget indeed the film features only three gadgets an explosive ball point pen a wristwatch with a laser and a souped up motorcycle aside from the flavorful hall opening theme song ice station zebra composer michel orchestral music score leaves much to be desired legrand replicates none of those snappy jazz cues that made john barry's music for the regular bond franchise so memorable all in all never say never again seems to fit more into the first two bond moviesÂ dr no and from russia with love Âand on her majesty's secret service in terms of its more down to earth approach to the subject matter br br never say never again presents sean connery's james bond as an older 007 who has seen his day and has been taken off active service to teach ironically roger moore was a year older than connery and moore's bond movies treated 007 as an active young guy sean connery seems to be responsible for making 007 a more mature secret agent and a number of changes take place in the lorenzo semple screenplay that emphasize bond's age initially connery had to play bond without a but mercifully wiser minds prevailed and connery sports a he looks tanned and fit and appears in better condition than he did twelve years earlier when he was rushed into diamonds are forever at the last moment to replace john gavin connery had been working on another movie and had gained weight for the role that he was unable to remove in time for diamonds are forever at 52 connery still has a youthful vigor here despite the contrived demands of the script br br the action unfolds with 007 single handedly trying to rescue a kidnapped woman on a remote desert island he dispatches several guards armed with machine guns and frees the woman only to have her stab him with a knife in the side when he isn't looking it seems that this entire sequence was an exercise designed by m edward fox of day of the to test bond's ability the new m doesn't share his predecessor's use of field agents m decides that bond needs to clean out his system of all 'free and has 007 packed off to while at the country clinic bond notices suspicious activity between a nurse and a patient and gets noticed watching them the nurse is none other than spectre assassin blush barbara carrera of the island of dr moreau and she is in charge of making sure that nobody sees usaf officer jack o'herlihy of superman 3 is part of a spectre plan by millionaire businessman maximilian largo klaus maria brandauer of out of africa to black the world powers by stealing two nuclear warheads the villains implant a duplicate eyeball into captain who has access to the highly sophisticated computers and can order the arming of weapons after he steals the weapons for spectre blush runs him off the road by tossing her pet snake in his lap and then attaches an explosive to his wrecked car and blows him up indeed the first part of never say never again apart from the spectre planning conference belong to as she stay at the clinic and then repeatedly tries to kill bond one at sea with sharks and later in a motel suite with an explosives device br br eventually bond meets the beautiful blond domino kim basinger of mother lode and sneaks into largo's charity banquet at a monte carlo casino where the two face off in an elaborate video game called to see who will rule the world bond bests him and largo hates him doubly now because 007 is his only rival to domino and a thorn in his side that not even seems to be able to remove bond and have it out after a motorcycle chase when he returns the favor and blows her up their earlier encounter in the bahamas when she attached a device to lure a shark after him is pretty lame like in the original thunderball the villains recover the hijacked nuclear warheads at sea but just the warheads themselves br br bond flies to the bahamas where he meets his diplomatic liaison nigel small fawcett no lesser than rowan atkinson of mr bean fame who is worried that bond may kill somebody and ruin the island paradise of course nigel small fawcett serves as the film's source of comic relief the c i a sends felix bernie casey of guns of the magnificent seven to back up bond this is the first time that an african american portrayed bond encounters his share of problems involving saving domino from arab slavers while and he save the world never say never again is a richly respectable james bond thriller with many neat touches but it never generates the air of danger that the franchise bond films have indeed never say never again looks like a dignified masterpiece theatre take on 007
<START> some good set design good songs though like the other guy said they aren't performed with much energy bea arthur trying her to do something with the material had an occasional good one liner as friend vera and helped move the song bosom buddies along other than that there's nothing here that's worth your time slow pacing incredibly bad not very good singing except from robert preston an awful script bad acting except from bea and a horrible lead actress who thought lucille ball would be good as the classy life loving mame the heads over at warner bros were no doubt on crack when they decided to not use angela lansbury who had done it so well on broadway and instead use ball who wasn't nearly as funny by then as she was 20 years earlier couldn't act the part the right way at all and used a painful as an excuse for singing even if perhaps because making the movie was painful for her to make and even if she financed it she just isn't mame auntie mame is such a better film and the soundtrack of the broadway musical with lansbury sounds great for the most part there's nothing here that's great engaging or interesting at all forget it unless you're a huge lucy fan who thinks she could do no wrong hopefully after seeing this you'll realize she was only human
<START> incredibly hilarious mid 70's italian with lots of non consensual s m lesbian sex gratuitous racial cruelty etc few redeeming cinematic qualities except for the fairly cool theme music with african drums and flute brilliant sample dialog br br white slave owner to white plantation manager you're so dumb i'll bet you forgot to interrogate that n r midwife br br white plantation manager not only did i interrogate her i did it so well she died before i could get any answers from her br br all the black actors have 70's afros and say yes in a high pitched voice the female lead has sex with everybody on the plantation 10 stars for fans of tasteless sleaze
<START> this movie is breath taking and mind blowing but i think maybe it can only be appreciated by die hard rpg it is like a game one problem is the plot is too game like and just has too many twists the twists are excessive jude law gives a very good performance i really like him in this movie just as jerome in gattaca and joe in a i
<START> as a recreational golfer with some knowledge of the sport's history i was pleased with disney's sensitivity to the issues of class in golf in the early twentieth century the movie depicted well the psychological battles that harry fought within himself from his childhood trauma of being evicted to his own inability to break that glass ceiling that prevents him from being accepted as an equal in english golf society likewise the young goes through his own class struggles being a mere caddie in the eyes of the upper crust americans who scoff at his attempts to rise above his standing br br what i loved best however is how this theme of class is manifested in the characters of parents his father is a working class drone who sees the value of hard work but is intimidated by the upper class his mother however recognizes her son's talent and desire and encourages him to pursue his dream of competing against those who think he is inferior br br finally the golf scenes are well photographed although the course used in the movie was not the actual site of the historical tournament the little liberties taken by disney do not detract from the beauty of the film there's one little disney moment at the pool table otherwise the viewer does not really think disney the ending as in miracle is not some disney creation but one that only human history could have written
<START> this is a charming movie to say the least the main character is an old man who refuses to be among the living dead by which he is surrounded he and his accomplice go around pulling pranks and getting into trouble all over town meanwhile his family is up in arms about what to do with him from there you see relationships with his wife best friend and son develop it finally leads up to one of the best movie endings i have ever seen br br the characters in this movie are rich and deep they develop well through the course of the film the movie has quite a range of moods it goes from light and funny to grim and dark any slow parts for you in this film will be made up for in the end br br autumn spring carries a similar message like a lot of other european movies do don't lose sight of the small pleasures in life if you enjoyed amelie the eighth day or life is beautiful all great films btw you will probably like this movie br br 8 5 10
<START> i don't normally give movies a 1 although i am a heartless critic i try to find anything that makes the movie worthwhile that is to say watchable the main thing i look for is a coherent plot if it has that alone i can watch it let me start by saying this doesn't even deserve to be called a movie this is more like an elementary school project gone horribly wrong and i've seen every sci fi movie special that was ever made br br many times i've read professional critic reviews that say crap like this played like a made for tv etc etc and i kept saying oh come on i wish they'd think of a real criticism well this is worse much worse this is truly the worst thing i've seen that's lasted the length of a movie if i did consider it a movie it would be my new worst movie of all time and i've seen every movie uwe boll made this movie makes uwe boll look like francis ford coppola i'd rather watch jaws the revenge all day then see this one more time even 5 minutes of it there was one good scene and it was the end p ok enough bashing the works of ron hall now for the serious criticism br br the script is poorly written the dialog is delivered in a wooden manner the effects are cheesier than those in a power rangers show and don't even get me started on the screen zoom in transitions ugh someone actually watched this thing edited it and then said ok release it i would have rather burned this than release it in closing all i can say is thank goodness dvd and vhs players have a stop and eject feature my advice don't rent it if you do you'll be glad you have stop and eject too
<START> i agree with most of the critics above more yet i was shocked by the presentation of the love scenes with the homosexual couple why because while they the director the producers didn't have any compulsion whatsoever in presenting the different heterosexual couples in the most passionate embraces including nudity and super close ups of french kissing and all sorts of nude contortions in bed completely unnecessary in their length and in the story when the moment came to show the same experiences with the homosexual couple they only dare to go as far as an excruciatingly painful hug almost among scholarly giggles with two very nervous actors so in reality the makers of this film found homosexuality to be unnatural as one of the characters says in some scene what a difference with the spanish cinema i remember being at the projection of an almodovar film in an italian cinema in rome and being completely amazed at the total lack of reaction from the italian audience they were afraid to have a reaction when in spain people would fall down from their seats laughing at all the situations and fabulous almodovar wit and flair obviously in italy there are dark forces in its history that the free manifestation of some very normal and natural emotions pity i must add that i was quite surprised to find that this same comment was censured by another correspondent it's very bad and dangerous when we cannot be allowed by the of others to express our opinions about certain matters where is freedom of speech i don't know if that censor will approve of the changes i was forced to make in this comment and i hope he won't receive the same treatment from some other narrow minded judge pity again
<START> i have seen a lot of movies in fact i love b horror movies they are one of my favorite genres however this garbage i refuse to acknowledge that this was given the honor of film was the worst piece of crap i have ever had the torture of watching i actually signed up on imdb purely for the fact that i needed a way to at least voice how awful this garbage was i have watched films they at least deserve the honor done in basements by high school students that were better written and directed i have nothing but pity for the poor actors in this garbage because they were just trying to earn a pay check they will now and forever have this stain on their records like a virgin who was raped and given herpes if writer director john has any dignity left at all after obviously fellating countless people to get this made he should never allow himself near a camera again and try applying his so called gifts to something more suited for him like mopping the floor of a peep show
<START> without john rhys davies i have to admit that this would never even register on my movie meter but in spite of that single fact this is not a bad little thriller considering the low budget the low quality effects the stiff acting and the sci fi channel aspects the blood effects are very convincing and the actually looks realistic regardless of what you think a looks like this is one good looking br br aside from the positives this runs kind of like kolchak the night stalker darren mcgavin remember meets the love boat but in spite of the ultimate cheese of this work it still holds something resembling a plot and actually attempts to gain your respect while making you laugh and roll your eyes br br as conflicted as this work is i still managed to find some enjoyment herein maybe you will too br br it rates a 5 2 10 on the made 4 tv scale br br it rates a 4 1 10 on the movie scale from br br the fiend
<START> one of the most boring pointless movies i have ever seen the title character is self centered self absorbed and wholly distasteful the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying hated it
<START> this is a good film this is very funny yet after this film there were no good ernest films
<START> only if its the last thing yo do and your humour is evaporated should you ever attempt to watch this if you do watch it alone invite no one they will never return to watch another movie with you it might be an excellent tool for that very purpose invite people you want to get rid of in your life br br apparently i need to write more about his film in order to qualify as a review this is sweet irony for this film it really does sum it up perfectly after wasting my time it wastes more of your time it does have a function i take it all back br br i recommend this film watch it its provocative really go ahead watch it
<START> the animation is great i'll concede to that but disney perpetuated every stereotype we have been trying to overcome for the last two generations and the names i mean come on sitka cheesy takeoff of those are real places where real people live and the real people these real places were named for are probably struggling out of the earth seeking vengeance over this trite little flick disney you're based out of california florida right amidst the rest of the states that still treat us like a foreign country if you can't stick to what you know at least hire and or work with people who know what area you're trying to maybe then it wouldn't be so insulting
