<START> for a made for tv movie i thought that it was a great popcorn movie don't expect anything to be very accurate and don't expect any award winners in this bunch but i do recommend this for a tv type version somewhat like the replacements look for cameos from real nfl players officials
<START> i loved this film it has a great heart and great bones i stumbled onto it by chance and i had no recollection not even an inkling of this movie from promos or reviews or word of mouth Â  i remember reading many years ago a journalist who commented on the value of watching movies without having them contaminated by the pre judgement of reviews or the false shill of the promos this seems to be the single most common source of the critics' negative reaction to the film failed to meet expectations of it being a comedy or a slice of life or character driven Â i had no expectation about the film and so it was comedic but i only laughed once or twice without being a comedy it was about a person but so eccentric that it wasn't slice of life it was about a character but the character was so intelligently optimistic and trusting of her instinct to life that it wasn't the angst driven sentimental melodrama so typical of american film as i wrote that i realized that writer director lisa krueger managed to poke fun at this schlock american sentimentality in the husband very cleverly too and kreuger was able to keep the cloyingly sentimental ending from the screen when the wayward husband returned with his tail shrunk between his legs ms krueger bravo Â  now i will be watching this film again as it is getting better and better as i reflect on it br br graham's performance as is brilliant i loved how subtly but completely she was able to portray and convey intelligent awareness of her commitment to honouring her words and actions she knew that in keeping her word with a band or friends or husband that she was setting herself up to ridicule and or disappointment in a world that was unable to honour commitment as she was able to do but even with that strength she was fully connected to humanity and embraced with a fully committed heart their frailty and failures the character of was amazingly well acted and i left the film surprised that i had no recollection of awards nominations for it okay not that surprised as american awards tend to go to women in roles filled with angst and the proper amount of nudity which this film did not have what it has was far better which was heart in this woman's discovery of herself with the assistance of new friends and a self deprecating shaman br br i admit to being a bit of a soft touch for eccentric characters who manage their peculiarities while remaining honest and true to themselves as they move through the minefield of what comprises 'proper' societal behaviour and interpersonal discourse if people must conform to normality in your world then this film will not be to your liking that was it seems one of the common threads in the critiques br br and i am always a sucker for a good play on words when it raises questions of human behaviour and ethical philosophical values until this movie i hadn't made the emotional connection between being committed to a cause or honesty or something and being committed to an insane asylum at what point does one's commitment to a personal sense of truth and action in life become a one way ticket to insanity this sounds like a simple question or one that is easily dismissed as being rhetorical but is it and yet few of the critics i think maybe two commented on this aspect of the film either directly or indirectly br br a lovely film 8 10 br br Â 
<START> this was a funny movie just having seeing the evil dead trilogy not a week ago and left wanting for more i got as many bruce campbell movies as i could including really bad ones this one is funny without being exceptional but as sure as hell original br br i mean you've got mad scientists superhuman cyborgs half brain freaks gypsies ex kgb cab drivers jealousy murders of passion love romance sex action and what more all with the same 6 actors br br you really have to see it and enjoy it i can't explain it in a text box i guess it is not so much a cult movie as evil dead was but it certainly has that bruce campbell touch i love ted raimi lends a hand tamara looks both beautiful and interesting she has gone a long way from the hooker in friday the 13th and vladimir also shows a lot of promise as an actor although he will probably be cast as secondary character in hollywood movies his entire career br br bottom line funny movie if you liked evil dead you'll like this too
<START> this film is a perfect example of great escapism i loved this film and was sucked in from the very beginning sure it's just an action flick but isn't having fun what watching movies is all about br br the cast of this film are very strong with likable characters the friendship between the boys is so realistic and appealing it's heart warming and hilarious to see a group of teenage boys interact especially this group of boys sean astin makes a great rebel successfully avoiding being a precocious teenager br br if you want fun watch this film i thoroughly enjoyed it even though i was watching it on a very dirty and old vhs that was terrible quality go dvd's
<START> if i was only allowed to watch one program in my entire life i would definitely have to pick the war on everything of all the satirical shows that have been on australian television i found chaser to be the funniest of all it is just so amazing the boys aren't afraid to do anything br br whether it's dress up as hitler to get into a polish club or push a massive ball of string around melbourne to try out the tourism or rock up to the coke factory naked in a bath with 2 40 to buy some water the chaser boys will go there br br in agreement with the comments above and or below the war on everything is more popular than their previous program but was just as funny some unforgettable moments from that show clean up cambodia classic br br so anyway to stop me from ranting further i strongly advise you to at least give chaser a chance you'll more than likely find it hilarious
<START> i watch this movie without big expectations i think everyone should do it's a great tv serie and of course we couldn't compare it with gone with the wind but it's still nice to watch it's also weird to see a different scarlett joanne whalley don't play scarlett with passion and fire like vivien leigh but i believe that scarlett is changed when she became older don't expect to much of this just watch but don't watch like i think this would be horrible
<START> yes at times unconditional love overwhelms as it bounces no as it from one story element to another in the most unconventional use of thematic elements and characters in fact it wasn't until i watched the film for the second time that i began to understand what i think p j hogan might have been attempting to do with this quirky unconventional flick perhaps the entire film itself is a metaphor for the unconditional love for which grace kathy bates yearns and describes in the later part of the film grace insists that unconditional love is just that without condition and without qualification so i watched unconditional love again with that in mind i laughed much more than i did the first time i became more involved with the characters i began to understand the at times absurd turns the story takes the performances are often over the top but no more than they need to be to fit hogan's weird and whacky vision a vision which moved me to tears yearning and outbursts of side splitting laughter yes hogan is asking a great deal of his audience but i for one have come to truly love his film unconditionally
<START> this is absolute drivel designed to shock and titillate the 60's mindset the acting is completely wooden consisting mainly of ad libbing which results in the sub standard actors dribbling the first thing they can think of repetitively br br the end result is of a badly written play being read by people who have no idea and couldn't care the one exception to this is the lead character joe played by joe who spends a lot of the film in a naked stupor either stoned or the only one in the piece who can act please don't think i don't get warhol this is plainly and simply a stinker that should never have made it out of a film class
<START> when goes to town he discovers nothing but bad news for his little insect neighbors in the can this honest good natured grasshopper save his sweetheart miss honey bee from the machinations of the evil c bagley beetle and also lead his friends to a safe new home before it's too late br br while not one of the great animated features a very new art at the time this film was created is an enjoyable film which should bring pleasure to uncritical viewers technically it is well made with animation of a generally high quality the movie's main drawback is that none of the characters really have any heart' they don't come alive' on the screen in the way jiminy cricket did a year earlier in pinocchio br br however it is ultimately unfair to compare the fleischer studio output with that of disney max dave fleischer had their own star to follow their contribution and it would be a considerable one would be in the realm of the one reel cartoon with their popeye and betty boop series they created alternate realities as viable as any produced by other cartoon studios was their second experiment with feature length animation after gulliver's travels in 1939 and henceforth they would expend their energies again on the cartoon short subject in fact the first in the highly acclaimed superman series was already in release br br story owes a great deal to frank capra with it's energetic go get hero up against powerful societal forces indeed the film's original title was mr bug goes to town which immediately puts one in mind of gary cooper or jimmy stewart and their capraesque adventures br br jack mercer famous as the voice of popeye here speaks for two very different characters old mr bumble swat the fly movie mavens should be able to catch veteran voice actors pinto colvig mae both in uncredited roles br br the film has some pleasant songs supplied by carmichael frank loesser of which be my little baby bumble bee' is the most familiar we're the couple in the castle' is a fine romantic tune which deserves to be rediscovered br br it is unfortunate that the film's initial animation with its sweep out of the heavens and past the in depth new york skyline is obscured behind the opening credits
<START> ok i admit it i'm 40 and still shed a tear every time i watch johnny calling back his robot at the end br br robot now stop don't do it stop the attack robot what are you doing robot robot where are you come back robot robot please don't do it you'll die robot robot please comeback i need you robot robot giant johnny the last of emperor guillotine br br of all the thats out there giant robot has a special place in my heart and will always be there i credit it with getting me into everything sci fi and anime when i was a kid br br live on gr
<START> i attended a screening of this movie it was wrought with clichÃ©s and very unfunny jokes and set ups i think the other comments were by people who must've worked on the movie or been family members of the cast i'm amazed this movie cost 3 4 million without any real stars where did the budget go it obviously didn't go to writers for re writes nice thought to bank on the success of big fat greek wedding but a major miss there was little or any spark between the main characters and the inciting incident was a bit flimsy at best the direction was uninspired and looked like a student film br br i don't even know what it means everybody wants to italian is that a real saying i've never heard it
<START> i put down this vehicle from robert de niro and eddie murphy and murphy in particular the first time but having seen it again recently i can see that it does have some very funny bits br br this is by no means to say that this is the greatest buddy comedy of all time but really what can you do to the already exhausted subgenre what director tom dey has tried to do is make it a satire of the clichÃ©s of buddy comedy and the media early in the movie the executive of a cable network asks how is this different from cops when chase is pitching the idea of a reality show dealing with de niro's character mitch preston hilariously boring name by the way that's when i saw it in a new light that i hadn't previously noticed br br the idea is to show all the elements of the buddy comedy and put a twist on them de niro's reluctance to star in the show and to partner up with murphy is right out of every cop film you can think of you can say that de niro is actually playing himself asking why would i do another movie playing a cop chase is portrayed to be a hollywood phony but if you look at her opening scene again she is merely doing it to save her job she somehow sees the ridiculousness of what she is doing but she wants to succeed despite that one line says it all who doesn't want to be on tv maybe this is reading too much into what is essentially a lightweight film merely set to entertain but it does give it a little spin that i hadn't noticed before br br as for murphy you got to applaud him for looking this ridiculous trey wants to be a star so bad that he is willing to sell out everything he comes in contact with murphy was a big star and maybe it struck a nerve that it is all so fleeting br br the plot with the gun is of course pretty boring the action sequences are nothing special except the end which required a lot of effort both from cast and crew one thing that i noticed about the villain is that he is dressed like an 80's pop star george michael comes to mind and that adds to the whole media spin br br so i trashed it the first time around but what the heck if you are gonna do this why not point out how ridiculous it really is and de niro and murphy took a big chance doing this
<START> i would not recommend it whatsoever it was like getting stuck in the middle row of a theater so i couldn't leave and watching a part porn movie except they didn't take their clothes off it was the body language and definitely the language i have to say i was embarrassed filming was very low budget no good dialogue yuck actors stunk except the two best characters who got killed off and they were david carradine and dennis hopper it did smack of kill bill and that old movie with the two guys who ride the dessert on their you know what i mean blablabla the filming was grainy and just a very low quality there was nobody in that theater that liked this movie and the people around me were younger and tattooed
<START> what makes this one better than most movie movies is that it doesn't feel phony the film the story of the hot headed director and his rise and fall and rise by using real recognizable names and events during the silent and early sound eras instead of the generic sound will put us out of business business they actually show jolson and the jazz singer the acting is really quite good with believeable performances from don ameche alice faye and j edward in particular
<START> simply one of the greatest films ever made worthy of sitting alongside such european masterworks as the rules of the game grand illusion andrei 8 1 2 wings of desire the night of the shooting stars la strada ordet the passion of joan of arc the four hundred blows and madame de both a blessing and an almost perfect work of art
