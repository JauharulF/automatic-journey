<START> if you have ever babysat in a house you didn't know or if you saw the original and enjoyed it then this will be a good choice ignoring the reviews and what was posted here i went ahead and rented this movie because of the memories of how the original scared me as a teen this movie has of course changed some of the original story to relate to todays teens such as the babysitter is in trouble for going over on her cell phone minutes and has to take on a babysitting job to pay her bill however it sticks to the original story line pretty well if you can relate to the babysitter not knowing the house and it's usual pops and cracks it is quite suspenseful when the killer is shown he is very creepy and you find yourself yelling at the girl to get out of the house if you have never babysat or been in a situation like this then you probably will not be able to relate and will not like it it's all about understanding her fear
<START> this is a terrible movie and i'm not even sure why it's so terrible it's ugly for one with that trendy 1970s visual style that maybe seemed like a good idea at the time but which now enables one to instantly recognize a film from that time period as being a 70s product the film retains the story and songs that made the stage version of the musical such a hit but the songs sound lifeless on screen but mostly the movie sucks because of the wan performance of lucille ball who you'd think would be able to make something of this larger than life character if anyone could she sleepwalks through the movie like a terrified actress choking on her opening night and the film sinks with her even bea arthur who i bet was hilarious in the best friend role onstage can't breathe any life into this stinker br br avoid at all costs br br grade d
<START> let me tell you a story br br one day on the streets of athens a film director bumped into a male prostitute and decided that the world just had to know his story because you know he's deprived and he takes his shirt off a lot and so on br br this film is the result of his revelation repulsive depraved homophobic misogynist but of course filled with pretty guys with their chests showing if this is your idea of a good film then enjoy if not avoid it like the plague br br it's put me off ever going to greece that's for sure
<START> i was duped as well here i was expecting all sorts of man eating and what the hell do you get br br an hour and a half of nothing but awkward silences with some weird guy who isn't weird enough to be scary br br i thought there was no way 5 could be too much for a movie br br damn i was sooooo wrong it was very hard to watch the whole thing br br don't fool yourself its not so good that its bad its not even that kind of movie br br its nothing an hour and a half of absolutely nothing br br piece of crap
<START> this has to be one of if not the greatest mob crime films of all time every thing about this movie is great the acting in this film is of true quality master acting skills make you actually believe he is italian the cinematography is excellent too probably the best ever this movie was great and i have the brain capacity of an earth worm
<START> oh yeah this one is definitely a strong contender to win the questionable award of worst 80's slasher ever made the prey has got everything you usually want to avoid in a horror flick a routine derivative plot that you've seen a thousand times before and better insufferable characters and terrible performances a complete lack of gore and suspense fuzzy photography and unoriginal locations and Â most irritating of all Â the largest amount of pointless padding footage you've ever encountered in your life and that's not an exaggeration but a guarantee apart from the seemingly endless amount of national geographic stock footage which i'll expand upon later this film is shameless enough to include a complete banjo interlude and two occasions where characters tell jokes that aren't even remotely funny the set up is as rudimentary as it gets with the intro showing images of a devastating forest fire with ott voice over human screams fast forward nearly forty years later when an elderly couple out camping in that same area get axe whacked by something that breathes heavily off screen this ought to be enough information for you to derive that someone survived the fire all these years ago and remained prowling around ever since enter three intolerable twenty something couples heading up to the danger zone with exclusively sex on their minds unaware of course they are sitting ducks for the stalking and panting killer the prey is an irredeemable boring film apparently it was shot in 1978 already but nobody wanted to distribute it up until 1984 and it isn't too hard to see why in case you would filter out all the content that is actually relevant this would only be a short movie with a running time of 30 minutes possibly even less there's an unimaginably large of nature and wildlife footage sometimes of animals that i think don't even live in that type of area and they seem to go on forever the only thing missing in fact is the typical national geographic narration providing educational information regarding the animals' habits animals in their own natural are undeniably nice to look at but not in a supposedly vile and cheesy 80's slasher movie for crying out loud the last fifteen minutes are finally somewhat worthwhile with some potent killing sequences and fine make up effects on the monster who turns out to be lurch from the addams family movies but still silliness overrules Â the scene with the vultures is too stupid Â and the final shot is just laugh out loud retarded as mentioned above the prey easily makes my own personal list of worst 80's slashers alongside appointment with fear berserker deadly games don't go in the woods hollow gate the stay awake and curfew
<START> this show disturbs me it takes up slots on nick at nite that could be reserved for the fresh prince or george lopez even full house and roseanne they're all better than home improvement first off the mother jill annoys me so much she is an whiny baby and i really despise her brad is a fat toad and he is annoying too and the youngest brother i don't even know his name i don't notice him at all that's probably not the actor's fault though it's probably the writers' tim is just a stupid ass although jill is definitely my least favorite i don't like any of them the only reason i gave this stupid show three stars is one star goes to randy as the middle child he is still a pesky little brother but an older brother and i like his fun character the other star goes to al as the chubby friend his character is likable other than randy and al this show sucks
<START> the plot of this boils down to ah versus satan and what i remember most about the movie is a lot of explosions gunfire blood noise and let's not forget that flammable satanic urine the story is nonsensical utterly predictable and so full of holes i couldn't take a bit of it seriously stick to rosemary's baby or the exorcist if you want to see a really good devil movie and um well i can't think of any good action movies at the moment probably because they're so far and few between so you're on your own in that category this flick does get a 3 out of 10 rating from me for its camp value and for a pretty good performance by gabriel byrne as that old satan
<START> what an original piece of work i've always enjoyed liev schreiber the actor but now one must appreciate the man on a multi dimensional level how did he get that field of was it it sure looked real and how do you audition a dog knowing you are going to get that kind of performance does the academy have a category for animals i guess what i'm saying is that i really really enjoyed this quirky offbeat little indie film from the excellent cast one would never know eugene was not a pro actor to the cinematographer some beautiful shots the music bought the cd when exiting the theater and of course the two d's direction and the dog all in all a 10 br br
<START> there are lots of other comments here about how poor this film is what i wanted to point out is how this film took the largest science project in history and made it look small the manhattan project was an incredible achievement and it was huge virtually all silver in the country went into making wire for electromagnetic if there was every a choice between two alternative ways of doing things they just did both the first sustained nuclear reactor was fired up under the stands of the university of chicago football stadium with graduate students wielding axes as a mechanism it's a fascinating story involving hundreds of locations and thousands of people that this film seems to reduce to a small group of eccentrics in new mexico br br the other thing i really disliked was the huge moral debate over if we should continue the project after germany surrenders okay we have thousands of mostly men who worked for years to make a really big boom does anyone think they didn't want to see it work there was some controversy at the time about if we should use the device but it was not that serious clearly not the huge debate this film makes it out to be
<START> if there were two parts that the physically towering ugly charismatic actor gÃ©rard depardieu was born as a frenchman to play it must surely have been cyrano de bergerac and the orator georges here he dominates the film both through the breadth of his shoulders and the power of his voice his charisma carries the part despite the fact that it is made clear that the character has as much blood on his hands as any of the rest of them feasts while the people of paris starve but he is the one man who can challenge the tyranny imposed by the dreaded committee of public safety in the name of 'freedom' and he is presented as the hero of the film despite the fact that the source play practically his opponent robespierre br br for those who know the characters from history there is interest to be had in identifying the minor parts the frog faced the cripple the prosecutor the dashing fop st just the epic painter david but the script cuts little slack in this respect names are often late in coming if minor characters are identified at all and there is no hollywood style 'info to make sure that the audience can place events in their historical context the film takes it for granted that you know what has gone before and what will happen after sometimes it takes too much for granted as when it relies on a close knowledge of dates to provide the sting to its tail in the fact that robespierre followed shortly to the scaffold br br considered as a film it's not entirely satisfactory in that it ebbs away towards the end the structure of the story leads up to some great confrontation between the protagonists in the courtroom or some dramatic climax to the trial which thanks to history never actually happens things just fizzle out there is no revolt there is no overthrow of tyranny there is no assumption of power by the victor there is no triumph on either side it may be historically accurate but it's not entirely satisfying as the outcome of a screen scenario it seems an odd place to stop as others have commented it might have been more logical to take events up to the end of the terror and show in the fall of robespierre
<START> excellent hitchcock thriller with robert cummings proving once again that he could really act up a storm br br this time he is a defense plant worker caught up in a horrible plot when his best friend is killed at the plant br br priscilla lane is the girl who suddenly becomes interested in cummings as the plot thickens and he is pursued from california to n y br br there is a diabolical plot by a group of wealthy 5th columnists to destroy from from within hitchcock was known to play up the upper echelons of society involved in mayhem in his long career as a director br br ironically the film implodes at the very end while we see what happens to the guy who killed friend we don't see what happens to the rest of the gang again many of whom represent the upper crust of society
<START> i seen this movie when it came out i thought what an average movie i have now realized that this director was ahead of his time this is a great movie and great soundtrack i have seen my share of rock films but although this is far from spinal tap which i did not like this film does take us into the life of an 80s rocker wanting to be nothing but this is nothing more than our inner child wanting to grow up and to be a rock star yeah i said it everyone wants to grow up and be on the spot light weather said or not this movie just puts you in the core of emotions and you can almost feel the excitement of izzy i must admit the acting was less par but still the music and story was enough to hold you in to it till the credits rolled worth the watch especially if you are a fan of ye ole mighty hair bands
<START> really really what pleases audience american one in this so called show is totally beyond me what can we learn from these series br br 1 each casino there is spending about 2 3 billion bucks every year to rent a satellite and enormous quantity of hi tech high resolution cameras for their security team let fbi bites the dust of them br br 2 every security employee must have voluptuous breasts of course natural ones the tits must be shown all the time otherwise they will lose their job br br 3 if the employee happens to be a male he needs to get breasts implanted then go to step 2 br br 4 only in hollywood one can blatantly rip off other show's ideas then implement them as their own and call all this crap original and art br br 5 every security with tits bigger than is considered immortal and cannot die br br i really would like to have the opportunity to vote with minus values 10 10 for this one
<START> this movie was unfortunately terrible br br clichÃ©d hackneyed stilted dialogue and acting make it almost unwatchable br br the feel good finale is laughably lame br br there is a reason judge career has vanished br br if you don't live in new york and aren't jewish several of the jokes will be inscrutable br br i too found the need to have the unacknowledged lesbian daughter go straight at the end quite insulting br br i simply cannot fathom how this film was so popular at film fests br br it is without a doubt one of the worst films i have seen in quite some time
