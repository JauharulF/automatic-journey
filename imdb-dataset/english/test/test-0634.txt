<START> unconditional love is surprisingly entertaining while the plot goes off in perhaps too many directions making for an overlong movie it never fails to charm and ingratiate itself the several plotlines one warmly reminiscent of shirley valentine provide ample smiles laughs wisdom and tenderness it all shouldn't work and at times it certainly bumps along but forgive its inconsistencies sit back and have a good time it's a charmer
<START> they were alternative before there was alternative the residents are a band like no other and i love them for it this has all their classics from 'hello reich and to their homage to the great james brown with a take on 'this is a man's man's man's world' but that is just the beginning as a bonus it even has renaldo the loafs hauntingly beautiful for swinging and even features the residents cover of it needless to say i highly recommend the purchase of this dvd i would also recommend buying their latest album 'demons dance alone' it is fantastic br br uncle willie eyeball buddy 502
<START> i own a video store with hundreds of documentaries i have seen loads of them and love all of the great info out there only a small handful though even come close to offering info as important as this one i have been reading through other peoples reviews of this film and can't help but notice that the main things people are criticizing are irrelevant such as it is very one sided such a pathetic criticism every where in society that you look you will see the other side and if you still need help go to com it is the same people over and over uh one might be led to believe that these people are the experts so maybe they are the best people to interview filming style is all the same head shots with few exceptions if you want flash and dazzle watch micheal moore if you want info watch real docs such as this one as you can plainly see none of these complaints have any relevance to the information contained my guess is that these people are just missing the point and don't wanna give up there suv's br br my recommendation watch it learn from it and continue your education about such subjects it is very important stuff for everyone
<START> this one was truly awful watching with fascinated horror i kept on asking why have they done this that is taken all the scenarios out of the day after tomorrow the perfect storm and twister and them in a three hour miniseries directed by long time junk tv director dick lowry with every disaster movie clichÃ© known to man and not an ounce of real suspense many of the cast were unknown canadians and location filming was done in canada doubling for chicago so no doubt tax breaks had something to do with it although some ambitious special effects were attempted the execution is so poor no decent spectacle is achieved the actors may be a competent lot the script is so bad no one had a chance to show it except perhaps for randy quaid as tommy the tornado chaser who went right over the top and was quite amusing br br believe it or not the producers have since made another one of these canadian disaster turkeys called category 7 Â the end of the world which was very tastefully shown on cbs in the us a few weeks after hurricane katrina how could the network of ed murrow and walter cronkite do such a thing in prime time pt barnum nobody ever went broke underestimating public taste is proved right once more
<START> this was the first feature film for just about everyone involved including director teck tan so they deserve credit for pulling it off but this film was awkward in its direction preachy in its style exaggerated in its acting and overly politically correct the plot was all over the place preventing any aspect of it from developing well gangsters get involved in the story though i'm not sure what their presence added to the movie other than making the film even more unrealistic they could have been completely left out and the film would have been better as a result br br the plot is about a young ethnic chinese malaysian who returns to his home country after studying in the west his studies have brought him back with the skills he thinks he needs to fulfill his dream of managing a rock band and taking them to the top of malaysian charts a rather juvenile premise the beginning of the film hints at conflict with his traditional father but once the gangsters get involved this part of the story is dropped unceremoniously br br the film tries to take advantage of wondrously diverse ethnic mix but unfortunately the manner in which these aspects were put to film either seemed terribly contrived or downright preachy there is a pretty scene of malay women doing a beautiful traditional dance on a beach but the way the vision is integrated into the plot seems forced and unnatural br br the acting came off as somewhat amateurish and the male lead was particularly unconvincing the female malay lead was a notable exception leaving the most positive mark the film also has an openly gay character and though he is a bit of a caricature he provides some of the funnier moments in the film but the movie was just barely a notch above a typical local television soap drama sadly this film which is not in the least offensive has been banned in malaysia 3 10
<START> i first saw apocalypse now in 1985 when it was broadcast on british television for the first time i was shell shocked after seeing this masterpiece and despite some close competition from the likes of fellowship of the ring this movie still remains my all time favourite nearly 20 years after i first saw it br br this leads to the problem of how i can even begin to comment on the movie i could praise the technical aspects especially the sound editing and cinematography but everyone else seems to have praised rightly too these achievements to high heaven while the performances in general and robert duvall in particular have also been noted and everyone else has mentioned the stark imagery of the dou long bridge and the montage of the boat traveling upriver after passing through the border br br how about the script francis ford coppola is best known as a director but he's everyway a genius as a screenwriter as he was as a director i said was in the past tense because making this movie seems to have burned out every creative brain cell in his head but his sacrifice was worth it in john milius original solo draft we have a script that's just as insane and disturbing as the one on screen but coppola's involvement in the screenplay has injected a narrative that exactly mirrors that of war check how the screenplay starts off all jingoistic and macho with a star turn by bill who wouldn't have looked out of place in the green berets but the more the story progresses the more shocking and insane everything becomes so much so that by the time reaches kurtz outpost the audience are watching another film in much the same way as the characters have sailed into another dimension when coppola states this movie isn't about vietnam it is vietnam he's right what started off as a patriotic war to defeat communist aggression in the mid 1960s had by the film's setting the manson trial suggests it's 1970 had changed america's view of both the world and itself and of the world's view of america br br it's the insane beauty of apocalypse now that makes it a masterwork of cinema and says more in its running time about the brutality of conflict and the hypocrisy of politicians what did you do in the vietnam war mr president than michael moore could hope to say in a lifetime i've not seen the redux version but watching the original print i didn't feel there was anything missing from the story which like all truly great films is very basic in fact the premise can lend itself to many other genres like a western where an army officer has to track down and kill a renegade colonel who's leading an injun war party or a sci fi movie where a un assassin is to eliminate a fellow un soldier who's leading a resistance movement on mars though this is probably down to joseph conrad's original source novel br br my all time favourite movie and it's very fitting that i chose this movie to be my one review at the imdb
<START> possibly the worst movie i have ever seen pathetic in almost every way br br i threw the dvd straight in the bin i didn't even think it was fair to give it to the local thrift shop br br the effects are beyond a joke the dam control room looks like cardboard the water looks way out of scale with the backgrounds nothing works br br then there is the limp plot about as much depth as a scooby doo cartoon br br i couldn't wait for them all to drown
<START> spoilers br br i gave this film 2 out of 10 for 2 scenes that i will never forget by the way my husband rented this surprising non blow 'em up almost chick looking flick but i guessed why when i saw the cover girls in school uniforms duh lol ah well men if ya can't beat 'em join 'em br br bijou philips one of my favorites on the indie screen too cute not only gets into bestiality her toy dog is the best lesbian in town according to her bubbly outrageous character that would be the first worthwhile scene br br then she enters a restroom in a lovely gown goes into a stall after a bit she gets up goes out to the party she the pathetically sad 'cat' character are at hands a shiny silver ice bucket to the host of the party the host looks in her precious silver ice bucket and says oh my god it's poo br br i love bijou phillips myself for her creativity and unusual movie choices this would definitely be one of them and um i would rent it for the poo scene if i were you i am not a big poo jokes fan but it definitely puts the 'party people' in their place they didn't look like they were having a good time anyway lol you will never forget these two scenes hmm but is that what we want in our databanks maybe you shouldn't follow my advice at all lol br br dominique swain is kind of squirrelly sad in her confusing nonsensical role in i don't know i can't decide if i like her because she is so into indie films indie films are awesome all but couldn't she pick a few good ones i am going to check out a few more of her movies and reserve judgment but this one was pardon the reference to beasts a dog
<START> i happened to see this film on a flight from paris to boston and it reminded me of the food on the plane generic tasteless and obscure the french cinema seems to have lost its footing these days and this is a good example of how a motley script can waste brilliant actors while some may find the of the script to be in line with the dictates of euro post modernism the whole project seems more like a post mortem on the death of euro cinema's golden years and truly fabulous talents one is vaguely reminded here of bunuel but without the charm or wit
<START> a beautifully photographed and paced short film it evocatively captures the feeling of this family and much of the country during the period just prior to and after pearl harbor br br i appreciated the visual look of the film naturalistic and simultaneously poetic great work by a great d p david boyd br br though a family film the story never becomes maudlin or saccharin we understand and believe the motivation that propels the young boy on his odyssey i understand the love of the younger brother for his older brother and do not question why he sets out to do what he does i understand that he is driven by a deep desire to be with his brother in this time of crisis the kid is tough and the performance by jonathan is superb as is the veteran performance by ron perlman
<START> mcgee is a show that you really have to be a certain age to appreciate otherwise it's likely you'll miss the references to 80's cop films and simply think it's a running gag about a walking rectum think it's brainless infantile poop humor go watch the stallone film and you'll see what i mean this show actually has very subtle humor which says a lot both for a show that aired on adult swim and for a show about a walking ass br br all the standard genre clichÃ©s are in place that made movies like dirt harry and cobra so great and ripe for parody sanchez is partner who is as per the genre level headed and constantly apologizing for his partner's homicidal behavior the police chief is of course a fire breathing hard case who lives to scream i want your badge on my desk first thing tomorrow morning the over the top and sometimes completely nonsensical manner in which the 1980's cop' film is parodied suits the subject matter well for instance while breaking up a bus robbery one of the criminals stops to ask hey where are you going asshole to which the title character snaps off the one liner i'm going to shoot you br br highly recommended for anybody who loves 80's action movies and has actually viewed enough of them to understand the humor
<START> having seen most of the coen brothers previous films i expected something different and off centre is certainly those things but it also has a heart as big as well as big as mississippi it is one of the most plainly enjoyable movies to have come out in recent times intelligent well crafted clever and superbly acted br br characters are delivered in their myriad shades by a group of marvellous actors george clooney winning me over completely with his clark gable ish looks and character having only ever seen him in three kings and his thin red line cameo i am now a fan more comedy please george br br john and tim blake nelson ably assist especially nelson if ever the simpsons is made into a movie then he must be a natural to play cletus the slack jawed yokel i don't think there is a performance that falls short of excellent from the entire cast my special favorite is stephen root as the blind radio station man br br great old timey music a jiggy type dance by clooney that i am trying to learn and a feel of depression era southern us enhanced by sepia like photography make this the best movie i've see so far this century the only drawback to the film is that it has almost sent me broke buying the soundtrack the dvd and a dvd player to play it on it's that good br br
<START> i live up here in croc territory and remember well the true events that inspired this movie our guts fall out each time we hear of a croc attack black water is quite simply the best croc movie i have ever seen while i loved rogue last year for all its effects and splashy scenes it was the local scenes that captured our audience we laughed in rogue more than anything black water however really resonated with the eeriness and fear that you can experience when you are alone in the you guys call them swamps or but they're every tourist should see this film before heading to the northern territory the ending was a bit of a letdown after the rest of the film but i'll be adding this one to my dvd collection when it becomes available
<START> in bollywood it isn't rare that worthless films become hits good films flopping and good actors not making it big br br is such a movie br br himesh after a music director and singer tried acting hell man just because his songs became a hit that means next he becomes an actor br br the producers were sure the film will work perhaps the songs were a hit too and of course himesh did his cheap publicity as usual br br the film tells such a poor story such poor direction such poor acting it makes you cringe br br indian rickshaws in germany stunts by himesh and lot of stupidity cap is intact even when he is in the car which somersaults br br direction is poor music is saving grace though most songs sound the same br br himesh tries hard but sadly his emotive scenes are a joke lacks expressions he is best suited for his music director and some singing he cuts a sorry picture is awful malika is okay sachin is okay darshan hams
<START> jack the tempest is an adaption of shakespeare's play the tempest bender transports the plot from medieval italy to mississippi during the time of the american civil war he includes the slavery problem and the role of revenge in br br prospero re named gideon prosper is not the duke of milan but a landowner in mississippi he learns voodoo magic from the female slave mambo he saves her son ariel who thus accompanies him into his exile the island is not situated on the sea but in a swamp near the banks of the mississippi there lives an alligator hunter a so called gator man who later tries to rape prospero's daughter miranda during the time of the civil war ariel wants to join the union troops to help fighting against slavery prospero does not care about the war he is only interested in his personal revenge on his brother antony when antony and his bookkeeper willi gonzo gonzalo try to cross the river prospero raises a storm the union soldier frederick gets lost in the swamp and finally comes to the island he and miranda fall in love with each other but prospero won't accept that meanwhile ariel transformed into a raven by prospero finds out that antony has feigned to ally with the union but plans to betray them antony and gonzo meet gator man in the swamp and conspire with him against prospero they kidnap miranda and ariel but prospero freeze them and helps the union defeat the southern army in the end ariel is free frederick and miranda are bound to marry prospero returns to the plantation and gator man gets back the island br br peter fonda represents gideon prosper powerfully and convincingly while the character of antony stays rather flat it was no bad idea to perform the tempest before the background of the civil war but perhaps the director has risked too much in some parts the story seems constructed or comical gator man for example does just appear without any explanation that it needs a kidnapping to bring prospero to his mind and that he loses confidence in his power shows that bender tried to make prospero more human but only made him a weak old man without his magic prospero's original authority and wisdom is not made clear br br end of part 1
