<START> this was terrible mean spirited and full of the worst clichÃ©s and racial stereotypes i've seen in a looong time seeing hayden p trying to act ghetto was painful hi one pant leg up on yer sweats and some braids make you down with the homies solange knowles pretty much grimaces through the entire movie most of the set sequences look like they were filmed in cardboard boxes what was up with the finale and poor rihanna was just plain exploited to get people to watch her act which she can't br br put simply this film even deserve one star please put this tired franchise to rest or at least make the next one bring it on iv cheerleaders vs freddy jason
<START> this movie gives us some wwii history along with some touching romance a little fantasy and meaningful emotion and beautiful scenery nicholas cage never fails us and here again does a great job and so do the other principle characters one key charater the physician father played by john hurd delivers to his daughter one of the best definitions of love i've ever heard some of the events are a bit too coincidental to be real but i excused that knowing that this is partly fairy tale and my wife and i really liked the film and it is nice to watch people taking the risks to love the enemy one man who left the theatre near us said to his wife now that's the way to wage war i think you'll see what he means when you watch the italian occupiers of this lovely greek island
<START> a fascinating slice of life documentary about a husband and wife and their marriage told through the eyes of their son we all like to think that our parents lived happy lives that their marriages were full of fulfilment love and happy memories sadly many of us know this not to be the case of their own families and that of their parents this wonderful little documentary is told through the camera lens and emotional perspective of the son of a family that has just experienced the death of their mother the son being a documentary film maker has filmed his elder family for many years for as he states posterity three months after the death of his mother his father remarries his long time secretary the suddenness of this occurrence stuns the family and pushes the son to dig into the past lives of his mother and father what he reveals is a fascinating look into the lives of two rather ordinary people who like so many of their generation married early for the wrong reasons and found themselves stuck in a family life where they found they just had to make do a wife who found herself at times bitterly lonely and unloved and a husband who buries himself in his work she and intellectual at heart he a much simpler individual who seems to find most of his pleasures in the quiet solitude of work they are obviously wrong for each other this much is clear yet they stick it out for what well that's part of the mystery they clearly show affection for each other at times if not ever much love you won't find any truly shocking disclosures here aside from infidelity on both sides which in good part is what makes this such a gem you really feel that these could be your own parents if circumstances were different and indeed makes one question the lives of ones own parents
<START> put simply this mini series was terrible let me count the ways 1 absurd plotting 2 over acting 3 scattershot approach to characters 4 annoying narration 5 inability to create viewer interest br br this film can't even pass the soap opera for dummies test i'm sorry i have not read this award winning novel so i am judging it only as a film but it really stinks imagine going to a party where they show you dozens of appetizers you look at the wide variety and want to taste them but suddenly they are withdrawn and you wonder where they went that's like this film with way too many characters introduced and never drawn out there are enough stories and characters in this film to create a 20 episode series yet we are given less than four hours to digest it all br br there are more facial expressions and reaction shots of ed harris than you'll find on 10 000 monkeys the pace is extraordinarily slow br br dennis farina and helen hunt are so far over the top that their characters are not believable joanne character is one dimensional br br the persistent river metaphor becomes trite br br and probably the most absurd part of the film the cat this evil and vengeful cat who follows the hero around to scratch him and his seat covers well come on now it's not even good stephen king br br probably the most interesting character in the film and one who is not drawn well is john voss the disturbed boy whose final act of desperation accounts for the only plot device that works in this film br br just about everyone in this film is unbelievable br br to sum up there's little here to inspire the drama is poor melodrama it's just a terrible effort
<START> although they died with their boots on is not entirely historically accurate it is a very entertaining western not only is flynn the perfect custer the character actors are superb besides the action portion of the movie flynn and love scenes are very touching and believable flynn and dehavilland were very fond of each other in real life flynn was always so tormented for being not taken seriously if only he knew that there were very few actors who could play the characters he played and play them well
<START> eaten alive goes down much easier than ruggero deodato's cannibal holocaust but it's also a far more sillier film i mean at times it can be unintentionally hilarious but the plot is so mind numbingly idiotic that it was impossible for me not to lose all patience by the end tough guy robert cannibal holocaust teams up with janet the gates of hell here with an intolerable accent to search the jungles of new guinea for sister who's been brainwashed by the leader of a religious cult ivan rassimov along the way they fall witness to sometimes real animal torture and some cheesily rendered cannibalism as directed by umberto the movie is so over the top it's hard to take seriously but if you enjoy trash cinema with more than a few unintentional laughs it's not bad br br 4 10
<START> i watched this series after tipping the velvet for which i gave 10 10 grade i had read user comments on this and i expected an equally good series or if possible even better at this point i must emphasize that this series is good and it definitely captured me throughout it and thus worth watching however i didn't enjoy it as much as tipping the velvet for the following reasons br br 1 less passion love and related sexual content there were surprisingly little emphasis in these elements which i held integral for a love story felt like a watered down version of tipping the velvet br br 2 similarly as in tipping the velvet the story had three parts the beginning a shocking second part and the ending the second part should have been the climax of the story as in tipping the velvet but instead it was almost totally skipped perhaps due to inability to make shocking but believable asylum content the series should have been in three parts featuring two cliffhangers with a lot more focus on the second part br br 3 almost no weight was given to what were and how it affected their personalities i found it rather annoying that the series did not properly address such central topic br br 4 the ending was much more hasty than in tipping the velvet left several interesting plot lines open br br despite these shortcomings is a good series and well worth 7 10 however it is not a classic like tipping the velvet
<START> was curious to know the name of the tuscan village where the filming in italy was done i know the name villa san however would like to know the exact location in tuscany the cinematography is excellent and it would be wonderful to visit that area i would also be interested to know what the location of the desert shooting is as well travel extensively in europe and africa and would am interested in visiting the areas that the book and film were about please e mail me with any information on the sites that any one might have we would be very grateful and if any one knows if the villa in tuscany is still habitable that would be awesome as well i await any information and i thank you in advance for your time
<START> this film is bone chilling in a way that is hard to describe while it is fairly accurate in its description of the events leading up to and the subsequent investigation regarding the first attempt to destroy the world trade center in 1993 seen now post 9 11 it is almost unbearable br br it would be a mistake to call this film prophetic but it certainly makes the common playground wisdom of fool me once shame on you fool me twice shame on me come alive br br our government learned nothing from the 1993 attempt on the world trade center and subsequent readings of the 9 11 report show that many of the mistakes that led to the bombing in 1993 were repeated br br some people have criticized the first and fourth of the us constitution as being partly responsible for the islamic terrorists being able to carry out their evil plans but that is wrong headed in every possible way br br surely the people making this argument are not supporting a ban on free speech a free press or freedom of religion i certainly hope they are not supporting our government officials being able to break into any person's home or office to search without cause or without a warrant br br the fact is the fbi the ins and even the local police could have gotten warrants based on the information they had in their possession but they chose not to for a variety of reasons besides no matter how distasteful or ignorant it is it is not illegal to speak badly about america or its leaders likewise it is not illegal to either own guns or to pray toward mecca br br consider this until lee harvey oswald actually fired his rifle at president john kennedy he wasn't really breaking any laws living in a free society has its drawbacks br br still path to paradise is a must see film that i am afraid will never be seen by that many people as far as i know it is not on dvd and 2007 is its tenth anniversary and there are no known revivals of it br br i'm not really surprised people don't like to document their failures and this film certainly shows that the various agencies that were supposed to protect us did not do their jobs right and for the of reasons like squabbles and a refusal to share information br br this is a shame as path to paradise is well done and gripping and as many have stated before the final scene where yousef played by art malik the bomber who built the truck bomb that was used in the first attempt at destroying the two towers is flying past the world trade center after his capture and simply says next time we will bring them both down is a film moment that froze me in place for several minutes
<START> after watching a texas tale of treason you feel a renewed disgust for the nature of the hollywood beast inside the interviews and conversations of all involved with the project there is a common sense of comradery and rebelliousness that spans backgrounds social and even geography this can be attributed to hard work on the entire production's undying commitment to the project and the love the of the story from the original film and the complete creation of vacuum that is it's creator the scale of people involved in hawaiian holiday was amazing to me at a no budget no glory production there were no trailers or craft services no amenities at all and yet everyone involved stuck right there with it if nothing ever comes of this project productions have laid their foundation for being a serious honest company that's never going to lay down and take it or sell out and make a movie just for the money i'd like to see any l a director go through the guerrilla process to get a shot more realistic true to life cinema is lacking in this time of cg and green screens the masses may enjoy their entertainment spoon fed to them in nice bite sized censored calm bits but there is a large group of people out here in the world that share the opinions and insights of the filmmakers that still make films for the love of the material or love of storytelling not dvd sales or box office i loved this documentary and i hope that ifc has the to pick it up and air it so that maybe just maybe one more person will decide to pick up a camera and film some real life so we the viewer can have even a temporary understanding that everyone everywhere is the same and anyone anywhere can be a true storyteller
<START> i remember all the hype around this movie when aaliyah was killed being a fan of ms rice's novels my first thought was how can they do queen of the damned without doing vampire lestat first br br having finally seen the movie now i can see how they did it if you have read these books imagine taking out the gory parts from vampire lestat cramming marcus and marius into one character and removing everything to do with beginning the wolf hunt his violin playing the theatre of the vampires and also louis claudia and gabrielle then in the last 15 minutes cramming in queen of the damned br br what we loose is a very important piece of character his inner agony of having to kill to live the fact that he carefully tries to select killers as his victims and his love hate relationship with louis armand gabrielle and all the other vampires br br also important to the story is that we loose the story of the twins which is the genesis of ms rice's vampires and while i am sure the cannibalism was to intense for showing on the screen they could have done something closer and showed us more of ancient egypt br br even worse we have this love interest thrown in between jessie and lestat the vampire chronicles is basically an american story for those that do not know is another form of hentai japanese porn comics but in it is about gay male relationships told by a female while i am sure many men object to the gayness of the characters in this movie they went to the far extreme the opposite way for instead of lestat killers he goes after young female groupies br br and the other flaws in logic and storyline are vast at the beginning lestat emerges from a century long sleep then later on asks marius how he made it through the 1950's in red velvet marius has no idea who elvis is and says he slept through that period makes you wonder how lestat knows about 50's fashion and music since he slept through the same time period himself and nothing is ever even mentioned about louis claudia or gabrielle i think that is a huge shame is like seeing snow white and the 3 dwarfs br br overall the movie i thought was really bad about the only good thing about it was the soundtrack most of the acting was poor the accents drove me up the wall and all of the really in depth parts of the book were removed leaving us only with a hollow shell kind of like after he was sucked dry br br if you want to see a good modern vampire movie get lost boys the original interview with a vampire or even some old episodes of dark shadows let this one rest in piece with a stake through the heart of garlic around the neck and a vial of holy water in the mouth br br in ending remember that before aaliyah was killed this was intended to go straight to video no theatrical release was planned it is obvious now why this was it is only sad that somebody as talented as she will be remembered for this dog of a movie instead of something where she really might have shined br br i rate this a 2 on a scale of 1 10
<START> itÂ´s a movie to see on tv and only once i mean itÂ´s good but itÂ´s a little too lengthy and the plot is so well known it isnÂ´t very original but it isnÂ´t boring the best thing of the movie are the performances natalie portman and susan sarandon are great actress and in this movie they have done a great job i give it a 7
<START> is a murder mystery these movies tend to be popular br br and the 6 9 rating it currently has suggests that it has been too br br unfortunately this movie has no redeeming qualities whatsoever br br a few non spoilers for instance include a 5 minute scene br br wherein the main character eats an apple and another 3 minutes br br where he breathes br br in case you were wondering this is not in fact art neither is it a br br commentary on humanity which from the title it seems it is trying br br to be it is in fact boring there are numerous attempts in this br br movie to say something about humanity one might think to br br how would i comment on humanity and the most br br obvious and boring answers will of course be sex love and death br br not that these options are uninteresting when done well just that br br they are the canonical options for sex this movie does its best to br br make it unattractive and disgusting in your first five minutes br br hence this is not a spoiler you will see the bloodied vagina of a br br murdered 11 year old girl it's a murder mystery remember later br br on a few people throw themselves at each other and have what br br the director would like us to believe is raw sex but in reality it's br br contrived and overly symbolic but worse yet so br br i enjoy being disturbed by movies this movie showed me why br br disturbing movies usually show something inside of someone br br their humanity which they did not know existed and are a bit br br scared of tried to do just this and failed and i walked br br out of the theatre not disturbed but disgusted thinking that i had br br wasted my time in the theater despite having seen the movie for br br free
<START> this movie was ridiculous from the start let me save you all time from watching this movie a woman who sells corn liquor to the locals takes in her cousin or nephew and he convinces her to open a cafÃ© downstairs from her home she does and she and the cousin become close there is a scene later where she is locking lips with him later the woman finds out an old boyfriend is coming back from jail and its tense between them leading to a down and out fist fight in the cafÃ© the woman's cousin nephew is enamored by the man the ending was awful the story was awful and if i could get back the time wasted on this movie i would appreciate it a definite skip
<START> i saw this movie as a child and fell in love with it it has a sweet sensitive story something children can appreciate i loved so much as a child i had to find it for my daughter it is definitely a movie i would watch with kids it reminds me a great deal of story's of a disney nature like pete's dragon and mary poppins both because of the live action and cartoon features but on its premise it is also a good story to show kids that if they tell the truth they can be trusted and adults will listen to them i think all kids should see it and would enjoy it it is such a break from the violent movies of bad taste so many kids watch these days it has all the charming qualities so many of today's movies don't have
