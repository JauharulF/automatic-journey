<START> tedium as only the french can do it i checked my watch for the first time 7 minutes in and with minutes left i also considered walking out i won't even try to discuss the incoherence of the plot or the inability of the characters to be personable because at about 1 hour in i realized none of this mattered it was not merely self indulgent or pretentious it was a vacuum a soul sucking vacuum this film has no saving grace no enjoyable character nothing funny and nothing sad it isn't smart enough to be drama and there's no moment that's in the slightest bit farcical the most intriguing thing about this movie is how it has managed to get mostly glowing and positive reviews i was tricked by those reviews but you don't have to be gentle reader all i want for christmas is my three hours back
<START> i've never seen a show with as much story mystery suspense and hard hitting excitement before i barley watch tv anymore but i own every season of this show and it's amazing every episode is extremely well acted written and plotted towards the end of the show i felt that the stories were getting too far fetched for being in a prison but the actors pulled it off sucks huge compared to oz in fact any show that is on a cable network hbo or not just cant hold a candle to oz i wish it would come back for one more season if it did happen they would probably kill off every character on the show but hey we all gotta go sometime as far as the characters i'd say o'reily and were my favorites both were in a scene together but their individual stories i thought were the strongest of anyones except of course but still anyway best show ever best network ever some of the best actors ever period
<START> a beautiful magical thought provoking and heart warming story excellent direction perfect cast marvellous script excellent score beautifully lit need i say more br br if you love films that not only make you think but also warm your heart some that spring to mind are of dreams' and 'groundhog day' then you're sure to love k pax br br most highly recommended
<START> my first film saw it on ifc long ago and loved it it seemed absolutely artistic original fun and hilarious not a moment in the film let me down or made me bored and i was laughing a lot or had a smile on my face i mean this movie is truly funny but here's the catch it's also very artistic and creative if you don't know probably sadly because so many of his great films aren't available here he has a very original style like no one else's and for me this isn't even my favorite film of his right now it's the insane also i have to say as a russian this film is great because you really do see what russians are like and this is possible because this is a true russian film to me not a foreign film trying to be american or trying to appeal did not sell out nor has he since 1998 was as good if not better this is true russian style filmaking that came out of communist social realism br br if you liked this film i think you have a very high chance of loving other films in fact i like quite a few of them more than this one i guess this one is his most accessible film a similar film is fountain taking place 6 years before during perestroika it has the same actor in the leading role and more of regulars who you will recognize from window to paris this one has one supernatural twist in the end but is mostly a realistic comedy a great one viva hopefully criterion will hook all of his movies up one day he's still working and his catalog is so great see any of his films if you can
<START> this 'documentary' sheds absolutely no light on what it would be like to be backstage during the hard knock life tour granted i wasn't there but watching this film didn't make me feel like i was and for a film like this that's not exactly a compliment the whole time i watched it all i could think was what are they leaving out when it's all over the only rapper you feel like you have some insight into is and that's mainly because he just talks about his dogs a waste of time br br 3 10
<START> i first saw this film in 1959 at the hoyts double bay cinema in sydney when fifteen years old i loved it then and still do the ensemble cast is great in those days the actors acted naturally and you felt for them in the respective roles a glossy film of the period the relationships therein still relevant to today's world but now the sexes are on the same level women would not or should not allow the type of treatment displayed in the past the soundtrack music is wonderful and it is a delight that film score monthly released the cd in january 2005 pity scenes were cut prior to release even at two hours you want more i have registered with amazon for the dvd they do now have a special page to view this film in cinemascope after forty six years of pan and scan will be great twentieth century fox please look further into your of fifties cinemascope productions for dvd there is a large market out there i await arrival from us of march 2004 vanity fair special article on the film which is said to be fifteen pages with many photos on set cheers
<START> this film an early william wellman has an important message particularly today it posits the notion that sometimes there are things more important than your own personal or well being the film which has walter huston as the lead is stolen by the performance of chic sales as grampa he's the most completely drawn character in the film and a joy to watch you'll recognize some familiar faces if you watch many movies from the and '30's your time to watch if you get the opportunity recommended
<START> i don't think i'm spoiling anyone's experience of this film by telling you not to see it if you have anything better to do like clean under the stove it gets dirty under there and you've gotta clean it sometime br br i think the movie suffers from a lack of sex and violence though there is one car chase stunt that looks so dangerous it could only have been filmed in a country where life is cheaper than beer gargoyle 's heart is in the right place but its aspirations are conservative it is at least not pretentious but i had a great time acting in it playing the perennial idiot in the horror movie who says what's down this hole and dies for his hubris plus i got to meet michael pare every film junkie should work with a b movie staple at least once before death and romanians are the loveliest people i've met literally the loveliest walk down the street in if 7 of every 10 women aren't absolutely beautiful you're walking down a street i didn't come across and be consoled by the fact that at least 5 of the 10 are available for drinks br br part of the film was shot in casa radio an abandoned unfinished classic communist bloc cum georgian nightmare originally intended to house kgb propaganda i e radio not so free europe the building's five stories tall and takes up a city block best of all while its facade radiates big state solidity it resides near the city center like a post apocalyptic ruin in a jungle of burdock and peopled by dozens of gypsies and scores of wild dogs construction on casa radio was suspended when and his wife were executed on tv in 1989 and still there are gaping holes that drop from the sun baked top floor offering surreal vistas of a modern quarter mile stretch of concrete roof decorated with jutting rebar and old car parts overlooking a crumbling ancient city all the way down to the damp creepy sub basement which doubles in the film for the gargoyle lair no american style or warning signs for br br since the demise of the soviet union casa radio has hosted several non union film shoots including highlander iii it is attractive to producers because it's a cheap location massive in terms of scale and available space bizarre looking and free of insurance headaches as it's still state property plus no one complains if you don't clean up after your production anything left is interpolated into the resident construction of their shanty town in this actual urban jungle br br an assistant director was bitten bloody by a wild dog during the shoot of gargoyle the apples provided by catering were pressed into service by cast and crew as projectiles in order to keep the prowling dogs at bay i too was bitten by wild dogs in once in a bar and once in a city park i also survived two car wrecks in two weeks both in taxis and neither of which was seen by the drivers involved as grounds for stopping the cars br br geek note the sci fi network or channel or whatever was one of the backers of this film the smaller the budget the more producers on set so it's a little weird that nobody had a problem with the original title gargoyles until it was almost time to show it on the network even though sci fi already had an unrelated series of that name the title was changed sometime relatively close to release as i have a color corrected copy labeled with the former title
<START> this film plays like a demented episode of vh1's where are they now or behind the music in the first half of the movie that depict his glory days abbie hoffman is unintentionally portrayed as a sort of delusional rock star you know the kind the lead singer the pretty boy who didn't write any of the music doesn't have a clue but gets all the glory for nothing and chicks for free consequently he takes his success for granted abuses it and ultimately destroys it along with himself indeed hoffman's glory days ended abruptly when he was busted for dealing cocaine skipped bail and went into hiding br br the second part of the movie deals with that time in hiding in it we see hoffman as a pathetic crybaby endlessly blaming everyone anyone but himself for his downfall eventually the times pass him by completely and he can never to come to grips with that how sad the end end credits roll and oh no we learn that abbie hoffman eventually committed suicide in 1989 br br i'm sure this is not the image the filmmakers intended for hoffman in making this movie given that tom hayden and gerald were involved i'm sure they intended this film as some kind of homage to the life of a man who was after all an icon of the 60's and of the anti war movement in this they have failed miserably the film presents abbie hoffman as a mindless caricature we are never told about what drives him how did he arrive at his views how did he manage to capture the imagination of a whole generation how did he organize such a vast movement why at the height of his fame did he get involved in dealing cocaine why who knows and since the filmmakers don't seem to ultimately who cares
<START> the worst movie i have ever seen the sound quality was bad the cutting of the scenes was even worse and above all it was not logic and it had no speed br br i first tought oh no i don't want the trail that proves that poor patrick was an innocent killer but this turned out to be even worse typically in this american film you get a super hint or no hints at all i want very tiny small hints that direct you to the killer the audience isn't involved and now when i don't get any hints at all you can expect a several 's he is the killer' sweeps in the end and that is not all ah this is hopeless lets make an end to it br br in one word disgusting br br
<START> nothing about this movie is any good it's a formulaic predictable romantic comedy geared to make females force their significant others to watch in other words it's a predictable chic flick that is neither comedic or romantic and is extraordinarily forgettable if you like watching the same thing over and over then this movie will fit just perfect i was also forced to watch this with my g f at the time and it's no surprise we are no longer together i enjoy great movies that are wonderful to watch while she just wants to see the same thing over and over again just with different actors nothing good to say about this movie the title says it all 1 10 one b c i can't give it a zero
<START> i usually don't consider turning a movie off unless it's really bad homegrown is a movie i wish i hadn't even turned on the plot is interesting but the acting and writing are too low key i didn't care about the characters any movie that has drug use and gratuitous nudity as its highlights is not worthy of praise the characters spent their time getting high and believe me that's the only way to sit through this movie
<START> about the movie itself there are ample comments br br i just wanted to say something about the german version which i have seen recently on tv it is heavily cut from 103 to 76 minutes it is usual that the most bloody scenes are cut for german tv i understand the reasons for that but this movie was something else they did not only cut gore shots they have cut entire sequences sparing only glimpses like we have to attack them one 5 second shot of explosions in the camp protagonist running away br br when the assault on the island begins it isn't even possible anymore to follow the storyline all the cuts create something that amounts to a string of erratic disconnected scenes that don't make any sense anymore br br i could not stand to watch the end after spending 60 minutes on this nonsense br br i think i would have given the original 7 10 the german version is worth only 1 10 br br get it on dvd and check the runtime first or forget about it
<START> in his feature film debut yellow ' chris chan lee attempts to enlighten hollywood's portrayal of asian americans by departing from the stereotypes typically depicted in mainstream film however in so doing lee commits a far more heinous crime he exaggerates asian americans' own stereotypes of themselves to the point of incredulity the result dreadfully one dimensional characters and an outrageously shallow script triggers the cast into a frenzy of over acting ultimately resulting in a film that is physically painful to watch br br don't be deceived by any of the positive reviews garnered by each falls into one of two camps in one corner e g right here on imdb com you find asian americans who are so elated that an asian character can be depicted onscreen without thick glasses and a math book that they somehow neglect the idiocy of lee's final product on the other hand you find movie critics who have simply presumed that it'd be uncool to give the thorough bashing that it deserves after all it's an edgy asian american film made by an independent asian american filmmaker protected territory for now br br case example main character sin lee michael chung writer director lee accomplishes a monumental feat with sin by editing in such a way that sin never appears onscreen unless he is either scowling or yelling see sin his friends' support scowl see sin walk along the beach and brood scowl yelling ensues see sin closing up his father's shop scowl see sin urinating scowl see sin breathing scowl br br gee i wonder if sin is full of asian american angst do you think i'm not sure scowl scowl br br just to be thorough lee introduces us to father lee soon oh throughout the movie whereas sin simply scowls or yells mr lee scowls and yells in fact this is principal role in simultaneous scowling and yelling br br gee i wonder if is an asian father with an authority complex do you think i'm not sure scowl yell br br if lee's one dimensional characters don't annoy you his story line will meet mina mary chen and joey john cho two characters that exist in this film solely for the purpose of spinning a tangential and entirely irrelevant love story into the film you see lee learned in film school that every good movie must include some sort of love related subtext and these two characters allow him to fulfill the obligation mina and joey's excruciatingly inane flirting dialogue consists of one liner insults culminating in a kiss nerd ' ' eyes meet understanding smile kissing ensues br br but rest assured somewhere out there sin is scowling while this all takes place br br that neither mina nor joey contributes in any way whatsoever to the film's plot does not perplex me so much as lee's insistence on the most hackneyed movie cliches to accomplish his and trust me the flirting sequence is just the tip of the iceberg br br towards the end of the film we find lee attempting to explain his constant scowling and yelling to girlfriend teri mia in what i am sure lee meant to be a poignant moment what a surprise as invokes a metaphorical story about the homeland to illustrate his point ripped straight out of reader's digest his voice quivers in that extra special paternal way the camera pans into an obligatory shot of trembling hands we feel compelled to roll our eyes except we realize that explanation makes no sense whatsoever but lack of substance didn't stop lee from making the movie so why would he cut this particularly ineffective scene after all the world can always use another clichÃ© br br well you say the movie may be painful but at least it must be a technical masterpiece say like what dreams may come ' sorry on a technical basis disappoints as well lee's edits are awkward and disrupt what little rhythm exists in the film at all but i'm sure lee thought they would seem hip to make matters worse every frame is either or overexposed although the light meter was invented in 1932 somehow the technology didn't make it onto the set br br in light of the film's utter deficiency supporting actor burt who plays best friend alex performs relatively well although overacts slightly you can't really blame him when lee's script consists solely of scowling and yelling castmates on the other hand show no restraint in their overacting whatsoever br br i have not seen a film as bad as in a very long time and i truly pray that i will not see a film as bad as for quite some time as well please do not waste see it life is already way too short thank you
<START> 1 thing this movie sucks big time i was into singaporean comedy when rice war came along but this time even singh well done acting cant pull this one of a total failure of following shaolin soccer next time do ur own thing
