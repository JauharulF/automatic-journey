<START> although i liked this western i do have to say it's not one of my favourite john ford westerns for me it just lacks a certain something that most of his other films the ones i have seen anyway possess i'm nit sure what that something is it's not something tangible anyway the gist of the story is about a mormon wagon train which is being used by a band of outlaws as a hideout from a pursuing posse ford employs a lot of his regulars here there are some interesting characters some nice scenery a bit of action and excitement it all adds up to a watchable experience it's certainly not boring just not quite up to the usual john ford standard for me wagon master is a 7 10
<START> in short this movie was awful br br i understand it's a disney movie which are generally shallow movies with mediocre plots and bad acting however i must say this is the worst of all disney movies with bad acting lots of irritating shrieking teen girls my god and an extremely unrealistic plot even as a 12 year old there is no way i would have liked this movie the only way this movie could have been any worse is if they attempted to put it in theaters or tried to sell it in a local video store br br do yourself a favor and change the channel before watching this no matter how bored you are on a sunday afternoon
<START> creation is a great example of how not to make a movie first there was a book written with a great humor book that has numerous fans who would be happy to supply help when producers for some reasons decided to employ people who hardly heard of the book in the first place then came a script as humorless and full of nonsense as possible at the same time the script was written in a way to allow only those who actually had read the books to understand anything of the plot not that anything in this movie made much sense anyway ex i'm like an ice shard you can burn yourself said as a word of warning warning that logic is something this movie seriously lacks to add to that we have to mention that no matter the amount of money that was supposedly spent on the movie everything looks like an amateur production with two 2 computer effects one of which is a see through dragon even the costumes look as if the were borrowed from a really poor theater that is the better ones look this way and to add to that we have a few 'naked scenes' put there only so they will be in the film because they have no explanation in what one may mercifully call plot the movie has only one strength that can hardly make up for the rest music is not bad though if i was to choose i'd prefer to have it separately it sounds better if you don't have to look at this failure of super production
<START> hilarious clean light hearted and quote worthy what else can you ask for in a film this is my all time number one favorite movie ever since i was a little girl i've dreamed of owning a blue van with flames and an observation bubble br br the clichÃ© characters in ridiculous situations are what make this film such great fun the wonderful comedic chemistry between stephen furst harold and andy tennant make up most of my favorite parts of the movie and who didn't love the hopeless awkwardness of don't forget the airport antics of leon's cronies dressed up as hari dancing chanting and playing the tambourine unbeatable the clues are genius the locations are classic and the plot is timeless br br a word to the wise if you didn't watch this film when you were little it probably won't win a place in your heart today but nevertheless give it a chance you may find that it doesn't matter what you say it doesn't matter what you do you've gotta play
<START> not only was this film exhilarating but it took me back down memory lane with its true to life sound track these were the things we were saying and doing these were the songs we were listening to all during this same time period in the same era way down south in alabama i may not have been one of the skateboard set but i was definitely one of the observers sitting on the curb with the old radio listening to neil young watching those more brave than i ever hoped to be as they put the spin on their surfboards on wheels applying the tricks of and adams hoping that maybe just maybe for a brief moment they'd adopt the style it just goes to show how much alike we all were during those wonderful days
<START> this movie gives a cinematic example of the word worthless it's awful you can forget plot or decent acting cause it's not there and with the dismissal of any decent story or acting or even the trait of being frightening then there is usually only one plus left for a horror film the appeal to those who like soft core porn this film doesn't even have that the women show a little skin but not really anymore than say the xena show except for the main star who is not particularly attractive and has a couple of poor and i mean poor sex scenes so in short if you like good movies you have no interest in this film if you like cheese you still don't have any reason to rent this film if you like erotica and soft core porn you really have no motive to rent this film and most importantly if you value your time in the slightest you cannot do better than to avoid this movie
<START> the good news the director is reportedly committed to the cause of amnesty international and eager to deliver a solid message about the freedom of expression and the evil of oppression the plot is distinctly original and the actors are two of my absolute favourites the not so good news 'original' is not everybody's when visiting the movies or video stores also noted critics like mr maltin and roger ebert have dismissed the film as a genuinely failed attempt to convert a play from stage into cinematic form if i remember correctly the title is taken from the fairy tale stowe's character has written and which has made her a possible subversive and suspect person in the fictitious place where the story takes place her dreams are dangerous to the government represented here by rickman as the intense manipulative interrogator since those two people are virtually the only ones appearing in the film altogether the director is in for a real challenge in keeping the viewer's attention in the end i found the whole thing fascinating not flawless and definitely not for everyone but rewarding it's nowhere near a masterpiece like kieslowski's 'a short film about or as explanatory as 'dead man but if you're into those films or any of costa gavras political thrillers you may appreciate this one as well just don't expect any sermons or action sequences
<START> the fire gives all br br this is one of film's most masterful meditations on artistry set in 19th century korea it tells the story of the famous painter but rather than stick to saucy anecdote melodrama or psychological egg hunting it portrays a series of episodes throughout his life all of which are beautiful works of art in themselves it gives no interpretation of these episodes but leaves them for the viewer to ponder along with the paintings of himself in this way the viewer enters into the same sort of contemplation as and minus his talent can feel their way into the inspiration of his paintings br br part of why this is so effective is the utterly masterful evocation of 19th century korea and the musical artistic world that moved in there are so many gorgeous shots of the world outside the paintings that we get a mirror effect where we see the beautiful world inspiring living and looking in that world and the works of art he creates all mirroring off one another br br the story is told with extreme economy a feeling evoked is hardly ever lingered with or explained it just appears quickly then is gone for the next one to appear as an analogy it is a sort of work of art endless and quick succession of great ideas rather than obsessive lingering on one great idea it has a classical restraint much like paintings there is really no music hinting how to feel except a few classical korean pieces used with great effectiveness in several scenes and mostly played by characters in the movie one haunting image if i remember correctly is of a flock of birds soaring away over the blue mountains while a female singer croons br br this life is like a dream and only death will awaken us br br one telling line of advice in the film from one of teachers is that the painting lies between the strokes the film follows that attitude as there is so much matter between what is spoken and described in the film i have seen it twice and it was very rewarding on the second viewing a very terse film with little in the way of explanation one could see how it is film it is an artistic masterwork like great friend and mentor tells him in describing one of his paintings not a single stroke is wasted br br i compare it to andrei in quality though in style it is very different it is much easier and more directly entertaining to watch but classical in form where andrei is gothic br br all in all highly recommended to almost anyone except appetite junkies both times i left the film i felt a wonderful spiritual renewal br br one point of life that me was that his mad drinking and raving began suddenly after visiting the noble who told him that good art can come only from great knowledge and learning the next brief scene was very angry and the next blasted drunk as he often remained for the remainder of the film i am curious why the nobles words effected him so much and drove him to the drinking that dominated the rest of his life or was it just a coincidence
<START> this movie is terrible it was so difficult to believe that katie became a heartfelt teenager with the power to save the pity chinese people the movie didn't show any convincing argument to prove that and the rest of the plot didn't make any effort to show us more than a cheap common sense br br the plot is ridiculous and the only thing we can extract from it is that it demonstrate how arrogant a human can be katie must have inherited her arrogance from her mother the most annoying character i have seen for a long time br br the acting and scenery were ok but the plot ruins everything full of cheap clichÃ©s and hypocritical scenes i expect not to see this movie again in my life skip this one
<START> being somewhat an independent filmmaker myself i really understand what these guys were trying to do and it sounds like a good idea on paper on 16mm film however it's awful i didn't realize the thing was made in the mid 90's because the film was so grainy and bad i would have sworn this was one of those 30 year old flicks where a porn producer tried to go mainstream and the sound ugh i don't know what kind of mic they were using to record but it sounds like someone is walking over dead leaves throughout the entire thing i guess i shouldn't judge too harshly after all how many feature films has my company put out none but i'd like to think that we'd at least have good picture and sound quality to go with our poor acting writing and directing a for idea f for execution
<START> i was first introduced to john waters films by seeing female trouble on ifc i was disgusted but for some sick reason i enjoyed it then i picked up the pink flamingos dvd in the john waters boxed set the movie is about babs johnson the filthiest person alive who lives in a trailer in maryland with her obese egg obsessed mother and her deranged son crackers in the movie you will see such sick sights as sex with chickens drag queens people eating feces torture and all other sorts of random humiliation the film has a soundtrack from 60's rock and roll artists the only problem is that some parts of the film seem to drag on and can get a little boring i found female trouble a little more fun rated nc 17 for explicit sex violence and disturbing images enjoy
<START> how do these guys keep going they're about 50 years old each and act as if they're only 30 they play 3 hours of music at every concert and barely break a sweat this dvd is their first concert in rio brazil although the people don't speak english they try to memorize the words to the most famous rush songs and try to sing a foreign language at the concert with their best friends br br from tom sawyer to the spirit of radio this concert dvd will keep you in the chair not wanting to pause or move away from the classics that you've listened to when you were young this is their 30th reunion tour started in 1974 i went to their scranton pa concert and this was just as good although in pa they didn't play so i was upset br br they have they have the trees they have the pass driven red sector a limelight roll the bones and much more 10 out of 10 because nothing else compares if you never go to a rush concert then at least buy this dvd
<START> this is an excellent film but momento nolan's other big budget film is much better i would recommend people go to see momento and then if they like that see this film the film is shot in black and white which i was a bit annoyed with at first but once into the film you understand black and white is the best way for the film to be seen it is extremely gripping and reasonably easy to understand even though the way it is made is extremely clever elements of the storyline i think are a bit daft but the film is definitely worthy of a second viewing to the film has a clever plot clever twists and turns very good acting and bearing in mind the budget of the film i have to say that it is pretty amazing
<START> i just saw this film in austin texas at the austin gay and lesbian film festival and it was my festival favorite the gymnast is a film not to be missed it is an honest coming to terms story about relationships self discovery growing older and having the courage to change and move forward not only is this a good story but the glorious performances by weber and will take your breath away see this film it will be coming soon to a festival near you this film deserved to be picked up right away by a major network or studio i will certainly purchase this when it becomes available on dvd
<START> having been born and raised in odessa and having graduated from the other high school in the late 70's odessa high school i had mixed emotions about this movie i no longer live in odessa but will always be a texan at heart i didn't like the way that this town of 80 000 plus was portrayed as a dirt poor small town if i'm wrong about this please feel free to correct me but i believe ohs also plays in the town stadium and the home of the panthers sign that was shown at the stadium used to be at the practice field at i would have liked to have seen a little acknowledgment about the cross town rivalry of the big game in town every year ohs vs i am curious why the outcome of the game was altered though i think it would have been just as dramatic if the real outcome was portrayed overall the movie was okay made me a little homesick remembering the good old days of mojo
