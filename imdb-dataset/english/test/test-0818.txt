<START> police officer michael tomas the church has his hands full while investigating a serial killer who's been leaving parts of the bodies of the people that he's been murdering at the house of one recently widowed tracy joanna pacula mike has to find a way to stop the bodies from piling up while perhaps finding love in the process br br a feeling of the 'giallo' films of yore pervades this film even though we know who the killer is from the get go and the film contains a few good set pieces a scene later in the film set in a school for the blind being particularly memorable but it doesn't make all that much sense when all is said and done either all in all not nearly as good as bava's earlier macabre nor his first two demons films but enjoyable enough if you can forgive the rather outrageous plot twists towards the end of the film a pity the image entertainment dvd lacked extras of any kind as i would have been interested in some br br my grade c
<START> i know jesse franco is responsible for a wide variety of films and i mainly go for his horror films as lousy as they are at times i guess it was morbid curiousity that drew me to this and i wasn't even curious enough to finish it maybe it got better towards the end but unless you're into lesbian sex scenes of which there's plenty then you may want to take a pass so what exactly can you say about a movie that features a woman that pees in a bowl on the kitchen counter while standing up just never you mind what that's used for later you probably don't want to know if this sounds intriguing to you then that's your problem but then again you might just like this movie i myself am no prude i've seen plenty of disgusting movies in my day but at least they were done well and this isn't sometimes too much is just too much bleah
<START> its the best movie i have seen in 2000 it has the beautiful and talented natalie portman in it it has a great storyline cast and soundtrack i enjoyed it very much 10 out of 10
<START> when you look at the cover and read stuff about it an entirely different type of movie comes to mind than what you get here then again maybe i read the summary for the other movie called instead as there were two movies of this title released about the same time with both featuring plots that had key elements in common however reading stuff about that movie here i know i saw this one and not that one and that movie is even less what one would imagine a movie with that title would be about i will be honest i expect more of a zombie type picture and you get that in this movie to some degree however there is more stuff involving the occult and strange powers as the opening scene of the people being taken away by the coroner at the beginning of the film will attest to the movie also has the old theme of kids going somewhere they do not belong to have some crazy party in this case it is in fact a mausoleum the other movie i do not think really has that key feature playing that prominent role in the movie and i see the score for this one is higher too still it was just not the movie i was expecting
<START> recently released on british dvd this is a good movie as long as you have an attention span and iq of more than a fruit fly not as depressing as it could have been this is kitchen sink at its most dirty terrance stamp is great in it the music is sweet carol white is very believeable as the single mum tart who can't stop loving criminals br br my favourite scene is where carol and her friend who works in the pub with her the one with the enormous beehive hairdo which comes down over one eye sit and gossip about all the men who walk past br br the only thing that marred this was the shakey acting of carol's first husband but if you can get past that you're ok and donovan provides some of the most languid mellow bittersweet lyrics to come out of the 60s
<START> like almost everyone else i became aware of this turkey on mystery science theater 3000 it easily ranks as one of my favorite mst3k episodes of all time i really couldn't imagine attempting to watch this film on it's own though it's really really really really really really really really really really bad br br miles o'keeffe stars as ator a muscle bound fabio wannabe who lives during the time of cave men we the viewer are asked to suspend our disbelief in that he knows alchemy and chemistry and can manage to build a complete hang glider in about 5 minutes yeah right there's also a fairly attractive actress can't remember her name who wears a hub cap as a chest shield oh and i can't forget that wacky asian side kick thong he had the easiest role in the movie since he doesn't utter one word of dialogue throughout the entire movie he had to figure out how to make his character interesting without talking and he failed miserably br br the film isn't watchable in any way and should be only viewed in it's proper mst3k format if you watch that version you'll laugh yourself silly br br i'm huge br br rating 1
<START> robin williams is a genius one of the best comedians in the world he really shows off in this one cracking jokes left and right as the talk show comedian tom dobbs from the previous this looked like it would be a side splitting laugh fest and it was funny but there were a lot of serious parts in the movie that i was not expecting i would describe it as a drama comedy but it's still worth the money to see and i still found it to be almost everything that i expected robin williams is at his best along with the famous christopher walken they play a very good team in this movie and i was actually shocked to see how well the two were able to work together i recommend it to anyone who is looking for a light hearted movie
<START> spoilers shocking yet true story of the horror that befell the alabama georgia border town of when it was taken over by a gang of organized hoodlums who turn it into the sin city of the south br br with crime and no one to turn to a group of concerned citizens get well respected lawyer albert patterson john mcintire to run for the office of state district attorney with the criminal element of doing everything from intimidation to outright murder to keep the voters form getting patterson the nomination he still wins with the other 86 of the state not including russell county giving him the nod by just over 1 000 votes br br terrified in what patterson would do when he takes office head of the mob tanner edward andrews has a hit put out on him patterson is gunned down while driving to his office but his killers are spotted by ellie rhodes kathryn grant who soon becomes through an informer in office next person in line to be targeted for murder what tanner co didn't expect is that the late albert son john richard kiley got the news from ellie about his dad's murder before his boys could shut her up that major miscalculation on part will end up putting an end to both his criminal organization as well as his freedom br br powerful documentary style crime movie with the actual persons involved in the events given some 15 minutes at the start of the film to tell their stories this despite the fact that they were still in danger of being murdered by the tanner mob that was still at large at the time their interviews were filmed br br finishing what his brave dad started john patterson single handedly brought the story of city to the front pages of both the state and national newspapers giving tanner the very negative publicity that he tried so hard to avoid with the now alabama national guard flooding into city the blood thirsty and gutless in not willing to stand up to people with guns in their hands tanner mob evaporated from sight like a morning mist after the sunlight hits it and with john patterson now taking the place of his murdered dad as the state of alabama's new attorney general you can be sure that the patterson mob has seen its last days of pushing people around as well as murdering them the only thing that they'll see now in the future is the gray prison walls and bars that will be their home sweet home for the rest of their rotten and miserable lives br br very probably the most graphically violent movie to come out of hollywood up to that time the city story didn't pull any punches in showing how a group of lawless and powerful criminals can turn a quite american city into living hell for everyone in it no one was speared from these ruthless gangsters who didn't even think twice when it came to murdering even women and children if that's what it took to keep them in power as for the city police they had better thing to do then enforced the law that they were sworn and paid to uphold they were out having coffee and while their city was being burned to the ground by the gangsters like tanner who had them in their hip pocket
<START> it's difficult to find anything worth of praise with this movie it's not the worst picture ever made but that's not saying a whole lot the plot is quite incoherent and unbelievable it seems that the producers wanted to make a space movie but decided to make it underwater to cash in at the success of the abyss in some scenes it seems as if the story indeed was set to outer space initially the sub has a landing gear the technicians are worried of a rip in a rubber diving suit at the depths of several kilometers where the pressure would crush the diver and the suit like an empty beer can br br the movie starts out okay with planning of a recovery of a lost naval sub after that the movie takes a plunge along with the siren 2 br br effects are so so the screens are all done on commodore 64 remember this is 1990 not 1983 the sub is controlled like no other sub ever instead of control consoles the officers have keyboards with which they enter long number sequences to control various functions of the ship the interior of the ship isn't too convincing either br br the final scenes leap from awkward to absurd welcome to the fifties you can check your suspension of disbelief at the door br br i fail to see enjoyment factor here the movie is neither good nor hilariously bad mst3k style until you get to the final scene it's like eating a slightly bad apple
<START> i normally love jackie chan movies but this one was terrible there are only 2 or 3 fight scenes all of which are up to normal standard more or less the bad thing about this movie is it focuses a lot on car chasing racing the car chase isn't so bad though not as exciting as fighting but the car racing at the end is exceptionally boring basically it takes all of things that make a jackie chan film a jackie chan film and leaves out everything except jackie chan even the traditional outtakes at the end lack their usual humour br br i suppose to a certain extent it was made worse by the fact i saw one of those horrible dubbed versions i usually try to see the subtitled version i wish i could understand chinese br br i've only seen one jackie film worse that this one and that was one of his early forays into hollywood films that didn't turn out so well br br avoid unless really curious or a lover of motor sports
<START> bad bad bad br br this is another stupid movie still don't know what is the language of this movie is or french or german you have to be speaking all 3 languages at least italian too to understand it poor quality translation with very hard to read font showing a very stupid way of ending this movie in the mid of the movie you will lose interest in this movie and start to think why am i watching this brad pitt is proving that his acting talent is going down br br maybe this is the movie number 1000000 that talks about nazis is there any other subjects that hollywood can produce i think this movie is another american propaganda to show super heros american i expect next hollywood movie is american hero will save jesus
<START> bedrooms and hallways was one of the funniest films of the 1999 melbourne film festival from the uk it is about a young crowd of flatmates and their various relationship dilemmas much of the humour is centred around a new agey men's self help group where they pass around various implements like the 'rock of truth' they also go on a weekend with hilarious results trust me you'll laugh your teeth out
<START> is it only now that you notice the links between all the characters of course it's libby and for the guy in the hatch with desmond any deja vu yeah he was the same guy that gave money to sayid after he's killed or tortured the other soldier in the episode 14th of the 2nd season one of them well actually it's not completely the same guy he's named joe in the 14th episode and kelvin in the last 2 episodes twins who knows jj abrams mmmm i'm not even sure of that there are hundreds of links like this one between all the characters br br but that was just in response to the libby comment br br i found those 2 episodes far more interesting than the whole season 2 during all that season i felt that there was lots of things i've missed and very few things i've learned especially at the very beginning the 1st episode of the 2nd season is excellent and then the 2nd one is a kind of flash back of the 1st one i found that disappointing even if i'm pretty sure that everything in lost tend to have a meaning that was just an example of how i was frustrated watching those episodes br br let's go back to the last 2 episodes i think we've learned more new things in those 2 episodes than in the entire season but all we learn are little pieces for the next puzzle like the involvement of relatives sorry if i spoil too much believe me or not i'm trying not to for example so lots of things evoked in the past 2 seasons are still unclear or have been developed once then nothing and still there's new material as if all the holes in the picture were not enough we all want to see the big picture of all of it of course but i think we'll have to be very very patient i hope there will be only 3 seasons i'm not sure i will watch more than 3 seasons anyway there was also lots of actions in the very last episode and a good cliffhanger at the very end br br so basically yes i loved that last episode and yes i want to see the third season
<START> throw momma hasn't dated at all it's as funny now as when it was released a genuinely eccentric comedy that doesn't try too hard to be liked and is all the better for it full of memorable laugh out loud lines even small characters are well written and beautifully played like billy crystal's best friend's girlfriend and a lovely cameo from rob reiner as crystal's agent a little bit insane and a lot funny
<START> i fear you speak upon the rack where men enforced do speak anything this shakespearean line from the merchant of venice is echoed again in the new film rendition which introduces the viewer to the enhanced methods of interrogation renditions which began in the clinton administration and have become more commonplace since the terror attacks of september 11 2001 br br the film features an all star cast with oscar winners meryl streep alan arkin and reese witherspoon as well as peter sarsgaard jake gyllenhaal and omar supporting roles filled by unfamiliar actors deliver as well sucking the audience into the plot and showing how many people can be affected by overseas terror attacks and our means of investigating them br br rendition follows an egyptian born terrorism suspect who is taken by u s officials following his flight from south africa to washington dc to an undisclosed prison overseas his pregnant wife witherspoon ventures to washington dc to find out about his disappearance through a family friend and senator's employee sarsgaard gyllenhaal plays a young cia analyst at the overseas detention facility who monitors the violent interrogation br br this film follows the emotional plights of the torture victim and those involved in obtaining the supposed information from him some like the cia analyst gyllenhaal are visibly shaken and horrified by the methods exercised while others the stern senator streep and foreign interrogator see it as necessary and effective br br the film may be described by some as a political piece but is ultimately an emotional one performance as the tortured prisoner is oscar worthy the film does not intend to preach but rather to question and inform the audience on a topic that does not often have a human face put on it renditions have been known to work but have also been known to produce false information from innocent prisoners the film simply depicts the emotional struggles of those involved in such grave business and does so in a way that will affect every viewer differently the film will keep your interest and have you engaged in each of the character's plights
