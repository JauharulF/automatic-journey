<START> they said it would be a film greater than turks fruit how dare br br they it's not even 10 of this classic bad acting the only character i felt sympathy for was the one br br played by angela her acting was the best in the whole film the story could've been interesting but it wasn't some scenes were very beautiful filmed lights and camera the br br opening scene for example but the bad acting made the magic br br disappear br br i really don't understand why so many people voted this film so br br good
<START> this show has an amazing plot with good and recognizable actors like the girl from boston legal and boris the butcher from snatch even the extras and the kid whom i thought from the commercial might be a weak link surprised me with his skill it's just the little things that the director needs to tweak like the guy who does the recap of the last episode at the beginning of each new episode needs to be fired having a narrator tell you what happened kind of ruins the story the only other small problem i had was that sometimes they take too long to do things but no where near as long as some shows like prison break anyone know when they will resume the season
<START> my introduction to a lifelong love of shakespeare my brother was 5 and i was not quite 7 when chicago broadcast an age of kings it became a family ritual to watch including the reruns as an autumn series my father used to buy us a rare treat for the midwest and my mother would pop corn on the stove wonderful acting from actors whose names meant nothing to me then although i will never forget the achingly young sean connery as but do now and they published the scripts in paperback so we could follow along and figure out the language i managed to memorize most of richard iii over that so glad to see it coming out on dvd highly recommended for all ages and any level of familiarity with shakespeare or english history
<START> a girl named isobel becomes possessed by a demon the local priest who formerly dated sister must try to save her but the bigger problems are with the family's suspicions of each other rather than the demon in their daughter br br this film is directed by ethan wiley the writer of house and the writer director of house ii i loved the first film and liked the second one even better so you would think this would be a winner alas this one looks like it was thrown together by first year film students dawson leery could have done better i have thought about blaming new writer eddy especially because the idea is hardly original are they trying to cash in on the fans of the exorcism of emily rose but wiley should have been able to do his magic br br also you'd like to think veteran horror stars jeffrey combs and james russo would help this film russo playing the bishop barely shows up and combs has a great role as a sheriff for the five minutes he's on screen but i love the mustache so no help here br br after seeing the exorcist all other exorcism films must be compared to the classic by default no and the demonic possession in this film was not scary in the least no head spinning or paranormal activity at all just a girl with a deep voice and runny makeup all the demonic stuff was centered around the father accusing everyone of sleeping with his wife as another reviewer wrote you get a lot of isobel bouncing on her bed like it's a trampoline hiding in her closet and jumping from a hay loft yeah it's chuck e cheese gone wild that sadly sums up the extent of the evil in this movie br br if you want to watch a movie about family members who invent accusations and yell at each other while the possessed daughter sits in another room off camera this is the movie for you but if you don't mind my saying so you have a horrible taste in film if this is what you're seeking br br the plot seems to focus on the father accusing a cowboy of sleeping with his wife who didn't but did sleep with his daughter and of the veterinarian of sleeping with his wife who might have but denies it and then you have a gardener who attacks the possessed girl with a crucifix and tells the family to call an exorcist but once the priest arrives the gardener declares he does not believe in god what was all the bible quoting you were doing five minutes ago br br a horrible exorcism movie examples of what combs and russo are capable of and such a sad display of directing after the house series of films became classic i would like to pretend wiley had no part in making this shamefully derivative and unoriginal uninspired film the power of christ compels you to avoid this movie as if viewing it were a cardinal sin
<START> i had always heard about this great mini series but viewed it for the first time this week july of 2007 i can see why it started the careers of so many young actors the story is intriguing and gives wonderful insights into the period before and during the civil war i cared about the characters and how their lives evolved during this period some of them were stereotypes but they still helped me see how people thought during the 1800's many historical facts were thrown into the story and it was interesting to see history books come to life the costumes and sets were gorgeous i thoroughly enjoyed watching both parts i and ii part iii is a disappointment
<START> the attic starts off well the somewhat dreary story is helped greatly by the two main actors and there's a semblance of a character study going on here but the film goes downhill fast when carrie character buys a monkey not one of those cute little monkeys she buys a real big chimpanzee br br this sudden plot device basically kills the movie it's just not conceivable for a woman like the one plays who has a hard time doing anything because of her domineering father for her to out of the blue buy a chimpanzee i mean come on forget about it
<START> during an eight year stretch of the 1980s when charles bronson made nine films only one was released by a company other than the cannon group 'the evil that men do ' a tristar films pickup from sir lew grade's itc entertainment firm bronson was already in the thick of his collaborations with director j lee thompson which ran through numerous actioners until forbidden in 1989 br br expectations should run pretty high with bronson and thompson working for a better funded outfit like itc but 'the evil that man do' is a great disappointment on many levels while still from the low budget b movie mold of the 1980s 'evil' has tantalizing potential for a great film everyone in the production department however took an easy way out and sold hack work undeserving of bronson's imprint 'the evil that men do' had a concept and technical resources that could have been used to make one of bronson and thompson's best films but instead will go down as one of their most average br br this 1984 political thriller actioner opens in brutal fashion with clement joseph maher a british doctor holding his special training class for political leaders in the gray haired passive is an expert on torture methods who is employed by numerous political regimes in the opening seven minutes we witness using electrical current to inflict unbearable pain on jorge hidalgo jorge humberto a dissident journalist as you may expect the scene is awful to watch and was cut from the original vhs release br br hidalgo was none other than a friend of holland bronson a retired assassin who is enjoying life in the cayman islands holland was approached by the journalist years before to rid humanity of but turned the offer down a mexican professor named hector josÃ© ferrer visits shortly after death to talk holland into finishing the job bringing videotapes of testimony from the doctor's victims while in denial at first holland eventually agrees to the dirty work targeting and his doting sister claire antoinette in guatemala br br holland enters guatemala city with help from an adviser max ortiz renÃ© he poses as a tourist with widow theresa saldana and young daughter sarah amanda nicole thomas in tow as with most of bronson's later output his character knocks off henchmen one by one crossing paths with a sleazy american diplomat john glover and his supporting hit man roger along the way a brutal ending takes place in the crevices of an mine where the doctor gets just deserts from several of his victims br br 'the evil that men do' is based on a forgotten novel by r lance hill and jumps at american political dealings in latin america during the 1980s indeed 'evil' is hard boiled in every sense of the term as it uses sensationalism and doses of brutality to cover up huge weaknesses in plot and character development for every plus this film has there are three or four minuses resulting from shod craftsmanship br br while 'the evil that men do' has a great concept the film is never truly more than an excuse for bronson to wipe out foreign based scum in the style of bad pulp fiction 'evil' is filled with cardboard characters that we never get to know or understand holland despite being played strongly by bronson never talks about his inner feelings or explains what motivated him into becoming a killer for hire a terribly weak part for theresa saldana is disgusted by holland for much of the way but later feels an affection for him where does her love come from especially after watching holland kill several people and wanting to go home just a few scenes before br br the most interesting characters are actually and his sister claire because so many questions can be asked of them naturally we never find out what has brought them so close together how and where their torture dealings started what claire's exact role in their business plot holes can go on forever especially with the paint by numbers storyline that seems to make things up as it goes along why is daughter brought into such a dangerous situation other than for her to be conveniently taken hostage by if bodyguard randolph raymond st jacques clearly saw holland and in the cockfight arena why is he so friendly with them in a bar afterwords is his memory that short and what really was the purpose other than cheap theatrics of holland throwing chauffeur jorge luke off a window ledge when the murder could have been handled more discreetly in claire's apartment br br the overall acting is decent and somehow bronson gives one of his strongest performances j lee thompson's direction is lacking at points but may have been compromised by limited time on site besides filming in mexico the presence of itc is clear through better production values cinematography and music rural locations are well used to convey the hot and dusty atmosphere of latin america and cinematographer xavier cruz provides rich color and clarity the orchestral score by ken thorne war' is refreshing in an era of synthesized junk oddly enough these positives only add to the frustration of a good movie that is screaming to come out peter lee thompson's editing is better than usual although with more laughable continuity errors br br 'the evil than men do' was perfect grindhouse material for the early 80s and i find it hard to recommend for 21st century action fans the dvd from columbia tristar entertainment is an okay presentation offering widescreen and standard format with four language subtitles while the video quality is well above average 'evil' was originally recorded in plain mono audio the theatrical trailer is offered and actually has a grindhouse feel with eroded color and fuzzy sound quality br br out of 4
<START> fred williamson one of the two or three top blaxploitation stars cynthia rothrock one of the two or three top american female action stars imagine a film with these two together for the first time now imagine the worst film that could possibly be made with these two together for the first time welcome to night vision of course this movie was made in 1997 and they were both past their prime but that doesn't mean they didn't have what it takes anymore they just needed the help of good writing and direction they got neither here rothrock does get to throw a couple of kicks near the end but this film is so atrocious that you probably won't be awake to see them
<START> lucio fulci's cat in the brain is an inventive and somewhat egotistical tale of a director's decent into madness the director in question is fulci himself who stars in the film fulci has become known to horror fans everywhere as 'the godfather of gore' and for good reason as he has provided us with some of the nastiest and most gruesome films ever to grace the silver screen from the eyeball violence in films like 'zombi 2' to a man been hacked to death with chains in 'the beyond' all the way to the full on gore fest known as 'the new york ripper' if you want gore and let's face it who doesn't fulci is your man however all this catering for gorehounds like you and i has taken its toll on fulci's mental state and he's quickly delving into madness brought about by what he films fulci's problems don't end at his mental state either as his psychiatrist that he has gone to see about his problem has took it upon himself to take up murder as a hobby using fulci's films as blueprints for the murders br br i've got to say the acting in this film is absolutely atrocious there is one scene in particular that involves a hooker and it's only fit to be laughed at for both it's acting and it's stupidity fulci takes the lead role of the film obviously he's not an actor and it shows but his performance is actually the best in the film it's even safe to say that one the whole the acting is bad for an italian horror film of course nobody goes into an italian horror expecting good acting so it's somewhat forgivable but i do think that fulci could have hired some better ones bad dubbing doesn't exactly help either however something that does help is the fact that the terrible acting is counterbalanced by lots of gore and it's extreme to say the least people get their heads cut off a woman is slain in the shower and unlike psycho here we really see it people are hacked up fed to pigs and there's lots and lots of cinema's finest melee weapon the chainsaw on display which delighted me no end the amount of gore is massively over the top a lot of the time which gives the film something of a feel but cat in the brain is obviously a tongue in cheek film anyway br br it would be hard to make a film about yourself and not come across as being a bit of a big head and fulci does indeed come across as a bit of a big head in this movie his name is mentioned often and he's on screen nearly all the time it's not too much unlike 'new nightmare' in the ego stakes but it's obvious he had a good time making this and i for one had fun watching it so we can forgive him a little egotism the film's ending lets it down i saw it coming a mile off but then didn't seriously think that the movie would take that route but i was wrong it did unfortunately the ending left me cold and the film is a better watch if you turn it off just before the final two minutes however despite it's ending and terrible acting cat in the brain is a lot of fun and will please fulci enthusiasts no end and it is therefore recommended
<START> if there's one theme of this film it's that people can cope with hardship by having a good imagination this family is poor their father works graveyard and their mother works double shifts and peter is constantly picked on for a variety of reasons and becomes increasingly frustrated that he is often mistaken for a girl he is just starting to approach that age of 10 or 11 where your perceptions start to change and thinks like your appearance start to matter the backdrop of this story is the 1967 world's fair and the centennial of canada the film's greatest moments come during the various fantasy sequences where we see just how they cope watch the flim and if you've ever had a childhood friend that you dreamt with and then for some reason lost you'll really like this film perhaps kids will like this film but only adults will truly appreciate it including its references to and what parent's will do for their children
<START> edge of the city is another movie that owes a lot of credit to on the waterfront from it's nyc locations to its score to the belief that whatever trouble you may be in you can somehow right your wrongs br br edge also deals with ideas like loyalty and racism in my opinion that is where the movie does not succeed like waterfront at 85 minutes the movie rushes through the establishment of relationships and ties everything up so quickly that much of it seems forced and unbelievable br br possible spoilers br br the relationship between sidney poitier and john cassavettes could have been further developed in the beginning i don't believe that these two characters from two very different places would have built such a strong relationship so quickly br br i think that the whole love sub plot with cassavettes could have been eliminated he is so awkward with a woman that it becomes painful to watch the only reason why it is in the movie is so that she can motivate him to do the right thing at the end there are other ways that they could have shown this i would have also liked to see some scenes of axel in the army to illustrate why he is the way he is br br the acting is excellent poitier is terrific in a role that is beautifully written his role as tyler is interesting and multi layered and especially for 1957 a man who is confident respected and intelligent cassavettes as axel north while very good does not seem quite right for the part warden is terrific as the boss who knows secret although his fight scene with cassavettes at the end is staged horribly too many break away boxes i thought ruby dee was wonderful in role of poitier's wife br br on the whole edge of the city is a smart movie with a very good cast that tries too hard to be an interesting noir style picture without taking the time to let the drama build br br 7 out of 10
<START> this was it i would have never expected the ending if i didn't already know the behind the scenes stuff br br the one thing that i hated was that why was shannon kicked off and not alyssa i hate her i would rather her character die that what was funny is that in the scene where piper is dieing on the hospital bed and was crying by her side i started crying too lol at the time that this aired i was about and my favorite character was piper from the beginning so i was saying to myself if she dies then i will not see the show anymore lol br br then the whole go back in time thing was a shocker and really good i also blame pheobe for death because instead of being with her sisters she had to be a slutty bi and be with her good for nothing demon boyfriend br br but i think this episode will be now and forever one of my favorites and a classic br br forever charmed blessed be
<START> the film was apparently spawned from an idea one of the writers had when he one of his creations in a supermarket the inhabitants of royston vasey head into world to persuade the writers not to stop writing about them and thus destroy their world br br if that sounds a bit too serious don't be put off within the first few minutes we get bernice the vile female vicar letting rip at an unfortunate during confession chinnery the vet who inadvertently destroys every animal he touches attempting to collect semen from a giraffe mickey thick beyond belief being ah thick and tubbs inbred sister wife and local shopkeeper being sweet as ever but still disgusting br br some of the regular characters are missing but a new idea by the gents introduces some 16th century characters and we have the gents themselves in the action too if you're new to the league of gentlemen this is an easy introduction and a lot of fun if you're a long standing fan this has everything you've come to expect including the joys of jeremy dyson spotting br br all told it's got the same faintly surreal humour that's the hallmark of the series plus some moments of quite touching herr for example maintains a gentle dignity on learning that he's regarded by his creators as a 'one joke character' while most of the characters stay as they are some develop in unexpected ways that are perfectly natural when they happen br br this film is a song' for royston vasey but it's also a showcase for the gents who prove that gasp they can write other stuff and it can be very funny but you knew that anyway
<START> it took me years to finally catch this gem of a film and it was worth the wait in nearly all of his films clint always plays the hero be it hero anti hero or avenging hero in this film he is pure villain and he plays it well br br as a wounded union soldier he is brought into a confederate girls school by the students and teachers to heal soon after he begins to seduce the ladies no matter their age and some are quite young he also plays upon their jealousies and pits them against each other in the end you are never so happy to see clint die a terrible death br br that is what makes this film such a gem clint has never done any other film like it and after seeing this film you wish he had he plays the role of the villain so well it will make you wonder why he never did any more films like it it also explains why the film is not seen very often most people don't want to see clint as the villain and with dirty harry being released shortly after this film it has become a hidden gem if you are a clint eastwood fan you owe it to yourself to see this film you might not like what you will see but you won't soon forget it
<START> morris and had been the toast of broadway in its heyday at ninety morris is a widower he summons his sons the psychotherapist and the bmw car dealer and his daughter the television writer producer to attend a party in his honor after which he will himself literal minded creatures that they are they take what he says at face value he leads them his grandchildren and some others including an african american jewish psychiatrist reminiscent of godfrey cambridge on a merry chase through manhattan as they try to stop him or dissuade him br br the comedy totally works the performances are excellent peter falk is in top form this film does more than deserve an audience it deserves popular success
