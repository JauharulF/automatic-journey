<START> i loved this film it manages to make the characters sympathetic well most of them concerning the problems they have with their relationship br br gloria swanson as leila is in a dusty marriage with a husband who barely notices her presence though he does notice her absence the film shows very well why she is tired of married life and why she is susceptible to a sweet talking con man without making her selfish or demanding the reaction shots of leila at the dinner table on her anniversary while her workaholic husband late to dinner again eats salted with gusto and pushes bride and groom dolls out of the way of his plate are perfect br br the show is stolen and stolen effortlessly by elliott dexter as jim leila's neglectful husband after losing leila to another man jim literally cleans up his act shaving off his mustache working out to lose the middle aged spread and dressing neatly there are several shots of jim at home lonely and thinking of leila including a powerful scene when he finds one of her old dresses in the closet the film gives the audience the advantage of watching jim's transformation along with leila it isn't just the exterior that's more attractive we come to know much more about the kind of person jim really is and we see how completely different he is from leila's second husband lew cody dexter shines as the before and after jim who is determined after discovering true character to win leila back if he can the film's most touching moment comes when jim and leila discover that they are standing under the and jim talks of what he has lost br br definitely worth watching
<START> first i don't see how the movie is on any best list or how it won any awards compared to la pianiste which is also on a best list la pianiste is gold this movie lacked so many things on so many different levels but i can't quite explain why i disliked it so much the lead actor was annoying i felt as though i never knew what was going on and i was bored even though this was supposed to be some worthwhile life change that pierre was starting i wanted it to end as soon as possible why did it have to be his sister and cousin ugh and why did get mean he just turned mean and also was it me or did i miss the whole purpose of what that guy in black was all about who were all those people playing music in the big basement of the big warehouse why did they have all that weird equipment and the guns and all those extra rooms for people to live in i mean this in all seriousness but does incest happen a lot in french culture european culture i took 5 years of learning about the culture and i never heard anything about that
<START> i saw this at a test screening in chatsworth a week or so ago and went with a bunch of my girlfriends we all really loved it a lot james franco is amazing and so hot i would see it just for him but sienna miller is also really good and plays a southern girl who is in love with him so much that she can't let go david caradine who was in kill bill plays a cowboy and he is perfect for that the story is kind of strange but if you believe in the power of love and magical things you will love it it is really original and it is also very funny and everyone laughed a lot but by the end it gets more serious and we all ended up crying i am going to see it again with my friends as soon as it comes out it is really good
<START> why take a perfectly good original drama based on a perfectly good novel and remake it as a quasi musical and cast it with actors exclusively lacking in singing or dancing talent somewhat akin to showgirls or the two most recent star wars films lost horizon is full of unintentional laughs who can forget sir john gielgud smiling uneasily in his dali outfit overseeing an interpretive dance to the republican party family br br or sally kellerman warbling lovingly to george kennedy doing her best cher impression as she hops from one rock to another every little thing you do and my favourite bobby van embodying the strength of america's education system question me an answer i can't wait for the dvd release as hopefully it will contain comments by liv who will finally explain what she was thinking when she agreed to do this film
<START> i went to watch this film with my family who were expecting a neatly conclusive story like mrs and they returned home thoroughly disappointed so this is a warning to all story to stay away 15 park avenue does not seek to answer questions or provide moral solutions on how to treat the mentally challenged rather its intention is loud and clear it questions every human being's sane or not sense of reality in fact for me it even arouses doubts about my taken for granted sense of sanity the security bondage satisfaction that i find in my present is it really what i am or does it really create an illusion that all of us desperately and sometimes ignorantly cling on to just to falsely console the neglected which exists in all of us in some way or the other so why does anjali so maniacally makes it a point to show off her strength of mind when she is really harrowed by the realization that she is becoming a monster aren't we all who think we are really monstrous and helplessly vulnerable about it deep down inside is it not better to be happy even insanely than to create the impression of while suppressing one's fragility bravely madly sincerely does that and society labels her as the ending did confound me at first but then you realise that bravery and sincere belief took her where she wanted to go she found what she was searching for not caring what society had to comment upon her search and it is the seemingly 'real' people anjali the psychiatrist and jojo who never reach anywhere my family thinks that i am schizophrenic too in trying to make sense of a film that is largely to the rest of the world anyone else willing to believe in my sense of reality
<START> i can't believe i even tried to watch this filth as an avid b horror movie fan i was more than riveted at the prospect of this film by popular budget horror filmmaker herschell gordon lewis unfortunately right from the opening of the film i could not for the life of me think of a worse movie than this well maybe gigli but i firmly believe dr gore the body shop is worse when i think about it a horrible plot that moves incredibly slow the movie drags on with no real horror to speak of however i will admit to the pure hilarity of a couple scenes when dr gore is his soon to be victims the camera zooms in on his overly large bulbous eyes while the whole time there is this purely putrid soundtrack to add to the amusement i laughed for the better part of 10 minutes after he his miracle woman the movie wastes away nearly 20 minutes just showing him and his girlfriend as he is teaching her to speak then they talk frolic among have picnics etc unfortunately there is only music playing during this whole fandango with no speech whatsoever this portion of the movie will leave you wishing you had slit your wrists with the dull edge of a butter knife i almost want to puke at the very thought of this movie if you like movies that are bad watch this one
<START> if a movie can't hold your interest in the first 25 minutes it's over as far as i'm concerned this concept that you have to simply deal with a slow first third of a movie and be rewarded later is nonsense a good movie has to start and end strong it all seem interesting and some decent shots and lots of promise but ultimately muddled and irrelevant there are so many other movies from asia to watch many of which i am sure most of you have not seen that i would really skip this one and look elsewhere why exactly does imdb require a 10 line minimum for reviews i said my piece and i hope this helps a few of you move on to the next film
<START> additionally titled burning man and flash fire for its various releases this australian made film shot in new south wales is problematic for its producers from its outset due to several personality conflicts and extended shooting time that prematurely uses up its allocated budget and although the storyline is at times nicely detailed below standard post production finishing and overmuch cutting jettisons the affair tom skerritt plays as howard anderson an american entrepreneur with a passion for building who is in process of a tourist hotel in the blue mountains region all the while unaware that his business partner julian guy has insured the incomplete structure for ten million dollars far more than its actual worth and plans its destruction as corollary to normal summer brush fires in order to collect a handsome sum through fraud in line with this illicit scheme arranges for an arsonist to perform the incendiary deed a young man who also happens to be the boyfriend of anderson's daughter and due to the future being in the midst of a critical fire hazard sector one of the many unexplained elements of the screenplay julian has every expectation that his dastardly design will come about without serious hindrance as the local insurance firm victimized by the crime is majority owned by the naturally skeptical lloyd's of london deploy senior investigator george james mason to probe into the nature of the made more sinister because of the death possibly a homicide of an insurance investigator wendy hughes who in following clues was apparently coming close to the cause of the arson the setting for the film is the week before christmas of summer in the antipodes a dramatic background but the links within the story are not smoothly compounded resulting in the presentation of events that are rather difficult for a viewer to follow a problem heightened by erratic editing the mentioned heavy cutting and poor sound and picture quality skerritt's semi comatose and droning style is fatally by this dim sound processing but mason is very effective as ever and enjoys the best dialogue with hughes impressive as the too early written out investigator wins acting laurels with his performance as the malevolent julian
<START> ivan the terrible is more a filmed stage play than a big screen opus citizen kane a similar work in many ways is quite the opposite in the way we come to expect such fare in that it has lots of location shooting for example br br acting is meant to convey a character's motivations and thinking to the audience if it succeeds in making you understand the character what does it matter how it was done and considering the low amount of action how else is one to express events that influence the story and consequently the characters' machinations and decisions other than exaggerated movements br br as well there's a historical level why the acting style should not surprise the rise of totalitarian regimes in germany and ussr forced film makers who stayed behind to make films the way they knew how as they were prevented access to more modern works that showed cinema's evolution and techniques they only used what they knew br br the nazi's control of government in germany destroyed the great german film industry of the 1920's due to their total control over that film industry and propaganda films can only entertain german troops so much hence the need for popular german silent films of the 1920's for example so a lot of ivan the terrible film's techniques would have been derived from such captured german films supplied to the film crew as mentioned in other comments br br there was no confusion anywhere and though personally it was found over hyped it is by no means a bad cinematic experience and definitely not amongst the worse films ever the acting is fine and part of the cinematography excellent even by today's standards more below definitely not a popcorn flick one can't leave their brain outside this one's door dated perhaps and very symbolic only worth watching on the big screen if one is unable to view the films with the lights off at home for many of the cinematic elements will be lost in these films' chiefly b w experience it all depends upon what expectations one walks in with br br warning spoilers do not read the following comments in case they influence your personal view of the film s br br and if one does not mind the obvious communist propaganda as opposed to capitalist propaganda for ivan is how stalin saw himself obvious in his influence on the film's direction see other comments and anyone with a world historical awareness outside the us perspective will definitely understand this maybe ivan was an earlier incarnation of stalin or maybe not this is more a diatribe on stalin and his motivations decisions loneliness promotions of lackeys etc using the persona of ivan than any true historical record of ivan also note the obvious use of particular colours in the sequel red for the ussr in the banquet scene and perhaps blue for the usa during certain shots when the usurper wears the crown br br but it has many excellent visuals such as the profound use of shadows or the exterior shot of the populace coming to beg return to moscow
<START> notable only as the acting debut of future big time hollywood starlet sandra bullock this ludicrous action flick is so full of holes that one might easily suspect termite infestation the storyline is incomprehensible and very poorly thought out the production values stink of cheese in fact a total lack of production values would have been better at least the film might have seemed grittier that way the adr is laughably bad and omni present in the film it's debatable as to whether or not any of the dialogue tracks from the actual shoot were used br br the performances are for the most part horrible though there are a few exceptions in those exceptions however the performances are undermined by the fact that the director was obviously giving the actors poor direction and making them act completely out of character at times i e characters going from passive to panicked in the blink of an eye bad direction also the constant weapon sound effects magazines being loaded slides being cocked etc are completely overused and more often than not totally out of sync with the on screen actions add to this cheesy bad guy vocal distortion for the lead villain mainly so that you know he's the villain in this incomprehensible mess of a film and you have a recipe for disaster br br the situations in the film go well beyond standard suspension of disbelief and become downright laughable one lead character spends a good portion of the film tied to a chair before he decides to use the butterfly knife tucked in his sock in order to free himself so my questions are why didn't he do this sooner and why does he even have the butterfly knife he wasn't searched right this is one of a hundred examples of completely ludicrous situations which have somehow been crammed into this 90 minute package br br in whole the plays like an unbearably bad r rated tv movie from the '80s if not for the subsequent success of sandra bullock this would have never found its way to dvd but it has so my only advice is to steer clear watching this film may actually your iq
<START> for me late was interesting not only because it was my first film of i completely enjoyed but because it was technically as modern and innovative as his 30s work i've seen this doesn't mean innovative editing in the way godard would introduce it with breathless in 1959 but quite the opposite br br the editing was as fluent as in the best of hollywood films from the 30s 40s but at the same time incredibly fitting regarding the way he was telling his story unlike them it never purposefully accentuated anything or tried to make itself invisible but together with the cinematography made me feel like i was traveling on a gentle stream constantly feeling the waves beneath me like a gentle stroke of the hand or the almost unnoticeable rocking of a cradle in this sense the film was comparable to ozu's and work but somehow even more subtle br br what was so modern was the fact that the editing seemed almost a character in itself similar to the remarkable camera work in dreyer's ordet 1954 or 1943 which is revealing us a deeper understanding of the film and its characters rather than simply showing them to us br br i feel that editing and cinematography are the most interesting aspects of his films elevating the stories significance beyond the obvious the wonderful sets and settings shouldn't be forgotten either i found the story itself to be rather conventional br br the narrative and its characters were introduced in a very interesting way and i thought that the first half of the film was setting up a delicately ingenious spectrum of emotions and interrelations unfortunately the second half of the film and its resolution were rather didactic and and formulaic compared to the set up though by itself it would have been perfectly fitting in any other less complex film somehow i felt that he failed a bit in trying to dissolve the many layers he had woven maybe he should have kept them intact this criticism might seem a bit harsh to a viewer of this film especially since the procedure is again reminiscent to the way ozu dealt with the plot in his films unfortunately i haven't yet the feeling that was able to elevate the story and its characters in his films' conclusions in a similarly sublime fashion the best efforts i have seen to date floating clouds 1955 and scattered clouds 1967 sustained the energy he had built throughout the narrative while delivering poignant and resonant endings br br this is already more than most director's are able to do and in my opinion the basis for a real mastery of the cinematic medium in this regard and considering the resonance of the last two films i've seen by him he may have already become one of my favorites br br the only problem i have at the moment is where i'm going to see more of his films on the big screen
<START> i would be one of the few people who owns a copy of this classic but i dont only own 1 i actually own 2 its that good br br well when i say good i mean bad but i will try to do a thorough review i even watched a which one of the other reviewers here mentioned to compare it to this and born a ninja is actually worse but not quite as funny br br and is this ever funny everything about this movie is poor everything the plot is absolutely stuffed note the need to keep me alive if you want to know where to find your wife' every action sequence is stuffed too our hero is more than a hero he can stab people with twigs take 3 bullets in the heart at 50 cm away without even bleeding and tie a rope up to a tree which when an enemy steps on it ties a knot around the enemies leg picks him up and throws him 50 metres into a bunch of spikes br br the acting is so bad it is impossible to comment on it but it should have you rolling especially 'jump out of the ground and growl at the bad guy' oh yes and the bad guys somehow it seems they resurrect themselves 5 times each in the movie perhaps it's just that there weren't enough actors but in a movie of this calibre i doubt that br br the 'plot' is about how was a soldier in the vietnam war and now his colonel is hunting real people for training for his mercenaries the colonel just happens to pick up then fights back this is just the excuse for a rambo clone with most of the movie being slaughtering soldiers and i really cant explain the plot any more cos there is nothing else to the movie it still rocks though br br what else could be wrong you ask dont get me started hand grenades which actually go off at the actors' feet because the explosion is the size of a match scenes where there are 5 people chasing then the camera cuts away and back and there are 7 the way that every time loads the grenade launcher he is against the same background even though he is in completely locations and the worst part is when pushes the plastic boulders onto the enemies and one enemy is completely untouched by the boulders so he doesn't know what to do so he half heartedly dies without even being touched it's ridiculous br br but funny very very funny this is one of the few movies i can thoroughly recommend to everybody cos if you dont find it funny you are 1 in a million and for the rest of us it's magic
<START> tacky but mildly entertaining early 90's soft core comedy features xena sarah luna tamara landry and nicole posey as three outer space teenagers parents have gone on vacation for a couple of days following some persistent persuasion from her friends xena agrees to take her father's spaceship for a ride the end result they wind up running out of gas in space and crash land on planet beta 45 aka earth meanwhile teenagers dave michael todd davis and jerry ken steadman have come to california to stay the summer with dave's uncle bud joe estevez a beach bum who lives right on the beach the three of them wind up meeting our three space girls who have walked away from the crash without a scratch uncle bud is about to be thrown out from his soon to be condemned beach pad thanks to sally linnea quigley who lives right up the hill and used to be in a relationship with bud she's also a bikini magnate and is trying to win a bikini design contest to the tune of 30 000 exactly what bud would need to fix up his property so the girls decide to try to win the prize for him and that's about it folks that their paper thin plot was barely enough to sustain a feature length movie the filmmakers subject us to scene after scene of endless beach parties featuring tons of extras gyrating their half naked bodies in the scorching sun oh and lets not forget the sex there's quite a deal of it before i go any further i need to put this movie in context it was released in 1993 long before the advent of such soft core labels such as surrender cinema and seduction cinema compared to these newer edgier more explicit movies the soft core movies of the 90's sure seem somewhat mild when beach babes from beyond first came out in 1993 from the full moon offshoot entertainment it was heralded as the debut release of a label that specialized in mature audiences type films to say the times have changed this particular film genre has gone from a few steamy but brief sex scenes and fleeting glimpses of female full frontal nudity to extended sex scenes that occasionally threaten to venture into the realm of hardcore looking at beach babes from beyond again after viewing it upon its release it's safe to say that if this same film were to be made today there would be a hell of a lot more emphasis on the sex scenes and less time spent on plot and dialog as for the sex scenes themselves they tend to run hot and cold three space girls waste no time in getting comfortable with the boys that evening so each couple gets a soft core scene complete with annoying slow motion camera work and too dark lighting they're really not that horrible and are surprisingly graphic in a few spots especially the scene between xena and jerry that takes place in the back of a trailer but the one sex scene that really leaves a lasting impression and causes you to be surprised in its overall intensity occurs quite early on in the film sally is attending a topless photo shot with three of her models posing by a pool all of the actresses in this scene are beautiful gorgeous but nikki fritz stands out from all the two due to her enormous presence remember that this point in her career she had yet to achieve the type of enormous popularity that soon would follow her posing nude by a pool leads to an unforgettable fantasy sequence where she shows her soapy body in a tub and then again when walking away from her bath walking toward the bed towards a nearly nude pumped up guy in the waiting we get a full length complete nude scene with her almost heart shaped rear end and perfectly shaped back it's good that back is so muscular as it is about to get a pretty good workout nikki spends the next few minutes completely nude with a hunky guy in a variety of positions in a scene that is filmed completely differently than the three other lovemaking scenes no dark lighting or annoying slow motion here just two actors in one enormous bed sans sheets and covers who seem at time to be barely acting at all ecstatic body language just goes to prove that few other actresses seem to enjoy filming sex scenes as much as she does it's really the only time where beach babes from beyond truly delivers the goods but even without this spectacular scene i am mildly recommending this film just for the fact alone that it's fairly watchable and never dull no thanks to an incredibly energetic and attractive cast many of whom would show up in various direct to video features in the remainder of the decade
<START> so this is the worst movie you will probably ever see it's up there with crossbones and southern comfort but if your a bad movie fan like i am this atrocity of a film will be the most fun you've had in years why does the camera make old school kung fu noises when it zooms why does that random guy stuff a nascar commemorative plate in his bag and who is he anyway why do the vampires shoot lightning after they die what is this highlander dracula mccloud who cares just laugh at it this movie has no continuity no plot no anything really ron hall's range of emotions are always off he looks happy when he should be sad angry when he should be confused the rest of the cast couldn't act their way out of a paper bag the special short bus kinda special effects are randomly placed and never needed most scenes are lit with a desk lamp if they are lit at all mel novak has the audacity to look off camera for his line and it's not even edited out they just keep on filming in fact half of this movie isn't even on film at all it's 1 2 film 1 2 sony hand cam for most of the film it seems that they left their boom mike at home this movie doesn't just have a few plot holes it's a mine field of confusion and mental pain but oh do i love it thank you ron hall for this cinematic abomination i went out and bought it cause it's just so damn funny 1 99 on amazon and i had it rush delivered br br i have weapons i have weapons i have weapons
<START> spoiler alert br br the point is though that i didn't think this film had an ending to spoil i only started watching it in the middle after matt had gotten into sarah's body but then i became fascinated by the bizarreness of the plot even for a channel 5 movie and couldn't possibly see how matt end up happy what about his fiancee at one stage looked like he was gonna get with his best friend surely icky and wrong and then the whole thing does not work as a touching buddy buddy catchphrase tis just ridiculous so was going 'surely he can't just come back to life and yet how can he live as a woman ' and then the film just got over that by ending and not explaining anything at all what's that about i was so cross wasted a whole hour of my life for no reason at all but was one of the funniest films i've ever seen so swings and
