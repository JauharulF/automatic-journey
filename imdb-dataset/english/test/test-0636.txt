<START> i had been avoiding this movie for sometime because i viewed it as an unneccesary installment to a series that should have only had 2 parts but after reading some fairly favorable reviews from some imdb watchers i spent 1 50 and rented it at my local video store need i go further when i say this was a buck 50 lost this movie is one of the 10 worst movies i have ever seen first off i realize that noone wanted to see a 33 year old macchio in this film but why could'nt they have had miyagi read a letter or something from daniel san maybe explaining what happened to daniel hell they could have at least made a quick mention of daniel or something but no and to the already bad script they added those stupid monks i thought monks take a vow of silence guess these yapping monks don't take their vows seriously hehehe the training the girl went through in the movie was hurried and stupid and the paramilitary group of young males were a confusing concept to say the least this was far from even being a martial arts movie with the girl only fighting briefly in the final scene and then she didn't even come close to getting hit even once by the male fighting her give me a break she would have gotten hit at least once i guess the writers and directors thought it would be to shocking to see a girl get punched by a male in this one i could go on and on but basically i'll end by saying that this movie was just so bad even the girl they chose wasn't nice to even look at she was sorta butch looking i can only think of a handful of movies that i have sit through that compare to just how bad this flick was don t waste your time on this one
<START> it is well known that irene dunne could sing somewhat more than a little and i think her talent as a comedienne can only be really understood once one has struggled through a sonata by haydn or a song by debussy and made a success of it her instrument is her voice and her handling of it is pure musicianship she could tackle any part the only thing she couldn't do was to not make a success of it this film is a perfect example in it she channels ruth gordon because the play is the thing is feminine charming willful and self effacing generous protective and combative but never pretentious she manages to stay as believable as alexander knox is in another difficult role he assumes with aplomb the viewer gets to believe in what he is seeing and to care for it it is refreshing to see a film that is both entertaining and intellectually challenging while pushing all the right patriotic buttons i sincerely hope the entire dunne oeuvre makes it to dvd one day because it's really hard to keep a secret like that among just a few initiates
<START> this is a failure so complete as to make me angry br br all of the subtlety and structure of early films is gone leaving nothing but a hash of digitally smeared images whose sole purpose seems to be whining about bad things humans do just how do star trek like wormhole graphics slo mo colorized seascapes of obviously fake computer icons and shots of athletic competition that incidentally show that no one has ever been able to top or even match leni riefenstahl for filming bodies in motion edited together with an overlay of video colorization that a 1980s dr who producer would have rejected as too cheesy add up to a polemic against civilized violence there is no intellectual emotional or visceral connection between these images as assembled and mutated by and way too many digital effects artistes and the cautionary tale i assume he wanted to produce with all of the dramaturgical consultants involved no one seems to have pulled his head out the his own feeling of saying something important and considered that they might all be failing to say something new br br only people who watch too much television could make such a film and believe that it's meaningful this is kindergarten stan and ultimately gutless in its relentless obviousness the only irony and tension evident here unlike in koyaanisqatsi where the relentless beauty and strangeness of time altered ordinary images forced you to consider their meaning was when the dvd i was watching jammed and skipped this is mtv for the noam chomsky crowd based on reflex rather than reflection and signifying nothing two stars for the music which is in glass's best cesar franck style and features some passionate cello from yo yo ma i hope for his sake that he didn't have to record his parts to a playback of the film there are some things you shouldn't have to do even for a paycheck
<START> is a movie that i treasure and its one movie i don't mind seeing at any time well almost any time this movie is simply marvelous and according to me is the funniest movie i've ever seen and yes i do put it over hera pheri reason hera pheri has scenes you'll watch out but not possible simply because every scene is a scene you got to watch out for aamir salman share great chemistry and are perfect in their shoes but i'll put the characters in order of favoritism br br rank 1 crime master gogo shakti kapoor's best performance till date and yes this happened before the casting couch gogo is an innocent character who belongs to well reputed family of mr india fame crime master gogo is actually nephew but for he's more than a responsible handsome charismatic charming son gogo makes the biggest mistake of life by lending 36 000 rupees to who is as had once said a fraud and a cheat now only goal is to get back what's his and in his journey of recovering his lost money gogo realizes that there is more than 36 000 that he needs to achieve and thus begins struggle against the sinner world br br rank 2 main hoon mark hai is an evil character who is ram gopal twin originally named gopal chooses to change his name to suit his personality as a child had always envied his brother and then one day things took a turn for the worse when his father gave his entire wealth to ram decided to kill his father but in the night's darkness instead killed munshi harish chandra dad though doesn't regret his actions sole mission now is to get back his property somehow and start his own poultry bakery farm also needs to return back the loan to gogo but has no intentions whatsoever to do so in order to achieve his evil goals employs two people robert vijay who is very good at aiming and khan clone and son who is a very very smart boy br br rank 3 amar aamir khan wants to marry the rich heiress raveena so he sells his father's cheap saloon and heads off for mumbai amar has no problem taking care of the big business that father will hand him over after their wedding and is willing to sacrifice his happiness and shift to london if needed br br rank 4 prem salman khan after gogo prem is the second most innocent character to appear in the movie and the way amar tries to take advantage of him in the mask of a friend is tragic br br i won't reveal any more characters because jesus christ i just wouldn't stop typing the movie is outright stunning go and get the dvd now and beware of those cheap as they have omitted many good scenes out of the movie br br the background music is stud and the action is better than the matrix especially the final encountered between prem and crime master gogo watch out for it it appears in the climax is also a drama with many negative and positive characters and teach us a lot about life and values and ethics it teaches us about bravery why else would amar ask prem to stay back when they go to meet the kidnapper even though prem was complaining that he had to go to the toilet is also a tragedy especially the scenes where salman is targeted by aamir and is given overdose of stomach upsetting pills the part where reveals his sad feelings regarding why he couldn't go to london and the part where gogo is arrested in the ending without even getting back his 36 000 is overall a complete package sit back and enjoy the ride bet there'll be a second ride after that and then a third br br the movie was considered a flop back then and i bet no one liked it but buckle up guys this movie is a big hit even if it didn't have enough people coming to theatres the movie is one of the highest selling home dvds and one of the most frequently movie on most of the channels so the producers have laughed their way to the banks long time back
<START> first they ruin it with the uniquely bad animation quality then they get voices that sound nothing like the original they make sooo many movie mistakes when sasha is singing in count me out the drummer disappears and then reappears itchy's shirt keeps changing color his hat keeps changing position one of the bridge is white everyone in the background appears fat keep changing colors and appearing and disappearing even heaven appears different i don't give a damn if this is a low budget film they shouldn't cut corners on animation they completely ruined the first adgth the only good thing about this movie was the soundtrack
<START> having grown up in new jersey and having spent many a day and night on the gritty streets of new york in the 1970's watching a film like the seven ups or its kindred spirit the french connection always evokes fond memories of a time and place which for some might have been darkest hour but which for me in my early twenties was always one fun filled adventure after another i truly miss those times as one reviewer remarked this film very aptly captures the stark cold matter of fact feel of the nyc winter season while keenly exposing the underbelly of the region's infamous underworld of crime and policing a great snapshot of a place and a time and a culture a spot on characterization of both the film and the city the stellar attributes of this film the plot the cast the characters and of course the car chase are amply described in many of the reviews here so i won't go into that except to say that one of my favorite moments occurs during the car chase when the camera focuses on richard lynch riding shotgun to the maniacal bill hickman the look of horror on richard lynch's face along with the defensive gestures are so out of character for an actor much better known as a source of terror rather than an object of it that it is actually comical to watch i get a chuckle out of it every time
<START> a brutally straightforward tale of murder and capital punishment by the state so painfully slow and accurate in the description of capital punishment from the preparation of the to the victim p ing in his own pants before dying it has the power to change your mind about death penalty the whole originated from this story the screenwriter was the powerless lawyer unsuccessfully trying to defend and then console the accused
<START> i was a huge fan of asterix comics when i was a kid and watched every one i never heard about this movie when it was released but i watched it with my kids last night i remembered the comic well enough to know that a lot was added to the story for the film some of the changes i thought were a bit corny like the nephew's 'modern' dancing and the viking chief's daughter almost everything about her but i found most it amusing enough most importantly seeing the reactions as my kids watched it confirmed that the film pleased its target audience as a family film it works better than other asterix titles i've seen many of the names that weren't in the book i found had the same appeal as ones that were overall an enjoyable family film regardless of whether you're an asterix fan or not
<START> i made it through half of this but was not enough of a masochist to see it all the first half of the film had next to no dialog almost everything was voice over commentary to carry the story the scriptwriter forgot that sometimes less is more and tried to explain several millennium of detailed history in the voice over at the same time he forgot to do any character development most science fiction fans don't require huge amounts of character development but it would be nice to know why the two main characters who survived the destruction of the space fleet together ended up fighting each other br br there are some good things going on in the film the soundtrack was well done some of the computer generated graphics are very good but others were just mediocre
<START> the plot of in the mood for love is simple enough a married man and a married woman though not to eachother slowly develop a romantic attachment to one another the film's pace is numbingly slow and precious little actually happens between the two yet the backdrop of hong kong in the early 1960s and director wong kar wai's keen sense for capturing the beauty of the setting as well as the principal characters make this film a joy to watch actors tony leung and maggie cheung are both excellent and wong kar wai has done an extraordinary job in capturing the feel and nostalgia of the past something so many films and directors try to do but usually fail miserably there are so many little details that add charm to the film a trademark of the director and the colors and cinematography are what send this otherwise simple story over the top as a marvelous cinematic achievement 9 10
<START> writers and directors by the nature of their craft stand back a frame from the action in their work to show insights about characters and situations here huston and joyce have stepped back a bigger frame yet to show us the ultimate view of what it means to be human until it's very end the movie appears to be about nothing much the kind of typical circumstances that fill every day life it is not until the end of the very final scene that we realize that it is in fact about everything br br it is not possible to watch this final scene without simultaneously feeling pity and also deep affection for oneself and the rest of fellow beings
<START> i think i win the bargain contest for this movie since i got it as part of a martial arts movie classics dvd collection with 50 movies for 20 bucks which means i paid something like 50 cents for the chance to watch the black fist version of a movie that was released as bogard br br for a basic revenge flick black fist isn't too bad even though it is obviously hampered by a low budget one of my informal rules of thumb for watching a movie is that if the lead actor is better than his production and screenplay the movie automatically gets at least three stars that is certainly the case here lawson has some presence and some charisma and probably deserved a better film career than he got br br the street fight choreography the ostensible reason for the film really won't to impress anyone who has ever in a martial arts school or even just been punched in a schoolyard fight i only spent about two years learning basic kung fu but even i would never fall for the front stamp kicks arm drags and roundhouse punches on display here but the atmosphere is good dust and blood and shouting crowds and the actors put some feeling into the fight scenes br br less believable is the plot dawson's character leroy is portrayed as a street smart sharp young man who goes looking for work as a pick up fighter in illegal street matches yet he is surprised and indignant when he has to pay off the cops excuse me but i was raised in small town iowa and even i knew from watching hard times with charles bronson that the cops have to be paid off for this sort of action and that the guys who fight needed the in order to get their matches and that the were worth the money so you have to watch this movie with a sort of willful suspension of your critical faculties in order to accept it as a black brother being repressed movie most of the other non black fighters in the stable get punched in the face for the same deal too yes br br the movie suffers from a short attention span the director obviously didn't have the budget to film some of the scenes he needed so he had to fill in the gaps with some fairly ludicrous exposition scenes the i him i him and then i killed him scene just doesn't work along with voice overs and montages that are clumsy and unconvincing this is especially true with the whole romance angle which seems to have been filmed as if it were an afterthought this is a little shoddy when you consider that the death of wife's death is supposed to fuel his drive for revenge br br but once the movie switches all the way from young fighter rising through the ranks to the revenge theme it picks up a little steam and plays with a little more conviction i'm not sure that the final payoff is worth the buildup roger ebert calls this sort of thing a long drive for a short day at the beach but it does tie things off in a reasonably satisfying way br br if sylvester stallone had made this film with a real budget and the same cast slicker sets and costumes and himself as the hero people would have hailed it as the next rocky which goes to show you how circumstance and chance can play havoc with would be filmmakers' dreams br br worth seeing once for various decent shots and lines and to watch dabney coleman embarrass himself in a role that is beneath him
<START> i watched princess of the nile for the first time when i was about 10 years old i am 63 now and have never forgotten the movie nor have i gotten over my fascination with egypt i have searched the internet trying to buy the movie but have not been able to locate it it makes me wonder if this is one of the lost movies in hollywood i loved debra padget and jeffrey hunter together they have such charisma together if you were to ask me anything about the movie i could not tell you anything other than who was in it i vaguely remember a scene by the nile with debra padget a bunch of other women i have always wanted to see it again i never thought of it as an escape movie back then but i can see now where that was probably the case i do hope they will put it on dvd and i will be able to see it again before i die it was a wonderful movie
<START> it's about jealousy it's about racism it's about manipulation but the underlying message is love geoffrey sax tried to pull off shakespeare's othello by bringing it to modern day context however the actors were not convincing enough to pull this off there were extra bodies to help put everything in to perspective however john othello played by eamonn walker over reacted a lot in this film causing for the down fall of hawes eventually ending in death br br ben played by christopher eccleston was seen as the main character in the film he didn't give enough evidence for to be cheating on othello with michael cass played by richard coyle instead he just played a friend to all and gave one reason as to why she was cheating in the play it took a lot more convincing from iago to make othello even suspect anything this change made the movie more about rage for the wrong reasons than what the book was based off of however the movie did have a few good points it turned the army scenes into more a racist group toward blacks where othello is the main chief of the police squad these scenes are made believable by the raging crowds and burning fires you are able to sense the amount of racism in the movie more so than you can in the book this book plays up the modern day scenes by making it much easier to understand than the shakespearian times it was written in in the play iago gets tortured at the end but in the film he gets his satisfaction and gets othello's position he never gets what he deserves and is never caught for telling the lie to othello until it is too late i saw this as a downfall in the movie because i feel that the villain is granted his treasure of the promotion out of lying and in the book he is found out by rodrigo overall the movie could have done a better job based on the play than what it did i feel that the director of the movie left out some of the most important parts of the play that were mentioned or there to make the play flow or make it more of a tragedy i would say that you should read the book first in order to understand all of the events that happened in the movie otherwise you may find yourself lost and confused
<START> when king kong stripped her of her top in the 1976 remake i was breathless i don't know how many times i went back to see that movies hoping to see more jessica lange was not a great actress then she became one but she was so hot i went to see sweet dreams when it came out because by that time ms lange had become a great actress it looked like a wonderful story and she's always exciting to see br br i never walked out of a movie faster my wife concurred br br when we got into the car i turned to her and said if you had told me i would get bored watching jessica lange take her clothes off i would have said your crazy i just got bored watching lange take her clothes off how bad is that
