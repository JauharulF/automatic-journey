<START> black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend it's limitations it's an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience br br in the tradition of all good animal centered thrillers ie jaws the edge the original cat people the directors know that restraint and what isn't shown are the best ways to pack a punch the performances are real and gripping the is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed that's because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous br br if you are after a b grade gore fest croc romp forget black water but if you want a clever suspenseful ride that will have you fearing the water and wondering what the hell would i do if i was up that tree then it's a must see
<START> i was unsure what to expect from driving lessons unsure whether rupert could carry such a role but within the first few minutes i was completely hooked all the way through the music acting and scenery were absolutely stunning julie walters as always gave a superb performance as the eccentric old actress and rupert equally as good gave a fantastic performance as the romantic ben br br right from the beginning i was forced into involuntary cringes bursts of laughter and of joy as ben broke free from his controlling mother and fought for his friendship with his only friend a very controversial story probably rather exaggerated but none the less one of the best films i have seen in a long time br br highly recommend to anyone seeking a good british film and an evening to kick back and just enjoy yourself
<START> since there have been so many reviews of this fine film i will write in a list form and attempt to address issues that have not been discussed br br 1 dana andrews was 38 during the filming of this movie his character according to the screenplay was in his mid 20s andrews a highly underrated actor did brilliantly play a character who was supposed to be much younger br br 2 march like all great actors needs at times to be restrained by the director to avoid over the top acting he was mugging for the cameras when he was drunk on the night after his arrival and also the next morning when he was checking out his hang over in his mirror br br 3 dana andrews was superb as he was in laura the ox bowl incident a walk in the sun the purple heart and many other films why did march win the academy award and why was dana andrews not even nominated for his outstanding performance br br 4 harold russell gave the best performance i have ever seen by a non actor br br 5 i realize this was the 1940s but dana andrews seemed to have no romantic interest in his exceptionally attractive wife virginia mayo br br 6 ray teal who played the right wing bigot years later became famous for portraying the sheriff on bonanza br br 7 the professor from the south wrote that the film was slow moving boring and poorly acted the professor more than likely is uninformed about classic films the beauty and significance of these ageless classics is that they are slow moving character studies that avoid profanity excessive violence and gratuitous sex br br i was surprised that zero out of 3 people found my review useful
<START> sleeper cell is what 24 should have been 24 is a cartoon i watch 24 but feel cheated with every stupid episode all four or five seasons so far who can keep track as they are all the same jack gets in trouble jack gets out of trouble and then immediately gets back in to trouble and then sleeper cell is really well done and is far superior unfortunately they blew it with the ending in season two i can think of a half dozen better endings off the top of my head that would have worked better for the writer's obvious goals and not been so contrived shame on the writers for wrecking what had been up to that ending a really good series
<START> dennis hopper must've been really hungry to do this movie atrocious special effects very poor writing cheesy dialogue stupid looking killer bio robots never mind the blatent disregard for science the awkward scene with the 2 young leads taking their clothes off the best part of this movie was the pull start cyber penis on the wacked out cyborg pirate captain 2 out of 10 stars because i'm in a generous mood
<START> sorte nula is the 1 box office portuguese movie of 2004 this extreme low budget production estimated usd 150 000 opened during christmas opposite american blockbusters like national treasure polar express the incredibles and alexander but rapidly caught the adulation of the portuguese moviegoers despite the harsh competition the small film did surprisingly well topping all other portuguese films of the past two years in its first weeks the film is a mystery murder with a humorous tone cleverly written and directed by fernando fragata who has become a solid reference in the european independent film arena did i like the film oh yes
<START> this movie takes the plot behind the sci fi flick doppelganger an astronaut from our earth crashing on a 'counter earth' on the opposite side of the sun and the cold war totalitarian vibes on that world and tries to turn it into a pilot for a tv series however the whole thing sank without a trace and tv is probably better off for it br br everyone here is perfectly adequate in a 'made for tv' way cameron mitchell turns in his usual solid performance so does glenn corbett who seems to be a kind of poor man's john saxon who plays the rugged individualist whose very existence poses a threat to the foundation of the 'world order' on counter earth br br but the low budget and low energy and inconsistent script and the lack of any real imagination in the set designs and cinematography keep this sci fi adventure firmly tethered on the launch pad br br i'll give one example in the original template for this pilot doppleganger the astronauts lose control of their landing vehicle in a thunderstorm and crash their ship in a truly appalling sequence it was obvious that their ship was never going to fly again then the two astronauts stagger helplessly from the smoking remains of their vehicle in the middle of howling rains and winds only to be smacked down and overcome by faceless men yelling through loudspeakers br br in stranded in space the astronauts are sitting in their seats when sound things start shaking and the camera blurs into a blackout and as a friend pointed out it was pretty obvious that the actors were simply shaking themselves on their seats the director wasn't even shaking the camera or the set i've seen episodes of the twilight zone and the outer limits that took more effort to establish mood and setting than this made for tv mediocrity br br and that in essence is what's wrong with stranded in space no budget no time no imagination just making the token gestures and hoping the sci fi fan boys' imagination and enthusiasm will fill in the rest sorry guys it didn't work br br i'm sure that everyone here just finished their work on this one and walked away and never thought of it again except as a listing on their c v and that's what you the viewer will do you'll remember if pressed that you once watched a tv movie called stranded in space but it made no lasting impression on you and you can't recall too much about it
<START> director delbert mann was a much better director than this film indicates he directed all quiet on the western front that touch of mink and the last days of patton among others this mediocre made for television retelling of dicken's masterpiece is so bad even those unfamiliar with the often filmed tale will be unsatisfied br br besides the fact that the movie is available from only two known suppliers brentwood and bci eclipse the poor quality of the transfer and the scratchy and muddied sound track make the task of finding this film on video not worth the effort br br i have always believed that if a company is going to put a film on video and charge the public money to buy it then they should at least have a descent copy of the film and do a good job on the transfer unfortunately neither of the two suppliers have such a work ethic and the result is only fit for the bargain bin in the local discount store br br the story is told mainly through flashbacks making the film episodic and talky much of the rich detail of the novel is lost in this translation the characters of martha and others have been cut and the relationship of young david and is not explored enough so we are left wondering why david would hang out with the guy br br the relationship between david the boy and young agnes is never developed and it is hard to understand why she and david eventually marry since martha is left out it is a mystery how dan peggoty finds his niece and the absence of makes david a very lonely fellow br br some have credited this film with doing a good job of the lengthy novel i disagree this is at best a hatchet job on the book anyone who has seen the 1935 george cukor version will agree br br the performances in that version by fields as micawber and rathbone as murdstone are definitely worth the trouble of watching it and the more recent masterpiece theatre version april 2000 and hallmark 2000 versions are both outstanding achievements in made for television adaptations of classic novels directors simon curtis and peter medak who are responsible for those films are deserving of the highest praise br br my final comment on david copperfield 1969 is don't buy it there are several much better versions of the film available if it is on television turn the channel to something else it is a waste of one hour and twenty minutes of your life sorry folks but i can't praise such an appallingly bad film
<START> this is one gripping movie reminiscent of the mgm crime movies of the late 70's excellent cast crisp editing and good acting keeps the pace of the movie developing rapidly one of the better crime movies of the decade kudos to the director cast
<START> oh dear quite how alfred hitchcock north by northwest spellbound the 39 steps could turn out this nasty cheapjack shocker is beyond me don't bother looking for hidden depths or deep meanings there aren't any this is just horrid seedy and cheap the one redeeming feature is the home life of the inspector who leads the investigation his wife fancies herself as a gourmet cook and constantly serves up her revolting culinary experiments to her poor husband this is amusing and just about saved me putting the film in the 'awful' bracket but the film as a whole is one of the most unpleasant i've ever seen i believe this was hitchcock's next to last film perhaps someone was trying to tell him something
<START> tom and jerry are transporting goods via airplane to africa but being white men they're worried they won't be safe so they put on blackface to fit in once they're wearing it they adopt black dialect and fully inhabit their new characters they crash into the ocean and use the wing of the plane as a raft before reaching land they suffer the advances of an over affectionate octopus and more serious danger from sharks a swordfish and a whale once on land they're frightened by fantastic creatures and duck into a cave inside it's even worse when they encounter living skeletons in blackface and upon exiting the cave things are even worse than that when they are discovered by cannibals br br plane dumb is an especially sloppy effort from van studios one example a lion unknown to tom and jerry enters the cave before they do but the animators must have forgotten about it because the lion never appears again another example is the ending that's not an ending it's just an arbitrary stop br br according to a youtube poster the cartoon was originally intended to feature the voices and caricatures of a popular comedy team known as miller but aubrey died of tuberculosis before the recording session was completed and co directors john foster george were forced to rework the animation into a 'tom jerry' story br br they shouldn't have bothered the crude animation and poorly executed gags make the film a loser from beginning to end
<START> this is a comedy romance movie directed by andy tennant starring will smith eva mendes and kevin james br br it is about a professional dating doctor will smith known as who helps men to land dates with the women they are interested in he is currently helping a shapely clumsy albert who is obsessed with a very powerful famous and rich woman called at the same time hitch has become interested in a gossip columnist sara eva mendes who has been assigned to write about when the best girlfriend of sara has a love disillusion with a man that sara thinks that is a client of hitch she plots a revenge against hitch and the misunderstanding leads the two couples to a conflictive situation this film is not one that men should see as it has a lot of male bashing and both subtle and blatant male hating there are also double standards that you would have to be blind not to spot hitch and sara are both very guarded around the opposite sex hitch still likes women despite his burns from them in the past and is teaching men to make them happy but of course sara is a sexist bigot who makes frequent sexist comments along the lines of men want to have sex with anything that walks shes self obsessed and knows she looks like a goddess and knows there are no 'real men' out there what annoyed me most of all was the 'bad' guy who wanted a quick fumble with sara's best friend who is the classic example of a defenceless 'victim' and even after being turned down physically by hitch receives as blow to the pills from sara after which she says now i'm satisfied add to that the women are still oppressed vibes you get from not being allowed to spend her own money after asking permission from a table of men in spite of all the rubbish assumptions and women can always tell when you ain't being straight with them this movie does have the correct point that in america love simply doesn't exist there are some funny parts in this film such as albert and his dancing habits but this film overall only beats the dreadful film honey by a marginal amount
<START> there is a clever little scene in the karen carpenter story where both carpenters are in a recording studio and richard makes an impromptu decision to have karen sing for the owner of the studio br br richard picks the wrong key for karen to sing in so karen is singing above her natural range you can see a look of bemusement on the owner's face he figures she really can't sing richard quickly realizes his mistake and tries again in a different key the next thing you hear is karen's amazing beautiful voice and the owner does a priceless double take nicely done for some reason i have never forgotten that scene br br the karen carpenter story chronicles the meteoric rise of the carpenters and karen's struggle to overcome anorexia a lot of things are glossed over this isn't a documentary and the movie left me with a lot of questions very little is mentioned of karen's solo venture the cd was released only a few years ago if you buy it you will wonder why they waited it's some of karen's best work the songs aren't as timeless as her work with brother richard but it was a great recording in my opinion br br i have heard it said that you can be listening to a cheap time worn little radio in the middle of the third world that would seem to produce more static than anything else but when a carpenter song comes on the radio you would think you were listening to a 1000 hi fidelity unit br br watch this movie
<START> lana turner proved that she could really dance up a storm in this 1940 charmer about the ultimate sacrifice that her sister joan blondell makes for her br br when both sisters come to new york they follow blondell's beau a wonderful george murphy in this film br br as fate would have it the director of the show is impressed with turner but sees nothing ahead for blondell except a job as the cigarette girl not only does blondell miss stardom boyfriend murphy eddie falls for turner as well so as not to hurt her sister turner is ready to marry the producer of the show a wealthy womanizer who has wed 4 times br br the story concludes as best as possible with blondell taking a fast exit back to nebraska look for paul ford as a gossip columnist in the film he is hard to recognize due to the date of the film and the fact that he is much thinner the film leaves you with the question of whether ford and blondell could ever get together br br blondell as the devoted sister sacrifices both career and love for her sister this film is sentimental and might have worked better if it had been shot in technicolor br br few realize that george murphy the future republican senator from california was quite a song and dance man in his day
<START> ghoulies iv starts in a museum storage facility where pvc leather clad blonde alexandra stacie randall is looking for a ancient jewel after offing various guards she summon the demon faust who she worships wants to have sex with unfortunately she lost the jewel so he's not very happy orders her to get the last remaining one which belongs to jonathan graves returning from the original ghoulies 1985 peter who is experienced in demonic possession stuff like that after the events of the original ghoulies alexandra sets about finding the jewel so she can bring faust to earth permanently from the 'other side' to well i don't know actually erm that's about it really br br directed by jim wynorski whose very name name sends shivers down my spine when it's attached to a film i'm about to waste 90 minutes of my life on iv is as i expected complete total utter crap from start to finish it's as simple straight forward as that the ahem cough by mark has virtually nothing in common with the other ghoulies film except in it's title that they managed to convince to reprise his role which also has the added bonus of big able to use footage from the original even though it has no relevance whatsoever the story is almost none existent the whole film is a real chore to watch it's incredibly boring moronic it's slow it's predictable it's squeaky clean as far as blood or gore goes it has two comic relief goblins whom i assume are supposed to fill the ghoulies quota even though they look nothing like they did in the previous films are in fact just embarrassing to watch in fact i think they were practising to be ventriloquist's during most of the film as when they speak their don't move you know i don't want to talk or think about ghoulies iv anymore so please believe me when i say this is one huge piece of crap of elephant sized proportions don't waste either your time or money br br wynorski turns in a throughly rotten film on just about every level the special effects are terrible as is the whole film apparently ghoulies iv is meant to be some sort of horror comedy but it misses both targets by the proverbial mile it is neither funny nor scary the best thing about this film is actress randall in her pvc leather outfit running around trying to find the jewel that's hardly worth sitting through this rubbish to see there's a half decent runaway car scene with a few crashes but it looks like it was edited in from a completely different film given track record i'm sure it was forget about any gore as there isn't any br br technically ghoulies iv sucks it's obvious it had low budget but that simply isn't an excuse for it to be this bad is it is back in the cast although he probably wishes he'd stayed away pvc clad babe randall is easily the best thing about this film which says a lot br br ghoulies iv is crap there's nothing else to say really i honestly can't see anyone who enjoy films getting anything out of this i just can't i can't believe that i'm going to recommend the original ghoulies over anything but it's going to happen now because even though that's crap as well it's a hell of a lot better than ghoulies iv one to avoid folks you can thank me later the things i sit through so you don't have to honestly
