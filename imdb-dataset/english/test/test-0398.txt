<START> what is your freaking problem do you have nothing better to do than sit on your fat asses and blog about about how you find something in bad taste here's an idea go outside that's right walk outside your mom's basement that you've been living in for 13 years and go outside but i can't leave star trek is on in 30 minutes and i still haven't married that avatar on world of oh my god in that case stay inside alright i might have gone overboard there i mean star trek is okay but i don't really watch it that much anymore either way do you really have to write crap about mind of mencia it's a good show maybe you're just venting your anger because that girl dumped you on world of or you're constipated try putting fiber in your diet
<START> i was really looking forward to this movie but sadly it didn't live up to expectation br br a good movie has the audience identifying sympathising with the main actor unfortunately this was very hard to do with samantha morton br br the storyline seemed very disjointed and didn't flow as it should could have done br br keifer sutherland appeared to be little more than window dressing and made me wonder why he agreed to play what appeared to be a bit part beautiful scenery and the acting of tem morrison and cliff curtis was about the only plus br br maybe by being a kiwi i set the bar higher for locally made films maybe the change of director supposedly hard to work with main actor has biased my opinion br br maybe i'm just trying to make excuses for a movie which could have been great br br a lot of which still does not explain why this movie just lacked anything special br br it could have been great it wasn't
<START> the acting is good the action is good and so is the plot if you like some good fast entertainment with an air for authentic action scenes not the hollywood looks great but is totally ridiculous kind you're in for a special treat just sit back and enjoy
<START> i think dirty dancing was a great movie they tried to make another one havana nights which was good but it was nothing like dirty dancing i would like to see another dirty dancing with the same people without them i think it would be a mess a lot of times movies are made then when they try to add on more they start to change the people an make the movies go down hill i would love to see dirty dancing have another one to see what happened after they were able to be together patrick an jennifer did so well together this movie was made in 1997 its time to make another one but this time start where it left off an keep the same people in it
<START> while i agree this was a 1950s sitcom i don't feel it was typical firstly donna reed was a strong woman unlike the regular 50s sitcom moms she made a stand for women's worth and equality remember the episode where the tv announcer says just a housewife and donna stands up for all women do and represent especially those that don't work outside the home and when the women rebelled against something in the series it was not something trivial it was always something to show that women have the right to be treated with the same respect as men remember donna reed was married to the show's producer so she had much more input into making hers a more powerful character br br the children were intelligent but not precocious they were normal kids and they could act br br something else that made donna reed show stand out was not only did the children look like their parents but you could feel the chemistry between all the actors in the real life situation which then came out in the characters shelly and paul peterson have often written and remarked that they were treated like the children of donna reed and carl and that the adults were fiercely protective of the child actors and treated them accordingly donna and alex also had somewhat of a sexual chemistry that wasn't seen on the other family shows and the characters could be flawed and in major ways and yet accepted for the flaws and mistakes these were not super parents that did no wrong and had no emotional highs and lows they were normal people acting as normal people br br women's rights drug abuse child abuse single fathers poverty children who need good health care but can't afford it it was all shown on this show pretty groundbreaking for the era br br donna reed show didn't last for eight years without a reason and it could have possibly endured had it not been for tony owens and donna reed divorcing br br this show is highly underrated and should be shown so that other generations can appreciate quality br br in summary i agree with the original poster who obviously cares for the show but i think that the donna reed show has so much more to offer than casual entertainment
<START> obvious tailored vehicle for ryan philippe it seem the studios were hoping he could play a lead tough cop and not look like he's eternally 16 he can't br br heavyweights jason statham and snipes serve as bookends to phillippe but when they're not on the screen phillippe flounders his shallow acting style has nothing to bounce off of br br the script is a typical late 20th century potboiler good cop bad cop with a ridiculously predictable plot and dialogue lifted out of 1970s tv cop shows such as the streets of san francisco snipes reprises his role as the eternal black hat villain playing a slightly less crazed madman than his demolition man role however there wasn't much for snipes and statham to chew on statham's character announces he'd given up nicotine and caffeine something this movie badly needed injections of br br truly forgettable moment ryan phillippe on buddhist dogma galloway are you a buddhist dekker no it's just something i picked up along the way
<START> whenever this film gets a mention usually the discussion begins and ends with the wonderful collection of cars and drag scenes often overlooked are the at times eclectic characters that populate the film around the three central characters br br one character that stands out is rebel played by the great veteran australian actor max cullen rebel is a blind drag racer who nearly runs down the hero and his group in the middle of the night because he is not using any headlights br br in the back story we discover that rebel master builder of street racing cars and he and his wife seem locked in a time warp of the 1950's rebel goes on to play a small but pivotal role in teaching mike played by terry serio the almost spiritual truth about street drag racing it is not speed reaction times that make a great racer it is the one who feels the car best who will become the greatest br br this is best exemplified as rebel explains to mike after a test drive you got all the agony just missing the style br br graham bond is another well credited actor lending his talents as a crooked police officer looking to get in on some of the financial action being generated by the street racing the confrontation between bond and fox played by richard adds tension to the story bond not only expects results but also fox to drum up racing business br br for most of the movie fox displays a real manipulative and evil side yet in the climax he presents a sense of honor that turns the final few minutes into an extremely tense and memorable ending it is almost as if the film is on its true intention to show us the culture of street racing rather than the day to day activities of people br br one of the major complaints about the film is the script although it is nothing exciting i believe the complete lack of any chemistry between mikes girlfriend played by deborah conway and his mechanic played by vangelis mourikis has more to do with the problem any scene in which these two interact simply should have been cut br br lastly in terms of the actors one truly standout performance is delivered by kristoffer greaves who plays a deaf and crippled member of fox's inner circle his back story is never explored was he injured in a race born that way what is it that fox sees value in to keep him around br br the reality of the film is simple it is about street racing and the culture behind it when the cars are flying and action sequences are in motion it is the only time director john clark and his writer barry seem really comfortable with what they are doing br br so if you are looking for an in depth exploration of human relationships moments of life defining drama then this film is not for you if your pulse races at the thought of a blown 57 or the iconic gto phase 3 blazing away on the streets of sydney then you wont find much better than this film
<START> imagine if you will four teen students have an assignment to spend the night in a haunted house in st louisiana to check for the existence of the paranormal if you watch this in the dark and late at night you possibly will have the hair on the back of your neck rise a couple of times otherwise this mock documentary is a very lazy rip off of blair witch project what is to be dialogue is very lame and the actors are pleasant looking enough but seem to lack genuine personality it seems to take forever before something real spooky even happens this movie is excellent for when you have both eyes barely open and everyone is and
<START> mild spoilers br br the premise goes like this a store gets burnt down and assistant sergio is asked by the father of the man who started the fire to take the wrap to which sergio agrees br br so far so good but there s a fair lapse of logic involved sergio agrees to do this for the sum of 25 000 dollars but why come on guys if you were a good looking white boy would you run the risk of getting a long spell in a tough jail a very real for arson for the sake of 25 grand i know i wouldn t and seeing as you d have a criminal record no employer would want to touch you with a barge pole so is 25 000 dollars all that much for a life of and welfare cheques there s also something else that seems to have gone without notice from the premise since mister has told sergio that his son did the fire he seems of the possibility that he may know too much wouldn t alarm bells be ringing in your mind about someone wanting to keep you quite if they told you something br br i guess we re not to think about such details since a pyromaniac s love story isn t to be an intelligent thriller it s a light hearted romantic comedy chick flick that s probably best as a girls night in looking through this comments page it is obvious that the movie has its defenders but as a cynical male i wasn t too impressed and william baldwin does go way over the top
<START> this film is a great rampage of action and comedy it gets right in to it right from the start there's no boring build up the chemistry of the leading roles adds to the excitement and anticipation of the ending even though my suspicions were not satisfied the special effects worked brilliantly and were believable would have liked a different ending but it still had me reeling in emotions the story line unfolds well however it is a film you have to watch from start to end carefully to pick up on all the details to fully understand and get maximum enjoyment br br
<START> spoiler alert br br a clichÃ© riddled film that somehow makes an anti death with dignity statement though it attempts to do the opposite washington is a paralyzed forensics officer who has been suffering and wanting to die for the past four years apparently he wrote his huge selling book only a year ago though so it hasn't all be despair he arranges for an assisted suicide with his doctor who will return in a week br br in the meantime he helps out on a serial killer case he recruits the gutsy i don't wanna do it but i'm just so good at it cop jolie and they track down impossible clue jumping to highly unlikely conclusions in matters of moments hey that old bolt means that the killer has the millionaire's wife in a steam tunnel by the old building right it's laughable yet no is smart enough to figure out that doctor who's going to assist him is the killer br br when he comes to washington to murder him ahead of schedule he has a change of heart and struggles unbelievably for his life cut to the obligatory bad guy about to shoot the good guy scene when bang the gun goes off but the bad guy didn't fire no the woman steps out of the corner she has just shot him in the back
<START> i can't really remember any details of this movie except that the setting looked awfully familiar then i realized it was filmed at the lazy lizard hostel in utah that was one of my favorite places to visit when i was younger and wandered around the country the guy who owns manages the hostel managed to get himself in the movie all i remember about the plot of the movie is that it involves jeeps and naked women it is great to watch just for the scenery i mean the rock formations if you are just looking for soft core porn you will probably be better served elsewhere i don't even know if this movie is available on tape or dvd
<START> this movie is sweet not cloying just warm spirited and kind i found it only mildly funny and the premise is wildly improbable but the characters are so charming especially minnie driver's that they had my full attention right from the beginning and soon had my affection too br br bonnie hunt has done a great job in her directing debut and a good job with the writing as well i highly recommend this movie and will see it again i'm sure
<START> dark reality is a saw like movie that is slightly decrepit while the plot and story are good there is a little too much unnecessary nudity while i feel the film was technically well done the acting was spotty it was just a little too dark for my mood while i was watching it it basically says that there are a lot of missing people out there that will never be found and are perhaps being tortured by sick i feel that some information on the captors and their reasons for being so sick would have helped some it came of as a snuff film just made for the violent content if you like to see women beaten tortured and killed then this is for you if you're looking for something a little and more expressive and reasoned skip this one
<START> this movie tries to run away to the typical 'i'm fighting because i'm obliged to defend the fatherland the nazi's are all bad guys i'm against them' typical of german war movies how by not talking too much about it and just referring the war and the pow's nevertheless i would like to see a german movie which would be something between the extremity of come and see and the bad nazi's das boot i say this because excluding this factor the german movies are the best depicting 2nd world war and the german side you easily see some of the german hierarchical relations very different from the ones in us army br br this is a movie which tries to get a real sight of what was stalingrad and i was not there and i doubt most people were there now but if i would choose one movie depicting this battle for sure would not be the all american enemy at the gates why do i say this because even the best soldiers are not hero's and given the conditions they may regard their own lives instead of the fatherland this goes for all the ranks and in the end you see von giving the example
