<START> this is a charming little film which like many of it's kind derives it's charm from the circumstances involved rather than the actual dialogue br br glenn ford as always shines through in a great comedic performance as the penniless air force officer married after just one day to gold digging showgirl debbie reynolds br br after the one initial wedding night of passion and a life changing move to spain the two quickly realise that apart from the strong sexual attraction they feel for each other they have nothing at all in common br br however when she decides to give their marriage a go it is on the understanding that it for one month trial period only and sex is most definitely not on the cards br br ford is also falling foul to his new 40 000 lincoln concept car the future batmobile which he wins in a the same night he meets his new wife br br the car is bringing him unwanted attention from the air force who see it as a vulgar display of american wealth and is bringing suspicions of corruption and embezzlement etc it is also putting him in the 80 90 tax bracket and as penniless as he is he now faces a tax bill of over 17 000 not the kind of money you should be owing when your wife is the kind of person who spends over a 1 000 on one shopping trip br br even when he tries to sell it it brings him misfortune as selling so much as a cigarette or a pair of stockings to the natives is punishable by court martial so you can imagine that a 17 500 transaction practically has the firing squad polishing their rifles br br his potential is also causing him problems as he is a disgustingly handsome bull fighting spanish nobleman who's interest in the car has lead to a stronger interest in ford's wife made worse by the fact that a rich jet set lifestyle is being offered and is what she has sought for so long br br with ford's sexual frustration rising and jealousy in his love rival mounting coupled with reynolds' materialistic attitude and flirtatious behaviour around the enamoured spaniard serving to drive the wedge deeper between the two it seems that their whirlwind relationship is destined to end br br but can whatever love and attraction that threw these two love birds together in the first place shine through and keep them together br br not the best example of this genre of film but due to the watchable performances by it's principles and the enjoyable plot line it is certainly a fine one
<START> this movie with all its complexity and subtlety makes for one of the most thought provoking short films i have ever seen the topics it addresses are ugly cynical and at times even macabre but the film remains beautiful in its language artful with its camera angles and gorgeous in its style skillfully recreating the short story of the same name written by a master of short stories tobias wolff br br not wishing to spoil anything of the movie i won't go into any details other than to say that this movie is magnificent in and of itself it takes pride in what it does and does it well it shows the most important memories of life all of which can be topped by the single most elusive feeling unexpected bliss this movie of its own volition has created in me the same feelings the main character tom noonan felt when words transformed his very existence and that is one impressive feat
<START> jean paget joe harman and noel all are unlikely heroes and survivors petite but strong jean whose strength and resolve help save lives marching hundreds of miles and with calm self discipline and persuasive powers joe harman oh my word who took risks for jean and the other prisoners only to suffer the worst pain imaginable and noel who trusted jean regardless of the odds her good humor and inspire everyone around her and those with the courage to go in with her are rewarded the beautiful scenery and musical score adds to the adventure despite the length it was never boring to me these ordinary people did extraordinary things and it is based on a true story someone borrowed my vhs a few years ago and i never saw it or them again learned my lesson mates and will buy another copy when it can be found it's a shame the miniseries is not on dvd
<START> throughout the world the unmistakable imprint of the american c i a can be found in many a muddled mess they have left behind in the beginning their objectives were simple spy remove enemy agents steal classified information and destabilize governments years have elapse and although their mission remains similar their clandestine black operations now include domestic spying u s citizens and infiltrating american organizations who criticize the u s government this movie however centers on the c i a 's world manhunt for the infamous 'carlos the ' the film is called the assignment and tells the story lt cmdr ramirez aidan quinn a u s naval officer who bears a striking resemblance to the mastermind of so many terrorist bombings recruited by jack shaw donald sutherland of the c i a and amos ben kingsley a special agent from the israeli ramirez is secretly trained to look pose infiltrate the elusive organization and to thereafter discredit the real working for the russians this film is explosively exciting and packed with wild chases killings and inter country mayhem quinn is wonderful and surprisingly artistic playing both sides of the war easily one of his best efforts
<START> though i have watched i do not know if excrement tastes tart if it does this film is accurately titled so much of so little substance this is the celluloid equivalent of celery only it does not cleanse the palate it leaves the taste of wasted time in the mind's mouth and if i could vomit this film and get back that expanse expense i would detention was more exciting the director should be forced to wear a dunce cap and the spirit of ed wood jr couldn't save this semi professional projection from certain failure a waste of time a waste of mind don't be fooled by the toothsome dominique swain competent eye candy she was in the lolita remake less tragic and than sue lyon though by no means better however a previously competent turn of the screw does not make her a skilled crafts person you need craft for that not crap which is what this film is the reels belong in the girls' bathroom flushed till the pipes burst while director direct less christina wayne should do 5 10 in study hall watch anything else and pass this class by bye forever
<START> jane eyre with full frontal nudity i was not surprised to see that a woman had had a hand in this awful woman's picture and i mean that in the worst possible way the trouble is it could have been so good if they had only left out the jane eyre stuff and stuck with the vastly more interesting scenes involving the spanish portuguese jews in early 19th century london when the sound track music is better than the film you know you are in trouble when you fast forward the video because you can't stand the film just to make sure you don't miss anything you are in even worse trouble this film will end up on the romance tv channel where it rightly belongs
<START> thought i just might get a few laughs from this long drawn out film but was sadly disappointed this film is all about losers who spend most of their time trying to get a passing grade with out even trying to open a book or accomplish anything the film also portrayed teachers and the principal mary tyler moore mrs stark labor pains 2000 as complete idiots i know this was suppose to be a comedy but it never made me laugh and i thought the entire film was a complete waste of time however all the actors gave excellent performances and had the hard task of trying to make this film an enjoyable and entertaining film just plain studying and getting good grades for college is the only way to go
<START> obviously the the responses here were written many years after the film was released and cannot be taken in context back in 1980 in post labour england this film was bloody funny we were glad of something to laugh about and rising damp with its sympathetic mockery of a complete social strata was one of the best british sitcoms of its period if not ever it struck a chord in almost everybody and in true british fashion we laughed at the in ourselves america had nothing to touch this type of humour because self debasement was not amusing to our overseas cousins leonard was one of englands finest actors on stage on tv and in movies his commitment and professionalism were second to none richard beckinsale was although young a perfect comedic foil to and should by all rights be classed as an all time great had he not been taken so young i feel sure he would by now be classified as one of britains greatest comedy actors frances de la tour found her finest television moment in rising damp and for me never her undoubted ability with further roles if you did not see the film at the time of its release you are not qualified to comment simply because you cannot understand why it was funny the humour of the moment
<START> i'm normally a fan of bruce willis and despite him playing the cold hearted professional killer i thought him the most appealing character here that said his character makes such a mess of his professional activity it's incredible he hasn't been caught before the plot is thin to the point of being nonsensical the end was no less annoying and insulting for the fact that it could have been predicted from about 20 minutes into the movie br br spoilers follow in hollywood morality the good guys always win with a few casualties along the way and the bad guys die or are at least heading for justice by the end the breathtaking insult of the film is the way that our ira terrorist who has somehow become a cuddly touchy feely character gets to walk off to a new life as does his former terrorist playmate who is now a loving wife and mother br br who's the bigger villain the former and so far as we can tell unrepentant terrorist or the hired assassin i don't see much to choose between them in real life or in the film br br this is the poorest film i've seen this year
<START> it was surprising that a silent film could be so easy to watch the economy with which it has been edited and the films structure itself are the main elements that contribute to this br br the film really captures the spirit of the revolution that it is dealing with you really sympathise with the sailors and citizens of course this film has it's own agenda but as it is a practically redundant cause it can be viewed as a piece of entertainment in a much clearer sense br br the tension created on the screen is excellent starting with the battleship itself and then moving onto the mainland things escalate believably and for a film of it's era it really is quite unflinching in revealing the sacrifices made by the characters in the film br br this really is worth sitting through that is if you can adjust your modern viewing habits for 90mins
<START> i can't comment on the accuracy of this production historical or literary but i can say that i enjoyed it if there is a god the sound track will be released ilona work is truly enduring twenty years on i am still moved by the haunting themes of this production and return to it frequently br br the story surrounds the entry into society of catherine moreland somewhat awkward and possessed of an unhealthy interest in gothic stories early pulp fiction catherine descends on bath in the company of mrs allen where she meets henry she is invited to visit the at northanger abbey the seat of the formidable and somewhat financially challenged general who has the unfortunate misconception that there is wealth afoot br br where mutual attraction mixes with family finance dispute is inevitable this coupled with catherines vivid imagination leads her to fear for her safety her eventual departure is marred by accusations and counter accusations of deception and connivance br br but the attraction between catherine and henry stands these trials he returns to provide a happy ending this final scene is especially compelling given the incidental music of ilona br br it may well be a bad production from the purists viewpoint gaudy costumes and shaky performances not withstanding but for me it's 88 minutes of bliss
<START> was a hero and one of the founders of the french revolution of this movie is set five years later and the revolution has morphed into something ugly while initially the revolution promised freedom at this point the small committee running the country is extremely repressive and is a dictatorship and his friends were angry at how the country wasn't better off in 1794 than it was before they got rid of their king so they begin criticizing the government the movie begins as the printer who makes critical pamphlets concerning the government is beaten and his business is destroyed so much for liberty equality and fraternity so as a result of being silenced this way et al begin publicly criticizing the government eventually robespierre the leader of the committee and his cronies trump up charges have a show trial and get rid of the dissent some have mentioned that the polish director also intended this to be a criticism of his own nation which at the time was soviet dominated and very repressive as well this makes sense as you see the movie unfold especially when the government destroys all dissent in the name of the people br br the acting is fine the story compelling and i have no major criticism of the film however i really wish the ending had been handled differently especially because other than history lovers and french people most probably have no idea that this execution helped to end the government after this purge of in april 1794 robespierre himself was executed in july 1794 because the country had just had enough plus those surviving frenchmen knew that they too would face the guillotine sooner or later if this sick system remained in place some sort of an epilogue would have been nice such as showing the soldiers coming for robespierre he responded by trying to kill himself first but he only succeeded in blowing off part of his face still alive he was shortly afterward this would have been a dandy little epilogue and could have been done in about five minutes however not showing a connection between death and the fall of the government is an odd thing to omit
<START> after a group of young friends experience car trouble whilst travelling off the beaten track they accept an offer of help from lonely local mr chuck connors owner of a nearby museum full of historical wax mannequins once at the creepy roadside attraction the friends are stalked by a mask wearing lunatic who can bring the museum's dummies to life through the power of the mind br br tourist bad guy is a demented cross between the texas chain saw massacre's leatherface and anthony the scary kid from the classic twilight zone episode 'it's a good life' whilst the plot is a blend of elements from the aforementioned tcm hitchcock's psycho and house of wax the atmosphere and execution of tourist trap however is so totally off kilter that in this respect it's virtually impossible to draw comparison with other earlier movies br br director david continually inventive and unpredictable treatment of his own script gives the film a distinctly nightmarish quality and with a brilliant left field performance from connors an impossibly creepy score from pino donaggio a collection of truly unsettling mannequins with detachable jaws and the presence of super sexy tanya roberts who spends the film in and briefly out of tiny denim hot pants and a figure hugging boob tube tourist trap is a totally unforgettable and ultimately one of a kind horror experience well deserving of its cult following
<START> when i first watch this series the impression i got was that the characters were charming and funny and rory in particular were witty and intelligent albeit a bit too talkative after watching it for some time however my opinion changed br br the main characters slowly revealed themselves to be self centered self obsessed who treated tiny wounds to their pride as the worst insults in their existence for example rory wouldn't speak to her mother for months when didn't consult her on her impulsive marriage while dumped luke for simply wanting a little time to adjust to his new life circumstances these people are shallow see themselves as the center of the universe where everyone else should behave exactly according to how their own rigid rules and if they don't they will hold grudges against them for an eternity they don't want to see other people's problems and treat the smallest slight as the gravest offence most of the characters appear to lack the ability to behave in a grown up way they think they should do whatever that they wanted and everyone else be damned br br the series is character based so when the main characters became so unlikeable the show also became impossible to watch i still have the rest of the series but i doubt if i will ever finish watching them i will also hold anyone who think highly of the show and its awful characters with the greatest suspicion they must just as horrid as et al
<START> i can't knock this film too terribly because it's obvious midway through the the watching of it that they were trying to make it bad or 'campy' if you prefer anyway many of the parts they tried to make funny actually are but often simply for the cheese factor watch the 'space game actually played as real life scratch your head at the bumbling robots oh the and watch the whole thing go way over the top near the end with the 'time warp' and the sexual innuendoes just keep on flying i'm actually surprised this got away with a pg oh well a fun way to waste a couple hours but star wars trek this ain't folks 3 out of 10
