<START> the hindi version of the film is minutes set in bengal in the early 1900's the film based on novel draws an analogy between the british colonization of india and the subjugation of women an educated and beautiful woman becomes a widow within a year of her marriage but she does not accept the constraints imposed on her as a widow by her society the film has a beautiful look to it but perhaps aishwarya rai is out of her depth in portraying strong character with its subtle combination of idealism and idealism does not come across and as a result the analogy between women and colonization remains somewhat buried
<START> ann margret did the best job she has ever done in her history of film making i felt as if she was mrs there might be one or two films of ann i have not seen since her film debut in pocket full of miracles with betty davis in 1961 i feel she has been totally under rated in the industry though she was nominated for an emmy award for this role in who will love my children she was overlooked like she was nominated for an academy award for her roles in carnal knowledge and tommy she was snubbed over all i think everyone did a superb acting job including all the children in who will love my children yes it is a sad movie as true stories can be but well worth the time thank you
<START> this movie sat in a dusty stack of videos in my house for ages before we watched it we knew it was there every time someone wanted to watch a movie it was suggested it almost became a joke i know let's watch throw momma from the train i don't know why it was always turned down it just was little did we know what we were missing out on it still befalls me why it took us so long i mean it stars danny devito billy crystal and ann who we referred to as the lady from the goonies an all star cast that should have appealed to everyone in my household but there it sat for nearly ten years until one day it was suggested and we could turn it down no longer br br it was like finding king tut's tomb br br no movie has ever made me laugh so hard and i doubt any movie ever will i had to rewind for almost every line because i was still laughing at the line that came before it and lost ability to hear or pay attention not just simple laughing either the kind of laughing that more energy than running ten miles in the cold the kind of laughing that you cannot control that causes rolling around and spasms and tears and snot running down your face because it's just that freakin funny once i learned the movie by heart i will say this effect has lessened but i don't think i will get tired of watching it and finding new quirks in it to appreciate i think that's all i can say i would recommend this movie to anyone but if you don't enjoy it please don't let me know i will probably be offended
<START> seven ups has been compared to bullitt for the chase scene but does not come anywhere near matching bullitt bullitt has a beginning that builds builds builds when mcqueen leaves the seedy hotel gets into his mustang which is parked under the freeway now torn down and notices the charger sitting you know you are about to see something spectacular from that moment on when mcqueen starts that car begins the best car chase sequence ever filmed adding to it is a terrific lalo if i remember correctly sound track this goes on for a long time before you actually hear the first tires squealing that shot of mcqueen's mustang suddenly appearing in bill rear view mirror is unmatched for visual impact look of surprise and double take really adds to the effect then of course san francisco is unmatched for the setting of cars racing up and down hills and around bends also bullitt being filmed in the 60s when cars were still hot mustang gt and dodge charger made for a better set of wheels then two boring smog device laden in the 1970s seven ups bill hickman was the driver of the bad guy car in both movies i saw him sitting at an insider movie preview once on the univeral lot when i was doing movie reviews for a paper they gave it a good try in seven ups though with the chase scene seven ups had a few jumps over little hills yawn but of course they were not san francisco hills the seven ups chase where they are actually going fast is longer than the go fast sequence in bullitt but the scene of a single shotgun blast totally blowing the hood off of roy pontiac is the height of absurdity strictly hollywood i would say except that it was filmed in new york
<START> with that carry the same dark weaknesses we all unfortunately possess lying deception laziness the list goes on br br however as an american i was shocked to see that corruption and racism exist in today's police force as is reflected with the duval county sheriff department's horrible detective and police work with the murder of a white female tourist and a 15 year old accused black youth i shook my head in shame that detectives were protected from their abusive work while a young man's life hung in the crooked balance of justice br br however there is also a story of hope with our judicial system and how poorly paid public defenders stuck by their guns irony intended and forced the truth from the detectives i wanted to fly down to florida and tell anybody with influence what a great public defender team they have in duval county those lawyers care about the little man and most importantly for justice br br the other story line is about faith and family praises to the family and their strong christian submit any dedicated religion beliefs and wonderful family values i hope they win their lawsuit against the duval county sheriff's department br br bravo for justice bravo for the little guy
<START> i normally don't like romantic films but i love this film very much the story is really touching and the ending is very appropriate i feel i really care for many characters in this film i feel i can feel their feelings while most romantic films always make me feel detached and bored this one completely makes me feel involved starting from the scene of capshaw running along the beach with scott until the ending scene i want to rate this film 11 out of 10 because i want to give an extra one point for the ending the acting part is very strong kate capshaw has a good opportunity to show her talent though i'm not impressed with scott in dead man on campus ' this film completely changes my viewpoint towards him he's so irresistibly charming here geraldine mcewan is as terrific as ever br br this film might not be as good complex deep or believable as other films which deal a little bit with the same kind of relationship such as de la chair' or 'post animal triste ' but the love can still be proud of itself as it casts a rare different light on that kind of relationship and that difference makes this film eminently enjoyable by being and relying on great charms of small stars dreamworks this time you really make my dream come true
<START> i saw into pitch black on t v and so i had to see this i must say i was very impressed br br not only has david style improved since he wrote critters 2 this film brought to my attention vin diesel sure he was there in into pitch black but here he was ferocious scary and intense i haven't seen charisma like that since schwarzenegger in the 80's br br the story is simple enough but it is the characters that make this film interesting then there was what happens with the female lead unexpected the dark humor helps the film move along the effects aren't grand but when riddick fights the alien it blew all of my complaints out br br diesel hasn't done a whole lot since this film that i would care about but i am eagerly looking forward to the sequel
<START> i believe an entire book can be written about the odyssey to remake the classic film on which this film is loosely based when hollywood first started talking about such enterprise the reaction was always negative because there were just too many aspects that could have gone wrong starting with the solid ensemble that made the original unforgettable and that's exactly where things begin souring here with the selection of actresses that otherwise can do remarkable work but that are not suited to the parts and sadly enough have been directed with the heavy hand of a director that doesn't understand or appreciate the source material br br it seems as if there is no focus or direction or as if the direction that has been taken is to obliterate anything that was good about the original film this is called an updating as in let's drain the story out of humor snappy dialogue and any interesting premise most of all let's prove that women have come a long way except that the problem is that we don't really get at least by watching this film where the women are truly going br br for starters casting meg ryan in the central role proves almost fatal to the movie because somehow she seems to have locked herself into some sort of limbo where women don't really change appearances even after 20 years of working in the movies her mary which proved to be a difficult role in the 30's somehow grew from her interaction with the other stereotypes like dorothy in the wizard of oz by learning observing and realizing that she had a choice in the matter it might not have been a choice that women would celebrate nowadays but it was fun ride and part of the fun was the catty silly sometimes slapstick routines that elevated that movie into the realm of the sublime in here we are down to earth with a thud by changing the nature of sylvia the film has lost a lot of its spark and it isn't in anyway annette fault i couldn't help but admiring how she tried to save this sinking ship and got a sinking feeling as she struggled with the horrible lines she was handled thankfully i entertained myself by looking at some of her terrific outfits and kept reminding myself how talented this lady really was her sylvia is wise but flawed and she could have been a great creation unfortunately ms english wasn't paying attention to her own work and loses control of the one character that could have turned the film into a fresh direction br br yet that wasn't the biggest blasphemy of them all in the original we have joan crawford doing probably one of the best performances by a woman her crystal is legendary with conniving lines incendiary moves duplicitous maneuvers and some very sexy poses she was the link between the male and the female and through her we knew what the whole catastrophe was about she provided the tension between men and women she was dangerous sexy the ultimate femme fatale a woman of intelligence that we feared and admired and most importantly we wanted to destroy to save our heroine eva mendes as gorgeous as she is is two dimensional in this outing because of weak writing and once again some bad casting br br there are more atrocities in the film such as the addition of a terrible role for as the dedicated mother who lives for having babies and the rather annoying lesbian turn by pinkett then comes the biggest waste of talent in the movie as bette who is a little unrecognizable in her make up shows the spark of what could have been her acidic delivery reminds us of the contemporary angle the film could have taken her words revive and put a big of much needed naughtiness in the film and it is exciting to see that it could really fly then she is gone she is in the film all of six minutes and she fades away in the middle of the muddle br br here is a movie that raised our anticipation level and truly disappointed us a film that could have joined the successful sex in the city who made an amazing transition to the big screen because it respected its source material and didn't compromise it gave us more bigger and better adaptation it truly updated what had made it successful before the women in its present reincarnation needs to go back and rework itself much like the hulk did it this year find more suitable performers a really good writer and most of all someone who truly treasures what good movies are about
<START> ugly heartless hollywood crap that expects nothing but ugliness and from its audience the scenes without spacey reveal how truly awful the film really is but the scenes with spacey are just so entertaining that you hang on in there right to the end yes he could play this part in his sleep but he does it so well he's such a joy to watch so believable and marvellously monstrous enjoy it for his performance but don't expect anything else from this movie if you want to see a great film about the evils of modern hollywood check out robert altman's the player this sad little potboiler is not remotely in the same league
<START> when i first saw this movie i was only a little kid and i fell in love with it they really don't make movies like this anymore i just watch this again now slightly older and still love it br br the humour is perfect and fits into the movie really well all the gags are kind of childish but will make adults laugh as well and in a kids movie is really very rare br br the animation is amazing and to watch hand drawn animation is a real breath of fresh air to all the computer animation we see today the backgrounds are stunning and the coloring is amazing br br the characters are just the kind of characters that you fall in love with the moment you start watching girls will think the chipmunks are adorable and guys will think the are really kinda sexy br br the songs are fun to listen too and some just really make you wanna cry or get up and dance its also fun to watch visual humor to go along with them br br the voice acting is great no doubt even if most of the voice acting is high pitch but an interesting thing popped up and it one of the songs from this movie but the slowed down to show the real voices behind them and its really kinda fun to watch br br if you see this movie in a store or somewhere to rent i say check it out it's really worth seeing and is a perfect family movie its absolutely amazing words can not express this movie
<START> witchcraft witchery la casa 4 and whatever else you wish to call it how about crud br br a gathering of people at a massachusetts island resort are besieged by the black magic powers of an evil witch killing each individual using cruel torturous methods photographer gary david hasselhoff is taking pictures for linda catherine hickland whose voice and demeanor resemble ee yor of the winnie the poo cartoon a virgin studying witchcraft on the island resort without permission rose brooks annie ross portraying an incredibly rude bitch is interested in perhaps purchasing the resort and along with husband freddie robert champagne who is always ogling other women much younger than him pregnant daughter jane linda blair and grandson tommy michael manchester who just looks bored throughout probably wanting to watch sesame street instead of starring in this rubbish go by boat to the resort being treated to a look at the property by realtor tony giordano's son jerry rick farnsworth obviously a pup in the business getting his feet wet along with these folks is architect leslie leslie cumming whose character is a nympho who might help rose re design the resort the boat's captain is killed by the lady in black hildegard knef wearing her make up and lip stick extra thick and a storm is brewing the boat drives off by itself guided by the invisible power of the lady in black i guess with everyone stuck in the decrepit resort which is in dire need of repairs most of the victims before meeting their grisly fates are carried through a type of red wormhole whose vortex leads to another dimension perhaps a type of hell or something where they are tortured by these fiends dressed in raggedy clothes with a crummy visage one victim has her mouth sown before being hung upside down in a chimney roasted as the others light the fireplace one poor soul is tortured by harsh twistings of rope wrapped tightly around her flesh before being found hanging from the snout of a swordfish penetrating through her neck one fellow is slowly suffocating as his veins bulge and bleed and neck's blood vessels burst squirting in hasselhoff's face one fellow is crucified with nails hammered into his hands before being hung upside down over an open flame blair's pregnant victim becomes possessed with her hair standing on end speaking in another woman's voice one is raped by this demonic man with a diseased mouth as the hellish hobos stand nearby gleefully cheering the film despite it's excesses is mostly dull fodder for those who really wish to see the lowest point in the careers of hasselhoff and blair who deserve better than this almost unbearable at times building little to no suspense clumsy execution of the death sequences which look cheap and laughable sure some gore is okay but most of the film shows victims after they've been run through the ringer we do get a chance to see pregnant women who look exactly like stuntmen in costume with bad wigs jumping out three story windows oh and the lady in black's reflected face often pops up on inanimate objects for characters to see tommy has a little sesame street recorder which tapes the lady in black's mumbo jumbo chants obviously used for later for some reason the lady in black likes to visit little tommy he's not at all scared of her for tommy's just too bored to show any expression on his face much less fear need i say more this one's a real stinker ugh
<START> sheltered young woman home schooled and possibly quite gifted harbors a disturbed overly emotional side which comes to the surface after her absentee father pays her mother a visit asking for a divorce directed by celebrated cinematographer william a this ill titled psychological thriller falls into the trap that most films helmed by directors of photography find themselves in each shot is composed for the utmost style but at the sacrifice of fluid pacing and a tight gripping narrative and his cinematographer lÃ¡szlÃ³ are very fond of gauzy whites and golden tones giving the picture a tableaux feel the mansion at the center of the action looks like a funeral parlor and paces the wheezing yarn just like a funeral robert shaw and sally kellerman as shaw's fiancÃ©e two of the most interesting actors of the 1970s manage to cut through the plastic overlay and are quite compelling despite the jagged editing which turns their scenes into little bits of half realized business sondra locke another interesting screen personality seems cast for her resemblance to catherine deneuve in repulsion pale and saucer eyed with thick and long hair locke is a curious human puzzle and she's initially quite intimidating and dangerous however this role is so old hat that locke can find nothing fresh to bring out of the deep freeze and she flounders allows locke's freak out scenes to go on and on while shaw looking terrifically debonair is put in the impossible position of playing touchy feely daddy to her all of this nonsense might be worth slogging through if the screenplay had been peppered with a modicum of or at the very least some dry wit or humorous relief as it is lewis john and edward hume's limp script adapted from stanton novel go to thy deathbed strands the viewer early on and only the charisma of the players gets us to the finish line 1 2 from
<START> the moon is blue director otto preminger tackled even more taboo subject matter in his controversial 1955 release the man with the golden arm whereas he had incensed the motion picture association of america with his use of the words virgin and mistress in his mild 1953 comedy the moon is blue preminger went far beyond what any movie had attempted with the man with the golden arm since dick powell made his law and order epic to the ends of the earth 1946 about thwarting the international traffic in narcotics based on nelson novel that won the 1950 national book award this gritty uncompromising minute black white melodrama deals with heroin addiction initially when preminger's film came out the motion picture association of america would not issue its seal of approval because the filmmakers depicted addiction to narcotics this groundbreaking film qualified as the first major motion picture to handle narcotics from the dope fiend's perspective and actually showed the paraphernalia that junkies wielded to shoot up heroin the production code that filmmakers must refrain from showing characters using illicit narcotics nevertheless united artists released this unique frank sinatra picture and it grossed over 4 million dollars br br the critical and commercial success of the man with the golden arm eviscerated the production code as a result the mpaa the code so that filmmakers could delve into other taboo subjects such as drug abuse kidnapping abortion and prostitution the film received three academy award nominations oscar nominations went to sinatra for best acting joseph c wright and darrell for best art direction set decoration black and white and elmer bernstein for best music scoring of a dramatic or comedy picture indeed elmer bernstein made a name for himself with his jazzy score the producers had thought about casting marlon brando in the title role but sinatra beat brando to the punch eleanor parker kim novak arnold darren mcgavin and robert strauss co starred with ole blue eyes mcgavin was particularly memorable as a sleazy heroin dealer while eleanor parker played the protagonist's wife with a dark deep secret of her own that comes as quite a shock br br the man with the golden arm refers to protagonist frankie ability to manipulate a deck of cards frankie deals cards for zero robert strauss of stalag 17 but he has been out of chicago for the last six months in a federal narcotics hospital recovering from heroin addiction not only has frankie licked the habit but he also has learned how to play the drums and plans to embark of a music career optimistic as frank is about his future he finds himself facing his past all over again when he returns to his old stomping grounds wants him to deal for him again and nifty louie darren mcgavin of counter attack tries to induce him to resume his heroin usage meanwhile frankie comes home to his invalid wheel chair bound wife eleanor parker of escape from fort bravo who manipulates him with guilt frankie was drunk when he had a car accident and wound up in a wheel chair frankie shows up with high hopes and a drum set but sees no future for him as a musician and urges to go back to work for frankie plans to visit a music promoting and one of his own friends sparrow arnold of my sister eileen shoplifts a business suit from a department store for frankie after frankie refuses to work for because he is going to see musical agent harry lane will wright of the wild one turns both frank and sparrow into the police meanwhile gets department store to drop the shoplifting charges the suit was worth 37 00 frankie agrees to resume dealing for and the hustler bails him out not long afterward despite his resolution to shun heroin use frankie breaks down and pays louie the 2 00 for a fix br br eventually frankie meets harry lane and lane warns him that he is catches frankie shooting up that he will have nothing to do with him what poor frankie doesn't know is that has recovered her ability to walk but she uses his guilt about the accident to hold on to him is also jealous of her downstairs neighbor molly kim novak of picnic frankie's former sweetheart who hustles drinks at a nearby strip bar called the safari club when complains about headaches that frankie gives her practicing on his drum set frankie moves them downstairs into molly's apartment and louie are planning a big poker game with sam george e stone of guys and dolls and williams george mathews of gunfight at the o k corral two big time gamblers who have heard about frank and his legendary 'golden arm ' and louie persuade a reluctant frankie to deal for 250 after an early winning streak frankie starts losing and he cannot reverse his bad luck in fact frankie spends about two days dealing exhausted his nerves shot and desperate for a fix he falls apart on the second day and and williams catch him cheating louie refuses to give frankie a fix so frankie knocks him out and his apartment for the heroin br br preminger pulls no punches in the man with the golden arm and the film is pretty disillusioning none of the characters here are remotely sympathetic essentially they are either hustlers or hustled sinatra gives another dynamite performance as does mcgavin and parker to be sure the man with the golden arm has lost much of its impact in the intervening 50 or more years but it still ranks as a landmark film
<START> the story overall though quite graphic is actually decent and reasonably interesting to readers however the movie was absolutely dreadful the story was good but the acting was terrible i was crying the whole time because i knew i could never get my spent time back don't see this movie if you do bring a pistol with a bullet in it and a few bullets if you're going with friends i feel sorry for everybody who had anything to do with this film i also feel sorry for everybody who had to watch the film avoid this film at all costs and if your mother forces you to watch kill her hahahahaha see i'm a psycho now turned me into a psycho
<START> i can understand why others reacted rather unpleasantly towards the climax yielding a twist that really is hard to take seriously i think though that the build up to it works rather well the music quite menacing and spine tingling really provides a spooky aura matching the unforgiving sound of a constant ringing telephone that is driving struggling english actress joan matlin jean marsh bonkers she's borrowing a pal's nice apartment while attempting to jump start her career in new york city the city buildings outside the window look about as realistic as david letterman's and is unceremoniously welcome by a noisy telephone which rings quite a bit followed by loud slams against the wall searching for answers regarding the one responsible for such disregard towards her sanity joan discovers that no one rents that room and that a former tenant had in fact strangled herself without help from the manager joan will decide to find out for herself who is causing her such anguish joan discovers the room empty and the phone with a particular female voice which will haunt her br br the episode i think is a tour de force for jean marsh who is a one woman show she's the only actress visible and we follow her through the crisis which slowly erodes her the phone and the banging from that other room causing her much distress which grows into fear instead of leaving joan remains so shaken by the noise and to the breaking point where she just wishes for the phone or whoever is ringing to stop the episode provides a possible answer as to who is plaguing joan and why a character named beth comes into the story rather late as joan struggles to find out whose female voice it was across the other line who knew her name on that dreaded phone she discovers in the room across from hers the fate of beth might just tell the viewer why joan is being traumatized i think this episode is an exercise in spooks instead of credibility some didn't particularly like it but i certainly did i will admit that the phone as a physical menace crawling towards joan is hard to take seriously not to mention it's attack on her but i thought the intense opening twenty minutes before this were suitably chilling enough to make up for it
