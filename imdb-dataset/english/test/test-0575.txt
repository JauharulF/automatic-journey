<START> after seeing the harry potter movies i've been a fan of the trio actors rupert daniel radcliffe and emma watson yet we've been waiting to see if they would do other projects besides play the same characters year or every two years of the j k series mainly instead of a trio the cameras and magazine articles concentrate more on daniel and emma being that they're the leading male and only leading female in the saga leaving rupert dead end no matter every actor has a time to shine and light hits him for once in this movie br br driving lessons is called the harold and maude of this generation with rupert playing the role of ben marshall a young british lad who lives with his domineering mother laura linney and a wimp of a vicar priest father for which he wants a job in the summer but can't find work while at the same time taking his driving tests and failing and writing poetry for a young girl who doesn't have any interest in him br br ben seeks an ad in a church newspaper for which the job requires to take care of an elderly lady he takes the job and realizes that he's in for a fun of surprises as julie walters mother in the harry potter series an out of work actress who is also a poet giving ben the run for his money they bond where and tell each other secrets along with acting like a child and getting into mischief where she drags ben along for a country road trip from their not only does ben drive all the way from britain to scotland since needs to recite at a local library but at the same time an older lady falls for the young man in which ben starts becoming a man br br there is mishap and at the same time rejoice with ben and along with saying that i was very pleased about the film when it came out in theaters and i was impressed with rupert acting especially if he showed the rest of the world that even though he brings a bit of ron within ben marshall there's no stopping the actor on his brilliant performance
<START> kramer vs kramer won five oscars including best picture of 1979 this intense and deeply moving family drama follows an advertising executive whose life is turned upside down when his wife of eight years walks out on him leaving him to care for his son and build a relationship with him he never had robert incisive screenplay presents us flawed but real human beings with hearts souls and brains for instance in the scene where joanna announces to ted she's leaving him she doesn't just storm out the door she gives him the keys her credit cards the dry cleaning ticket tells him which bills have been paid and informs him she has withdrawn from their bank account the same amount of money she had when they were married no more this decision to leave was not a whim it was thought about and joanna felt with no other option than to leave if she was leaving she was going to do it properly and with no specific plan in mind she did not think it right to take billy dustin hoffman won an oscar for his ted kramer a man so obsessed with bringing home the bacon he had no clue that his life at home was crumbling into pieces meryl streep also won an oscar playing joanna the unhappy wife who we feel sympathy for in the beginning of the film but that all changes when she returns for her son hoffman is at the top of his form here i always tear up during the scene where he tries to explain to billy justin henry oscar nominee why his mom left and he does it all in a stage whisper or when he meets joanna upon her return and slams her drink into a wall a hoffman moment not in the script that streep was not told about in order to get a natural reaction justin henry hits all the right notes as billy the confused little boy who doesn't know why his mom is gone and doesn't know how to communicate with his father jane alexander also got an oscar nod as ted and neighbor margaret who has switched allegiances by the film's conclusion this is an intense family drama but there are laughs to be had here too billy and the chocolate chip ice cream billy pouting because ted is late picking him for a party billy catching his dad's one night stand jobeth williams on her way to the bathroom stark naked but it's the moments of human drama you remember ted running through manhattan with billy in his arms to get to the emergency room after billy falls off the jungle gym ted getting fired right before beginning his custody battle and instead of making a scene he tells the guy in a whisper shame on you and of course the finale where joanna tells ted she's not taking billy which i found a little hard to swallow why would she go to all that trouble of suing for custody and then just change her mind but this is a small quibble regarding a wonderful movie masterfully directed by robert benton and flawlessly performed by a top notch cast a must see
<START> avoid this movie if you are expecting the poseidon adventure 1972 you may experience nothing more than a case of the this film offers nothing more than two extremely long and drawn out hours of complete boredom br br the cast members act as if they are angered by the irritation of a bathtub of water overflowing on a bed of an petunias the script is totally unrealistic and the film does not even have the feel of a disaster movie in fact everything about this movie is bad with the exception of tom it is unfortunate that such a fine actor got swept away by a flood of misrepresentation to appear in such a washout when this movie was being made the poseidon must have turned over in its watery grave in a sea of shame and shelley winters will rise again from the dead direct from the poseidon to haunt anyone who dares to see this pathetic movie i rate this film a 1 out of 10 but it really deserves a zero this movie will make you want to avoid or completely turn against water and it will leave a bad taste in your mouth it may even make you want to see jaws 1975 and befriend a great white
<START> i really thought this would be a good movie boy was i mistaken for a quick summery b grade acting c grade special effects d grade for the overall movie don't get me wrong the story was pretty good and not kiddish so an adult too ride along with it the hero is good looking so most women will like it not a total chick flick as it contains some fight scenes and some blood br br but the way it is shot horrible br br the special effects would be better suited for tv on a kids show br br and lastly send some of the actors back to acting school if they ever attended a class there br br trust me there are much better ways to waste 2 hours br br you have been warned
<START> i saw this on television more years ago than i can remember but never forgot the performance of sammy davis jr i just by chance thought to look for it on video this rendition of and bess is a treasure i would love to see it again and introduce my son to it as well i just can't imagine why it is not heralded as one of the greatest performances sammy davis jr every gave whoever is responsible for not bringing this to audiences should be ashamed of his her ignorance i will continue to look for it though maybe the execs responsible for such things will come to realize the forgotten work of so many african american actors
<START> i spotted the dvd on a store near my home and since i'm a cheesy horror movie alien flicks addict i wondered how good it was it even had two award mentions on the cover i don't remember what festival it won so i figured hey this might be good so i bought it for five euros and i came here to imdb to check out some reviews here either people bashed the movie to say it was bad or people said the movie was a wonderful feat in indie movies bla bla i then played the dvd not thinking about any review i had read with an open mind and not expecting anything at all br br man i don't' like being this critical but the movie was genuinely bad ok i'm just going to give out some pointers of what i thought br br 1 acting dialog the acting was so confusing sometimes the actors did a decent job but there were scenes were i could spot no effort at all from them the dialog was even worst i think it was probably the aspect i most disliked in the whole movie the talking in between characters seemed off not just bad but far away from the actual happenings in the movie the monologues of the female character although well delivered became boring and annoying in a little while but of course the most ridiculous aspect was the aliens or the infected i wont even comment on that one just going to say that it was absolutely ridiculous and took the entire mood away from the picture 2 visuals the strongest aspect in the movie if you forget the awful fx and light flashes they used to simulate explosions or what the hell they were supposed to be the camera in car aspect was quite cool actually but they didn't even used the environment to inspire fear or dread they left that to cheap sound and video fx and the three infected characters the movie becomes boring in so many scenes 3 sound talk about editing this movie has no problems in showing how weakly edited it was from computer sounds imitating the forest animals to the alien dialog ah br br so what did i like in the movie spoilers the only thing i really liked and it was actually quite scary was the succession of two scenes where the car is still and you spot something someone walking in a distant at first i really thought it was me seeing things but when the character realizes that the figures coming towards her were her own reflection i was surprised pretty creepy idea done well apart from that i had an awful time br br and i don't recommend this to anyone not even teen get together because you can't even laugh at this br br i give it a solid 2 only some technical achievements worked here apart from that yeah nothing
<START> silly disney film about a college student who accidentally discovers a potion that makes things invisible not a bad idea and some of the special effects are pretty good still the script is very bad all the jokes flop and the acting is lousy everybody's trying to be funny and they're not a real boring stupid disney film but it was fun seeing kurt russell so young
<START> i kept waiting for the film to move me inspire me shock me me in some way but it stirred none of my emotions it just meandered along to the end none of the characters seemed very unique or complex they just seemed like actors reciting their lines i think it could have been a better movie if the characters expressed more emotion the only one who did and was believable was the veteran and he probably committed suicide just to get out of the movie as soon as he could it was a waste of talent film their time and mine if there is a message or meaning or genius in this story it certainly is well hidden or i am very dense which i doubt
<START> living just down the hwy from georgetown co i remember this movie well and thought it was great the story seems like something john would do even in real life but there is something that i will always remember most about the movie for those of you who don't live in denver every christmas the city of denver co puts up a fabulous display of lights and decorations at the civic center in downtown denver well as it so happened during the filming of this movie a nativity scene was needed so it was borrowed from the civic center display with permission by the way someone had forgotten to advice the powers that be and it was reported stolen a frantic search began with law enforcement for a few days finally someone spoke up and remembered it to the film crew in georgetown it was returned and put back where it belonged as it turns out it wasn't featured all that much in the movie you can barely see it during the christmas show with the children it did create quit a disturbance though
<START> apparently i am swimming against the tide of the glowing comments on this film i have not seen it since i was 4 or 5 years old but there is one thing i remember distinctly br br the was terrifying nightmare inducing terrifying with the creepy music and the little girl and kangaroo running hopping away for their lives br br as a kid i also remember the animated hobbit no worries watership down didn't blink an eye dot and the kangaroo it still haunts my dreams and i have several friends the same age who also think it was massively creepy maybe we can get a group rate on therapy br br in short one freaky film for its time
<START> i can't say what knowing the source for this movie adds but this is one of my favorite films from paul mazursky director and co author this is a retake on the shakespeare comedy but utterly removed from the stage without much text mazursky and star cassavettes make visual a mid life crisis of passion and purpose desperate to re center himself cassavettes retreats to a remote greek island where the locals and the island itself weave a little magic with raul julia especially susan sarandon and molly ringwald this is an adult fantasy that is emotionally satisfying and visually gorgeous and funny it wasn't a big box office hit but whenever it does come to dvd it will sell
<START> this 1955 heist film follows tony le recently released from prison for theft as he undertakes the robbery of his life he teams up with his old heist buddies and they bring in an expert safe cracker cesar from milan played by jules dassin who also directed he only directed because he had been blacklisted as a communist in the u s and couldn't work in hollywood the brilliance of this film is the 1 2 hour during the robbery during all this time there is no dialogue and no music only the muted sounds of digging through the floor or drilling the safe this increases the suspense and draws you in they get away with several hundred million francs worth of jewels but a jewel offered to a dancer by cesar brings their haul to the attention of a trio of brutal brothers they set out to get the stash for themselves and bring misfortune in their wake great heist gangster movie but i prefer j p melville's films in this genre br br this movie is like some lemonade i had last night i had gone to a caribbean restaurant and the lemonade was made with sugar cane juice instead of sugar it also had a lot of ice and was heavy on the lemons leaving it fairly sour which i like the sugar cane juice imparted a subtle slightly more mellow taste to it than actual sugar and the ice made sure it was cold and refreshing as i sucked it down 7 5 10 http blog myspace com locoformovies
<START> this film like much of their music is either underrated or unnoticed by the casual observer it is terrific and in many ways ahead of its time br br the images are funny disturbing and at the very least engaging br br the music is amazing br br this is not the candy pop sound they are unfortunately associated with this is the sound of a band in exploration and revolt br br head alone should put the monkees into the rock and roll hall of fame br br can anyone tell me why these guys are not in there
<START> sandra bullock paints a believable picture as the troubled detective though seeing her as a cynical man eating victim turned requires a leap of faith or two the two creepy troubled kids are portrayed adequately by ryan gosling and michael pitt br br i do have quite a bit of trouble getting ben chaplin into the equation same problem arose when watching 'the truth about cats dogs' http us imdb com title i mean when you put an englishman into an all american movie shouldn't there at least be a reason to put him there shouldn't there be some story leading up to the fact that an englishman is serving as a detective on an american police force shouldn't there be some dialog pointing out and explaining that rather obvious fact or even some jokes about him being that english br br he looks out of place here as he looked out of place in 'the truth about cats dogs' producers really should take notice it distracts and annoys the audience at least me nothing wrong with chaplin's acting it's just a matter of making an actor who is 'out of place' believable and not putting him somewhere without a good reason or a storyline br br the movie itself well thrillers especially those dealing with solving a complicated crime require some suspension of disbelief this one's no different actually it requires quite a bit more effort than usual in order to make bullock smart enough to crack the case despite of all the pressures requiring her to let go of it some unrealistic assumptions are being made about the evidence and i'm sure a lot of people who watched it had a few moments of 'come on this is highly unlikely under the or even 'hey you can't brush evidence aside like that to wrap this movie up ' br br like i said reasonably entertaining and watchable just don't use this as required viewing for detective exams there are no shortcuts there
<START> this is definitely a lesser known comedy short from the 1920s the only reason i saw it was because it was on a dvd by kino films featuring non laurel and hardy shorts featuring ollie they are interesting and historically important but also generally average to below average for the style film compared to shorts by chaplin keaton arbuckle and lloyd they are definitely a step below them in quality and humor also the accompanying music was pretty poor by the standards of other silent dvds i ended up turning off the sound due to the of the music to set the proper mood but despite this they are still worth seeing br br i've gotta be honest about this short it was the last of 8 on this dvd and by the time i got to it i was pretty bored with the mediocrity of 7 of the 8 shorts so it is possible the film might be a little better than a 4 but certainly if this is the case no better than a 5 the film is a pretty standard short about an incompetent bellboy nothing especially interesting and there are certainly much better silent shorts out there
