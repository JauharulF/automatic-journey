<START> times i look back to high school and it amazes me that i never went lower than marvin did in this bad film br br poor marv is the main character who's bad luck just gets worse and worse despite his intelligence he manages to get bullied exploited supports his lousy deadbeat dad and plenty more goof ups including a daring heist which let's say doesn't go fully to plan of course the viewer feels no empathy with anyone in this film so all this disastrous gloom bounces off like harmless zeta rays recommended for those days you're feeling down pop this film in and you'll smile and say i'm so glad i'm not marv
<START> i have just sat through this film again and can only wonder if we will see the likes of films like this anymore the timeless music the tender voices of william holden and jennifer jones leave this grown man weeping through joyous romantic scenes and i'm not one who cries very often in life where have our william holden's gone and will they make these moving wonderful movies any more it's sad to have to realize that they probably won't but don't think about it just try to block that out of your mind even so they won't have holden in it and he won't appear on that hill just once more either you can only enjoy this film and watch it again
<START> this is the worst exercise in middle class pretentiousness yet to hit our television screens i unfortunately did not see it when it was first shown but paid for the joy of watching six hours of excruciating drivel and i'm still waiting for the laughs to arrive i love having been a big fan of both black books and green wing and therefore know that she is capable of the very best of comedy parts however she played this part as well as she was able considering the lack of any decent comedy material provided please broadcasters bear in mind that the trades descriptions act may well be invoked if you continue to bill as comedy material which is at best pseudo psychological romanticism and at worst a drama which poses as a quirky comedy to hide the fact that is neither fish nor fowl
<START> i would say to the foreign people who have seen this movie and who did not understand it that it is normal because it was based on massive plays on words a person not knowing about the french cultural funny references in this film could not follow all the subtleties the movie has been a huge success in france and all the actors are well renowned here
<START> wait until you've watched most of all other films ever released wait a year then watch this when you're ready for something with such low production values it that will not challenge anybody's imagination br br i agree that whoever rated this movie as a ten star production has to be doing it to skew the data anything above 8 would be odd br br nice to see the very young sandy bullock in her hair for the short time she was featured though she overdid the new yorker accent but other times her southern virginia nc accent did sneak through ancient history for this accomplished actress who has grown so much since this film br br the dvd i rented had two bonus features a mini bio section that only featured sandra's bio taken verbatim from imdb it also had a trivia quiz as a bonus 3 questions hope you get them all right
<START> i should explain that as far as this trend goes for ripping off asian horror movies this shutter is a head above the grudge and dark water while still not achieving the same amount of atmospheric creepiness that the ring establishes br br still though movies like life don't exist in a vacuum and are therefore up for comparison to other suspense thriller horror movies honestly i'm not writing a lengthy synopsis here and will say that this movie attempts to rely on music induced startle scares rather than atmosphere and the ghost itself really isn't that remarkable the plot is pretty basic and predictable and isn't anything to write home about either while there are a few suspenseful scenes that border on creatively scary most of the movie is pretty vanilla if you enjoyed the grudge and it's ilk then you might enjoy this br br grade c
<START> this is a well crafted piece from everyone's favorite master of suspense as usual the technical elements such as camera work and lighting are outstanding especially for the film's time i did not find the first part of the film very exciting but the latter one certainly made up for it with one thrilling scene after another br br the only thing i did not like about this movie was the choice of farley granger for the part of guy haines somehow i didn't find him very believable on the other hand robert walker shines as sinister 'bad guy' bruno anthony br br overall i would highly recommend this
<START> in a nutshell the movie is about a gang war in the 1950's leon the leader of the deuces starts the gang after his brother od's on junk he vows to protect the neighborhood the leader of the rival gang is just getting out of prison and wants revenge br br the movie didn't really do it for me the good guys weren't any more good than the bad guys very little was shown to suggest that the deuces really cared for the community i suppose the writers were going for realism here but i just didn't care which side won none of the characters were likable or even capable of drawing my sympathy br br on the plus side the courtship between annie and bobby had some snappy dialog and the acting overall was well done
<START> wow i watched one night at yesterday and all i can say is wow br br here i go major spoilers br br would you like a summary of the plot just to see how stupid and pointless this movie is i would never tell anybody to watch it unless i was out to inflict pain upon them anyway here's a glimpse or a huge chunk of the plot br br randy works for a bar he meets up with this woman named jewel who convinces him to surprisingly have sex with him her ex boyfriend ends up trying to rob them and gets killed randy and his cousin and the detective at the scene of the crime all fall for jewel she being the mascot of stupidity uses every one of these guys to get what she wants involving a dvd player randy hires a hit man to kill her and eventually the detective is killed by the ex boyfriend's psycho brother and the hit man and jewel take off br br seriously that's it i left hardly anything out except for a few more sex scenes and a nearly pornographic scene of liv tyler as jewel using a hose to flaunt her sexuality br br what was the point of this movie to be honest i think it was so that the producers and directors could show off their male urges which i think is absolutely uncalled for and just plain stupid when i watch a movie i want a plot i want characters i don't care about sexy woman flaunting anything they might have something should happen in a movie for goodness' sake this is as bad as fight club br br it gets even worse john goodman is the detective devoted to the higher being i myself wondered why goodman would play in something so outrageously pitiful as this but then i remembered that he was in o brother where art thou as well his reputation just went down a notch br br liv tyler was an amazing actress in the lord of the rings series in this movie she is nothing more than an unintelligent slut who wants nothing but her way her reputation has gone down seven or eight notches to me br br i am amazed simply amazed that people would work so hard to make something so stupid the music is absolutely crappy having ymca play while john goodman's character is being killed doesn't really fit the characters are totally unlikeable the plot is one of the most stupid ever conceived by man and to top it off it doesn't even fit into any genre the closest it gets to is pornographic comedy if it was even supposed to be funny which it wasn't br br i think i'm done ranting now but let me just assure you that nobody in their right mind would ever ever want to see this movie unless they lust for liv tyler as much as the characters do that is
<START> this is one entertaining flick i suggest you rent it buy a couple of rum and invite the whole crew over for this one my favorite parts were 1 the gunfights that were so well choreographed that john woo himself was jealous 2 the wonderful special effects 3 the academy award winning acting and 4 the fact that every single gangsta in the film seemed to be doing a bad scarface impersonation i mean master p as a cuban godfather this is groundbreaking territory and with well written dialogue including lines like the only difference between you and me rico is i'm alive and your dead this movie is truly a masterpiece yeah right
<START> the movie is nothing extraordinary as a matter of fact it is an insult to the horror genre nothing about it borders on scary not even close to the threshold of scary br br it's just another case of another teenage horror movie seen one and you've seen em all first few minutes in the movie and you'll know what will happen next the worst part is the script is than the most recent installment of scary movie would have been better if it's written in spanish and don't get me started with the inside jokes and punchlines br br though i will give a little credit for the special effects but trust me like any other hollywood made horror movie and special effects has little or no effect to a horror movie's ability to scare in fact it makes it worse br br between the fresh faced anita and the spooky location there's not much to see in this movie
<START> another tiresome bore from anthony who seems to thrive on these big bloated super productions that take over two and a half hours to do what any reasonable filmmaker would do in about ninety minutes br br the story centers on a jude law who goes off to the civil war having just barely started a sort of romance with nicole kidman a preacher's daughter who has recently arrived in the prettily photographed backwater town the story cuts back and forth between trials and tribulations at war which is guess what boys and girls hell and kidman's trials and tribulations back at home which are very predictably incredibly boring renee appears on kidman's farm to help kidman get it back into shape after kidman's saintly daddy dies of inconvenient character disease acts all squinty and bossy in that granny clampett kind of way dispensing enough tough love and homespun wisdom to turn the stomach of even the hardiest watcher of touched by an angel br br this film is quite simply excruciating avoid it like the big bloated oscar bait bogus pretentious literary adaptation nonsense that it is
<START> some changes for the better the special effects are more elaborate some for the worse scott a likable kid in the original has turned into an awkward teenager but generally this sequel is about on a par with the original which doesn't say much the pg 13 rating is questionable although the film is not scary at all there is some brief but quite explicit gore and some out of place nudity 1 2
<START> a great movie the movie was even better then the commercials put on and believe it or not it was very very inspirational i really think anyone who walks out of the movie at the end will be inspired one way or another br br it was kinda corny at the very beginning but quickly picks up i laughed i laughed very hard on some parts the acting is basically above average nothing special but better then average i can safely say it was the second funniest movie to come out this summer 1st funniest being clerks ii so after all of that i give it a 7 10 a high seven but not quite an eight
<START> against my own better judgment i went to see this film today and god i wish i hadn't awful the first film looks like a classic compared to this it's that bad these guys actually make paul ws anderson look like a master storyteller in fact this is what i'd expect an alien and or predator film to look like if it was made by uwe boll this movie actually offended me and lord only knows what would transpire if ridley scott or hr giger were ever forced to watch this piece of crap i can't understand how any fan of either franchise could like this film br br truly i don't know where to begin i mean the first was poop but it at least a semi interesting story and setting and occasionally some genuine tension it didn't take itself overly seriously and it could at least be semi enjoyed on a purely leave your brain at home basis but this one it felt to me as though the people behind it thought they were making the next horror masterpiece one after the other was a contrived scene in a dark room or corridor with creepy music playing essentially bashing you over the head saying be scared now as james cameron once said you can't be told to be scared you can only have your own senses heightened the guys that made this film obviously weren't paying attention because they tried everything in the book to force you to be scared rather than letting you come to that level yourself it's a clichÃ© for internet nerds to say god i was so bored from this movie and felt like leaving well this is exactly how i felt even in the middle of the action scenes they took this film totally seriously which removed any possibility of enjoyment even the gag about how governments don't lie to their people was played without a hint of irony br br as for the characters i knew going in that the human characters were going to be completely pointless to this film but seriously if they're going to be on screen at least have them doing something that is relevant to the story i don't care about this guy being beaten up by his boyfriend i don't care about the mother who's own daughter doesn't even know her boo hoo a pair of night vision goggles for a present give me a break or the released criminal just trying to make a decent living and set an example for his brother what a guy hell even the obligatory hot chick in panties moment was more contrived than usual i get the feeling they expected the audience to be so shocked at the ending as well as seeing come out of kids expectant mothers being raped and the like that that would make up for everything i don't think so br br then we move onto the stars of the film and again very little to write home about were the aliens well designed i wouldn't have a clue because you can never see the damn things all you see is one of a mouth a head a tail or a really dodgy cg outline climbing a wall and barely enough to actually process that it is in fact an alien before mr i cut marilyn manson and nin music videos think i'll do the same thing here editor goes at it with the slice tool also notice how hack action directors always set their films at night and in the rain hmmmm the predator could've been fighting giant sea monkeys for all we knew yes the predator was more impressive this time around and i did think some of the new weaponry was cool but that was about it also since when does a predator sound like a dinosaur from the lost world there were a couple of things that i kinda liked though one was the use of sound effects and music from the original films i also giggled a little bit at get to the chopper although other references were stupid the main character's name being dallas give me a break i also liked the visual fx for the vision as well as how the hybrid alien looked certainly beat the one from resurrection but really those are the only positive things br br overall i found this movie inane pointless insulting and above all else offensive to the vision of the original creators of both creatures that they've left the door open for another one leaves me almost depressed br br if they had any decency they'd remove dan ron and hr giger from the credits of this film they've done nothing to deserve this
