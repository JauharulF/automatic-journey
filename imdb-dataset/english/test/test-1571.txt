<START> to date this is still the worst piece of rubbish i've ever viewed so annoyed i even complained to blockbuster for stocking it me and some friends rented it after looking at the back cover thinking we were in for a good horror film the plot line seem to change during the film and there was lots of irrelevant padding the film ended quite abruptly i'm guessing they ran out of film sound quality was dire and the first female character had a very thick spanish accent although she talked utter nonsense anyway the guy provided a brief bit of eye candy until his bizarre attempts at murder after wasting all the time to go into in depth discussion on the workshop and its many power tools he opts to put a plastic bag over her head all in all on second thoughts i think you have to watch this film to actually believe it exists
<START> i wasn't expecting a great deal from this film so i was pleasantly surprised when i watched it and found it to be most noteworthy it's is mainly due to the talent and appeal of it's star john garfield br br garfield plays jack a boxing star who is framed for murder he must go on the run and ends up out in the sticks with gloria dickson and the dead end kids here is offered a chance for redemption yet will the past catch up with him yet garfield was an actor ahead of his peers before the term 'method' was even coined and before brando ever screamed 'stella ' he brings to the screen his earthy quality and amazing acting talent dominate this production also interesting is that his role here as a boxer has shades of that 'golden boy' role he so desperately wanted to on screen garfield looks the type and goes the distance as a boxer proving his acting worth br br ann sheridan is here in a small role at the beginning as jack's trampy girl goldie i haven't ever thought much of sheridan but i liked her here she plays well off garfield performance is a little tired and she does not share good chemistry with garfield the dead end kids are here and garfield seems their natural idol even more so than cagney claude rains is miscast and he looks uncomfortable in the role in many a scene strange as he always was such a reliable actor br br also interesting to note is the director busby berkeley best known for his early musicals with dancing girls and kaleidoscope images directs a different genre here with remarkable ease he maintains a gritty atmosphere throughout admirably br br a very good film that deserves greater attention 8 10
<START> there have been many people that have tried to make a movie that was identical to the story heart of darkness some movies have been based on heart of darkness like apocalypse now in 1993 nicholas roeg directed a film that was exactly like the book heart of darkness the movie is almost exactly identical to the book this movie is full of action and adventure heart of darkness is about the journey of a seaman named marlow who sails along the congo river to meet the super powerful ivory trader mr br br heart of darkness the movie has the same exact beginning and setting as the book it takes place on a boat in the thames river and marlow is telling the story to four other men on a boat called the nellie the whole movie is a flashback of marlow's journey to see mr kurtz on the congo river marlow works for the belgian company which trades ivory along the congo river he tells of his account in the company's office and about all of the maps he saw in the office br br marlow sets out on a steamer to africa he arrives at the central station where he receives orders from the general manager the general manager tells marlow about mr kurtz and the ivory trading marlow would be doing marlow soon finds out that the general manager is not fond of kurtz because he fears kurtz will replace him marlow waits around at the central station for months because his ship has been wrecked and it is getting repaired marlow sees the harsh treatment and enslavement in africa while at the central station when the ship has finally been repaired marlow another african character named and other crew members set sail on marlow's steamer for mr kurtz br br along the congo river they are attacked by african natives in the wilderness as marlow's crew is attacked by the african natives they end up shooting and killing when marlow finally arrives at station he meets a russian who explains the might and glory of kurtz marlow is then led to station home there he sees many maps and pictures that kurtz has painted finally kurtz enters the room and begins to tell marlow about all he has done in africa and talks about his mistress marlow soon finds out that kurtz is insane with power because the africans hail him as a god marlow becomes angry with the harshness and enslavement that he sees in africa after marlow finally meets kurtz kurtz begins to die while kurtz was on his deathbed he called marlow into his room life begins to flash before his eyes and his last words were the horror the horror when marlow returns to europe to see fiancÃ© marlow tells her that last words were her name to hide the darkness in life br br heart of darkness was directed well and was formed into an adventurous movie i recommend anyone to watch this movie because it is full of action and mystery the movie is slow at times but in all it really interesting heart of darkness will really broaden your mind and will teach you a lot about how to interpret different scenes
<START> marathon has a very interesting premise excellent ambient sounds and good scenery unfortunately the movie aside from these aspects falls flat on its face for a woman trying to complete so many crossword puzzles in a day she spends an awful lot of time standing around sulking and not doing puzzles i believe there is more walking shown in the movie than her work on these puzzles also while i understand the point of showing so much scenery there is simply far too much of it the movie is incredibly boring and unfocused it's not worth buying renting watching on television or viewing in any conceivable way i lost interest so quickly that i'm not sure why i sat through the entire film in the first place
<START> this is a really good flick with awesome humor jim as we know was very good with facial expressions and demonstrates a lot of it in this movie this is definitely the best of the ernest films i would surely recommend it to any ernest fan out there i find myself to have great taste in movies and i'm sure anyone will enjoy this movie in the movie ernest plays 2 roles bad guy and good guy and plays them quite well i really enjoy exaggeration type humor where things just seem impossible like in the naked gun films for example and there is plenty of it in this movie i bought this movie right after i saw it good directing good script worth renting
<START> this film is about a struggling actor trying to find satisfaction in life especially love which he has not had a taste of for 5 years br br it basically is a film featuring a man with very poor social skills and he says wrong things all the time the plot is hollow and contrived the main character james is lonely but this theme of loneliness is not adequately explored it is more like an empty statement which other subplots stem from sadness and disappointment after being dumped are superficial there is a serious lack of emotions in the film br br it is not funny as a comedy either there are some funny one liners but that is it it lacks the happy and uplifting atmosphere to infect people with happy mood i don't find i want someone to eat cheese with funny
<START> poorly acted poorly written and poorly directed special effects are cheap best performance is by yvette but that's not saying much story is a confusing mess about corporate greed leading to sabotage of a space station and an attempt to rescue those stranded aboard br br there is little suspense and even less action there's one car chase that's not bad but the rest of the movie is simply a waste of everyone's time
<START> this is perhaps the television series with the greatest potential of any series around the production values are in a class of their own the characters are rounded and interesting this is entertainment at its best some of the aliens are quite grotesque but there is an underlying humour which makes it unmissable i hope that this series goes on for many years and will have many spin offs science fiction has had its bad press some justified but this is truly a flagship science fiction series and i thank henson for it top marks
<START> tom dodge despite having a reputation among submariners as a renegade and maverick note to reader maverick does not mean tom cruise maverick means non conformist is actually an intelligence operative for the vice admiral of his submarine fleet the vice admiral is concerned about our old friends the russians hosting yard sales with their old diesel countries like lybia north korea or iraq would love to get their hands on this baby and slip a nuclear warhead into norfolk harbour or florida and this was 6 7 years before 9 11 br br the admiral assigns dodge to assume command of a moth balled wwii diesel sub and mount an exercise against the surface fleet and the uss orlando a top of the line fast attack sub dodge takes command and in no time whips up the bad news bears err i mean his lovable group of oddball submariners into warriors despite having welcome aboard tattooed on his penis he is a competent and fair commander he does not choose favorites and he delegates authority in a responsible manner the us navy could not have come up with a finer piece of recruitment propaganda than this handsomely made under appreciated gem from the creator of police academy
<START> sweet entertaining tale of a young 17 1 2 year old boy controlled by by an overbearing religious mother and withdrawn father and how he finds himself through his work with a retired eccentric and tragic actress very well acted especially by julie walters rupert plays the role of the teenage boy well showing his talent will last longer than the harry potter series of films laura linney plays his ruthlessly strict mother without a hint of redemption so there's no room to like her at all but the film is a very entertaining film made well by the british in the style of the likes of keeping mum and calendar girls
<START> as a devotee of ms frank i remember being so excited that the play was being re made for tv that is until i saw it this film is a prime example of how important casting is and how directing plays such an important part in creating the sense of purpose the casting of any central role is crucial to a production of this sort shows like auntie mame and man of la mancha are totally dependent on the charisma of the lead actor and in the cast of this movie the whole thing is destroyed by the atrocious casting of melissa gilbert in the lead role there is not one single moment that ms gilbert even comes close to inhabiting the sensitive mature spirit of anne ms gilbert is white bread throughout the movie the only time i was close to tears was during the reading of anne's most haunting line i still believe in spite of everything that people are truly good at heart this is spoken by ms gilbert so rushed so lacking in conviction that she might has well and achieved the same effect film and dance legend marge champion was the dialogue coach for this production she should have refunded her salary despite ms gilbert ruining diary other performances are satisfactory for the most part special kudos to joan plowright as edith scott jacoby as peter and clive as mr schell does not have the deep rooted soul and spirit as otto as does the creator of the role on stage and film joseph schildkraut but he's okay doris roberts and james coco as the van are relatively superficial in their parts they're shrill and bombastic but again only on the surface this could be due to the fact that the pacing of the project is way too rushed as noted in previous postings this film clocks in 45 minutes shorter than the film version the difference owing to the pauses for dramatic effect which apparently is necessary to propagate the appropriate mood for the story this is not mandatory viewing especially for youngsters learning about anne frank for the first time stick to the original film version and or even better the tv production of anne frank the true story starring ben kingsley which is the closest thing to capturing the heartbreak and reality of anne's situation ever filmed note especially appalling is the fact that melora marshall who plays anne's sister margot is not included in the opening credits along with all the other members of the secret annex she's listed in the post credits along with the actors playing and mr if i was ms marshall i would have sued
<START> weak tale of an evil warlock who is searching for a centuries old satanic bible so that he can do lucifer's bidding by undoing creation hot in pursuit all the way is a 17th bounty hunter named and his reluctant sidekick sound like a load of bunkum it is br br this drivel from writer d t gets the superficial treatment it deserves from director steve miner who helmed that romantic nonsense forever young obviously knows nothing about true evil br br julian sands just flies around and cackles trying to look evil while richard e grant succeeds only in wasting his rich talent lori singer's career also took a nosedive with this one br br special effects crew has some fun and jerry goldsmith provides a score superior to its subject matter
<START> as a total movie geek with the fortunate job of video store manager i tend to watch all sorts of movies from good to very very bad this was a movie with so many corn ball lines cheesy cgi effects and predictable plot points that i ended up laughing extensively before switching it off after 30 40 minutes the creature feature genre of movies has been putting out some pretty awful stuff in recent years godzilla 2000 anyone but this movie makes me think the creators weren't even trying it might be worth checking out just for the make fun of me potential count the gunshots but i couldn't in good conscience recommend this movie to anyone
<START> this is by far the worst film i have ever seen it has next to no plot and the plot it does have is very scattered the story line is lacking in both content suspense and subtitles as what would appear to be story line is in russian the set appears to be only one room with various lighting effects and at the moment you think something good is about to happen you are let down by the total lack of acting drama suspense horror gore story line and mythology the directing style has been done to death the fisheye camera it would seem that the only action in this film is within the last 10 15 minutes and the action is made worse by the actors inability to portray the suspense correctly the only interesting thing about this movie was my dog barking at the surround sound
<START> the opening screams zero budget the titles whooshing in look like my grandson was let loose with imovie the dvd box gives the impression that you'll be treated to the old days of '80s boobie movies nope hardly any nudity from a flick that stars traci lords this movie really did need the nudity too instead you get a lot of lords pointing through a shirt however they seem to be activated by hot steam that's odd in my world the headlights go on in the cold br br the plot is pathetic the blind guy is just is a joke and not a funny one his antics are so forced and predictable he trips over stuff and you see him bracing for the fall he needs to work on his physical comedy br br most of nudity comes from a hot tub scene that looks like it was shot months later and inserted in to get a distributor and the nudity is not worth it br br it's just a matter of time before starbucks over that not even funny as billy arrives in town for the first time they come across bucks he comments wow they have these everywhere this leads you to believe it's a parody on starbucks but surprise behind the counter of this location is herself apparently she loves coffee so much that the owner of this huge chain decided to work in a tiny cold town br br the only thing this movie has going for it is the warren miller footage yep this is all warren's stuff so if you want to see great action get a warren miller flick leave frostbite alone br br there is nothing good about this movie there is no reason to rent it or buy it and if a friend offers to loan you a copy for free hit him and end the friendship
