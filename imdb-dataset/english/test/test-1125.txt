<START> i think that farscape is the best scifi since babylon 5 and is one of the best sci fi television series of all time ranking up there with dr who blake's 7 red dwarf mst3k and the aforementioned b5 i find the characters and races of farscape are much more interesting and imaginative than the typical humans with birthmarks that are found in many series the effects are quite good and the stories engaging despite missing the bulk of season 2 and some of season 1 i find the character development very well done
<START> i guess only a selected number of audience members really had any interest in watching how a male hustler in new york operates but i'd be willing to bet that even these brave souls were turned off by the irritating patchwork technique and deliberately muffled sound recording on display here the fact that these inherent were a direct result of the film's low budget underground experimental nature is i'd say beside the point anyway for those so inclined the film features extensive male nudity and joe understandably became an underground Â and gay Â icon br br the episodic structure showing the day to day routine of the hustler protagonist offers a couple of mildly interesting scenes his meeting with and eventually posing for an eccentric elderly artist the one where expresses his views on his unusual line of work and his particular modus operandi to a couple of prospective including perhaps the of hustlers Â a bespectacled nerd perhaps mercifully the film ran for only 89 minutes against the imdb's claim that its complete length is 105 but the latter could well be a mistake br br i had watched a few other of warhol's 'movies' and this one is decidedly not as satisfying as the most tolerable example i've run into yet bad 1977 and only slightly better than the likes of my hustler 1965 which were mostly a strain to sit through the fact that this was only the first part of a trilogy did not well but as the saying goes you gotta to do what you gotta do and the other two 'chapters' had to follow in quick succession br br despite my generally negative reaction to it flesh is nevertheless still valuable as a 1960s time capsule and as a prototype of the underground scene of that era both cinematically and in real life for the record an image of from this film adorns the sleeve of the self titled 1984 debut album and transsexual candy darling who appears here rather unremarkably was immortalized in candy says the opening track of the velvet underground's eponymous 1969 album although the latter band is my all time favorite and one of the reasons for this is that through their unique and ground breaking music they described a lifestyle so utterly different from my own this is truly a case where i'd much rather experience something aurally instead of visually
<START> genre cartoon short with no dialogue african girl and lion br br main characters the lion and the bird br br what happens a lion wants to eat an african girl called there is also a rather confusing bird is he on or the lion's side br br message br br my thoughts i agree with lee eisenberg this is rather mean on poor african people i like how the main character who is an african girl is quite a nice main character but they still portray her rudely and make a younger audience not like her very much just because she's hunting grrr charles m jones i don't like the lion very much and i think the bird is all right i suppose personally i prefer charles m jones's looney tunes cartoons in the future br br if you want to watch this anyway then i recommend the website youtube just type in on the space in the main page and you're there br br i wish charles m jones had been nicer to in this short so there br br recommended to people who are interested in old cartoons and or people who are just messing around on you tube
<START> i have never seen a b movie like this one on the part that the nanny sofia is being killed a hand of a woman appears on the tape handling the stick how bad is that lol i seriously laughed and wanted to stop seeing the movie but i kept watching it to see if this movie could get worse lol it is bad for itself poor pinocchio the only nice bit is the first time you see some special effects of pinocchio's face moving apart from that the whole movie is awful it's not really worth your time if you don't really have much to spare but if you have nothing to do go on treat yourself with some z movie cos b movie is still too good for this one lol
<START> this film is about the encounters of 7 couples on heath in one sunny wednesday afternoon br br it shows 7 different types of couples married divorced breaking up a relationship homosexual elderly blind date and escort service they are not connected to each other apart from the geographical location so that is a disappointment the film is a collage of conversations without any discernible plot the film jumps from a pair to another without any logic i find this film boring and purposeless the only redeeming feature is the great weather throughout the film it is sad that talents like ewan mcgregor and sophie get wasted by this film
<START> i love this movie it focuses on both issues reality and fantasy reality because hey we all wanted a date from that popular guy billy and some of us haven't been kissed yet right be honest br br another real issue is because of the pain people gain from teasing and whoa high school life remember it the fantasy is finding your true love when you're 25 and still in high school not really fantasy but close enough br br although some parts are unbelievable it was a great movie there are no other words to describe such incredible work and the story was wonderful drew barrymore did a charmingly wonderful job same as the hilarious david arquette the people who worked in the movie are all wonderful didn't i just repeat that br br never been kissed is one of the movies that the later generations should watch it shows reality and some not issues for people like you and me
<START> i actually saw the evil on the big screen i saw it as part of a double feature during the early 1980s don't remember the other film when i was in my mid teens the film is bad cringe worthy bad embarrassingly bad the effects are atrocious you can clearly see the cable pulling the black girl across the floor there's absolutely nothing scary about it in fact i laughed throughout the film br br the story tried to create this big built up for the climax when we're suppose to finally see who's responsible for all the evil goings on and we see greasy victor buono who's as scary as an overstuffed twinkie seriously what where they thinking buono who was a villain on the batman tv series is one of the hammiest actors ever to grace the big screen and i just cannot imagine anyone being remotely terrified of him br br the evil is all but forgotten now for good reasons but it's actually a very funny film and i wish i could see this turkey again just to see that black girl being pulled across the room by an unseen force with that very visible cable
<START> hi today i looked this film because of the medium 5 6 imdb rating i thought it would worth viewing also the comments here were quiet good but after start watching this movie i quick realize that this movie isn't anyway near a 5 6 its just boring you can describe the movie with some words also its just the standard horror movie story with all the standard horror movie scenes i don't know why people still like those films or why they vote such films better then a 1 3 in imdb just some examples br br bunch of people arriving from somewhere or going driving to anywhere they meet somehow on their journey strange people but hey maybe they are just nice so hang out with them then a very important scene for every horror movie oh my cell phone isn't working oh oh mine too is that strange but we don't need them so enjoy our ride our strange person is a strange psychopath better we all sit back and scream a while till he starts cutting parts from us or killing some of us after a while the bunch of victims get a weapon or chance to escape ofcorse they never think about running away or even kill the psychopath if they got the chance they just talk about what to do until the psychopath got his weapon back with any of the handful of standard tricks they got in those films and all running back as usual screaming some more to kill oh and in the end it gets really exiting sometimes the bad guy wins sometimes some of the victim can escape wow great movies ok if i never ever saw a movie of that kind i would say it is a movie which can be watched but if anyone ever saw any movie of its kind it should be just a boring waste of time because nearly everything in the movie you know before you even watched it because it every time runs like the standard horror movie mmm maybe there is a windows program out there 2 0 you can just pull some adjustment buttons and get the new shuttle jeepers creepers kind of movie
<START> i have not seen a better comedy than the king of queens for many years i rate it one of the best ever i've just returned to ireland from arizona on american airlines from a biz trip and by chance they showed several episodes i laughed my head off and later i asked the stewards to play again and they did thank you aa the acting from all the team is first rate and especially from kevin james leah and gerry stiller but from all of the cast in fact the acting is superb i love all the cast they are so funny there is a hard edge in the king of queens that i love and is seldom seen in today's tv comedy both leah and kevin play off each other so well that every situation is believable and hilariously funny i have just purchased the 2nd season while i was in az this week and i intend buying the full set the next time i am in the us my son who is 20yrs old also loves this show and its brilliance is that it has the magic to reach out to different generations i would like to thank all those involved with this amazing show it's so appreciated to see this kind of tv show in what is in my opinion an era of poor tv fair in general these days with the exception of re runs of seinfeld and such like thanks for a great show
<START> there's simply no redeeming quality about this film ok some of the costumes are ok but they're nothing you can't see in say the conan flicks and what's up with hair i can't believe this is part of a series i will say one thing about this film it was deemed bad enough for a righteous lampooning by the early cast of mst3k and i suggest to anyone that's curious enough to see how bad this film is to watch that version of the film for moral support if nothing else
<START> i normally am a glutton for poor movies but this thing stunk br br do not watch this movie br br terrible effects and very little humour what the hell was the point of making this movie no gore to speak of and no acting to speak of br br i could only manage 45 minutes of this rat dropping of a movie and that is rare for me br br something positive to say about this drivel cover art was ok i am pretty sure the movie has a ending too even tho i did not make it to it br br the rats were unorganized and blew their lines constantly they lacked intensity and seemed just to be going through the paces for their paycheque the actors were worse
<START> the violent death of fernando ramos da silva only eight years after the completion of this film only adds to the poignancy of powerful message the film is split into two halves the first in a reformatory where a group of youngsters are abused and violated by the violent law enforcers and guardians the second backdrop is the city where they are confined instead by their own actions and morality which includes mugging pimping and killing different characters who enter their lives br br the differing gender and sexual roles in the film allow for constant changes in the characters as they interact with other people particularly interesting is character of a transvestite who is mother and lover to some of the children her reaction to the arrival of a prostitute is both poignant and tragic br br there is no happy ending to this story and i reccomend to watch it with caution as there are some very uncomfortable scenes to watch especially in opening twenty minutes but whilst watching it it is important to remember that this is not just a fictional tale the actors are not trained professionals but instead boys selected from the sao paulo they actually lived this life that is portrayed so vividly on screen and in da case died at the hands of the police who are depicted so brutally a documentary a piece of fiction it borders on both but it certainly makes for heart wrenching material and is a film that actually leaves you breathless and thinking long after having watched it br br 10 10
<START> i have realized that many people have commented on the nature of this show being racist and homophobic but i don't feel that is what this show is about br br the show is about parents who weren't ready for kids and are now not ready for teenagers this show helps to bring humor to a very hard topic that is sometimes over looked parenthood br br yes we have all had shows that had families in it for example family matters step by step family ties full house but it always would have the same old recipe to it's episodes steph cuts from school and gets caught by her father they have a heart to heart conversation and music is played and it's over with a two week grounding that after an aww dad gets a smile and the show is over where is the comedy in such a situation where is the realism with the war at home you get real situations from a real father type figure most parents that watch this show hear some of the lines the parents put out and they either laugh cause they know they've said it or they nod their heads cause they know they've thought it and never had the guts to say it the war at home has situations that bring out great comedy as a father thinking his son is gay doesn't sound funny most think it makes the father homophobic but the comedy comes in the bumbling father trying to talk to his son to open up what parent knows the right thing to say especially in a situation as this i greatly recommend this show to anyone that i know has a sense of humor and especially to anyone who is a young parent or was young when they had kids you relate to a show like this when you are either
<START> this movie is something horrible i was laughing all the time i was forced to stop in some scenes because my mom thought it's not polite to laugh when people are dying but in this movie even death looks ridiculous especially when tornado tommy is sucked into one tornado br br explosions of cars thrown onto buildings by the forces of wind look like ones from the old school side game called r type dialogues are very bad and i am interested how they managed to persuade some of the actors to play in this movie it is simply amazing how such bad movie can make it into the tv br br only real reason to watch this movie is to have some fun of nonsense and absurdity
<START> this movie is excellent angel is beautiful and scamp is adorable his little when hes scared and the funniest parts are when scamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing never had this feeling before' i totally recommend this movie its coming out on special edition on june 20 the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid br br i just cant explain this movie more than romantic charming hilarious and adorable the junkyard scenes are funny all the junkyard dogs have something special too funny i laughed kids will love it buy it when it comes out it has new features
