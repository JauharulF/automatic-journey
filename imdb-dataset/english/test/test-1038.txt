<START> i'm not sure how this could have been better so i gave it a 10 the acting was excellent the main woman was so hot the chap who played was a smouldering pensive character who showed the inner turmoil he was suffering the truck driver's death is one example excellently the storyline was believable and the series length was just about right i e i love lost but will it ever end as a brit i tend to think of yanks as gung ho the lapd were in their ill advised attempts to arrest him but the other agencies were portrayed positively my main thought about programmes like this and the also excellent 24 is could it happen would it happen is it happening now possibly probably br br i hope they do another series but after reading some of the previous comments it would appear not br br to summarise if you haven't seen it make sure you do
<START> i am a huge fan of the 5 50 dvd bin at my local walmart hopefully you have one at your local branch you can find a bunch of campy flicks a bunch of trash and the occasional surprise this movie is one of the surprises my friend recently bought this one and in thinking it would be another cheesy kung fu laugh riot i was genuinely surprised at how good it was i watch a lot of movies and as a result i can almost always call how a movie will turn out and if there's a plot twist what it will be not this movie the directing is brilliant the plot is awesome and the fighting is unbelievably inventive if you see this one sitting around somewhere at a dirt cheap price get it if you see it at full price i would still recommend it
<START> before the days of home video stan laurel's pre hardy comedy 'kill or cure' was known to the extent that it was known at all only because a few sequences were included in robert compilation film and hardy's laughing knew what he was doing the best gags in 'kill or cure' were brought intact into his compilation while the rest of this only mildly funny comedy remained on cutting room floor br br laurel portrays a commercial traveller hawking a patent medicine cried professor i o dine's knox all that name is the funniest joke in this movie which ain't sayin' much i should point out that this movie dates from 1923 the shank of prohibition during prohibition quite a lot of americans purchased patent medicine if it had ahem properties so if knox all contains alcohol stan's job in this movie is less desperate than the one which he and ollie famously had in 'big business' selling christmas trees in the summer too bad for this movie that it's not nearly so funny as 'big business' br br we see stan but don't hear him in this silent film delivering a spirited sales talk to a man who seems to be paying attention until we learn that they're standing outside a deaf mute institution and this man is deaf a haughty woman emerges from the gates stan quickly tries to engage her attention by wiggling his fingers at her of course she's not deaf and she promptly whacks him with her umbrella i found this sequence offensive not because it involves deaf people the deaf aren't the butt of the joke but because it abets the very widely held misconception among hearing people that they can communicate with the deaf by merely their fingers randomly and performing without actually learning the highly complex grammar of sign language br br more amusingly a spinster in this movie has a pet canary named rudolph as in valentino and there's a gag involving trick photography to enable a man to hide behind an object that's than his body i've seen this device in several cartoons and live action movies but 'kill or cure' is i think the earliest movie to use it that i've seen so far br br stan laurel an under rated actor does one bit of physical business here that's worthy of chaplin or keaton in which he conveys his emotions and a change in his demeanour while walking away from the camera with his back to us still laurel never really became a first rate comedian until he united with oliver hardy to form the greatest comedy team ever 'kill or cure' barely rates 3 out of 10
<START> this movie is the best one forever upon the warm feelings of this real love story during the korean war by the story of hy sun the eurasian doctor and mark elliot an american at the shadow of different habits between east and west upon his quotation in the love scene between two lovers when he invited her to dance the relationship between east and west must be close in spite of chinese habits and customs that destiny made their great role by between them to replace the pains for both elliot suffered from failure marriage and hy sun suffered from the harmful shoot of her husband by chinese communists at the time of mao ze dung in 1949 br br she could not stop the decision of destiny in spite of her practical profile because love has a magnetic spirit for everyone seek for happiness soul and brilliant memory as the final quotation by the voice of elliot after his death and the sadness receive for hy sun for this hard situations when she went to the hill the source of this love under the tree to say goodbye for his body and live with his soul among their souvenirs
<START> i picked out this dvd out of the bin at walmart because the cover showed one of the planes i flew during viet nam c i did not fly for air america but knew being a c 123 pilot i knew a lot who did including those who flew in my reserve unit back home i am not a movie critic but wonder about the subliminal motivation of directors and writers who make movies like this the best part of this movie has to go to the cameraman the flying shots and stunts although totally cartoon like are excellent the movie begins with hollywood's favorite fall guy in 1969 but the fact is nixon did not start air america he did not begin the lies johnson was responsible for air america and nixon inherited the lies the war and air america its not fair or accurate to portray nixon as a liar on the subject of air america all president's have inherited the lies of their predecessors nobody smart enough to fly a c 123 was dumb enough to not know what they were joining that makes the downey character unbelievable a c 123 was a rugged airplane it could easily fly on one engine or the two auxiliary jet engines the three stooges shooting a duck with one shot is more likely pilots who flew with air america were civilian employees of the cia they were not reckless soldiers of fortune they had a good reason to behave and believe in a future if they survived their extremely dangerous job they were given double time towards a retirement pension they weren't required to sell dope or guns to get a good pension dope was legal and a way of life in sea as it still is today in afganistan if individual pilots tried to make money on the side it was not cia policy the cia was fighting a war on communism not drugs the writer based his story on war stories pilots love to bs anybody who will buy them a beer and listen the writer and director who had an ax to grind about viet nam and nixon see the movie and remember how it starts it blames nixon for what existed for years remember he didn't become president until jan 20 1969 br br my favorite scene is the landing up hill in the jungle air america pilots put planes in places the aircraft designers never thought possible their were plenty of funny stories that could have been shown instead the director chose to use the rubber scene to show how dumb the cia was this scene shows that the director and writer fell for some pilot bar talk and the joke is on them br br mds fort valley virginia
<START> i had seen in blackadder and the new statesman so i thought i'd give this film a try br br at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 8 i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasn't at around 8 i threw the dvd into the dustbin and that's where this film belongs br br what ever happened to british humour the humour so fine and witty intelligent and artful that you find in yes minister blackadder vicar of dibley fawlty towers or the fast show the black humour britain is so famous for i don't want to insult anybody but i presume even stupid children wouldn't find this funny they deserve more intelligent fun and you can do better so please do
<START> when you get ahead of a film you know you are wasting your time watching the movie in question that is exactly how i felt while i was watching darkness i could see anticipate every twist and turn easily it is a combination of the amityville horror and a myriad of films that deal with the occult it is so silly that i almost found endearing its naiveness i cannot say i was wholly bored but i found the film way too derivative for my taste director tries to redo his early spanish hit the nameless but he cannot pull it off i admit a few sequences were creepy enough but i just abhor when i can figure out what is going to happen next also i hated to see good actors like lena olin and giancarlo giannini sweat so much over this piece of dreck finally anna paquin as the star of a horror film this must be a joke she is cute but she is one of those good child actors that have become a very monotonous adult actor you can live without watching this one
<START> this was one of the slowest movies i have ever had the displeasure of sitting through after the introduction where we are given the backstory of something killing a couple people in a farm house we are introduced to a white looser family that is moving to a farm and nothing happens for a time then they meet this drifter who helps out on the farm and nothing happens again for a very long time then finally the girl of the family has some stuff happens then some more happens the drifter guy goes nuts and the movie ends in between its all about how this family had to move out becuz the girl got in some trouble back home and they have no money and its done so poorly that i could care less about these pathetic people i cannot believe i actually went to the theatres to see this not only did this movie suck but some a hole answered his cell phone dumb morons were making noise and the movie sucked thats why theaters suck bad movies overpriced crappy food and idiots in the theatre i'm staying home and watching dvds from now on at least i could smoke if i was at home while watching this stupid movie stay home and bake some pie rather than going to a theatre to see this piece of typical crap dumb stupid crap
<START> boasting some pretty good rick baker esque special effects and deran serafian in a small role this pretty lame italian movie deserves some recognition gets some credit for still making gore flicks while most of the other italian directors ruggero deodato sergio martino lamberto bava and enzo g castellari have moved on to lower key tv movies as for plankton it's half piranha half the thing with people into monsters raping women and causing general mayhem the ultra grimy sleazy and over sexed feel of the film makes it hard to enjoy only available in italian language work prints floating around
<START> in the veins of jeepers creepers and the texas chainsaw massacre monster man surprisingly well made though mindless little horror throw in a little buddy comedy nice gore and intense scare it's hard no to say that monster man is really entertaining the low budget seem pretty obvious but it doesn't effected the presentation of the movie in general and put more big budget horror movies in shame br br yes the plot somewhat generic as possible pair of friend adam eric and harley justin urich are driving cross country to interrupt the wedding of a woman adam has always loved while adam is more nerdy type harley is a self proclaimed ladies man and very offensive loudmouth adding a bonus to the plot then they picked up a sexy hitchhiker sarah aimee brooks things turn into nightmare when a monster truck with scary face drive stalking them when dead body starts counting they must do the race against the time before their own life on risk br br the plot is obviously reminiscent of many prior famous horror movies but michael davis as the writer and director succeed in keeping the tension the scare is build well enough where characterization is never be the best but fairly okay the script also littered with comedies that works for the funny moments and they quite enjoyable rather than annoying and also wait for the twist in the finale it's hilarious and shocking in the same time which is pretty amusing br br as conclusion monster man surprisingly entertaining it deserves more attention in the big screen it proves that big budget doesn't make an effective horror movie but skill does something that the director has shown and delivers
<START> i was really beginning to enjoy this show it just started out slow and it wasn't given the chance it deserved it is summertime so many people are not at home watching television i know there are a few talent and singing competitions but i enjoy them as do many other believe it or not when american idol is done for the year i miss it even though this was not american idol i thought it had potential i feel bad for the singers on the show who wee really starting to grow on me i wish they would reconsider and put the show back on i think it was a hasty move to cancel my only complaint about the show is i did not care to much for the judges
<START> according to the article at http blog com article html one of the actors in the film lau was forced to appear in this movie for free she was the victim of an infamous kidnapping shortly before this movie was made and later photos of her in distress were published in a magazine which has since been forced to shut down and its publisher sent to jail the actress denies she was assaulted but there was a movie leaked on net that allegedly showed her being gang raped the hong kong press out of respect for her has mostly refused to report on the incident but google will turn up a few articles about it
<START> if not the best movie ever made babette's feast is certainly among the most loving this is a wonderful exploration of the meaning of artistry generosity loyalty and grace humor is mixed with tender longing characters are treated with searching honesty but also deep respect there are meditations here on memory fate old age and faithfulness marvellous camera work by cinematographer seldom have wrinkled faces looked so luminous in the candle light the meal is accompanied by delicious period music mozart and simple folk hymns enjoy this feast for the eyes and the spirit for as the general says mercy and truth have met together and righteousness and bliss shall kiss one another
<START> sorry folks i love ray work but the one thing he ain't is a leading man maybe if you pretend he's the last man on earth this romantic plot might work but now br br here's a movie that exists simply to showcase the title song which was a big hit for the basie band the year before 1951 and some pretty nifty singing and dancing save it from being a total disaster br br however the story line is pathetic even by 1952 musical comedy standards and the other songs are equally as forgettable as evening in paris cologne the dialogue embarrasses the stars day bolger only claude charms keep his character three dimensional br br so how to enjoy this movie on video br br a fast forward through all the dialogue br br b surrender yourself to doris day's vocals and ray loose limbed footwork and don't miss hilarious take on a rain soaked windswept reprise of april in paris br br c finally keep a couple of bottles of chilled and handy br br bob raymond
<START> a group of environmentalists travel to an island to uncover a secret lab that is experimenting on animals when they arrive they discover that they are to late apparently the government made a scientist test his experiment on a komodo and yes you guessed it a cobra which made them grow very large i'm not sure that this movie really needed or deserved explaining since it is almost identical to curse of the komodo which also sucked the computer effects are as cartoony as ever an the komodo roars like a dinosaur which really got on my nerves like boa vs python this movie is not worth seeing and is about as much fun to watch as it is to nail your hand to a table avoid
