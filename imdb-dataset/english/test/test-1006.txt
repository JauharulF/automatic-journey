<START> i'm a horror movie freak and this has got to be one of the most phenomenal horror flicks i've ever seen the plotline is totally original who else would think up a town who gets totally obsessed with a certain symbol to the point of death and insanity the special effects are amazing and the cinematography couldn't be better some may find it disturbing but that doesn't mean it's a bad movie it also makes a good point the spiral symbol is kinda ubiquitous the spiral notebook spiral spirals on cakes of all the shapes they could have used square triangle rectangle this was one of the best choices if you can find this movie definitely see it it's certainly unique and quite unforgettable
<START> i saw this movie last night on hbo didn't expect to get hooked i usually fall asleep when i watch hbo but it happened you will too it's a tragic documentary 2002 oscar winner about a murder of an elderly female tourist in florida and subsequent investigation arrest trial of a 15 year old boy br br watch this movie today get a feel for how we have progressed as a society this film was most deserving of an esteemed oscar you'll be moved to tears
<START> okay this may not be the most sophisticated movie you'll ever see actually there isn't a bit of in it it's puerile adolescent inoffensive idiotic and utterly hilarious basically richie and eddie run the worst hotel in britain cue some ridiculous antics with the guests while they beat each other up try to get the rent money out of the only resident who is daft enough to stay have an all night drinking binge with the boys from the power plant next door and fall in lust with the beautiful actress who comes to stay to avoid the press give it a try if you're a fan of and and their work if you're not don't get the movie simple as that br br i'm not being thick this is a word from another one of fab into the movie world
<START> somewhere in the dark recesses of my brain cells a song plays in my head i can't forget it no matter how hard i try it's midnight madness and it's gonna get to you wish i could find a copy of this on a record five disparate teams head out one night in l a for a scavenger hunt for clues instead of physical objects an unkempt game master with two gorgeous assistants is the mastermind of all this insanity that's about to be unleashed on l a all the teams are stereotypes this movie being from 1980 before political correctness screwed everything up the good guys the nerds led by eddie the dumb beer loving jocks the we don't need a man type ladies especially the redhead the giggling twins are a scream too and finally the bad guys with stephen furst as the leader furst is hilarious as the overweight slob harold whose attempt to use a computer to decipher the various clues leads to a gooey mess movies like this aren't made anymore these days movies have to have an edginess to them with some dark characters and other nonsense go back to the days when the good guys led by david naughton were still good and not hopelessly conflicted so dump all serious pretensions and go back to 1980 it's midnight madness
<START> i watched this movie with big expectations the blurb on the back indicated that this was going to be a nasty one but it was pretty tame and a little unsatisfying the violence was nothing i haven't seen a thousand times before the gore level was only average mind you there was probably more than what has been seen in hollywood in the last 5 years perhaps more and at no stage was i even feeling uneasy let along frightened again a cat 3 movie with big wraps has not lived up to its hype br br sure hire this movie but don't go in with any expectations i am so keen to get into the whole asian horror scene but am continuously disappointed i did love ichi and audition but then again miike stands alone at the moment br br please inspire me there is a large cluster of jaded genre fans who are starved of quality horror
<START> i can imagine why he'd want to die after starring in this rubbish the man is incredible but even sidney poitier couldn't save this tiresome morality play about racism in the old west he and joanna going are both fantastic in this film too bad the screenplay co stars directing and score couldn't match those two
<START> what can i say about a movie as bad as this the people who made this movie didn't even try to make the monster in it look realistic you never see more than its head and the head is just a giant puppet that has little movement except for when it opens it mouth to roar and the sound they used for the roaring is the best part at many points in the movie it sounds exactly like a tie fighter flying over i couldn't believe that when i first heard it and had to rewind several times to make it sink in other than the terrible looking monster and the noises it makes there isn't much more to this film except for a few corny attack scenes and the crazy scotsman attacking the kids trying to have an intimate moment in his castle still it's watchable if you like this sort of trash i know i do
<START> this movie was terrible the acting was lame but it's hard to tell if someone was acting well since the writing was so bad this is one of johnny depp's worst movies i highly discourage anyone from watching it br br if you must see cry baby though i recommend muting it and simply ogling at mr depp for and hour and a half
<START> the bbc and hbo teamed up to create dirty war a 90 minute tv movie about a terrorist dirty bomb attack in london the film gets down to business quickly as it packs both the terrorist and the government anti terrorist efforts into the film leaving little room for human interest subplots on the terrorist side we follow the bomb from the smuggling of radioactive materials to assembly to deployment to detonation on the government side we see pr and training exercises intelligence gathering and analysis interdiction post detonation response and follow up the film also imparts a sense of how al type terrorist cells are organized the radical islamic terrorist mentality and terrorist strategies a sort of anatomy of a dirty bomb incident dirty war will answer many questions lurking in the minds of a public becoming ever more aware of this insidious threat b
<START> what if someone made a horror movie that was completely devoid of plot br br well i think it would probably end up a little bit like this one i don't think i've ever seen a move was so steady it its slide from hackneyed at the beginning to complete crap by the end i only stuck with it because i kept thinking it couldn't possibly get worse well up until the very end graveyard of horror proved me wrong br br who would have suspected that a movie with an undead lizard man evil grave robbing cultists and mad scientists tossed in for no discernible reason could suck this bad one would think there'd at least be some humor value but not here
<START> director screenwriter allan burns seems to have patched two different scripts together before coming up with this minor outing a comedy about infidelity and a melodrama about loss and sabotage it results in a unfunny film christine plays a crass cynical tv news reporter who makes friends with aerobics instructor mary tyler moore and is soon having dinner with moore and her family only to discover mary's husband ted danson is lahti's secret affair burns has a strange stop and start rhythm to his dialogue which is neither realistic nor effective just increasingly annoying because nothing important ever seems to get said rail thin moore looking alarmingly frail in her leotard has a radiant smile but doesn't convince as wife and danson gets stuck with a paltry thankless role he's just there to be a cad the movie attempts to cover all the bases in a classic case of overreaching woman's role in the workplace the tv news biz the cheating family man the working wife and mother who wants more a woman's need for female friendships et al but nothing substantial comes out of these ideas since burns only half heartedly examines the issues as a writer he is surprisingly free of punchlines but is devoid of a purpose as well and the heavy plotting just gets all fouled up 1 2 from
<START> mild spoilers but you probably know the plot br br woman gets raped and decides to take out her rage on all of mankind oh did i mention the rape victim was mute that s the problem with ms 45 the rape victim decides she s going to kill men but is there any logical explanation to any of this surely the whole film would have better if we had give a voice over as to why she s bumping off any man she comes across there s just not enough development to this plot br br as you d expect from a film by ferrara it s not a complete waste of time it s far better than i spit on your grave and pseudo intellectuals will have a field day pointing out the irony of the woman holding a knife like a penis as goes on a killing spree at the end but the script is somewhat silly and underdeveloped and hinders any serious comment the film could have made
<START> i've seen director's cut version and can be nothing but content excellent acting esp cole hauser i was sad about little space for claudia black though subtle visual effects and photography in overall believable plot considering the genre without a lot of logical holes really non predictable twists build up characters these are the greatest assets of the movie combined with style some may consider this movie a b grade effort but i would disagree with that the whole thing really is very original and stylish br br and even though i'm not a fan of vin diesel this tough guy role of riddick suited him well can't wait for chronicles of riddick it's really cool this flick's gonna have a sequel br br 9 10 if you ask me
<START> i saw this film in wales in july it deals with the courage of czech pilots who flew numerous missions for the raf after their country had been occupied by the nazis in this film the action takes place both in the early 1950's when these pilots are being beaten in political prisons in and during world war ii in britain they were imprisoned after their return to their homeland because the communist regime viewed these warriors as a threat to their occupation of the pilots maintain their dignity in prison and during numerous air battles against nazi pilots this film contain a love sub plot that does make sense because it helps us to understand that both civilians and soldiers made great sacrifices to preserve democracy the end of this film indicates that the heroism of these czech pilots was finally recognized in the early 1990's after the restoration of democracy in the country then known as this powerful and moving film was made with financial support from the czech government i highly recommend this film
<START> how this film could be classified as drama i have no idea if i were john voight and mary steenburgen i would be trying to erase this from my cv it was as historically accurate as xena and hercules abraham and moses got melded into noah lot abraham's nephew lot turns up thousands of years before he would have been born wandered the earth really what were the scriptwriters thinking was it just ignorance i remember something about noah and animals and lot and and all that stuff from sunday school or were they trying to offend the maximum number of people on the planet as possible from christians jews and muslims to historians archaeologists geologists psychologists as a matter of fact did anyone not get offended anyone who had even a modicum of taste would have winced at this one
