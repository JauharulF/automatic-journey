<START> i think it was franÃ§ois truffaut who said that the best movies either involve the joy of making movies or the agony of making movies this flick is definitely of the first type tromeo and juliet is a pleasure to watch from start to finish the zany zeal fuelling this shakespearian is infective i don't think i've laughed so hard since i saw monty python and the holy grail it's that good
<START> saw this at the hong kong international film festival over three years ago i went in with no expectations since christopher nolan was a no name at the time but it sounded interesting and turned out to be one of the best things i saw at that festival it worked well on the big screen with the technique of cutting the scenes out of sequence adding to the mood mr nolan gave a good account of its making at the end enough to put anybody off starting out as a film maker i liked it better than memento although this was perhaps due to the lower expectations and the fact that it was more of an art house movie
<START> for me this is a good series i am kind of disappointed that ana lucia and libby died but more upset that micheal lied to everyone about who killed them and if any one can answer this what was that guys name who was supposedly henry gale he was like the leader of the others or was that ms clue anyway if you know his name cool well trying to think of what can possibly happen next after they finally didn't press the button does that mess up the whole darma project thing and i personally thought it was cool how they had that key thing underground that desmond used to shut off the magnet thing yeah and what was the whole point of that i am just glad they didn't press the button finally but what happens to the people in the hatch like mr echo john charlie and well desmond probably died but what about the others i think they survived i forget well this is just my little thing on what i thought about this season finale
<START> a young woman leaves her provincial life for a new one in the city and there she meets another woman with whom she falls in love with their relationship turns physical quickly and they both believe that they are soul mates until one day the provincial girl comes home to find a man in their bed her lover then reveals to her that their relationship was just an experiment and she really likes men um kinda like the anne heche and ellen degeneres thing so anyway the provincial girl broken torn and shattered by this discovery moves out and begins to discover what the real world is all about as she falls into the hands of all sort of vindictive and salacious people in 19th century england
<START> a beautiful sensitive film that brings home the futility and cruelty of wars no matter what the so called reasons the performance of cage and cruz were quite impressive but it is to the older greek characters that go the highest praises irene papas is as gorgeous as ever though some scenes seems a little long at times this film will be a heavy oscar contender
<START> i watched this movie thinking it was going to be absolutely horrible and was ready for all the corniness bad special effects etc but i was pleasantly surprised not to say that it's the best vampire movie i have ever seen but it certainly isn't the worst i liked the whole alternate reality dream state that played into the movie the graphics were quite well for a straight to dvd movie and i liked the overall look of the film i enjoyed the main character sai i usually end up hating the female leads but there was something about her that kept me interested yes she does make some bad decisions but that was to be expected yes the other characters were stereotypical but i was expecting that too i don't know if i'd highly recommend this movie but give it a chance and you might be pleasantly surprised i'm putting this one on my guilty pleasures list
<START> i'm trying to find something of value here the best i can muster is that truffaut wanted to make a movie as tedious painful puerile annoying illogical and brainless as the experience of being in love if that was his goal then he succeeded but the solution to his exercise is really a drag to watch br br there is one scene that screams for a spoof belmondo compares the features of deneuve's face to the features in a landscape all i could think the whole time was glacier ice two lonely fishermen wearing army surplus on a frozen lake in minnesota br br the only other point of interest was the resurrection of theory of climatic determinism the tropics are presented as paradise and things get progressively worse as they get colder hell being calvinist french switzerland that was kind of funny
<START> if you are looking for a phony hollywood action movie this won't be one for you if the truth is what you seek rent or buy this from a true story the movie attempts to capture the heart of what was is happening in south africa and many other places br br for historical knowledge this rates up there with stories such as the pianist schindler's list or nuremberg millions of people today have no clue what apartheid is or that it even exists this movie may help them learn and may even help them dig deeper
<START> for a movie that gained so much recognition and appraise this spinoff to baby is one big mistake it starts off that andrew adrian whatever his name is because he's so confused that he doesn't know who he is anymore runs away from a cult with his mother and soon is kidnapped by a strange lady that ends up taking care of him as if she were his mother the acting is terrible as andrew grows up in his twenties and looks terrible with his sunken in face never ending grin and dukes of hazard clothes on looks more like a drunken has been than the son of satan in fact thats all he does is drink and falls sloppily all over himself as he tries to come to grips with his past and the last memory of his mother driving away on a bus screaming to him he finds a friend that seems to be an angel but he's quickly killed off and electricuted in a hillarious scene in which he looks more like a christmas tree andrew gets and the cult with the members of the first part test him to see if he's really the son of satan his dumb self fails the test and gets up off the alter glittering with makeup and jumps of the stage of a night club and dances like a clown on crack this scene is memorable and well worth a watch the ending is terrible and somewhat predictable considering how stupid he is in the whole movie do not watch this piece of trash or you will loose respect for the first part
<START> this excellent movie starring elizabeth montgomery is long overdue for release in dvd form the same can be said for her earlier also excellent movie a case of rape i can only hope that my comments spur some enterprising soul into placing both elizabeth montgomery movies on one dvd to be made available to her many fans i for one believe this excellent actress's role was unfortunately stereotyped by her role on bewitched and as a result more serious acting roles were not made available to her i am confident that if these two movies perhaps even a trilogy with the legend of lizzie borden were released in dvd form her fans would set the record straight on how highly they regard her serious acting abilities
<START> my age 13 br br james cole played by steven seagal is sent to help detective jim campbell played by ivory wayans solve a series of killings in which the victims are crucified since cole has arrived on the spot he notices that the killings have changed a little and thinks there is a different killer it becomes personal when his ex wife is murdered and campbell finds his fingerprints on the body campbell investigates the mysterious cole and finds out about a very shady past br br i am not a fan of steven seagal i enjoy action movies but he is the worst actor i have ever seen this film is not much fun to watch at all incredibly dumb and obviously steven seagal's acting performance is absolutely horrid ivory wayans isn't too bad though the only redeeming thing in this film is the occasional good action scene although most come round because of insanely stupid reasons the plot in this film is absolute gibberish i didn't care for it at all the whole glimmer man past of seagal's character was stupid all the mafia fights and fights in the restaurant were there for almost no reason give this film a miss br br australian classification ma 15 high level violence br br rating 35 out of 100 quite generous
<START> after watching this film i decided that it was so awful that i must join imdb and write a review to warn other people of the pit falls of renting buying this film to be fair to the film there is only one good section to this film and that is the end credits cause then you know that this crap is well and truly over i watched it to the end in the hope that i may get a little bit of pleasure out of the film just tunnels more tunnels and an old man talking to himself if you watch this film too many time so will you as for val if he keeps selecting films like this he may as well kiss goodbye to his acting career there is no point in even writing about what is in the film as that has already been done keep your money and sanity and keep well clear
<START> first the recent campaigning of this movie is a huge hoax judging from the cover you'd think this was some kind of scandal movie about kylie playing a character having sex taking drugs and whatever this is just a cheap market scheme she's barely in it and does neither of the things the marketing here is unbelievable and i'm surprised the filmmakers hasn't objected br br the movie itself was to me a huge disappointment it seemed like a sunset beach episode directed sloppy handed by a teenage quentin tarantino and thats not meant as a compliment mind you br br i think the weakness of the movie first of all is the story it seems to be about nothing just about cool teenagers tripping around living 'on the edge' the characters themselves does have some personality though but the movie doesn't use its potential as said there's no story of any substance here it seems to elaborate too much on cool dialog and ends up looking like a colorful mtv ad it definitely has that feeling br br still though i guess some people might enjoy it but i'd say there's far better movies like this around
<START> my god ryan gosling has made a lot of deep characters in his career this is one of his wonderful acting jobs for me this is a very deep movie needs a lot of concentration not because is difficult to watch just because you understand it if you put your shoes in this kid even though has everything and has famous father that is a writer has a deeper mind you don't understand why he kills this poor kid until you really heard what he has to say and you start to think at least to me that a lot of things that he says is true simple kid sweet very gentle in a way normal like any teenage but inside of him suffer because he start to look at the world in a different way then you understand why he did what he did i recommend this movie for those who likes deep drama
<START> this is not exactly what i would call a mad max film after seeing road warrior and experiencing the excellence of that film i felt somewhat disappointed after seeing this it supposedly started out as some kind of kids in the wilderness film and was merged with the mad max franchise bad idea the casting was not exactly the best i mean come on tina turner one of the main problems with this film is that there are no good villains no wez no not even a decent nothing really even happens if you are going to plan on seeing this sub par action flick can it even be called that make sure you see mad max 2 or mad max or better yet both another problem with this film is that there are too many people even the thunderdome battle sequence is dull max doesn't even kill anyone the music is bad the characters are bad not in the good way and after seeing this film it left a very bad taste in my mouth
