<START> this documentary about the life and comedy of bill hicks features bits from revelations and other stand up gigs it also features interviews with fellow comedians and people in the industry who knew him as well as reporters and journalists who talk about how his political commentary was raw and brutal br br i enjoyed it very much i had already seen revelations but the comedy clips were still refreshing it's a nice balance of comedy and documentary that will explain popularity to non fans and please those who are already familiar with him br br i rated it a ten
<START> let me break down this film for you br br the first fifteen minutes are a showcase for terrible special effects i'm not one to nitpick about special effects but what you've got to understand is that if you can't afford good special effects you shouldn't anchor your film around special effects starships fire blobs of color at each other flaring into stock explosions and careening past moons with polygon counts low enough to count with your fingers you will have no idea what is happening it will not make sense br br the second act involves a woman walking in the desert at this point you will be treated to drab scenery and illogical boring fight scenes nobody speaks nothing interesting happens the protagonist's goals are unclear and are not very compelling this goes on for about 45 minutes br br then in a five minute montage she sneaks into an enemy base straps herself to a rocket tries to destroy a doomsday weapon fails and dies br br none of this has any bearing on the eventual direction of the film br br in the last twenty minutes basically the chick's memories get transferred to her daughter who goes into stasis for a very large number of years learning the secrets of mankind after this we see the first and last five minute segment of human interaction in the film then the new heroine is forced to choose whether she wants to become part of the material that causes the big bang or not you know because when the universe is collapsing you get to decide if you want to be a part of it br br she chooses yes but the memories of mankind survive in a capsule maybe we won't make the same mistakes again huh if you like movies with characters then this is not a good movie for you the lead roles could have been fulfilled nicely by any old wind up toy capable of staying right side up while walking through sand all of the story is told through painfully dull narration br br the film tries to seem deep by throwing together a whole bunch of undeveloped science fiction ideas there are enough concepts here to fuel a number of films but as it stands it's bloated with completely irrelevant details two thirds of this film could have been reduced to a 45 second montage instead the narrator fills in a worth of backstory without ever giving us a reason to care what happens to the characters br br there are good ideas in here but nobody watches films to see ideas ineptly explained people watched films to be entertained this film does not entertain
<START> the reviews for rendition generally haven't been favorable so i waited until it moved to the local discount theatre to see it the film tells the story of anwar el an american egyptian scientist who is plucked from his international flight and hauled in for interrogation after a strange coincidence links him to a recent terrorist attack in an unnamed north african country not as bad as i'd feared it's an interesting and thought provoking entry in the ripped from the headlines thriller genre br br the film ultimately asks tough questions concerning u s methods of prying information from political prisoners is crossing the formerly line of openly employing torture on suspected terrorists something our country should be doing does it yield useful information that helps save lives if so at what cost what sort of monsters do we create when innocent people are taken prisoner and tortured by sanctioning the use of torture what sort of monster do we as a country become it's always disappointing when a film with such provocative material is sloppy with some of the details that make good films great for example i'd like to have empathized with wife who spends the entire film trying to track him down but the only identifiable personality trait she's given is an advanced state of pregnancy rendition also seems to imply that arab women who don't go along with their fathers' arranged marriages are only asking for trouble and there's a poorly conceived scrapbook kept by another of the film's main characters that too conveniently spells out in great detail all the information his love interest just happens to be in urgent need of at that particular moment i laughed out loud when the moment should have been filled with dread br br the film features a good central performance by jake gyllenhaal and strong but too brief appearances by hollywood veterans meryl streep and alan arkin as well as impressive turns by omar as anwar el and also by actors and all of whom i would much enjoy seeing in future films that have nothing whatsoever to do with terrorism good luck to them the five or so stories rendition follows are woven together nicely until the filmmakers insert a slight but effective twist that finally alludes to the never ending cycle of carnage that violent attacks of terror
<START> this film is so unbelievably awful everything about it was rubbish you cant say anything good about this film the acting script directing effects are all just as bad as each other even ed wood could have done a better job than this i seriously recommended staying away from this movie unless you want to waste about of your life or however long the film was i forget this is the first time i wrote a comment about a film on imdb but this film was just on tv and i had to let the world of movie lovers know that this film sucked balls so if you have any decency left in you go and rent a much better bad movie like critters 3
<START> public enemies is a kind of throw back to those early 1960's gangster biographies like portrait of a mobster mad dog and king of the roaring twenties although made on the cheap the film has a great deal of energy and the acting over all particularly by eric roberts and frank stallone is quite good theresa russell might seem too glamorous as ma but she has some very good moments there are two action scenes worth noting a shoot out in a hotel and a machine gun fight in the middle of the street between the barkers and the fbi both sequences are nicely done and compared to other low gangster junk like dillinger and capone this film shines
<START> you would think that a film that starred three of the biggest male film stars of the post world war ii era would have become a classic these three who also happen to be three favorites of mine walk around in a daze looking like they'd rather be any place but there br br the sad thing is that the way west definitely had some potential to be a classic in these days of political correctness a film about american pioneers and the travails of their migration is something not done now it should have been better done back then br br kirk douglas is a former united states senator who's heading a wagon train west to build a settlement in valley being he's an ex politician he rates above the hoi he's leading the script calls for him to have not only a covered wagon but a carriage to lead the train br br you think that's ludicrous you ought to see the whipping scene where douglas orders his black servant played by roy glenn to whip him i won't spoil it by saying what causes douglas to demand this of glenn but trust me it's bad br br robert mitchum is the trail guide and of the three stars he looks the most bored there was supposed to be considerable friction on the set between widmark and douglas but mitchum just through the film above it all br br maybe the friction helped somewhat because the movie calls for douglas a widower to have an eye on mrs widmark played by lola albright now she's the best looking thing in the movie br br the film billing says introducing sally field this was made in between her gidget and her flying nun days she plays a piece of white southern trash with the musical comedy name of mercy we first see her in the movie sitting on the back of her parents wagon legs akimbo and inviting of course she gets taken up on her invitation br br her character is something like what's found in every trailer park in america and then again what was a wagon train but one large trailer park on the move br br despite this film sally field went on to a two oscar career what that woman had to overcome br br victor mclaglen's son andrew directed this item and together with a lousy script turned this into a turgid mess shame on andrew mclaglen he's certainly done better in his career br br and so will you unless you're a stargazer
<START> this movie is based mainly on the emotions and interactions of people there are only three locations the school the store and the coach's house that are really used it's primarily at the coach's house however a movie doesn't need special effects or amazing views to be amazing in itself br br four friends who had bonded during their basketball days meet up one is rich important and has no real love outside of money one wants to be mayor again but his competition is turning him sour one wants to be superintendent of the school and take care of his family one is a traveling alcoholic br br first off i love the actors in this film they've all been household names to me they proved their worth here br br one of the most pivotal moments is when tom played by gary sinise blows up on the coach he yells and rants about how the coach cheated in the winning game his blows the coach's whistle and yells back his catchphrases forgive me father for i have sinned it's amazing to watch with energy that just chills you br br highly recommended to anyone who understands human emotion and doesn't need shiny effects to interest them
<START> i have seen this movie three times going back to vcr's in the 1980's and again on the channel last night feb 11 2010 based on a true story which i remember being in the news during the early 1980's i've decided that i find it too disturbing to watch ever again yet it's hard to look away from a car accident the creepiest character is joshua john miller who plays reeves little brother br br the story this movie was based on can be found anywhere on the internet just google it it's about anthony jacques who murdered marcy conrad in california in 1981 the characters portray generation x pre grunge borderline sociopaths with the exception of reeves who grows a conscience br br old hippies did a great job raising that generation br br for such a young kid i thought joshua miller was excellent as the serial killer in the making character in actuality he went to yale and has written screenplays as well as directed his acting capabilities in this film were amazing just the way he treats his little sister by drowning her doll and tearing up her dolls grave gave me the shivers it gave me nightmares even with whats happening in our world today in 2010 it still is the most degenerate film i've seen to date br br the apathy and dysfunction of these families is enough to make one puke this thrill kill almost makes the manson murders pale in comparison br br glover got a little too much into character he wound up on david to discuss his role and almost kicked the host in the head glover had to seek psychiatric help after portraying his character br br also fight the good fight to the great dennis hopper you're one of the best
<START> it has carla yay and a crappy ending boo br br jaded is a highly erotic story about a beautiful woman who arrives in a town trying to escape her past whiles there she meets up with two lesbians and after a couple of drinks the two decide to have some fun but one of the girls takes things a bit too far and rapes her whiles the second girl holds her down she is discovered on the beach where the incident happens the next day and is taken to a hospital after that we spend the rest of the movie watching her attempting to bring down the two girls and at the same time learn some new info about who she is and where she comes from and a bit about her past br br director and co writer does an excellent job with this movie considering its uber low budget it hand held and sometimes looks like 16mm but it fits the movie since the story demands a harsh look to it the actors all do okay jobs with what is given to them and there's not really anything to complain about it the standout feature in the movie is of course carla who bares it all in this movie she is actually more nude in this movie than she is in sin city christopher mcdonald is also in the movie but his character is really kinda pointless but he is fun to watch i didn't really pay much attention to the music since it doesn't really draw attention to itself but it gets the job done with what it's got the movie is r rated and it's that for a very good reason it's very sexual and very graphic at times it's essentially borders on soft core at times but the sex scenes are necessary for the movie so it doesn't feel like it's just there for the sake of being there although there is one pointless scene where we see chris mcdonald getting it on that scene was a tad pointless but it's not really much of a problem i guess the only fault with the movie is that we don't get to see the court trial after all that we go through in the movie it's like having sex and not having an orgasm or something br br it's a shame that the talented has never made a feature film since this this is a highly gifted woman can do great things with a very little budget i really hope that she gets back in the game soon because she is an amazing director jaded is not a masterpiece of erotic cinema instead what we have is an enjoyable movie that shows a great director in the making br br hide the kids and close the curtains you don't want people to think you're watching porn whiles watching this movie
<START> by the numbers oscar hungry biopic about the late great singer ray charles there is one exactly one great scene in ray it occurs during a flashback to charles' youth after the boy become completely blind running into the sharecropper house which he shares with his mother he trips over a chair and sprawls on the floor he cries out for his mother she in keeping with her philosophy that a person should stand on their own two feet observes silently and pensively from the kitchen waiting to see if the boy can fall back on his own resources the boy proves to be up to the challenge using his ears and memory to locate a kettle on a stove a nearby fire pit the grass blowing in the wind outside of a window the scuttling of a cricket across the plank board floor br br the movie pauses here it expands it breathes even if for only 40 seconds the scene is a much needed respite from taylor otherwise noisy film by noisy i'm not referring to the music which is of course excellent i am referring to the sound effects big booms preceding yet another flashback and the inane dialog i'm speaking to you as a friend ray etc on the visual side is equally and pointlessly flashy sepia colored filters over the camera lenses during the flashbacks whirling dervish from the camera crane etc etc all the modern amenities what a horrible cinematic style is displayed in ray a style all too common in wanna be important movies from the past decade or so scorsese's aviator is stylistically very similar to this movie these gimmicks are employed to the clichÃ© ridden screenplay some of us won't be fooled br br some of us also are not quite prepared to accept jamie foxx's performance as anything more than superb mimicry granted foxx eerily resembles ray charles he walks like charles talks like charles and even twitches like charles foxx's imitation of the singer during live performance is technically perfect i'm not begrudging mr foxx his oscar he deserved it it was a pretty weak field this year anyway but one wonders if foxx really understands charles the actor does achieve one great moment when he insists on trying out the smack that his band mates are shooting up he registers if only for a brief moment a disgust at the unfairness of being blind and a life of darkness the movie seems to want to dramatize the struggle within charles between the bright salvation of music and the oblivion of heroin with his blindness as the battleground between those two but the damn movie just won't take the time it bounces along from triumph to triumph never really pausing for any insight into the man one has to stretch to find the dramatic tension one must supply the drama for the movie one must in other words imagine a better movie than this one br br in its rush toward a glorious conclusion ray introduces then dodges several excellent ideas for a movie his early days on the circuit his bold musical innovations for the atlantic label the problem of his addiction to heroin the inevitable artistic compromises attendant upon overwhelming success the man's importance to the civil rights struggle touched on in the movie for oh about 3 minutes of screen time and much more the filmmakers are too lazy to focus on any one of these elements two and a half hours of watching a man overcome one adversity after another may make us feel good but such a movie is not necessarily a grand work of art this sort of approach certainly provides no deeper insight into the film's subject and shouldn't insight be the real goal of a movie like this if i had wanted a laundry list of ray charles' accomplishments i'd have simply googled him br br 3 stars out of 10 the extra 2 stars strictly for the music
<START> this movie has some of the best dialogue ever written the really good lines are all given to george c scott a man who knew what to do with a juicy piece of dialogue i just saw this movie again for the first time in 20 years and the dialogue is as good as ever the bizarre goings on at the hospital are so imaginative as to dazzle you they frequently involve such marvelous poetic justice as to be near strokes of genius i love this movie
<START> if i compare two films with sacha cohen borat and ali g then ali g is immeasurably better i'ts no master piece but it's a film at least borat is complete garbage and i do not understand how it rated better then ali g br br i cannot put my finger on it there something wrong with the ali g script half of the jokes are as if written by a 15 years old not by an adult scriptwriter and a number of jokes including mr cohen's lower body are quite tasteless br br but the film actually comes together as a comedy and there are some valid jokes too that are funny such as how ali g becomes a member of government for doing something scandalous and stupid in the public sadly true in today's western society people get careers for doing stupid things in public also advice about immigrant policy and some others br br ali g overall remains a sympathetic character even though a kind of mentally underdeveloped for his age but it's ok to watch it's quite funny br br but never ever watch borat it's awful and makes every intelligent sick
<START> following the world war ii japanese attack on u s forces at pearl harbor the kids leo gorcey as bobby jordan as danny connors huntz hall as david gorcey as ernest morrison as and bobby stone as skinny want to serve their country but both the u s army and navy reject them as too young still wanting to knock off about a million japs the boys attack an asian clerk who turns out to be chinese the unfortunate incident does however lead the gang to help uncover some really nasty japanese and german people br br if too young is defined as under twenty one only mr jordan and mr stone would be rejected for military service but it's possible recruiters were turned off by the office manners displayed by mr gorcey and mr hall let's get tough was made during what the script accurately describes as open season on japs for this and other reasons it hasn't aged well it's a wasted effort but the regulars performs ably with tom brown moving the storyline along as jordan's spy brother br br let's get tough 5 29 42 wallace fox leo gorcey bobby jordan tom brown
<START> jack webb's portrayal of the marine drill instructor shaping new recruits in basic training requires no interpretation straight forward direct up front are all applicable to this classic in a time when parsing the statements of our leaders is a necessity in order to understand what they are saying this movie that plays no games with our language or our moral fiber right and wrong are clear and easily defined if you like clear well understood dialog in a disciplined military setting this movie should suit you
<START> film noire is a genre that requires a certain level of tact cleverness intellect and imagery this movie has none of that though they really tried hard with the imagery br br it's the kind of movie that your cousin marky the dump truck driver who's always talking about how he's going to make it big in the movies someday would make br br the dialogue is wooden and lifeless the visuals while obviously expensive to make are the work of a director who has tried to be clever and failed miserably due to a severe lack in cerebral ability the acting ranged from sub par to just plain bad the story might have been salvaged by a real writer and director but i suspect that such people would not have touched it with a barge pole br br about 1 4 of the way through i noticed striking similarities with the scene in where viktor desperate to be rid of his actress makes the world's worst movie i figured i'd check imdb to see if a similar effect has occurred in this movie and to my surprise it has i'd almost be tempted to give a 2 out of 10 just because it's exposed the pretentious groupies but i won't it's that bad
