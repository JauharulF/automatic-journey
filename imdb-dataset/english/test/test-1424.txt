<START> first watched this film years ago with my daughter who is now 13 and fell in love with the vampire we both thought it was a top film then watched sub 11 then sub 111 now i find there is sub which i cannot wait to get my fangs on and also there is a fifth in the pipe line if no one has seen the movies these are the best of the best i think it a thousands oscar's i could watch these from morning to night i would love to have a set of nails like he has watch out girls i love it as all the story lines continues from film to film these ant typical vampire movies they are better i would love to live in the life that is in the films it would make all my dreams come true
<START> this film is totally unbelievable the only way a girl would perform this act on a dog is if she had serious mental health issues or had a long history of sexual abuse or was under duress yet we are asked to believe that an otherwise 'normal' healthy female just got a bit bored and 'made a little mistake' and oops had a sexual encounter with a dog what's more it never had any detrimental affect on her ever again except when she tells someone br br not she was raped by a dog or the dog did something she couldn't resist she actively initiated oral sex and completed this activity with a pet dog of her own choice she wasn't on drugs or anything she just like it' br br the rest of the film seeks to put this action in a light of 'hey it could happen to anyone she's only being honest' br br but really for this to be believed we have to believe that this is a woman who is capable of doing absolutely anything if she 'just feels like it' think about it could she have considered the rights and wrongs of this action before carrying it out if she had she would have stopped in her tracks human beings have instinctive boundaries for reasons if we are now to start considering bestiality as a 'cute' little aberration what is next child abuse yet the 'heroine' is portrayed as a hard done by nice girl who had one moment of aberration if she had been forced to carry out this act by an abuser the story might have made more sense and i would have been able to accept the storyline but there is no way that anyone carries out the prolonged activity required and referred to even once if there is not some deep disturbance that requires a great deal of psychiatric help this is no way a one off happening in an otherwise perfect life br br i know this is just a film but it is through behaviour such as this via the media that society becomes and more and more awful realities become possible br br i could imagine an abuser showing this to a child to persuade them that it isn't such a big deal and then moving on with their agenda it could also be used by an abuser to underline to a child not to tell about the abuse because look how people will react to you if you do br br this is not about truth the director wants people to think it's about truth this is about degradation and how easily people the viewing public can be manipulated into accepting the most appalling concepts if wrapped up in the right way the watching public are being manipulated degraded and laughed at br br this is a film in which the actors and the viewers are being humiliated and made fools of in a very sophisticated way by a clever but extremely disturbed film writer br br this film appears to me to be being used as a vehicle for the creator of the film to get off on the excitement of playing with your mind in an abusive manner i don't know whether it is conscious on their part but it is the most classic example of mind f k that i have ever encountered br br i hope that this doesn't offend anyone too much but if you watched this film i don't think there is any room left to be offended by anything any more
<START> i caught this film under the title of what lies above on lifetime movie network last night and just had to comment on it designed as a resourceful woman in peril action adventure yarn it is so unintentionally funny thanks in large part to marc singer's scenery chewing hammy performance that i thought i was watching a cross between cliffhanger and home alone 5 heroine nicole eggert makes her devious but dumb as dirt male pursuers look like the three stooges succumbing to her ridiculous makeshift booby traps somehow she manages to devise a swinging battering ram with rope and a log in a matter of minutes which temporarily takes out one of the knuckleheads who want to kill her worth watching for a hearty laugh
<START> this is most likely the best picture not many will see it presented a culture in a real way a must see for all who like indie and for those who don't i think this movie will draw more into the indie scene the acting was top notch the character of alice was so well with perfect this movie be brought to the mainstream i think it would do alice is the most real look at an element of our culture that i have seen since go ask alice a look that is untouched by the hollywood hand movies like this show young people that these things aren't glamorous but that they are real and compelling if you liked pieces of april you will love this one
<START> ok i am really into king's stuff but this is just dreadful the whole movie i am waiting for the main character to do something profound with his new youth and power i can tolerate the worst of movies as anything is better than watching a cut movie with commercials in it but this takes the cake i gave it a 2 and i would never recommend it to anyone
<START> god cuts himself with a straight razor afterwards he gives birth to mother earth which then gives birth through gods semen son of earth br br this is a one and a half an hour movie that sort of depicts a dark version of how god created the world its surreal dark and poetic the most important aspect of the film to me is the visuals its shot in a very grainy black and white film using both slow motion and normal shooting sometimes even fast film and stop motion the scenes are long and dragged out that sets a very weird mood no sounds were recorded when filming i think sound effects were added afterwards such as water and other ambient sounds repeated over and over as you might understand this movie is certainly not for the impatient person br br i often felt it was similar to david lynch's eraserhead only this one is even harder to understand and even more dragged out but that's okay for me i like that kind of stuff its certainly not entertainment at least not the hollywood kind so if your going to check it out i recommend you set yourself up for it be open minded and except something like the end of 2001 a space odyssey
<START> found this film for one dollar 1 00 and the film was a complete waste of time reb brown mark hardin played a military adviser in south america and was successful in capturing the leader of rebel soldiers operating out of the dense jungles however mark joins the opposite side after some horrible tortures were inflicted or women and men in one scene as mark is having a drink in a hotel bar his eyes catch the glimpse of sexy long legs sandra spencer shannon tweed dead sexy 01 mark and sandra have the extreme hots for each other and even make passionate love on some very hard rocks with no time for the comforts of a bed this is a horrible film and not worth wasting the time to even look at it
<START> this was a mish mash of a film that started out going nowhere got lost on the way then suddenly found a plot in the last 5 minutes when the title character is finally introduced there were so many ugly mutton chopped guys in this film i lost track of who was the owner and who were the i have a theory about the casting though all the bad guys were played by ugly actors and one ugly actress and all the good guys victims were played by beautiful actors indeed the actors who played the ultimate victims the slaves were gorgeous as was the innocent priest's daughter while the plantation owner his mistress and his were pretty hard on the eyes on purpose you make the call br br i hung in there till the end and some others might be able to make it as well if you just want to look at bare breasts there are plenty of them here and if you have a slave master fetish then you'll love this film otherwise watch it once vomit shower and never speak of it to anyone
<START> this movie starts with the main character lying in a coma in a hospital ward attended by two the unconscious main character is heard in a voice over saying that the are gay the kiss i watched this in a dvd version and i have the suspicion that this is supposed to be funny Â it said on the dvd case after all and it goes on like that had i seen this in a movie theater i probably would have heard part of the audience roar with laughter because it is so funny Â and because they are supposed to sit in a comedy while it is fascinating to think about what it is funny and what isn't this movie unfortunately only delivers arguments about what isn't br br brilliant brains can make anything funny people like ernst lubitsch billy wilder or mel brooks have proved that fact but you have to know the i suppose director and co scriptwriter dani levy does not bother about those mechanics he thinks that certain things simply are funny the fact that two are gay and kiss over a man in a coma for example do not get me wrong some people can make that funny dani levy can't not for me anyway br br the main problem i have with this movie is that i can't see a reason behind the way the main characters behave i could not understand why the two brothers one an orthodox jew from west germany one a third class carbon copy of fast eddie from former east germany so strongly disliked each other they are both rather bland characters their children are boring apart from the fact that they are sexually attracted to each other well one is a lesbian now but raises the daughter she has with her cousin but even these incestuous relationships Â if anything they are embarrassing just come through as an excuse because the scriptwriters could not come up with anything better br br the acting is not bad udo i actually came to like quite a lot although he reminded me more of ex chancellor helmut a lighter version than of a venerable orthodox jew the direction in itself is not really bad either but maybe levy should stick to directing movies leaving the scriptwriting to someone else now i heard he did a comedy about hitler oi
<START> when the episode was made and aired eisenhower was president kennedy was president elect br br as for the episode it was a passable episode if not a bit earnest the professor shows not much range here and the whole thing seems a little rushed a lot of episodes of the tz seem to not fit the time slot some seeming like they're crammed in and rushed some with little or nothing to it spread out over the half hour and some of course fit i guess you just expect a little more tension than to be taken back to some rooms and drugged but overall a decent episode indeed the what if motif of time travel is a nugget in itself and sets the table of with basic interest br br 7 out of 10 considering there were a lot of tz episodes not quite as good and some a great deal better
<START> i watched the mst3k version of the movie and this review includes minor spoilers br br when i started watching this movie it looked like it might have promise as a cheesy sci fi flick but the more i watched it the more disappointing it got the first reason is pretty idiosyncratic i liked the mousy shy girl with glasses a lot more than the model wanda became by the end of the movie more deeply it was the fact that the loss of glasses and change in clothing replaced any actual character growth instead of growing into a character that could take care of herself wanda was just as dependent on males to do everything for her as she was at the start of the movie the acting could have been better though i got tired of cracks about ireland's voice they were even in the movie itself it's not that bad the background was okay but it was a little hokey aliens humans with and could have used more explanation br br maybe it was just that i was interested in the movie itself but joel and the bots did little for me the movie might have been better without them at all br br overall for the movie itself not the mst3k a 3 out of 10 it was an okay flick for what it was
<START> ok yes its bad yes its complete fluff yes it makes the mule look like an oscar winner but look at it like i did i was 13 special effects were pretty much non in 90 of films back in the good ole days when films needed a story line ok so even the storyline is a bit dodgy but wow did i get into this film as a kid in the 80s cheesy rock bad special effects but airplanes an aerial fights and it had queens one vision on the soundtrack see even the worst things have a silver lining all in all if you want a bad film to show a 12 year old who hates computer effects if there is such a film this is the ideal choice
<START> usually when i don't see a show on an original run i find it later on cable and realize it's a gem the gimore girls is one of those rare exceptions i'm glad i missed it br br i truly despise shows that fill every minute of the actors space with rambling stupid boring banter this is one hour of just that the mother made me wonder if she is bipolar and off her lithium she never stopped talking every minute every second talking to every person she interacted with worse yet her speech is childish and soooo like valley girl she talked about guys her hair her mother her clothes like what's the for situation i've watched this show three times and still don't get the point of this series it's not a comedy it's not a drama it has no point except to make three generations of females in one family look like the girls from planet mars the males by comparison are smart and make the show somewhat watchable if ever existed and attempted to latch onto me with conversation i'd have to mace her to get rid of her she obviously doesn't know how to take a subtle hint to stop talking and start listening to someone else she also doesn't know how to really notice the existence of others br br in one show comes home from a date close to 10 pm she got the date after pursuing a guy she met at an auction she goes into her daughter's room where the daughter asks how it went she dithers on about how boring the guy was her date somehow got a few words in complained about how the man didn't stop talking choke hopefully the date learned how fortunate he was br br one other person here commented on how the mother acts like a teen and the daughter is the adult personality even dresses like her kid this obviously 40 something mom dresses and looks like she hit the mall with her high school pals in tow br br i thought that this show should have been followed by just shoot me because that's exactly how i felt
<START> 'apocalypse now francis ford coppola's war opus is probably the most beautiful war film i have ever seen capt benjamin willard martin sheen is a vietnam soldier who is tapped to head a very dangerous and highly classified mission into cambodia to the of col kurtz marlon brando a highly ranked and highly regarded army man who seemingly has gone completely insane and defected from the army setting up his own little society and helped by a cultish following of soldiers escorting him up the river to cambodia is a handful of navy men and along the way they encounter several interesting people most notably is robert duvall's a badass lieutenant colonel with a few screws loose and some horrifying situations br br is less historical war film than a philosophical and psychological study it is more 'full metal jacket' than the running time of is over three hours but the film is so wonderfully paced and compelling that when the end of the film arrived i was actually surprised at the amount of time that had passed the beautiful cinematography is surely what stood out the most for me however after seeing this film i am convinced that coppola is one of the masters of light and photography in film history the 'godfather' films were all tinged with an almost sepia tone and shadows created the feeling of a baroque composition with there is an incredible usage of natural light and the shadows particularly in the scenes involving brando and sheen almost become a living character they are so pervasive and effective another gorgeous scene was when cpt willard and jay hicks frederic forrest were in the jungle looking for mangoes and come across a tiger the sheer enormity of the surrounding foliage leaves as big as a house made the characters almost but the colorization of the scene was incredible while everything else was almost a muted grey the leaves were an incredibly vibrant green an effect that was particularly striking another really minor positive moment in the film was the great scene when the helicopters carrying duvall and company attack the small village while playing wagner this could have just been an ultra dramatic underlying soundtrack to the scene but instead coppola turns the song into an actual part of the scene with duvall mentioning that he likes to play it while they are approaching to the hell out of them' br br the performances in are first class much has been made of the amount of money brando earned for the film and the amount of trouble he caused regardless of this he turned out a powerful performance for a relatively short amount of screen time sheen is completely outstanding this is the first time i have seen him really unleash in a film Â and duvall is a lot of fun to watch as the loony 'apocalypse now' is a film that is so pervasive in pop culture by now most know several choice lines from the film 'i love the smell of napalm in the morning' et al but i knew little enough about it that there were plenty of surprises left to experience i have not seen the original cut of 'apocalypse now' so i cannot compare it to this newer cut but this is a film that should most certainly be experienced 8 10 br br shelly
<START> i have loved this movie since i saw it in the theater in 1991 i was 12 then and wil wheaton was my favorite actor and adolescent crush i am now 23 and i still love this movie the best part about it is whoever i am dating loves it too because it is a total macho guy movie it is wrought with enough action and mayhem to keep men with the shortest attention spans glued to the screen i only wish that it was available on dvd
