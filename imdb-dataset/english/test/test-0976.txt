<START> straight to video and with good reason its like the neighborhood kids putting on a play in the backyard but worse a young man don inherits a farm in west virginia that has been dormant for generations he decides to take a few friends to check the property out this farmland used to produce good corn crops even during the great depression the secret being that the owner was murdering folks and watering the fields with their blood then hang their bodies out as scarecrows the special effects are pretty lame and the the horrible dialog is full of unfunny one liners and the banter so ridiculous the sound may better be turned off cheap gore and a sham of a horror flick along with in the cast jeanie cheek b w york booty and jessica
<START> it is not surprising that this film was made by i'm at the time it was i'm examined the early beauty and tragedy of dynasty life in and delightfully explored a well known korean folk tale in and these comprised his last two films what is most surprising is that chi seon his 2002 offering is not presented in the style of those previous two films br br nonetheless the experienced hand of i'm comes through we explore together the life of a real person a late nineteenth century dynasty painter who rides on the edge of modernity but who is not a noble and who because of that causes a stir in contemporary korean society with his fame and his public and artistic expressions of disdain for the old korean noble class and his contempt for would be japanese ruling colonials alike the painter chang seung up known popularly as oh won performed magnificently by choi min the famous star of park chan already legendary oldboy becomes more and more influential and therefore more dangerous throughout the film contemporary korean audiences will back a hero like this despite the fact or maybe because of the fact that he was so ostracized in his time sense of simultaneous beauty and tragedy in history remains intact i'm is a master at capturing his country's past idiosyncrasies and in this film he almost outdoes himself as expected in an i'm film the cinematography is breathtaking the editing is precise and the story is central br br plots are set against seung up family ties are tested and broken scandalous behavior is alleged and is sometimes real all to bring down the man who painted fire but against all the intricacies of detailed but sometimes convoluted account of seung up's life seung up himself somehow manages to survive he becomes legendary because of his ability to perfectly copy famous chinese paintings after only one look art dealers and agents then besiege him and try to make money off oh won in other words lines of people who wish to take advantage of the real seung up an artistic star begin to form but he refuses to be manipulated his cleverness in off both the massive hordes and the imperial lackeys impresses the audience if not the cast br br what does seung up think he possesses powerful emotions and opinions about painting such as the aesthetic belief that paintings are living things and are never truly finished he despises those who would try to turn art into profit and he cares not for politicians who use their might to bring artistic beauty around them and then cast off the artist as traitorous but he also thinks that painting plays a role in the coming upheavals horrid scenes involving foreign invaders from france and japan are presented signature historical epic motif and his influence in the realm remains on prominent display in this multi million dollar epic br br the protagonist causes greater grief for himself and those who care for him when he refuses to paint this is when the story takes on a whole new meaning one that is not just political but social in nature i'm takes on the issues in laudable realist fashion br br he oh won becomes a jesus figure the people believe him capable of artistic miracles and the government feels it needs his artistic support but the protagonist remains fiercely independent and contemptuous of what others want him to do or be eventually both government and people come down upon seung up in a manner taken straight out of the bible his holiness becomes human his humanity is not accepted he dies for or escapes from the sins of the commoners the art critics the politicians who hound him br br but does he die as with most of films a question remains in this case does seung up really become an immortal hermit the film does not tackle that question it merely presents a possible end for the real man of chang seung up or oh won no death is depicted because no death is known br br it is difficult to find fault with this film but i'm has become so good at presenting various historical absurdities in his culture that when he does it hardly surprises anymore as usual for films the cinematography the editing and the writing are all first rate it's a well crafted film imbued with uncanny story telling ability granted he may be best at doing this through the ancient korean musical art of still the film contains stretches of this admirable art form and by the end viewers feel as if they have become privy to a great untold story and they have because that precisely is gift
<START> i think it is a brilliant show with cool talking heads and very cool action 2 guys who pretend to be masters in women seduction demonstrate their skills at different night clubs and 4 experts pickup artists themselves comment on them choosing the winner their jokes are amusing and some are really fun to watch more so this show really teaches men how to get in touch with women lots of expert's comments are useful while you may see how it works in the field actually i think this is one of the best tv shows and i totally recommend this to all men who like women br br ps pardon for my broken engrish
<START> first of all ignore the comment about how south park should make fun of republicans everyone is doing that now why should south park blindly follow what the rest of the media is doing and what the republicans are doing is more serious and less funny than al gore and his global warming hysteria br br but all that aside this episode is just plain funny al gore's portrayal has to be one of the best caricatures of a politician i've ever seen it was original and it was based on peoples opinions of the man i don't want to give anything away but it had me rolling on the floor br br there are also has some of the best cartman kyle moments ever br br all in all i'd say that this is one of the best episodes the show has ever had and i would highly recommend it to anybody
<START> if you have a chance see this russian how should i call them gems masterpieces hidden treasures war movies like this one or the dawns here are quiet or na and right after that watch again the american war movies or the international productions those one with the allies and the germans etc or even worse watch the italian war movies everything from the west will seem shallow contrived ridiculous in comparison with the russian movies i am sooooo stunned by the quality of the aforementioned russian war movies that i cannot find the words to praise enough their shattering superiority over anglo saxon war movies
<START> according to the budget information given on this web site dark harvest had an estimated budget of 130 000 where this money was spent i'm not exactly sure let me see costumes no location and sets hmmm think not special f x not acting lessons ah no dark harvest tells the epic tale of a young man who inherits a family farm in the hills of west virginia his girlfriend talks him into taking their friends up there to check the place out once there our intrepid hero learns that his great grandfather used a unique method for getting his crops to grow and now it's revenge time killer scarecrows out for revenge ewww scary well no not really we all know there have been some terrific movies made with very little money but this is not one of them this film contains pretty much some of the worst acting and dialog i've ever seen terrible clichÃ©s with terrible delivery all in all do not be fooled by the half way decent cover and avoid at all costs i'd like to give the film makers at least a d for trying but i'm afraid they didn't even do a good job with that grade f
<START> after watching the first movie in new aztec mummy collection it's difficult to believe how excited i was about the set and how upset i was when the release date was pushed back i've watched a lot of mexican horror in recent months some great Â the curse of the crying woman some entertaining despite obvious flaws Â night of the bloody apes and some cheesy Â pick any santo movie one thing that all these movies have in common is that none can be called dull well that's not the case with the aztec mummy it's been awhile since i last watched something so sleep inducing i wasn't hoping for or expecting a great movie but at least entertain me the aztec mummy takes every situation that could be interesting and sucks the life out of it through repeated scenes of people doing nothing and then extending those scenes for what fells like an eternity i guess that's what happens when you make an 80 minute movie with only 30 minutes of material padding extraordinaire for example for anyone who has seen the movie what purpose does the bat have other than to bring a masked wrestler type to the screen and to extend the runtime by 15 or so pointless minutes br br i can only hope that the other two movies in the collection are more entertaining than this one
<START> i have lost count as to how many times i have watched this movie i've never grown tired of it since this is a movie that can be enjoyed and interpreted on so many levels they just don't make movies like this anymore br br after recently finally watching the riveting documentary on the making of this film hearts of darkness a filmmakers journey into madness i'm even more amazed that this film even got finished yet alone turn out so great br br the fact that they actually filmed this movie in the jungles of the phillipines is the film's greatest asset you actually feel like your in vietnam br br all of the actors are fantastic with my favorites still being robert duvall i love the smell of napalm in the morning martin sheen and the great marlon brando br br a lot of people complain that the film gets too murky weird and cerebral near the end well what said about this movie this film is not about vietnam it is vietnam what he means is that this film is about madness and not the war br br this movie is based on the short story heart of darkness by joseph conrad and is set against the vietnam war instead of the civil war as in the book i think that was a brilliant combination in my opinion br br this is perfect challenging film that is dark violent humorous at times and well done in every single possible way br br a true classic br br rating 10
<START> d'amato's hardcore horror hybrid doesn't really live up to its extraordinary title and intriguing premise wherein various vapid contemporary types are attacked by a monster on an atoll previously used for nuclear experiments but for the most part the film is so slow the action so dreary and the cast so clearly repulsed to be having to have sex with each other that the film becomes a chore to watch br br this is a pity because the film sets up a promising idea a group of scientists are taken to the atoll by a naval officer in a small vessel the scientists Â three women and two men Â are an intriguing cross section of sexual types suffering to various degrees from nymphomania co dependency and there's even an intriguing foray into the world of female sex tourism where one of the women stops off at a brothel to get serviced by two hunky caribbean studs for hire the creature himself Â a mangled native islander with a horribly scarred face and an long Â bears some affinities with the old creature from the black lagoon and is the kind of nuclear nightmare that has over postmodern man since the cold war commenced despite those of us in the west having retreated into hedonism and science br br porno holocaust certainly is a film which shows the post sexual revolution westerners coming across their mirror image in a nuclear monster yet the with which it unfolds really lets down the fierceness of the idea there is a promising interplay of action shots with pov shots which suggest that the monster who looks stalks on as horror monsters from their pov position tend to do is akin to the voyeur in the audience getting off on the sex between the beautiful people the sight of the monster forcing a gorgeous young woman to suck his over sized member certainly throws the target audience's ugly fantasies in their face but d'amato has developed similar ideas better in other films and porno holocaust is a potentially fierce idea let down by the execution even d'amato's usual cinematographic skills let him down with much dreary camera work
<START> this adorable dog called various names during the film is seemingly loved by the whole town but he's alone he is friends with two children cindy and paul played astonishingly bad but their father won't let them have a dog then benji meets tiffany another adorable dog they instantly fall in love and it leads to a hysterical montage of the two of them frolicking in the grass drinking from a fountain in slow motion no less also benji lives in the cleanest abandoned house i've ever seen then the two kids are kidnapped by the most inept unfunniest kidnappers i've ever seen and wouldn't you know it they hide the brats in the exact house benji lives in br br wow was this bad a huge hit for some reason in 1974 which led to many sequels which i will not see the film is just terribly acted with humor so unfunny and badly done that you just stare at the tv in amazement the film also has a song that is played nonstop during the movie so much that you want to scream it was inexplicably nominated for best song at the oscars it didn't win yeah the dogs are adorable and much better than the human actors but i need more than cute dogs to keep me interested br br you might think i'm being a little hard on a kids film but i saw it with my 5 year old nephew within 20 minutes he was bored silly and basically stopped watching i kept watching in hope that it would get better it didn't really lousy but very patient kids or dog lovers might like it br br note to parents it's g rated but a dog is viciously kicked a few times you don't see it you just hear it and the dog survives but this might bother real young kids
<START> i really wish i had read everyone's review before going to see the movie it was one of the most excruciating films that i've ever seen i was ready to leave the theater 5 minutes into the movie i should have followed my instinct the movie offered nothing new or clever it was boring and very clichÃ© i was surprised to find that it was directed by a woman the characters did not represent any women that i know they were boring bitter and melodramatic the movie was unrealistic and depressing and a waste of time and money and the actors looked tired poor make up and hair styling it was recently compared to the sex and in the city movie it was not even half as good my suggestion do not see this movie
<START> how would you feel if you had only a few weeks left to live this film helps you to know through the eyes of one guy who is faced with that situation it is told with sympathy and without too much emotion some might feel it rather slow but i think that adds to the realism of the film some might see it as a love story but i think that is secondary to seeing his last days through his eyes the loves of his life are part of the end of his life and give it more impact low key and gentle the film rolls out the story much as life does without clichÃ©s and with unexpected events set against a backdrop of getting by if you like your films gently emotionally realistic this may be for you
<START> i did enjoy watching squire jerk around the crew in this episode though after a while the whole thing just seemed a little too long sure the histrionics were kind of funny for a while and the ending was a pretty good way to wrap the whole thing together i think the problem was that i enjoyed seeing when he was full of bravado and fun the fun seemed to vanish when became vindictive and nasty talk about a mood killer going from the obnoxious but affable host to the guy sentencing kirk to death but despite this the episode was enjoyable and worth my time for die hard trekkies this is a must see for others it's just a pretty run of the mill one
<START> i saw what i believe to be the best australian film of the year so far jon acolytes br br acolytes is a stylish thriller with a killer premise get bullied and molested teens discover a local serial killer in their suburb and then set about blackmailing him to kill the bully who molested them hewitt has picked a top notch cast including excellent new comers sebastian gregory payne and hanna lawrence to play the teens add to that three yes thats right three great psycho's lead by joel edgerton in an outstanding performance of serial killer du jour belinda his deranged spouse and michael as the teen raping bully with swastika tattoos once you add these teens and these menacing adults all hell breaks hewitt has crafted a balls to the wall serial thriller thats damn original and accomplished you can see the influence of larry clark and david lynch's twin peaks but hewitt makes it all his own in a qld suburban back water always ringing with the drones of emptiness the script by shayne shane and hewitt is tight br br if marketed correctly this film could be a break out hit with teens the next wolf creek it could well be it makes all the right moves the teens are real ala larry clark they don't suck and have an attached pc agenda they are non communicative good looking and hip the killers are dark with real menace joel edgerton steals his scenes as the mild mannered local ted bundy who sports a butterfly on his spare ala john the collector petrol head rapist pours on the menace that tops suburban mayhem and provides a creepy thug who you can't wait to see buy the farm br br the film is fast paced tough and brutal not only that it displays a confidence and directorial mastery from hewitt that is surely to win him an if or afi nomination if not award its nuanced and poetic mise en scene brilliant sound design excellent cinematography and tight structure mark it as clearly one of the best directed oz features i have seen so far this year br br the film leaves you shaken thinking and unsettled its a truly great edition to the return to genre going on in australian cinema at present it will surely garner the interest of hollywood oh and did i mention it got into toronto what other oz feature films can say that much the world should get ready for a new auteur jon hewitt
<START> seriously all these satan comes to earth movies always involve the catholics why doesn't lucifer ever mess with the other denominations br br the plot is that played by former jason vorhees kane hodder has a plot to become human but wasn't he always a demon by getting this young girl who is his sister pregnant with his child except maybe she isn't his sister the plot isn't clear on this and they inter splice these scenes where he is seeing a shrink about his problem br br the lead girl gets pregnant while still a virgin with an incredibly creepy scene of her father giving her a exam to prove her hymen is still intact her sister played by a washed up and looking much worse for wear denise crosby concludes that this is a sign from heaven praise be br br well the demon baby takes mom's body for a joy ride and picks off in order a truck driver her friend's boyfriend and her friend all being watched by an ex military priest whose mission is to kill the baby when it is born we discover that is actually a catholic cardinal who is running the whole thing br br the ending is pretty much incomprehensible and if you could make it that far straight through you have a stronger stomach than i did i paused the film a couple of times it was so awful
