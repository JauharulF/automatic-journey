<START> ghost son is lamberto bava's best film and at the same time also his worst i suppose that statement requires some slight clarification it's his best because it's well directed ambitious accessible and very stylish but his worst because it's a dull unoriginal movie and undeniably a huge letdown to all the real fans of bava's past efforts let's face it many fans myself certainly included wouldn't have been interested in this film judging by the plot the famous names attached to it and even the boring sounding title the only motivation here was lamberto bava who brought us large amounts of convoluted gialli and fun splatter films in the past ghost son is a bit of his comeback film alongside the torturer and although the latter definitely isn't a good film it at least lives up to his fans' lines of expectations with excessive amounts of sleaze blood and sadism ghost son is a weak and intolerably soft horror film even talking in terms of mainstream ghost stories the emphasis lies too much on sentimentality and this badly affects the already limited number of horrific creepily atmospheric moments the basic premise might feature one or two potentially good ideas but the film is overall dull and far too clichÃ©d john hannah and laura star as a happy couple living on a remote ranch in south africa and breeding horses for a living the joy and happiness couldn't possibly improve so naturally something tragic is bound to happen and it does mark dies in a car accident but the inconsolable stacey remains at the ranch where she's in constant contact with mark's spirit she even gets pregnant with his child but shortly after baby martin's birth mysterious events begin to occur it seems as if mark's restless and selfish ghost the baby and uses him to encourage stacy into committing suicide with all the focus on the couple's relationship many of the events and sub plots are underdeveloped and or remains unexplained like the whole background of the youthful maid there's too little action and the only real fright moments are too obviously borrowed from classic films such as the exorcist and rosemary's baby vomiting green goo self moving purely talking in terms of horrific entertainment ghost son is a painful misfire but it has to be said it's a beautiful and enchanting looking failure the cinematography is extremely elegant and many camera angles are truly inventive and suggestive the moody score sometimes even manages to create an ominous atmosphere even though there's nothing of any significance happening on screen there are several beautiful images of the south african wildlife to admire but if that interests you i suppose you're better off watching national geographic instead not much to recommend here fans of atmosphere driven ghost stories have much better options to choose from and die hard bava fanatics are advised to re watch demons macabre or blade in the dark
<START> we have given this film one star for awful however it really depends on how you look at it we are currently watching this on channel 5 at 3 30am and we haven't stopped laughing so perhaps we could give it a 10 just for the entertainment value right from the outset with the thoughts of the stalker being relayed in comic fashion we were laughing is it me or does that chick from knott's landing look like one of the characters from the dark crystal br br i'm not going to spoil it for you however you would have to be pretty stupid not to see it coming i don't think its clever enough for double bluffs br br this has to be the worst best film we have ever seen if we'd been playing the 'spot the clichÃ©' drinking game then we be wasted by now
<START> seeing laurel without hardy in a film seems strange yet it's entertaining all the same it's a well done parody of what became a classic silent film and it showcases stan's talents very well while his pictures with oliver hardy were great these early solo efforts give you an idea of how skilled he was at his craft and how great he might have been had he continued in the tradition of keaton and chaplin as an individual star on his own the dance sequence with his real life wife in the cafÃ© scene is the best part of the picture and has some pretty funny bits to go with laurel's excellent dance steps and the bullfight climax is a gem as even the bull takes a pratfall and i like the irony in the scene where he's buried in hats and comes up wearing his familiar laurel and hardy bowler hat as much as i love the laurel and hardy team and feel that there was never a funnier comedy duo on screen during their prime it's nice to see them on their own once in a while check out the fighting that hardy made with the duke as another fine example dale
<START> this movie was strange mainly because the plot was so incoherent the title refers to a vicious wind which renders the surface of the earth almost when it blows but this seemed to have nothing whatsoever to do with what was going on the movie seems to be an extremely poor rip off of bladerunner ie rogue android being chased by bounty hunter or ruthless cop in this luke skywalker turns in a surprisingly good performance as afore mentioned rogue cop nothing seems to be resolved at the end of the movie we never find out anything of any substance about the android or what his intentions are there is one baffling scene where bill paxton who has kidnapped the android plays one particular song in his cardboard airplane for no particular reason the song is called shape of things by the this happens again in a later scene where the same song is played for no apparent reason does this song have any relevance to the movie don't think so
<START> do a title search on randolph scott and trail street is the one film missing from the list you've seen one of 4 films scott made at rko during his prime 1947 the others are always easy to get liberal kansas is just southwest of dodge city and is a powder keg about to explode between the trail riders who drive the into trail street the town's main street and the sod busters who feed our it'll take a strong man like bat masterson to step between the two groups and bring the town to order more i won't say except that scott movies usually have just one pretty girl and this one has three randolph scott always played men you could look up to for their sense of honor courage level headedness and willingness to do the right thing fifty years ago parents could send their kids to a scott movie with confidence they'd learn positive values robert ryan co stars in this film playing a good guy for a change in real life ryan was one of the many world war ii heros who starred in america's movies how sad what we get these days george clooney teaches our young that we ought sympathize with suicide bombers while steven spielberg teaches there is no moral difference between the olympic athletes murdered in 1972 in munich and the palestinian terrorists who killed them hollywood 2005 derives their moral compass from too much cocaine and too much commitment to the wacky left i wonder how all this plays out in liberal kansas liberal after all was not a dirty word 150 years ago when the city was named
<START> i have seen nearly all the films of kurosawa and dozens of other japanese films as well compared to these other films this is a rather average to poor film the plot features two warring brothers neither one of which i cared much for and it is very confusing keeping up with who is allied with who the music and cinematography is pretty good but the special effects at times are terrible rubber heads flying off with about the same realism as the average high school play on top of these complaints the ending of the movie completely destroys and undermines the entire picture it turns out that the end isn't true but was completely fudged what's the point of this then if you have seen this film understand that there are many better films out there so don't give up
<START> i am a big fan of lonesome dove and all the books in the series and i love the movie i was happy to see that they finished up with comanche moon i have been a long time fan of steve and was eager to see him in a serious role i personally think that steve has done an amazing job of re creating gus i can't think of another actor who would have been better he has the voice the mannerisms the pronunciation of word all down to a t granted no one could ever hold a candle to robert duvall as gus but i think that steve has done a pretty darn good job karl urban acts the same in all the movies he has been in so he has made a good match for woodrow call as for the movie itself yeah it's a little corny but can you really beat lonesome dove no i don't think so
<START> when it comes to political movies i usually come out feeling empty they generally take up some moralistic stance and you have a clear good vs bad story line as if it is some sort of batman movie br br but with it is the first movie i've seen that showed politics for what it is and the real issues of trying to rule a country of broken people who have known no other rule but violence there were no good or bad there were just interests and conflicts of interest this is the only political movie in my opinion that one can come out of it truly learning something especially for anyone with their eye on politics as a career this movie shows you you cannot rule on what you want for a country but what the country wants from you br br that's why i disagree with a lot of reviews that say everyone comes of bad i think they come of too idealistic the belgians want the perfect colony wants a perfect unity congo wants wealth and riches america wants the perfect ally against communism russia wants the perfect aide for communism and the they come off used and abused best example in the movie when tells his black troops your government lied to you and it leaves them all in an uproar they are always being pulled and pushed into supporting this person or another br br this movie shows in politics a mistake can cost you dearly and this movie everyone makes mistake after mistake until it escalates and ends up destroying the country their intentions might be good or at least in the characters opinion but it's everyone's mistakes that lead to the downfall of congo i don't think anyone is bad in this film i just think they want too much from people sick of giving and want to start taking br br overall it's not just the best political film it is a great film in general acting is fabulous as was perfect casting i really believe him script flawless editing perfect pace and production value higher than i expected for a central african film a must watch
<START> the patriot staring steven segal is a late 90's thriller action movie that is not really a thriller and not really an action movie rather it is steven segal playing steven segal by another name but this time he is a native american country doctor who kicks butt every now an again baring the obvious plot line holes the movie itself is absolutely amazing in terms of the blatant disregard for character br br from a marketing standpoint i was left asking myself who in the world were they aiming at the bio thriller plot line is way off the mark for the middle america crowd and segal as silk cowboy would never sell to anyone even if you deep fried him and put him between a cream donut the whole movie is just way out there even for segal fans because it simply does not deliver on any level
<START> in the 3rd installment of left behind the makers did not care to put any kind of continuity into the plot although all weapons on the planet have been confiscated by the united nations world war iii suddenly begins at the snap of a finger within a few split seconds the ex lover of one of the main protagonists moves from passionately seducing him to outright hatred to a melancholy confession of love without any trace of direction br br but foremost this film is really an irony free zone after the president of the united states accepts jesus as his savior he immediately becomes a suicide bomber and blows up a skyscraper in the middle of the city osama bin laden will be very jealous when he sees this film
<START> 'the english patient' is a love story set in europe as world war ii ends it is a wartime romance mystery epic like mon amour ' 'the sweet hereafter ' and 'after life ' anthony weaves extravagant beauty around a central character whose condition is grotesque and puts emotional barriers between the characters and the audience br br this adult love story is an intimate portrait in the tradition of 'casablanca' and 'dr zhivago ' the film sweeps gracefully attaining a level of eroticism and emotional connection that many similar films had missed told in flashback it is a masterpiece of intimate moment and spectacular largesse br br ralph fiennes plays the english patient count de a hungarian cartographer of few words who works for the british government and is stationed in the north african desert br br count is the unidentified survivor of a plane crash turned over to the allies taken into custody by a medical convoy in italy and essentially left to die in peace in an isolated monastery in tuscany under the care of an inspiring pretty nurse who injects him with morphine and reads to him a book considered his great treasure and his one surviving possession br br hana seeks to stimulate his touching memories wrapped up in his head released in lost pieces from his disturbed mind br br fiennes gives a haunted pained performance playing the young man whose veneer of charm cannot plainly cover his heart's capacity for passion he makes us sympathize with the character in showing self doubt and weakness as a badly burned man he has only cherished memories his joy and heartbreak are completely clear and visible in his eyes he remembers falling under the spell of an attractive english married woman he remembers the way this turns him from a harsh abrupt wanderer into a man willing to betray everything for love his tragic love affair forms the heart of the motion picture br br kristin scott thomas matches fiennes' work with a radiant sensuality she is captivating as the married european woman conveying the audience with the energy and enthusiasm for life that the count finds irresistible their different world despairing and hopeful menacing and resilient is simply beautiful with intense passion and intelligence this attractive blonde burns the screen as the different wife br br juliette binoche seems to shine as the french canadian nurse full of life and energy this vibrant young woman has a heart of gold kissing wounded soldiers but she thinks that she is a curse as anybody she ever loved tends to die on her br br colin firth is good as husband he is a british spy flying into the tough desert in a yellow biplane to take aerial maps of the whole north african continent he quickly becomes friend of the count yet when he realizes that his wife has committed adultery his face reflected a peaceful fury br br william dafoe plays a double agent spy who covers his anger with a strange charm he is a crippled war veteran who has a hidden agenda this cunning canadian man seems to know of some dark secret in past he believes the 'english patient' is partially responsible for the mutilation of his hands and is busy seeking revenge on everyone even remotely involved br br andrews is ardent he is a handsome sikh and an explosives expert with a dangerous there's a scene that is stuck in my head because it literally had me on the edge of my seat for what seemed an in this particular scene the military has to cut the wires on a bomb that has been hidden on a it's on a timer and he only has a few minutes leftÂ the scene cuts back and forth between his tense face the wires and his dirty fingers as they try madly to figure out how to untangle and cut the wires without detonating the br br all the conventional elements of the genre are at peaks of excellence in the english patient john cinematography is breathtaking and gabriel majestic music is dreamy and this is a rich motion picture with ambition and style a fever dream lyrical and we are almost able to feel the heat of the desert the pain of the burnings the intimate flush of humanity that becomes the most haunting element of this epic love story
<START> is there a fire fighter clichÃ© that is not used in this film from the opening line i'm getting too old for this through the antics of the firemen to the worrisome wife the loss of his best friend in the firehouse to the final funeral for the fallen brethren this film looks and sounds like it was written by the marketing department at disney our studies show that audiences really like it when and then they stuck it in br br there is nothing original here any emotion we feel for these guys is brought in for our admiration and feelings for firemen br br go watch rescue me if you want to see real heroes everyday guys with flaws that think nothing of running into a burning building to save strangers
<START> the wizard of park was deeply responsible for many things we take for granted in 2007 even if he did not invent them without rivals or assistants he gave birth to the electric light the phonograph the motion picture camera the electric car battery the electric power grid possibly his most important but least recalled invention the pre fabricated house and innovations to the telephone and telegraph as well as the ticker tape machine and an early voting machine the total number of is over 1 000 far more than any other american inventor br br but edison was a ruthless business competitor he frequently had vast legal fights over the precedence of his inventions over rivals the best example is the telephone where he was one of seven or eight rivals with claims against alexander graham bell actually edison's invention here was not the central idea that bell and gray had come up with independently of each other in 1876 but an improvement on the sound quality of the phone receiver and transmitter that bell did not develop still it was part of the huge 1888 supreme court decision that was the longest u s supreme court decision a single volume of their reports written by chief justice morrison waite which by the way killed the poor chief justice from overwork within weeks of completing it br br in 1886 edison found an equally ruthless competitor in the area of electric power for large cities this was george inventor of the railroad air break firm had gotten the assistance of a new inventor and former edison assistant nicola developed alternating current which was a rival system to edison's direct current edison's system was basically a straight circuit system of electricity system allowed the current to be switched from one circuit to another actually it was a better and more efficient system but edison was determined to break this rival by a publicity campaign br br it started with electric power lines edison early on had his lines put underground so that they would not be endangered by weather conditions but was forced to have his lines out in the open like telephone lines when there were several accidental deaths by repair on lines in particular one incident where the repairman was burned alive in front of hundreds of horrified onlookers in manhattan's business district edison started insisting that a c current was far more dangerous that d c br br one result of all this was edison helping some subsidiary inventors with getting a c generators and for an electric chair edison himself always denied that he invented the electric chair but he helped several lesser figures along the way for the complete story read mark edison the electric chair new york walker company 2003 br br edison experiment himself with cats and dogs experiments he was glad to show the public in the long run despite assisting in the invention of a new method of execution edison failed to dislodge the public support of alternating current but he never stopped trying br br in 1903 he had an opportunity to combine his campaign against and a c with his invention of the motion picture camera he assisted in putting down a well known public elephant topsy who had killed several men he did so by electrocuting the poor beast with a c but the entire killing is on film and one can view it to this day it is a pitiful looking film whatever poor topsy had done it was a poor beast not a machiavellian murderer the moment we see the explosions of electricity sparks that show the death of the elephant we are aware it will soon be over but the sudden collapse of topsy is still an unpleasant sight to view the film leaves a bad flavor in the mouths of modern movie audiences yet sad to say it probably made a profit for edison his description of the film in his catalog of films shows real pride in his accomplishment here in 1903 it may have been exciting entertainment for many americans watching it one is glad that more people are appalled by it today sometimes one can sense the human race has improved a little bit
<START> after a long hard night being partied away at the walkabout in i needed a pick me up my throat hurt my wallet was empty and i ended up chatting to a drug addict at a bus stop trying to sell me some petrol today i watched red sonja and i can honestly say that i felt much better last night than i do right now brigitte nielsen leads a bunch of ass kicking warriors in various shapes and sizes to recover a green rock from some evil queen whose motives are never fully explained yep it's that good br br red sonja isn't in a genre known for great films until peter jackson came along with a certain oscar winning trilogy in fact the best swords and sorcery film i could think of before lord of the rings was george lucas's kiddie friendly willow perhaps in view of this one should go a little easy on this film but i can't it's poorly written badly acted with the exception of paul smith who's just average and dreadfully put together the film is as convincing as an episode of the flintstones with costumes and scenery seemingly lifted straight outta considering the comic book source material it is easy to forgive the various plot inconsistencies why sonja insists on saving the most annoying kid in this world or that one is bewildering his personality seems to flick from spoilt brat to polite gentleman at the flick of a switch schwarzenegger displays less charisma than a field full of cows and just goes through the motions a perfect actor for his breakthrough role in the terminator br br it's simple to kick a film when you're down but the fact remains that this is not a good film by any stretch of the imagination when nielsen mourns the death of her sister and schwarzenegger tenderly places his hand on her shoulder to comfort her and then blurts out in that distinctive germanic accent she's dead then you know you're in for a rough ride a few smiles were raised at inappropriate points such as the priestesses of a temple who when sent plunging to their deaths in a hole in the ground seemed to enjoy the experience at least judging from the orgasmic moans that seemed to echo around the place if you have to watch an eighties fantasy film that wasn't porn watch willow but never take that as a ringing endorsement for the real thing take yourself to your local multiplex and show peter jackson what a great job he did with lord of the rings trust me 11 oscars really does mean it's a great film unlike bloody titanic
<START> worst movie i have ever seen 90 minutes of excruciating film making all the ingredients to make this movie a true work of crap bad acting bad directing bad storytelling bad makeup bad dialogue bad effects and bad reasoning behind certain actions taken by the characters it also threw in a terrible naked shot of a dumb blond and a breast shot of a stupid asian girl and both attempts were just scary since these girls are ugly some good horror movies came out of the 80s but this could never be considered one of them kevin tenney also committed one of the greatest sins in storytelling he introduced characters at the end of the movie an old man and old woman i would vote for it below a 1 out of 10 but the voting system doesn't work that way apparently right from the title sequence i knew it would suck and i would return my dvd but best buy doesn't refund dvds or products as they call it or so my receipt says i have the dunwich horror and that was truly god awful but i still feel that night of the demons an obvious evil dead rip off was far worse than dunwich horror this is just like the howling how in the hell could sequels get milked out of this anorexic cow save your money and get the texas chainsaw massacre just don't get any of its sequels though or the evil dead or dawn of the dead night of the demons is a very very very bad investment every second of it was just maddening excruciating pain for the audience because the whole movie all around was horrible do yourself a favor don't see it you'll be saving some brain cells
