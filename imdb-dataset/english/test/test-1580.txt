<START> left quite a noticeable impression in my head the story is quick paced and leaves you constantly absorbed and at many times quite tense its about five remarkable student doctors notably julia roberts and kevin bacon among whom one of them has devised the mechanism of remaining dead or getting flat lined for a few seconds and then coming back to life br br the procedure is quite involving a plethora of medical knick injections electric blankets oxygen masks and a variety of esoteric medical terms i strongly suspect doctors coined all these words so that they never need to get layed off but funnily they follow the kiss original version for engineers keep it simple stupid extended version for doctors keep it stupid simple philosophy as well at the risk of getting euthanized by some revenge taking doctor reader let me continue br br so the first guy who gets flat lined hopes to find the answers to life which philosophy and religion cannot convincingly answer he hopes to get it answered and become famous through applied science he flat lines for around two minutes and then comes back into our world left quite shaken during death he has a vision of an incident when he was young which left the strongest impression on his life he killed another boy when he was kid by accident and he still feels responsible for it br br with the success of the first flat liner the others follow suit each of them extending their flat line time further and further to test the limits of how long one can remain dead and experience life after death br br meanwhile monsters from the past and future keep coming back to haunt them after their flat line experience the first flat liner is haunted by a young kid who tortures him when he is alone the second who camera ed all the women he took to bed sees television sets all over playing his videos the third is haunted by a young girl who he teased in school the fourth is haunted by her suicide dead father for whom she feels responsible br br all of them are driven insane by these haunting and obsessions and think that the past seems to want to take revenge on them the main focus on getting flat lined is that your entire life passes through your eyes at the moment of whatever stage that is and you are left mostly with the strongest impressions of life in your mind since they didn't die these strong impressions have somehow resurfaced and have become the focus of their lives br br all of them somehow come to terms with and their past demons all of them except the first one who realizes the only way he can move on through life is getting flat lined again during this flat line session he sees himself getting flat lined the first time and also sees the boy he killed trying to kill him this time round the boy kills him this time for a few minutes and in doing so has sought revenge for a few minutes in the movie one is left wondering if he gets to come back thankfully because most of us like happy endings the boy him of his past and he comes back to life again
<START> take an utterly stupid story couple it with unprofessional performances 2 bit graphics add ultra lame comedy bits and you get this film i thought the original was bad but at least that story was simple and straightforward though idiotic may nobody produce another in this series
<START> this was an excellent movie with good acting and it keeps your attention through to the very end maybe people are either tired or uncomfortable with the subject matter and that's why it's being trashing so much it could also be too deep for many of the viewers out there who give movies like the american pie series higher ratings br br jake gyllenhaal is a cia analyst not an agent who is to observe an interrogation of an egyptian man by not egyptians he's not supposed to be a hardened agent and so comes off as naive of the interrogation techniques used this is more believable than if he were to come across as being an old hat at it br br the story jumps around a bit and can be confusing but it also makes you stay focused on whats going on until the end when everything comes together as the puzzle falls into place the supporting actors did a good job of helping to carry the movie i found the movie to be powerful and thought provoking
<START> absolutely corrosive director arthur hiller and writer paddy dismantle the american hospital system with this wicked comedy drama whodunit the hospital depicted here is fraught with problems from protesting neighbors to irate patients to a potential serial killer on the loose george c scott is the top doctor who on the brink of his own nervous breakdown gets involved with free spirited diana rigg and her wacky father barnard hughes alternately depressing and uproarious the hospital features some of the most acid tinged dialog imaginable note how scott describes his love making session with rigg it also has a lot of great vignettes scott berating head nurse nancy marchand after one of here underlings accidentally kills a doctor daffy administrator frances trying desperately to collect insurance info from a waiting room full of sick people scott getting sobering advice from the hospital psychiatrist after telling him of his woeful home life all of the acting is first rate scott and rigg are dynamite and hughes is a real surprise the movie is a masterpiece with script earning a well deserved oscar over such stiff competition as klute sunday bloody sunday the opening narration is priceless
<START> after reading about this documentary i rented it and watched it with my teenage children it was amazingly well balanced showing each side's perspective and leaving many questions unanswered this is as it should be i don't watch a documentary to be told what to think i watch it to learn and to draw my own conclusions br br afterward we took a trip to waco and visited the branch davidians at the site of the conflagration this was a potent lesson in seeing for yourself and it drove home the basic underlying honesty behind waco the rules of engagement if you just open your eyes and look the facts can speak for themselves
<START> i've waited 9 years to watch this film simply because i never saw it advertised on tv eventually i caught it and it was well worth the wait it's much better than your over hyped scream or last summer garbage because it's all at a fairly quick pace with no drawn out creeping through the house to cheesy music scenes only the bad dubbing lets it down a little but don't let that put you off in any way what lies beneath over hyped and crap mute witness low budget not hyped at all and very good
<START> i first saw this movie in a queer film festival 10 minutes after the movie ended a gay couple walked up to me and asked me whether i needed help i was still sitting crying like a maniac the movie is cheesy it's bizarre it's over the top it's gay but it is amazing i do think that every character is plausible character is mean to a woman who only tries to help he brutally throws his terrible friends out he does have a temper he can harm a fly the fly that killed the love of his life doubly so bates is a miracle she is perfect just like a role a woman whose love and admiration is so strong that she even loves the homosexual lover of her idol is to me the essence of true love i even understand max the husband he is bored with his life he's got a midlife crisis he moves out tries to lead an exciting life only to realise a that he's the really boring part in the relationship and b that he loves his wife i love the fact that she comes back to him in the end because i think that it gives the film the right balance between dream and reality for in the end he's her husband and he might not be as exciting as victor but he's real he is the man she loves in a very down to earth way i've watched it about 50 times and i do love this film everything about it unconditionally btw just read rupert autobiography and ul is the only film that he talks of as one of the best films he ever made to me it's the best film he ever made
<START> i'm sorry to say that this movies was one of the biggest disappointments of the year following one of the biggest disappointments in movie monster match up history you would think that they would learn from the mistakes of the previous incarnation the sequel falls into many of the same traps the plot line was completely forced the dialog was so bad that the film might be better on mute and the action was contrived and far from the heart pounding brilliance of each monsters original films the best part of requiem is in fact the trailer which as you go through the movie end up realizing that almost every single death and every really cool shot in the movie was already shown in the trailer which leaves little to be revealed and little to be excited about i gave the movie an extra star for letting see the extra hot female in the almost nude the movie played out like a color by number sci fi monster fest which also played into the fact that nothing was a surprise when it happened because you'd seen it a thousand times before the main failing with both these movies is that the creators thought that setting the films in our time would make us be interested in the story more as if it may one day happen to us but what drew people in when they released the arcade game back in the day was that it kinda took place within an over the top futuristic version of the alien trilogy time line which allowed more of a suspension of disbelief this is where the future movies need to draw inspiration from because to be honest seeing a waitress killed by the alien we all have feared since childhood just really doesn't do it for us lets take the series back to its roots learn from the former masters and don't mess with a winning formula by trying to make a new vision' we liked the originals for a reason we want to see that again lastly the ending is the real wtf moment of the whole film spoiler after the big climax the survivors are ambushed by special ops soldiers who justify their horrific actions by saying 'we were following and then turn on a dime and start acting all nice and are turned into saviors then after the long pull back with one of the survivors looking ominously into the heavens we cut to the most bizarre cliffhanger i've ever seen with characters you never saw in the rest of the movie save the government dude then with all the subtlety of a punch to the face they reveal that there will be yet another film with the hint of a plot line that would make a sci fi channel original movie blush and turn up its nose so in summation if you have to choose between this movie and doing any other activity on the face of the earth skip the movie and do the other thing instead
<START> or is this another way below the bottom of the barrel masterpiece preferably both somewhere between 1969 and 1972 came a host of several horrible horror movies that are all but lost again nothing more needs to be explained asked or screamed out loud if you followed closely at my writings about carnival of blood or guru the mad monk then you know what's in store with scream baby scream the title sounds cool it's just the weak script that should have gone someplace else even so this is hands down the most dreadfully written piece of cinematic mastery ever worked on film br br if you thought this is an early slasher which benefits the average imdb user to write up another comment better luck next time the real truth behind the script has nothing to do with the movie which supposedly tells of a blue faced psychopath out to kill and make some ugly facial sculptures on his victims it feels like you're watching another early scooby doo episode my favorite scene is the monkey cage where the four young hippie teenagers play in and hooray for an actress under the name for giving us the worst facial makeover ever 1969 has never been this bad but it is br br try finding this 30 year old rarity at a bargain basement for five bucks it makes the perfect novelty item for going back to those psychedelic days of flower power bad fashions and trashy music interesting note scream baby scream is also listed in troma's film archives on the company's website only time will tell when this reaches the top of the bottom 100 list along with a few more early 70s cheapies gosh knows they need to plan 9 is history
<START> valentine a model in france is separated from her lover who is abroad they plan to meet up in england but seem to be growing ever more distant as the film progresses one night after declining a pass made by her coworker she hits a dog named rita the dog survives and she returns it to her owner a hostile retired judge who's is living as a hermit and listening in on the conversations of all his neighbours she becomes intrigued by the nature of this man and visits him often often becoming part of his eavesdropping games one conversation the two listen in on is of extreme importance though the conversation between a young soon to be judge and his wife which we find out parallels the life of the man who is eavesdropping upon them as we find out more about the couple the man reveals more of his story then continues his story and we find out if the two men will continue towards the same fate little does valentine know how her life this encounter and the fate of the young judge will become entangled together her hitting the dog that day seemed to be fate a divine sacrifice by the dog for her owner allowing valentine to be the saviour of the young judge who is traveling the same path as her dear friend to prevent him from having such a grim future filled with loneliness and solitude it seems the old man's dream will come true after all and he can sleep with a smile on his face for the rest of his days br br an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time kieslowski never ceases to amaze me he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art three of the most visually appealing movies i've ever seen and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome usually signified with a subtle pause or late focus in a scene see if you can spot some i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years i couldn't think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anything a work of art 10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy

<START> beware my lovely 1952 dir harry horner br br production the filmmakers rko radio pictures br br credulity straining thriller from the pioneering producer team of collier young and ida lupino aka the filmmakers with lupino pitching in with some uncredited direction br br robert ryan is the and ida lupino is the 'woman' in this entry in the in peril' style film ryan plays howard wilton a tightly wound psychotic handyman drifter noooo ryan i know hard to believe lupino is the lonely war widow helen gordon who hires howard to do some work around her house things go downhill from there as howard makes helen a prisoner in her own home br br howard has a nasty secret not that he could reveal it you see consciousness is a real challenge for him maintaining it that is he has an unfortunate habit of coming to and finding his employers dead this is part of the film's problem the nature of howard's psychosis is so extreme that it is nearly impossible to believe that he's been free to roam from town to town even in the year 1918 when the film is set he can't remember anything that happened ten minutes ago his violent threatening anti social tendencies are set off by the smallest and most common of things a young girl flirting inadequacies involving the war due to his being rejected for service i don't know how he even made it past the interview with helen there are other implausibilities if you were locked in your house with a madman but nonetheless left on your own for periods of time couldn't you figure out a way to escape br br ryan i think is defeated by the material it feels like he's overplaying his hand his series of tics and spasms and the tightly bursts of dementia all have a been there done that robotic feel to them at this point in his career he'd probably played this character to some degree ten times and it shows we are encouraged to empathize with howard i didn't through shown bits of humanity like him being stopped in his tracks by a music box and his relating to a group of children who won't judge him lupino just has to act frazzled and in distress which she is more than capable of and does br br the picture had one thing going for it what would be the eventual resolution of the conflict so naturally there was a disappointing ending that was abrupt and ineffective br br of slight interest was a recurring motif where the camera would catch howard's reflection in mirrors water christmas tree decorations this indicated something going on or about to go on in his head horner 1953's vicki who made his reputation in production design does a fine job of making the house feel like a prison credit too the always reliable rko art department for the work on the house in the end sub standard work from the principals who all have much better films to their credit br br Â½ out of 4
<START> i rented this movie because the cover was cool looking the first 15 minutes of the movie are okay and somehow interesting but once the young woman and her little sister go on their trip everything goes to hell and the movie becomes boring
<START> the movie shows many feelings and emotions that are very strong and personal the atmosphere in the movie is very tense and sad you can really get a clear picture of what the main character is going through and how he is responding to the world around him i think it is a great movie and that everybody should see it br br
<START> the promise of martin donovan playing jesus was quite honestly enough to get me to see the film definitely worthwhile clever and funny without overdoing it the low quality filming was probably an appropriate effect but ended up being a little too jarring and the ending sounded more like a pbs program than hartley still too many memorable lines and great moments for me to judge it harshly
