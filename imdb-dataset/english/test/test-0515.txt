<START> well what's wrong with the title separate lies accused elsewhere of not being exciting it's cunning subtle and a bit poetic of course there's a phil collins song and a james belushi film called separate lives which are alluded to here br br but the real point is the ethical dilemmas of telling lies at different levels that the film probes ok it's not an in your face hilarious title but then it's not an in your face hilarious film please give british films like this a chance they do try to make people think about important things as here how far do you go to protect your life even if it is a bit rotten against unexpected disaster maybe you tell lies maybe you ignore your loved ones' lies that can wear a lot of people out br br american movies on this theme are abundant but they usually go much further by involving the use of firearms which are not a part of everyday life here in europe br br maybe we're not so exciting over here but we don't expect slogan like film titles for films that are not aimed at a massive public
<START> the reason why i gave this movie a 4 was for a couple reasons but this movie was not that bad first off the editing i found too be pretty poor at times the script or what they had of one was not very good and if not for la bianca the acting would have been crap but all that aside ha ha i know its like the whole movie its not that bad for an extremely low ind low budget film if they would have gotten more money a little better actors but these ones were intimidating so it was good and a little more detailed script this movie would be terrific somebody has to tell me this guy was influenced a lot by the warriors by walter hill i mean this movie is exactly like it anyone who has seen both those films will agree with me
<START> it is always difficult to bring a 450 pages book down to a three hours film i read the book before and i found the bbc production dealing with this difficulty in the best way possible the qualities of the book haven't been lost the dense and lively depiction of a patchwork family in london in the 1860s the cold and obscene cruelty in which maud is brought up the characterization of different social groups by different ways of speaking the unexpected and surprising twists of the story the way the film makes the spectators look different at the same scenes when they are told first from sue's point of view then from one the main actors do very good and especially the growing love between the two women is convincingly developed with a first culmination in a very tender love scene between the two and finally forgiving all the evil they were ready to do and did to each other because they still love each other br br for each of her books the author sarah waters has thoroughly investigated what life was like in british 19th century while in tipping the velvet it was the world of the vaudeville theaters and the beginning of social movements in affinity the dreadful reality of women penitentiaries and the fashionable evocation of spirits in she depicts the public ceremony of hanging people in london and the inhuman treatment of persons supposed or declared disturbed in asylums based on the reading of sources and scientific research this is very well transferred to the film so that the corresponding scenes show a high grade of historic truth i highly recommend this film production because it offers three hours of colorful victorian atmosphere vivid emotions and suspense
<START> this is a classic movie that dramatizes the plight of a man who cannot adjust to changes taking place in society and feels more and more alienated which leads to violence joe is a worker and he is dissatisfied and angry and all he is needs is a pretext to lash out which is what the story is about alone joe is quiet together with someone else he becomes lethal and what makes the character of joe even more chilling is that he fully his violence so that to him it's not only not bad it's necessary for joe projects his own violent tendencies onto those who he considers the enemy and therefore considers himself to be in a war and in this movie the generation gap is portrayed as a war but it is a war in joe's mind only because the enemy in this case is in his imagination nobody wants to fight joe but joe feels he must defend himself although this movie was released in 1970 it's message is as relevant now as it was then as society continues to undergo major changes which lead to the kind of intense alienation that the movie effectively dramatizes
<START> tipping the velvet 2002 tv was directed by geoffrey sax for bbc television the basic plot is a coming of age story for the protagonist nan played well by rachael stirling as a teenager nan works in her family run oyster house everyone expects her to stay at home then marry an appropriate husband and settle down to family life nan expects this too br br everything changes when nan meets kitty butler hawes a beautiful and talented performer who dresses in men's clothes and captures the hearts of her audience the audience includes nan who is sexually attracted to kitty in a way in which she's not attracted to her boyfriend br br the remainder of the film follows nan to london and through her ups sort of and her downs horrible as a lesbian and sometimes male impersonator br br as is typical for the bbc every role no matter how small is performed by an excellent actor the bbc has a depth and breadth of performing artists that is truly marvelous none of the supporting actors stands out in my mind they were uniformly good both stirling and hawes are wonderful and their acting carries the film along br br it's always sad to be reminded of how difficult life can be for someone who doesn't fit society's mold for what is normal i know it isn't easy for lesbians even in the u s even today imagine the obstacles to love and happiness for lesbians in victorian england we've come a long way but we still have a long way to travel
<START> an intelligent summation of cold war era mutually assured destruction policy up until the conclusion it's a all russians and chinese are obliterated from the face of the earth saw this one at the 27th annual science fiction marathon january 2002
<START> i hate to comment on something i didn't finish but if i spare one person what i sat through for almost an hour before turning it off in disgust it will be worth it br br i decided to watch this with an open mind knowing it was on the bottom 100 br br bad idea i usually love crude humor or can at least tolerate it i love so called black comedies i'm not easily offended either br br it started off okay and quickly went downhill i laughed a few times for example when the main character got stuck in the airplane toilet but that was it and didn't compensate for the strong disgust i felt br br i didn't laugh when the dog got sucked into a jet engine i usually can't see the humor in animals dying except in animal house i didn't laugh at much else of the nastiness either i turned it off after an incident involving a blind man and a baked potato that i don't care to repeat the details of only that the wave of nausea still hasn't passed over me br br simply put it was smut filled and simply not funny with barely any plot this is one of the times when if you don't have something nice to say you should get the word out br br don't say i didn't warn you
<START> the title although singular will undoubtedly remind real horror fans of tod browning's immortal classic about a troop of circus freaks and how they were misunderstood by the outside world i can assure you however that this thing has absolutely nothing to do with freaks or even with the art of professional film making in general this movie was recommended to me supposedly because it's raw disturbing and thought provoking despite the low budget production values yeah rightÂ the person who recommended it to me may now consider himself to be my personal foe the low budget factor is correct but that about sums it up freak is dreadfully slow poorly made and every character that gets introduced is downright that includes the freak too two siblings on their way to a new life encounter a deformed mental patient who escaped from the transport truck to another hospital and heads back to the house where he killed his mother at age 9 this could have been an interesting slasher with good isolated filming locations but instead tyler sharpe decided to make it boring and pointless family drama the lead actress' attempts to look emotionally devastated are pretty laughable and the total lack of suspense and action can hardly be blamed to the limited budget total failure
<START> everything about this film is simply incredible you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child br br i do feel it is important to note this tale is about child abuse don't rent it for your kids thinking it is a fun disney esque film
<START> i liked this movie i'm not a big horror movie buff so i couldn't comment on similarities between this and other movies of this genre but i found this movie quite captivating the story line albeit a little obvious had some genuinely scary tense moments and the acting of the lead female role wasn't bad in anyway br br overall i'm a little surprised at the low rating this movie has gotten i watch a lot of movies working in a video store tends to help and this really isn't as bad as people seem to think i do have some criticism though the final call from the cop was terrible almost overacted the dead girl in the bathroom looked liked she was having a little sleep probably from the amount of tequila she mentioned she drank and the children's reaction to what was happening instilled in me the hope that they were ultimately killed br br hope this helps some people
<START> there's considerable amount of money behind this production so the look of it is very good it includes some interesting appearances by gilbert roland eddie burns and a brief cameo at the beginning by christopher lee there are a few exciting gunfights and a humorous bit or two the satire on django the man with no name and is amusing especially when they are given the names of failed presidents of the mexico revolution br br the trouble is there isn't any purpose in satirizing the spaghetti western as is attempted here the key element in the spaghettis is irony which easily blends into comedy in fact the source of all is kurosawa's yojimbo which is universally recognized as one of the great black comedies of all time and most spaghettis easily slipped over the edge into real comedy of a very sophisticated variety perhaps the best evidence of this is found in the trinity films which are both openly spaghettis and openly slap stick comedy so why bother satirizing a genre that by its very nature satirizes itself consequently i found the whole enterprise essentially unconvincing none of these characters were people i would ever care about the story was generically clichÃ© and the production values only reflected the money involved not the passion of the director over all a banal and futile effort to cash in on the phenomenon it mocks
<START> bought for Â£1 project vampire is one of the worst movies i have ever seen wooden acting lame effects and a terrible storyline all add up to be a movie you have no reason to even want to see pv is one of those movies that don't even have the good grace to be bad in an enjoyable way instead this bile seems to try to make itself as offensively dull stupid and crap as humanly possible br br a vampire has created a serum he sells to old people as a life enhancer and those who take it fall under his control a former lab intern teams up with a nurse to try and stop him someone should have stopped the makers of this rubbish br br no one has any reason to see this movie and i am actually appalled at the human race on the grounds that at time of writing 2 people have given this atrocity 10 out of 10
<START> i haven't seen the more recent which is based on this but i'd bet on this one as the better creation i know of no other movie that has so well portrayed the intricate tragedies of the drug trade and the 'war on drugs i've watched this one at least four times and am enjoying it again as part of masterpiece theatre's 30th anniversary presentations
<START> hard justice is an excellent action movie the whole movie is really nothing but shooting and fighting for the people who say they don't make shoot em ups like they use to well this one is really hard core david bradley is really good and his character takes a pounding in the movie he gets hit by the stick over a dozen times gets stabbed in the back and is in a coma for three days and then wakes up and fights again gets beat up recovers and is ready for more action his character is incredibly tuff charles napier was very good as well and he arguably steals the show wells was good professor toru tanaka had a short and an uncredited role in hard justice as for the action it is truly awesome with all of the gun fights and the huge stand off like scene in the beginning has cars getting blown up and flipping up in mid air there is so much that happens in the 95 minute run time for the action fans you will be blown away by all of the fire power and fighting that this film has to offer hard justice is a movie that isn't easy to locate and if you are at a video store and you see it for sale buy it up because this movie is big keeper an d plus the box is cool there is a ton of action that has to be seen to be believed look and see if you can find some good deals on ebay half com amazon com's z shops and market place sellers i strongly recommend that any action movie fan who loves shoot and fighting movies and has been disappointed by other movies that have the look like a true non stop action flick but fails to deliver it to get hard justice
<START> it happens often while growing up a hollywood movie impresses a youth it not only lasts a lifetime but inspire him to study ancient cultures as a career such was the case with the 1954 film entitled the egyptian audience were awed with the sets costumes and great acting of this film so much so other films soon followed in like vain this is the story of a young egyptian boy who was left parent less soon after he was born with such a dubious beginning it is not hard to wonder why he will spend his life asking questions the boy sin oh way which means 'he that is alone' edmund purdom grows to manhood and continues asking why even as he graduates from the school of life to become a physician during his formative years he acquires a lifelong friend named brilliantly played by peter ustinov and victor mature who raises from a simple officer of the guard to commander of the armies his life offers everything from a quick rise in social status to condemned criminal to outcast a wondering healer and eventually to a station in life he never expected fine acting goes to jean simmons as merit michael wilding as bella as the temptress and john carradine as a memorable grave robber tommy rettig plays the son of the egyptian in his final years 'he that is alone ' finally discovers the answer he had been seeking all his life which he to his son now in the care of his lifelong friend excellent film
