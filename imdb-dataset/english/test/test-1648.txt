<START> cult director lucio fulci is probably most famous for his gory zombie flicks from the 1980s that earned him his rightful reputation as the godfather of gore fulci's absolute greatest film however dates back to 1972 and while it is definitely gritty and violent it is not nearly as gory as many of his other films non si sevizia un paperino aka don't torture a duckling of 1972 is not only by far fulci's greatest film this tantalizing and utterly brilliant giallo is one of the absolute highlights of the genre the stunning atmosphere and tantalizing suspense the great setting the intriguing story the brilliant performances or the intense moments of sheer shock i don't know what to praise most about this ingenious giallo don't torture a duckling truly delivers cinematic perfection in every aspect which makes it an absolute masterpiece of italian horror cinema br br contrary to other gialli it is not seductive beauty queens who are slain one by one but little boys who fall victims to a killer on the loose bodies of little boys are found in rural sicily while the police are desperately searching for the killer the little town is basically full of strange people and the townsfolk are screaming for a culprit br br the film is stunningly suspenseful and uncompromising from the very beginning with a gritty dark and constantly tense atmosphere that has yet to find an equal the acting performances are among the best in italian horror cinema tomas one of my personal all time favorite actors is excellent in the lead as journalist andrea who is investigating the crimes sexy barbara bouchet delivers both eye candy and a brilliant performance equally outstanding performances come from irene papas and florinda bolkan who is utterly brilliant in her role the great score by riz ortolani brilliantly intensifies the suspense and atmosphere and the film is ingeniously shot in fascinating sicilian landscapes although not as gory as many other fulci films this film is definitely gritty and uncompromising in its violence with a few shockingly brutal scenes br br don't torture a duckling has everything brilliant horror requires this is not quite as easy to get hold of as most other fulci flicks but i assure that searching it will pay off any horror fan must see this personal favorite of mine and i highly recommend any true lover of film in general not to miss this a masterpiece
<START> i took my family to see barnyard this past weekend we had so looked forward to it but had my kids not been there my husband and i would have left coming from a farming community we found the fact that all of the male in the film having drawn on them was a little disturbing we felt like we were watching cross dressing cows or something it was just odd to hear a male voice come from a female body after checking some of the production notes on a different website i felt like the animators might have slipped up on this fact i know this is just an animated humorous show but by putting female body parts on a male i had to suspend my disbelief so much that i just couldn't enjoy the movie like i might have i know can be found funny but they were definitely over used none of the other animals in the movie seemed to have gender specific body parts drawn on them and i would have preferred the bulls in this show to at least have the correct ones if they had to be drawn on at all the kids however still enjoyed the movie though we took the time afterward to make sure they knew the difference between bulls and cows
<START> the dvd version we bought had sandra bullock on the cover but we've discovered it was a picture of her from another movie unfortunately she is in this movie very little you can however see how far she has come br br the one other bright spot in the movie besides her very small part were a few of the location scenes shot in nyc and new jersey in the 1980s br br the sound is terrible sometimes the background noise is so loud that the dialog is difficult to hear sometimes the dialog has been redone without any background noises at all which is disconcerting for example sometimes when they are in the car the noises from the car are too loud and then suddenly there is absolutely no extra noise at all the director is fond of close ups on faces and then it's clear that the movie has been over dubbed because the words don't match the lip movements through most of the movie the voices sound like the people are speaking into a tin can br br background music when there is music is distracting instead of adding to the movie br br the direction is laughable goofy camera angles and sound effects make the movie look like a joke especially during times when there is supposed to be tension like in the middle of gun battles the writing is terrible there are some subplots that make no sense and most of the characters come off looking very stupid because there is no explanation at all to their motivations the writer director tries to explain some of the relationships between the men that were together in vietnam but none of it makes sense these top assassins and former soldiers don't seem to be able to see other people's shadows or hear other people moving the actors go from calm to panic and back to calm again without any warning it's simply a combination of bad directing and bad writing br br the production values are so bad that at first we thought we had stumbled on someone's student film that just happened to have sandra bullock in it if you like laughing at really poorly done student films then this movie is for you otherwise avoid this movie
<START> wow what a wonderful film making mr im has done it again br br his last work 2000 was a great film but this one is even greater selected as an official feature film in the festival for the second time in a two year row this 66 years old director is getting better and better at what he is making of with a korean culture br br simply is about a great korean painter ' jang seung up' who was considered as a prodigy in the late nineteenth century the basic story of this film tells the life of jang seung up and the historical background of his time he was an orphan but in his teens he was picked up by a noble man called kim moon this mr kim becomes a mentor of jang as well as life long friendship and continues to support his great talent that he knew in the first place with jang's great effort and natural talent his fame grows faster and faster as the strength of his country korea falls down br br jang's personality portrayed in the film is very complicated and one of the best actors in korea choi min goes deep inside of jang's soul suffering eyes reveal the struggle of a great artist's life he is very serious sometimes but all of sudden he changes to a wild maniac he drinks like an alcoholic and sleeps with anytime even he said in the movie without an alcohol and a woman i can't draw an alcohol and women are my only inspirations in the peak of the fame to his own style he travels all around the country and never gives up his pride as an artist for the authority or money i don't want to give out every details but i think you surely did get some ideas about the film br br the most amazing thing about this film is a cinematography it is just so breath taking how they captured every beauty of landscapes yes each scene is like a work of jang's painting and the script is perfect too it mainly deals a deeper meaning of what makes a true artist for example kim advices to jang in the movie that 'before one holds a paintbrush one has to set an aim in life' this is very moving and inspiring line and there are many more br br go see this film if you are going to be in the festival br br will be the greatest film ever made that deals with the life of a painter in film history
<START> wow i just got one watching this br br how crappy post production is on this movie br br i kid you not i literally could've done a better job myself br br all of post production is flawed all of it whoever cut this film should be banned from the film industry br br that aside the script was a trainwreck absolute br br not to mention jack bauer and his patchy the pirate in spongebob accent wtf is his character doing there but to me the biggest flaw of all was character development dynamics dialogue wow i cant believe how bad it was br br i give this movie a 2 out of 10 1 for samantha who is a great actress too bad the production made everyone look like amateurs out there br br the other 1 goes to cinematography which was indeed good br br other then that my friend this is one bad movie br br i don't even feel like making an elaborate post on this it was just horrible production poor actors didn't know what they were getting into
<START> what is enjoyable about watching random movies at random times is that one never quite knows what to expect or where the next great piece of cinema will emerge recently my viewing has taken the form of stapled classics like raging bull or raiders of the lost ark but this time my vcr took me away from modern conveniences and plopped me right down in front of lionel the railway children this is a skillfully directed film about three youthful children a mysterious event with their father relocation to the open fields of england and eventually the rewards inherited by merely waving at trains at first glance this seemingly simple children's film doesn't seem all that hopeful as it has been lost on vhs rarity for some time but within the first fifteen minutes of this film one realizes that it is more than just your common place children's movie Â railway children was created during a time when purity was more than just saying no when family meant everything and where adventure was ready for you around every railroad track bend this is more than an adorable film it has amazing cinematic techniques used it keeps the regular viewer glued to the screen with unanswered questions and gives three perfect companions to follow along this 110 minute voyage railway children is a lost treasure that needs to be seen by families and film aficionados alike br br there are several moments that stand out proudly in railway children that transform this from mediocrity to excellence Â one happens to be our three children bobby phyllis and peter modern cinema assures us that these three children cannot provide ample darkness laughter and insight into the world surrounding them but children prove otherwise from intelligently spoken lines both from acting and the script to sincere kindness and dedication to this small village all the way to the final meeting at that train stop these children are more than just child stars advancing a story they are leading us with emotion persuasion and a realism unseen by today's children there is more imagination packed in this small vhs than i have witnessed in film for years a favorite scene that could have been handled with generality of which i have seen in other films was the birthday scene for bobby the way that jeffries floats her between guests and gifts was exciting and refreshing keeping our eyes excited about each scene as well as our mind another scene that captured my attention was when the children were working on gifts for perks when asking one man for a gift jeffries has him merely state no i will not i don't like perks the children's reaction is hilarious Â providing moments for both children and adults to enjoy throughout filmed in the 1970s this tiny feature provides genuine laughs than most modern comedies it is a creative film coupled with great choreography and direction br br that is to say as much as i loved this film it wasn't perfect jeffries does a great job of keeping us guessing as to what happened to father but it did feel like the event occurred the children were kept in the dark and it suddenly resolved itself by the end more detail to father not much more would have solidified his character and given us the opportunity to see more of the children's reaction also there is one scene in this film one of those grandiose wide screen shots of the english countryside that is just breath taking but when looking a bit closer you happen to see cars in the background it made me chuckle but didn't distract too much from the overall picture cinema like this is sorely missed today and oddly it seems that only the british have the gumption to produce it films like love actually or vicar of dibley demonstrates the power and excitement for community towns places where everyone knows everyone and we aren't afraid to be neighborly this is more of a theme that american audiences could have more of Â more understanding of what is happening outside instead of remaining secluded to your own events br br overall i loved railway children i didn't know what to expect when i first put it in the vhs player but from the opening scene to the exploding train set to perks birthday jeffries proved that he could handle the most child friendly story with ease his ability to make the child actors feel like real characters to involve the adults less and to involve the children like they were adults was outstanding this is a film to be viewed as a strong alternative to anything disney releases the continually occurring themes of friendship kindness to strangers and forgiveness blasts through the tv with grace and power railway children is more than just a kid's film it is a feature that should be a staple to modern audience viewing not only does it give a great visual to the english countryside but it also teaches and shows how life would be greater with an emphasis on imagination and courage instead of fighting any cgi bad guys br br grade Â½ out of
<START> what should have been a routine babysitting gig at a secluded lake house turns into a night of terror as high school student jill johnson camilla belle receives threatening phone calls from a sadistic stalker while trying to stay one step ahead of him br br the first 20 minutes of the original film were pretty good but it was all downhill from there the remake takes those first 20 minutes and stretches them into an 80 minute feature film that's a good idea because its eliminating everything that made the original bad however if they wanted this film to work more effectively then they should have hired a better lead actress better director writer etc there's no suspense everything can be figured out long before it happens and it's a very dull film since not much happens at least there isn't much to sit through since its less than 90 minutes br br if this premise were to work then the lead actress has to give a realistic performance camilla belle gives one of the worst performances i have ever seen and throughout the whole movie she seemed to be reading her lines you get a lead role in a hollywood film that will be viewed by millions of people and you give no effort at all why did they hire this girl sure she's pretty but she can't act at all yet i suppose this won't matter to the target audience who will most likely eat this film up the rest of the cast is bland and forgettable especially the woman who plays the maid rosa even the stranger was lame and his lines on the phone were not effective at all br br this movie reminds me of last years disappointing horror film boogeyman that movie was a bunch of cheap scares and false alarms and when a stranger calls is pretty much the same jill enters a room because she hears a noise but its just a false alarm like a cat or the maid this type of scene happens over and over again until finally after about 50 minutes the stranger appears he has to be one of the lamest killers ever he carried no weapons and didn't seem to pose much of a threat the ending is bad but it matches the rest of the film so it doesn't really matter the film is directed by simon west and he is really bad at building up suspense he was using every clichÃ© he could think of and the results weren't very good the house was amazing and i'll give the film credit for that it was an isolated house so it was pretty creepy but that's about the only good thing this film has to offer in the end if you're not a teenage girl then you should skip the movie rating 2 10
<START> how much do i love this film now i'm not a fan of bad films but i do love a film that is so bad it's good this is one of those juan pablo di pace has a great butt looks fab on screen and definitely doesn't make a bad turn at his acting debut i believe billy zane is suitably mean and moody though i still constantly feel that there is something more in him i felt it in titanic the look on his face when la winslet spat on him for example totally broken shocked and put down fierce kelly brook is a pretty face no seriously i think that's it it's worth catching this to see one really hot guy some big bra fillers from brook nasty growling from billy laugh at the dialogue revel in the scenery and madness of the whole affair i'm gona go watch it again now yes i bought it
<START> in reunion island in the indian ocean the owner of a cigarette factory louis jean paul belmondo is engaged through correspondence with julie and he does not know her when julie arrives in the island to get married with louis he waits for her in the docks but louis does not recognize julie in the passenger vessel and finds that she is totally different from the picture she had sent to louis they get married and louis shares his bank accounts with her when julie's sister writes a letter to louis asking her sister to write to her louis discovers that the woman is not julie that is missing further he finds that the woman has cleared his bank accounts and left the island louis and julie's sister hire an efficient private detective michel bouquet and louis travels to france seeking the woman but he has a nervous breakdown in nice and is submitted to an intense sleeping therapy in a clinic he recovers and finds that the woman actually marion catherine deneuve works in the phoenix club in and lives in the low budget monorail hotel louis breaks in her room and when she arrives from the club she tells that she was happy with him but her former dangerous lover richard had blackmailed her louis is still in love with marion and escapes with her to the countryside but is chasing marion in france accused of murdering julie br br la du mississipi is a film noir by the great director writer franÃ§ois truffaut with an unconventional love story of passion murder and love that hurts the femme fatale catherine deneuve is astonishing probably in the top of her beauty and is delightful to see her face and the topless scenes on the road and in the room jean paul belmondo is very athletic and the sequence when he escalates the wall of the hotel is impressive catherine deneuve makes this film worth and gives credibility to the passion and lust of louis my vote is eight br br title brazil a do mississipi the mississippi mermaid
<START> the filmmakers try to paint the influence of the and robert parker as a travesty on par with the german occupation of france and the reign of fascism but they never find a victim in this film we hear wine makers critics and distributors bemoan that while the wine industry grows it becomes increasingly homogeneous but the film never makes a case that this has resulted in the loss of any good wine or exploitation of any person or culture other than naive wine spectator readers with lots of cash if they want to pay hundreds of dollars for a dull wine so be it br br if this were a film about the diamond trade where the corporation's market domination results in human suffering the style might have been appropriate but as it is it just comes off as anti american anti modernization and anti capitalist had the filmmakers been around in the 1870s they most likely would have protested the grafting of american vines in the effort to save french wine
<START> this could have been a good movie if more things were explained way too many plot holes to find this enjoyable the ending in particular is off left field spoiler alert how did the kidnapper get back to dundee so fast and dundee shows up at the house in a matter of two minutes way out of wack here how did anna get hold of the money no explanation at all if the pete the cop knew lancaster was in danger why didn't he have a cop at the door in the hospital this and many more questions remain too bad because the premise was there just bad writing and execution br br good cast is wasted here decarlo goes from bad to good to bad lancaster's character lacks development and is just blah as the bad guy br br this could re made with a cohesive story line and better writing of course it would be much more violent with lots of gratuitous sex and everything the editing would be jerky as well i guess so let's leave well enough alone
<START> if you are planning to watch 'partner' and are on imdb reading reviews about it you have already wasted too much time over this stupid idiotic awful movie br br it's a horrible horrible horrible copy of the movie ' i choose to ignore all the other warnings and bad reviews i had heard about this movie and wasted a precious 20 minutes on it i thought that after all its david dhawan who is making it and it has govinda how bad can it be but after 20 minutes of watching this nonsense i couldn't take it any more and turned off my computer br br overacting by everyone in the movie stupid dialogues total time waste i gave it a 1 star rating because that's the lowest you can do if i could go lower i would have given it a 100 rating
<START> i was invited to an early screening of the movie about four months before it was released i had to watch the film and later fill out a packet on my thoughts it was the hardest thing to sit through on earth the show just crawls by and you quickly begin wishing you were dead the thing is there are two types of mormon films the good ones with actual good stories and the crappy ones that just plain stink saints and soldiers now there is a good movie but with these wannabe comedies the writers and the actors just try too hard basically they try to be funny when they are not no wonder why there is such a small target audience for these films they're filled with 'inside jokes' that aren't funny to begin with and they just try to poke fun at average things it's the story that makes the movie and the stories for these movies are just weak i bet you can guess what my packet looked like when i was told to fill it out after the movie
<START> the story of how the communist leader who freed the congo from belgium imperialism was eliminated by the western powers through the hand of a story of struggle and injustice of hope and the search of freedom the story could be the one of any african country a very moving film with images full of symbolism and beauty if you have to see only one foreign film this year see this one
<START> totally disgusting and cheap bawdy humor i loved it it is the most disgusting and totally horribly acted film except for nicolas read who plays an un dead court jester to comic brilliance but being that as it may i laughed so many times and i have to hand it to the film makers it wasn't pretentious or ordinary in any way raping fighting zombies on their rape victims what other movie has this not for the but with a pizza a bong and a six pack of beer you got it made if you have a cast iron stomach and a juvenille sense of humor like myself
