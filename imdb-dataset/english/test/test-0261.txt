<START> this is the lamest crappiest idiotic stupid movies i ever saw in my entire life i can't believe there are directors who make these kinds of movies this movie is a disgrace to horror genre acting oh no i couldn't bear it's full of anguish don't ever watch this movie you'll feel like u are being tortured to eternity please save yourself from the horrible fate of watching this movie if you really want to live don't watch it there are very good horror movies br br this movie doesn't deserve tat single vote too but i hate to vote if i want to post my comments
<START> this was alright it was one of those we gotcha but we don't have enough evidence yet storylines in the couple of movies i've seen her in i've never really though much of stephanie zimbalist a professional tv actress she is but nothing really outstanding here in this she was definitely above average as the former fed or was it fed on loan profiler her character got along well with the motley bunch of special investigation unit cops she was assigned with there wasn't really a goofy character you'd roll your eyes at and just despise which was good also good is it takes awhile to know who the murderer is but when i found out i wasn't that surprised oh well one more thing that was good was the los angeles locations quite possibly if this was made today they'd use toronto or vancouver but here they really shot in downtown l a like that a lot even though i semi despise l a liked the movie too i don't know if i'd ever watch it again but it wasn't too bad my grade b
<START> frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere it was well shot but then again it is a big budget movie it was too predictable even for a chick flick i even knew from the beginning that he was going to die in the end the only thing i didn't know was how too politically correct very disappointing the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful but if you want that watch national geographic i love lane but i've never seen her in a movie this lousy as far as gere goes he's a good actor but he had movies like this so i'm not surprised an hour and a half i wish i could bring back
<START> why spend a moment slogging through this awkward and self conscious movie every now and then after an hour of tedious plot and amateur acting we start getting bits and pieces of the big band swing that made tommy and jimmy dorsey separately and together the great musicians they were occasionally in a jam session with art tatum with tommy dorsey and his orchestra doing marie and a standout jimmy dorsey and his orchestra bob and helen o'connell singing green eyes we get a complete song br br unfortunately the movie is in the public domain and the dvd transfer is just as bad as the acting my copy has only four chapter stops that means you can get arthritis in your fast forward finger trying to speed through to where the good stuff is the swamp you're moving through is hollywood's version of the life and battles of the two tommy superb on trombone and jimmy superb on saxophone usually couldn't stand each other in 1935 they finally split with tommy starting his own orchestra each had greater success alone than they had achieved together they reconciled when their father died in the forties which is where the movie ends they later managed to tolerate each other in the orchestra led by tommy as the big band era faded out in the fifties tommy died in 1956 at age 51 vomiting in his sleep after booze pills and a big meal jimmy died of cancer at 53 in 1957 jimmy was hugely talented and from all accounts a reasonably easy going guy tommy was hugely talented and from all accounts often an overbearing jerk but good music makes up for a lot of faults and the big band sounds the two created helped define the swing era br br they play themselves in the movie and we see them develop from tykes with child actors to grown men battling and yammering at each other the movie is lumbered with not just their two parents played by those hollywood irish clichÃ©s sara and arthur shields who just want their boys to get along with each other but also with a major sub story involving a romance between janet blair as a childhood friend of the who becomes a vocalist with them and serves as a nearly full time mediator and enabler and william as a piano player blair is not bad at all however if you want to see why she never became the star she quite probably should have become just look at the films like this one that her studio put her in no wonder she left hollywood simply takes up space br br how bad is this movie other than when we can actually hear the play well here's a song written especially for the movie and given to blair to warble it's called to me br br to me you're the rose of a rosary the rise of a rising sea the glow of a star br br the rose of a rosary the movie doesn't get any better than this and it can't get worse still if you like the and if the price is right well in hindsight i'd still not buy it the highlight for me is and o'connell singing green eyes you can watch them on you tube for free you'll also find there quite a bit of each of the i wish i'd known
<START> i've rent the movie because i'm very fond on war movies and on the cover picture i've read better than save private ryan mmmmm i thought cool guys is just a ridiculous movie almost fun nothing to do with a proper war movie i want my money back why the f k the peoples lies f no subtitles they tried to make everything cooler with the light but they didn't make it sorry about this but the movie is awful the italians are shown as mafia e br br the american as stupid farmer the germans as even more stupid farmer br br the actor are ridiculous and unprofessional br br please please
<START> this very finely crafted film commits the unforgivable which is ironic given the film's theme no one coming into this film knows what they are in for worse than that 3 4 of the way into the film no one still has any clue of what they're in for because everything up to that moment is a different movie br br as a front row fan of first two films easily competing for the best 2 mormon films to date competing with saints and soldiers and now new york doll saw that at a screening had me wanting to see his film for a very long time i was there i wanted to believe believe that i'd see the next great mormon movie one that would hold the numero uno spot for a very long time but no three fourths in the film took the sharpest of left turns and dragged me through something that i never wanted to go through he takes on the mt everest of all moral issues yea both of them with little time or emotional capacity left to adequately address them but instead waves them both off with a nod towards jesus as if that will make all things well instantly true it is that jesus saves don't accuse me of not believing that that's not problem br br is the film shot well indeed do the actors act they acted their pants off was the music appropriate all but whatever was over the closing credits everything about this film was superb except the story which was so dank and wrong that all else doesn't matter i learned dank from new york doll very decent show by the way the third act of the film was neither desirable nor pleasant nor faith affirming i know was bending over backwards to make it so but i was so far shoved out of the movie at that point that nothing no thing could have brought me back the preposterous unbelievability of dozens of details in the final minutes didn't help anyone who's been on a mission knows what i'm talking about especially anyone familiar with events surrounding someone being sent home from a mission early for moral and or psychological reasons it's as if a parallel universe suddenly sprung up where normal rules or behaviors suddenly don't apply br br there are a million things good about this film but they were created and only to be trampled upon and thrown away in a knee jerk fit of ooh this will really get them elitism hence unforgivable i can only hope that when puts the finishing touches on his next film falling apparently that he remembers that film critics can only buy so many tickets and that it's the fans that pay the bills that's why the first god's army was such an unqualified success br br shock and awe approach proves that when it comes to the big issues he is in way over his head having neither the spiritual nor creative maturity nor business sense necessary to take them on i Âhe learns his lesson and that years from now he and we all look back with a chagrin and rejoice that he pulled his head out of where the light doesn't shine and really successfully takes on those and other issues and changes the world forever because of it
<START> i loved this movie when it first came out but i was just 12 years old then and i had forgotten this film existed until one day i found a used copy for sale at a gas station i bought it and i couldn't wait to watch this film that had i loved as a kid and then as i saw this film again many years later it hit me why in the world did i like this film as a kid watching it again as an adult i realized that this film is terrible the saddest part about this film is that they had everything in place to make the greatest western ever and they blew it the costumes are perfect good actors there are 2 music scores the score is wonderful and keeps with the classic spirit of the old timey lone ranger alive the second score is a series of songs by country music like merle and the statler brothers and those songs like the man in the mask are so bad that they are funny this movies strongest point is that it had a briliant storyline and one of the best western plots ever and for a while its fun to watch as john reid is nursed back to health after he and his fellow rangers are ambushed its fun to see him grow into his new life and identity as the lone ranger as he his identity and goes on a revenge run to get the gang responsible for killing his brother and all his fellow rangers to whom he rode with but unfortunatly as good as the storyline is its all ruined by merle haggard narrating everything as you are watching it happen for the love of god why did they do that between merle narration and the statler brothers singing corny stupid songs like ride little cowboy being playing in the make this movie impossible to take serious i would love to see a really good producer take this same script and story and re do this film right because at the heart of this silly film is a great western i would this film as a beautiful woman dress in the ugliest clothing i give it 4 stars out of 10 if your 12 years old and dont know better then you might love it
<START> warning some spoilers ahead br br what an incredibly crappy movie it makes iron eagle 2 seem good br br the story is as follows captain holiday rutger hauer gets shot down by his friend banning robert patrick to stop him from shooting down a iraqi airliner filled with innocent civilians six years later holiday returns to take his revenge among other things he sitting in a tank chases banning now a colonel and his pregnant wife over a field he manages to fire shells and drive the tank at the same time after getting the tank blown up by a bazooka he miraculously survives and steals a fighter jet with it he shoots down a number of allied fighters before attacking the nato headquarters in an attempt to kill banning's wife br br an extra bonus is that major baxter who holiday hangs in her office has put the rank insignia on her right shoulder on backwards elegant
<START> ghoulies iv may not be the best out of the series but it isn't too bad if you don't take it fully serious then you may enjoy it br br it's nice to see peter return as johnathan graves who has gave up using magic and has became a detective but still thinks about what happened in ghoulies br br the plot is about a woman named alexandra that is ex girlfriend that breaks into a museum and takes a red gem using the gem she awakens her boyfriend named faust that is dark side but he needs the gem so he can enter the real world and john is sent to hell br br something goes wrong and alex loses the gem so she needs to find a new one as she leaves the gateway is still open and two little ghoulies named lite and appear they're not the true ghoulies since they look like guys in a troll costume wearing a mask but that doesn't matter since they are humorous in parts br br lite and dark need to find johnathan since he can return them home so they go around causing mayhem as they try to find johnathan another difference is that the two ghoulies are the good guys unlike the ones in the previous films br br i found ghoulies iv to be good but this film may not go for everyone check it out if you like low budget films like troll 2
<START> i truly hate and despise this film and the filmmakers behind it br br sure i'm all for making a hard hitting and honest film about youth and youth culture 1987's river's edge is an excellent example of a well made teen drama however what i take exception to is the infantile grubby and sensationalist approach that the makers of 2 37 took br br a prime example is how it raises so many issues and yet fails in any significant way to comment or reach a resolution on even one of them br br my other major problem with this film apart from its complete plagiarism of gus van sant's elephant surprised van sant didn't sue is its loose in a china shop' attitude to quite delicate issues such as incest and particularly suicide br br in short avoid this film like the plague and anything that this filmmaker ever is involved with subsequently i've heard that his motivation for making 2 37 may or may not be based on lies having seen the substandard result this doesn't surprise me in the slightest this is a glorified student film exercise that has no place whatsoever being in a cinema or on dvd pure and simple
<START> maybe people do like having the devil around more than god maybe we like that safety net of a reason making a mistake only to blame the devil for the pain and suffering in the world there is so much hardship spilling out into the masses that it is difficult to not see the sadness on the faces of all you pass leland p fitzgerald understands all of this he knows that maybe everything won't be ok and maybe helping someone leave this earth to avoid the pain their life has waiting for them is a risk he needs to take for someone he loves credit goes to screenwriter director matthew ryan for creating a lyrical prose about two suburban families who have crossed paths in good times and bad just looking at the cast of almost all a and b list actors shows that the material really resonates with its audience emotions don't need to be worn on one's sleeve to exist sometimes all we want to do is end the suffering br br ryan gosling brings an understated performance to the table here that encompasses the of his character emotions he is a very passionate and intelligent young man cutting through the bs of life knowing what he sees and accepting the worse with the better the film is a catharsis for the souls of those affected by the horrific event of leland killing his ex girlfriend's mentally challenged brother in the confused mind of this teen he goes into the incident knowing full well what he was going to do he was going to stop the pain that he sees everywhere but most of all on the face of young ryan pollard almost immediately he realizes that he has made a mistake that maybe playing god is not a job he has been put on earth to do whether or not this is true will soon be put to debate as the murder begins a chain of events which finally bring meaning to many people's lives as they wake up to the tangential fragility of life this boy has opened their eyes to both sorrow and rebirth br br with haunting ballads sung by former sunny day real estate frontman jeremy the movie goes through a journey of small vignettes of two families' lives in the aftermath of tragedy the acting is superb throughout with special mention to a few for someone who plays the naÃ¯ve lug in most films chris klein actually does well with much the same material here yet also with an evolution into a man of purpose his aloofness is effective when utilized in the right part similar to his success in election and i am interested to see if directors will be allow him to expand his talents and sink his teeth into something more substantial jena malone is effective in much the same effect as well playing the role of troubled youth as she has in donnie darko and life as a house don cheadle is a stalwart of professionalism giving us a different take on the compassionate therapist from the one he did in manic and martin donovan is brilliant as the grieving father trying to keep his wits together and eventually realizing he must keep his family from falling apart as well also it is great seeing the beautiful fenn in a small but important role br br when tragedy hits people band together to get through it all as leland astutely points out at one point you see men and women helping others out and hugging when they see the pain and suffering surrounding them but after a couple of days everything goes back to normal cheadle's character extrapolates the optimistic viewpoint that at least we get a glimpse of people's true nature of wanting to help and be good to each other only to be shot back at with the retort well at least we do during tragedy maybe we don't want to think we are good natured because it does make us feel we should be good all the time and that when bad must have in turn meant to be so by being flawed we allow ourselves to rebound and try again mistake lets him see the love he had for those close to him as well as opening the eyes of others to wake up and not let their loved ones drift any further from them one can't focus on the sadness of others when they must first come to grips with their own has crafted a parable for this and a truly effective piece of film making with hopefully many more to come
<START> i saw this on the sci fi channel so i knew it would be bad to start with but i was surprised at how much worse it was than expected the cg effects on the dragon were terrible even for the sci fi channel and the writing was pathetic i couldn't tell if this was supposed to be that stupid as a joke or if it just came out that way the only redeeming quality of this movie is that it's so terrible it's almost funny especially the part where patrick swayze's knight character goes home to his knight father who has retired after losing his legs and is now bed ridden in his armor for the sole purpose of letting the audience know he was a knight the majority of the movie focuses around an enormous dragon egg that hatches into a not so enormous baby dragon with some of the worst cgi i've ever seen this was just awful
<START> mostly uninvolving biblical mumbo jumbo that drags on for well over two hours the only thing that saves this film from god's wreath and there is only one god remember is the unintentionally funny dialog and a good battle scene which comes far too late in the movie for most of the two hours until the action scenes there is too much talking the dialog is so inept that the movie just begs to be spoofed by mst3k br br george sanders is absolutely awful one of the most animated overly theatrical performances i've ever seen brynner isn't much better his stiff wooden acting combined with the horrendous fortune cookie wisdom utterings make for a rather boring and silly solomon it seems that every time brynner opens his mouth something oh so wise and ridiculously high and mighty comes out to an extent it's not sanders's and fault because of the crappy comical dialog and the typically biblical one dimensional characterization but they made little effort otherwise accent even reminds a bit of schwarzenegger's this is not a plus only lollobrigida manages to avoid embarrassing herself by playing the role with more conviction and in an appropriate way which befits a role in such a silly film to describe these biblical characters as one dimensional would be too give them undeserved credit the characterization is half dimensional
<START> the brilliance of this story delivers at least one skillfully crafted message to each viewer in the audience this story is about success it's about failure it's about the choices you make in life and the choices others make for you the story deals with self realization and determination on a scale so large no camera angle could cover it within the grasp of each scene is resides an element marked for depiction within your imagination keep this in mind as you watch the movie it's more than eye candy the sexually suggestive rarely explicit scenes serve only to distract and entertain you during the tedious process of character development
<START> a bad bad movie terrible plot hinges on bolo charater but he speaks maybe 20 words in the entire movie and only has one fight scene still in great shape considering he was also in the kung fu classic enter the dragon interesting to see william johnny from the karate kid in another martial arts role
