<START> i would suggest that only the valiant is one of the most original and intriguing and in some ways weird movies that peck ever did daring surprising and one of his few best westerns no no of course not a western really but a military chronicle which sometimes is better it's quite but oh very original and striking it's one of those treats a true buff sometimes gets movies that no one yet told you they exist you sounds intriguing or it surpasses your expectations br br all in all the script shows a level of maturity unusual for the it somehow reminded me obliquely of it's also straight suspense br br peck looked dashing as a young and tough somewhat gloomy and stoic officer and there are many unexpected the blonde babe kissing and flirting with the one she's decided not to marry perhaps a feeling of hers for justice and retribution Â br br even only Â is so much more than a military is as well an action drama a suspense movie a commando action weirdest combo imaginable a bunch of soldiers in a special mission to counteract and stop a possible attack Â the insane decision not to take all the available troops to the place where those natives could be only a handful of people Â and this plot never takes a crap most would and did Â the interest for humans for people and their reasons and actions never falters br br a due word about peck himself he performs with brio and though i usually find his famous movies to be rather insipid and boring in such small outings i find intact all peck's somber and even chilling glamor he was an unusual star br br i gladly recommend this extraordinary movie
<START> let's begin by acknowledging that there are arguably three types of horror films good bad and utterly embarrassing reels that make the entire genre suffer in every way dark harvest promises big with its artisan dvd cover but rest assured that is where the show stops following a grueling opening montage we soon discover that the film consists of a very poorly written script extremely under qualified even for a beginners film acting disastrous lighting and even worse special effects seriously could no one afford anything more than a mask for the villain or did they just think it was good enough for jason voorhees and michael myers so it's good enough for us well it did not work at all to create a scary villain at any rate this is one of the movies that make you check your watch sigh and curse your own gullibility the timing in every scene is painful and the entire production has a middle school feeling to it come to think of it i have seen better middle school stage productions right down to the special effects i'm trying to think of some way to end this review on a positive note so let me suggest that all copies of this train wreck be donated as drink coasters frisbees wind chimes i'd say go see your yourself but that would just be cruel br br check out the rest of this production company's reviews and you'll find the same for every one of their movies they claim to honor the contract between film and audience i e please the fans but all they have done is chuckle and dumped a load on our heads for the cash of which i am sure they saw very little for this br br sorry people the high ratings and favorable reviews are obviously posted by those either directly or indirectly connected to this travesty br br 1 star out of 10 because it is the lowest possible rating giving it even one makes me angry
<START> the last sentence of this review is a major spoiler br br i have enjoyed joe dante's work since piranha he's done a great deal of different genre parodies that were both funny and honest br br but this is pure crap this is the kind of satire in line with thank you for smoking that is so literal and direct that it leaves nothing a to be laughed at and b to leave the audience to think about br br it's a shame because the plot and the material is so rich timely and ripe for intelligent commentary br br by the way there is absolutely no reason for the main character to shoot the ann coulter character at the end of the film it's just flat out ridiculous
<START> billed as a romantic comedy set against the early years of wwii it fails to deliver the problem is that while beautifully photographed it has no consistent story line or narrative starting as a murder mystery it offers no hope to its actors as it meanders through recent history depardieu is wasted in a trivial role he obviously is not comfortable with playing adjani cannot carry the picture the hero is not obviously an imitation of a hitchcock wrongly accused role it lacks balance neither heroic comic nor suspenseful br br this could have been a good film i am reminded of the lady vanishes which did combine suspense romance and comedy in a serious film dealing with fascism
<START> this is a big disappointment the main problem is the acting le is pretty poor as fanny and the rest are not much better everybody is very stilted and unnatural also the camerawork is very 1980's ie cramped and jumpy compared with the likes of 1995's p p for example br br the script is if anything too faithful to the book and there are some cringe worthy expressions that should have been cut br br in every way this is far inferior to the recent film version which though it took huge liberties with the book seemed far more faithful to the spirit of the book and was far more enjoyable
<START> rudy rae moore is getting out of prison and getting revenge often referred to as the godfather of rap he should also be the godfather of great movies the non stop action will keep you on the edge of your seat and will leave you begging for more luckily rudy comes back as dolemite in human tornado so sit back relax and have the rewind button ready because you won't believe your eyes
<START> i survived the first hour of this and came back for the last ten minutes just to say i saw the end if you want real mythology flawlessly executed look for armand the odyssey great storytelling doesn't need to be tweaked the stories are fantastic on their own i only hope sean astin needed the money and sophocles and ovid must be whirling in their graves wherever those may be br br at least with version the tongue was poked relentlessly in cheek we knew it was mostly but perhaps enough interest was generated in the backstory to send someone to the library i'm surprised could turn out something so amusing the tv series and follow it with something so devoid of quality
<START> yes it's a fast times wannabe but it's still decent entertainment br br some of the comedy parts are really funny the scene when the three guys visit the spanish lady is hilarious with a little flamenco music in the background the reaction when her sailor husband comes home is a riot the guys' exploits in dealing with crabs are funny as well when they try to drown them and when they visit the pharmacist br br the abortion scene is a fast times ripoff too but it does do a good job of capturing the terror of the situation you really feel for what karen is going through and for gary in his mad scramble for cash to pay for the abortion and accommodating her recovery br br the ending is painful to watch but refreshingly realistic first time viewers will not be prepared for it and it will be a shock br br there is a decent eye candy for guys with young girls and the milf spanish lady but heterosexual guys will probably want to skip the penis measuring competition br br underrated soundtrack too check out early early u2 the cars in their prime and an appropriate tearjerker song by james ingram for the surprise ending br br some people will hate it and it is somewhat dated but those who like teen flicks or grew up in the early 80s should like it
<START> submerged is definitely not the worst movie ever it does have its flaws such as borrowed footage crazy script and non existent special effects these are the worst but it also has some good points too the acting is surprisingly good there are lots of familiar faces whom you probably know if a b movie fan like me br br i was very glad to see brent huff playing one of the heroes knowing him mostly for his 80's action films and i must admit he is not a bad actor at all fred williamson maxwell caulfield tim thomerson get some limited screen time but are believable in their parts the eye candies in this fred olen ray movie are yvette nipar and nicole eggert both looking very sexy and very mean michael bailey smith adds some muscle to the background as a navy seal unfortunately the only cast member who in my opinion is completely out of place is coolio he doesn't act at all talks like he didn't even read the script and being a badass in the beginning of the movie gets shot like a wimp a hour later not a good choice br br to sum this movie up this is not such a bad choice for late night entertainment if you can get over the special effects thing so many guns so much fire and not a single wound on anyone coolio's annoying performance and the recycled footage from airport 77 you might like this no brainer after all
<START> la esteban argentina 2005 br br a completely unique take on silent cinema in this fairy tale like story by esteban beautifully shot in black and white and practically without dialog la is a feast for the eye and a must for lovers of german expressionist cinema with most of the nods to the works of fritz lang and friedrich murnau br br 'the city without a voice' 'la sin is ruled by mr tv he has taken the inhabitants voices and is in total control of all spoken words and images forcing everyone to eat his own brand of tv food mr tv is not just a monopolist he is the personification of evil and totalitarianism even the swastika appears as a symbol a number of times he secretly works on a hypnotizing device to control all the citizens minds through his television broadcasts for this purpose he kidnaps the only one left with the voice a beautiful singer but a tv repairman witnesses the kidnapping and flees to an old tv antenna in the mountains in order to halt mr tv's evil plans br br the production design is stunning with beautiful sets and imagery although shot primarily with the basic language of silent cinema esteban also adds a number of fresh techniques of his own like a combination of typographic and animation techniques everyone talks with each other through text balloons usually floating near their mouths the louder they talk the larger the characters the texts themselves can be pushed away or crushed in the opening sequence we see a book titled la that opens and a city of paper rises from the pages there are hardly any references to argentina it's constantly snowing which gives the film a very un feel while the surreal setting suggests any large city in the hemisphere with only some of the songs revealing the film's argentinian background br br the pace is swift and there is so much happening on screen it's hard to keep track of the film's surreal narrative not only breathtakingly beautiful to look at we're also given a few messages about media monopolies corruption and totalitarianism but they are packaged one of the most original films i've seen in years a delight br br the film was shown as the opening film at the iff rotterdam 2007 br br camera obscura 9 10
<START> i usually like period films but this one just seemed to drag and drag i'd perk up during rupert graves' scenes but vanessa redgrave just put me to sleep br br i was disappointed in the film it lacked a little punch at the end that i'd hoped it would have
<START> in fact parts of it i liked a lot it had some interesting twists but it just left me with a been there seen that feeling after all of the saw movies granted the ending was different from a typical saw but let's face it a group of guys unknown to each other or so they believe tossed together in an abandoned chemical factory br br but then it loses something there's no intensity there's poor group dynamic there's no sense of urgency br br some nice twists at the end and definitely worth a watch if there's nothing else on your plate but it just left me empty it passed the time but it didn't satisfy
<START> ask a thousand people what the greatest unintentional comedy of all time is and they will almost invariably tell you battlefield earth or plan 9 from outer space they're wrong american ninja has those two turkeys beat down for a number of reasons not the least of which being a script that was quite clearly not thought through while i fully support the b picture industry for keeping slobs like michael dudikoff in work a little work on the product would have gone a long way br br for those who give a rat's posterior my next few paragraphs will give away significant parts of the plot br br first of all when we are given some background information on the titular hero we are told his date of birth next of kin parents and so forth are all unknown i don't know about you but i expect the us army to take fact finding about its personnel a little more seriously they also manage to screw up the continuity of dates quite effectively although i don't remember quite which dates were screwed up and when this is actually one of american less obvious flaws br br it has been pointed out before but a common failing of many martial arts films is that when our heroes are confronted by large numbers of antagonists said antagonists attack one at a time more recent films such as the matrix reloaded defy this convention but just about every film from the 1980s has the audience screaming hey why don't you attack all at once martial arts films tend to be a lot more impressive when the fights are more extensive than one on one br br the central premise was originally a joke but in light of recent events where the us army cannot crush a mob of insurgents simply because they won't delegate to the specialists it seems strangely ironic are stealing weapons from the us army's local division for sale to wealthy clients never mind that such a theft would prompt the army to give the local businessmen responsible or even believed responsible an aerial rectal exam this is a cheesy 1980s action film after all br br by far the funniest part of the film is the climactic battle however as joe and jackson turn combining posing and fighting into an art form evil ninjas start to explode for no readily apparent reason i agree with one previous commentator in that this film should have been called ninja holocaust because i'm willing to bet a total of at least three hundred evil ninjas bite it during the film's running time on top of that the black star ninja starts fighting with rocket launchers laser beams and all sorts of ridiculous implements that are not only poorly thought out they're flat out poorly executed you'll never see a laser beam effect that looks cheaper br br what tops it all off is that the film takes itself so damned seriously during the scene when joe is meeting up again with his old mentor i dare the viewer not to laugh at the hideous dialogue not that i know any modern of ninjitsu but the logical part of my imagination has a hard time believing that they have spoken like this at any time in their history during this mentoring scene i half expect the old guy to tell joe he must prove his manhood by cutting his own head off with a blunt plastic spoon br br in all i gave american ninja a 1 this is a special score in my system in that it is reserved for the worst most appalling most offensive films i've ever seen or films that make me laugh without even bothering to try american ninja is definitely an example of the latter
<START> this movie was nothing like the book i think the writer of the screenplay must have wanted the job of writing the sequel to gone with the wind and been turned down this was his or her way of getting their ideas in anyway the only similarity between this movie and the story it was portraying was the names of the principle characters and the location of the main action none of the events that are shown in the movie happened that way in the book for a gone with the wind fan of both the book and the movie this was deeply disappointing if you loved the book scarlett don't watch this movie hoping to see it played out on the screen they only share the title in common
<START> i watched cold mountain and the english patient again this weekend the former is a civil war melodrama about jude law a confederate soldier who deserts the army to return to ada monroe nicole kidman a girl he barely knows both films were lovingly directed by anthony who does an exceptional job although cold mountain is very good it could have been a great movie with the right casting and less folksy backwoods dialog br br romantic epics need a convincing heroine the english patient had kristin scott thomas who was perfectly cast as the smart alluring and beautiful katherine clifton the main problem with cold mountain is ada who seems silly and dim witted and lacks that quality would make you believe that could become obsessed after one kiss as an actress kidman has a limited range she usually plays stern faced women who face adversity with stoicism kidman was also too old to play the ingÃ©nue and law's love interest the film needed a young actress who could play charming warm and vulnerable for someone who was supposedly enduring hardship and near starvation she seemed ridiculously well fed and over dressed kidman was so impeccably groomed that it looked like she had spent three hours getting made up for each scene michele pfieffer in her younger days could have played the part perfectly even natalie portman would have been an improvement br br renee was more appropriately attired but her animated performance chewed the scenery but maybe she was trying to compensate for kidman jude law was in his own silent movie in the odysseus role but played his part well ray winstone was excellent as the london southern villain br br during the civil war people were probably not very well educated by today's standards and maybe they did speak in monosyllables however if you watch bbc adaptations of dickens austen or mrs everyone is articulate maybe this is unrealistic but it would improved my entertainment
