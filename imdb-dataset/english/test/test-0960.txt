<START> i don't understand why everyone hates this movie aside from the fact that they're just jealous their music careers never took off like mega popstar aaron carter like it or not aaron has seen more success in his young life than most people could ever dream of having so it only seemed natural for him to do a movie lou pearlman and company have been known for over exploiting their pop you remember justin timberlake's foray into tv movie model behavior granted this movie isn't big scale and impressive but it's not supposed to be it's not trying to impress people or be an emmy award winner it was released straight to dvd it's just a cute little movie about an awkward teen who gets her dream of being with her favorite popstar i know a lot of you out there have had that dream at some point or another about you favorite singer don't deny it it's sweet and gentle and i applaud it for not stepping into the realm of sex violence and vulgar language that seem to be creeping into more and more of our movies today where's the decency where's the line teen dramas come in dozens these days because teens are a big market for companies at least this one is more tolerable to me than aka with all the fake little girls running around going oh mah gawd in tank tops and mini skirts and is fathoms better than those gore fest movies like saw i feel for the main character girl because i was nerdy outcast girl in high school who loved aaron carter and nsync and the backstreet boys and other pop music and still do and like aaron's character would get crushing especially in math if you judge this movie solely based on the fact that you don't like or are jealous of aaron carter and his fame then of course you're going to hate it and trash talk it in reviews the only reason britney spears' dribble crossroads got a higher score is because she has boobs accept this movie for what it is not what you want it to be i think this happy formulaic teen movie ends on a high note and makes you want to sing
<START> let me see i've seen every film lou ferrigno has made i've seen batman robin twice i've memorized the dances in breakin' 2 electric boogaloo i've watched unfinished blade runner rip off student films yet this film is the most painful thing i've ever seen br br this was the first movie for the straight to video market so you can thank blood cult for all of those mysterious michael dudikoff films at your local blockbuster you should know that this isn't even high quality video this is consumer grade this is you father's video camera he never uses this is what you have to look at for 90 minutes br br i won't bore you with plot details since i'm getting sleepy just thinking about it but i will tell you that watching this movie is a form of torture i only watch this movie when i am angry at myself so i recommend this film if you are suicidal or if you are up for a mighty challenge br br if you happen to rent this film god have mercy you will know what you are in for from the first 10 minutes this is when you are hit by the usual horror film intro you know the drill there's a lot of suspense and build up before some girl dies yes you've seen it before but not like this this is the most boring intro i've ever seen i honestly believe that you could get a camera off ebay for ten dollars grab the bum that most smells like gin and candy and tell him to film your mom cooking dinner and it would be more interesting than this intro it bored me to tears i cried like a baby br br another one of the things that makes this film so unbelievably painful is its actors yes i've seen bad acting trust me i've seen 4th grade productions of oliver twist with more realistic dialog the lead actor makes me ill the supporting actress is a train wreck of a human br br i will not even comment on the boyfriend true horror br br so rent this movie if you can find it you'll never be more depressed that you spent 3 dollars on anything else
<START> i watched this episode with high hopes after seeing it on so many people's favourite episodes list i'm not boasting in any way but from the start i realised they were in some sort of can with the huge eye looking down on them to the type of characters in there even though throughout the episode the questions of who are we where are we what's outside carry the suspense of the episode which i unfortunately already figured out i must say that different types of characters and the interaction between them did make the episode interesting enough although the twist of the story may have been harder to guess if all of them were toy soldiers
<START> black water has to be one of the best australian movies i've seen in many years my girlfriend and i sat gripping each others hands jumping in all the right spots this is as much a crocodile film as open water was a shark film in other words the creatures are merely part of the dilemma the trap in which people find themselves through circumstances how director's andrew and david wring as much suspense and terror from such a modest situation is amazing to watch unfold and when i say terror its not overblown artificially constructed squirm moments but more little touches that when you ask yourself how would i feel in that situation lead you to conclude scared witless performances were great the pacing and gorgeous cutaways to other life in the were excellent and the ending moments of the film felt very right this is a fitting feature debut for two directors who should rightfully by very proud go and watch this very beautifully shot and acted suspenseful film
<START> this film is so bad it's almost good trash at its best jesus' bro vs pimps come on i'd say that you'd actually have to see this it's so bad my sides hurt when i laughed i can't understand why this isn't in the worst 100
<START> yeah i bought camp blood and it wasted about 86 minutes of my life and 5 pounds of my money on this crap i mean i didn't expect an amazing movie judging by the front cover i wasn't really expecting anything great but at least not boobies in the first 3 seconds i'm not complaining about the boobies i'm complaining about what the hell that has to do with anything this film should have been kept on there hand cam at home as a joke they suck why was the blood more brown and turd like that real blood cheap i tells ya i mean everyone wasn't in colour they were just tinted yellow and another thing that made me die laughing at this sad excuse for a film was the fact that they tried to pretend the clown was a woman all the time although its clearly a flat chested black short haired man did anyone else notice that the only special effect in this film was a slowed down jump that was also poor oh and the dissolve effect that you can find on many basic p c programs such as this film blows
<START> i did have a good time the first 45 min or so but then suddenly it was all down hill the suspense somewhat started to get thin and the jokes somewhat the same all over what kept it going were the good actors br br but the problem with this film is that it is trying to be cleverly funny like tarantino and god is that outdated stuff tarantino being a bit overrated sometimes this movie comes ten years too late at best it is for teenagers and i am sure many of them find the character of funny which he is for the first 30 min the other problem i have with it is that the story fades away towards the end more and more thou i tried to find a recovery point maybe it didn't recover because the lack of passion comes with the effort of trying to be cleverly funny also like in many movies sure good actors who can afford it don't seem to demand a better dialogue or just turn down the script
<START> this is a clever and entertaining film about the backroom battling that went on to choose a successor to johnny carson on the tonight show however the movie's ultimate thesis that david letterman's superior comedic talents were overlooked because of his controversial nature and the show diminished by the of an inferior jay leno in the leading comedy program on television is simply untrue as anyone who has watched both leno and letterman perform can see for themselves the hard and simple truth is exactly as one nbc exec stated in the film jay leno is the funniest man in america and david letterman is not once you realize this then much of the machinations in the film become irrelevant ultimately the whole film amounts to little more than sour grapes by letterman fans who just cannot accept that the better comic was chosen by people whose business it is to know these kind of things the final proof is that despite letterman's early lead possibly because of the hype that emerged from the battle for tonight show succession leno's show has consistently proved to be the more popular thus in my mind at least refuting letterman's claims to be unfairly robbed of his rightful inheritance
<START> the muppet movie is an instant classic i remember the opening scene with the bird's eye view of the swamp and kermit starting into in my opinion the most loved song in the history of songs at this point my mom would always sing along with kermit br br watching this title as a young adult it makes me smile i can still sing along to my heart's desire like many muppet films there are in jokes for adults that are in my opinion still funny today my favorite line of all time is actually from this film it's the last line spoken by my green goggle eyed hero kermit life's like a movie write your own ending that's what i intend to do thank you jim henson
<START> young fake accent was difficult to accept at times br br the show was billed as mystery suspence but should have been listed as a romance br br don't rent this one if you are sleepy it will knock you out
<START> though for most of us sexiness is a variable quality i cannot recall a movie that did for me what this one does it transported me into an awfully familiar realm of longing and desire all the compulsive attraction uncertainty over the outcome the palpable fear and excitement so attendant to that state of arousal were brought to fever pitch by this flick so french and what i consider daring no matter what your orientation i think that the danger of chasing your desire is brought full front and center here much more so say than with kubrick's eyes wide shut
<START> i hope the writer director editor and composer and let's not forget producer read this because their work was truly incredible on this movie let me start by saying that i am in no way affiliated with this movie i am only a regular guy who has been a fan of this movie for about 12 years and have seen it about 8 times br br every second of this movie is touching every scene is classic the acting is real the movie is honest you can relate to these characters as people not actors br br this tale follows three distinct killers at different stages in their lives the story is carefully thought out and every sub plot is intertwined and woven together culminating in a message that leaves us pondering the values of right and wrong that each of us carries inside br br crispen glover daniel roebuck dennis hopper and joshua john miller as a 12 year old boy give absolutely amazing real performances i've seen this movie about 8 or more times and i still get so absorbed in their performances that i forget i am watching a movie it's that good great job everyone who worked on this great job br br the music is also wonderfully matched and haunting with the chosen cast the carefully timed editing and pacing the mood and tone and even the subject matter the director made some of the best decisions for a movie i've ever seen br br this movie is real it's honest it's a true movie experience which i will never forget you may not be into the subject matter but it is something you cannot ignore ultimately it's about people being people and everyone can relate to that i recommend this movie to fans of drama suspense and horror above almost every other film
<START> um a serious film about troubled teens in singapore a country i have not much knowledge on but have the previous wrong impression that all the kids there are highly disciplined and controlled by their family and government well i guess i am wrong just like other cities countries they also have their troubled teens who also lead the not so surprising rebellious way of life of drugs fights bad language and many other obvious signs of being a bad boy the surprising part of this film isn't really about how these kids running around causing themselves and others trouble but rather the subtle gayness hidden behind their so call loyalty between them the bond between these brothers may very well originated from an unconscious gay tendency inside these boys though it isn't uncommon for guys to have very close friendship with each other but watch this film closely it should be entering all sorts of gay film festivals and i would not be surprised that it may win itself a lot more awards toward this direction
<START> i don't know what the critics were viewing when this movie was released but it slipped by them unnoticed it is well written witty satirical and thoroughly enjoyable it's like a video game brought to life you never know who's behind the door or what will happen next the violence is not gratuitous nor overdone for splatter effect br br one last word for you mickey rourke fans the is back and at his coolest in the cameo performance at the end
<START> i loved this film and recommend it to anyone who like a good spy spoof and who thought johnny english was an embarrassment this is the film je should have been but it's based on an old french films series so it's not really bond related br br the production is brilliant you'll almost believe the film was shot back in the 60's it even has that same pastel kind of colouring films had in those days jean plays his part with just the right amount of dumbness and naivety not with ham fisted pantomime silliness like rowan atkinson and even if you don't like the film you will want to see it for ooh la la she is the hotness
