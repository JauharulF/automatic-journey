<START> i like to think that i can appreciate a movie that is a bit out of the ordinary and i certainly love a good movie that makes me think br br if you like out of the ordinary movies that make you think then look elsewhere this movie is so bad and so disjointed that the only thing you will be thinking after it is over is how it is possible you wasted 90 minutes of your life watching this br br a movie of this kind needs a driver to get buy in from the viewer why are we interested in the main characters what motivates these characters through their existence why do they make the decisions they make this movie makes a very weak attempt at doing these and fails in the process there is no chemistry between these two actors both of who are superb in their ability to be comfortable in any role so why did they fail here i strongly feel that they didn't know what their motivations were either and when an actor doesn't know their audience can't follow br br in sum i have seen macromedia flash videos that offered more in the way of provoking thought at least i have more interest in the morphed hamster who likes the moon than why this married family man would risk it all for a code 46 violation
<START> there are two ways to turn a tv series into a film br br the first most common and least successful is to basically make a feature length tv episode see the disasters of the steptoe son movie the second is to do something else something quite different Ã  la monty python br br thankfully the creators of the cult tv series have gone for the second option and they've come up with something unique clever and funny it couldn't feel less like a tv episode br br try to get your head around this the writers playing themselves are confronted by their royston vasey alter egos played of course by them and told to continue writing the series otherwise apocalypse will befall the village br br high concept contrived and easy to screw up yes but somehow they managed to pull it off not for every taste perhaps and the ending does drag but fans will be delighted and it might even win over the uninitiated
<START> i sincerely wonder why this film was ever made a bulgarian italian co production set in a version of berlin where all germans speak english with a german accent and all turks speak english with some turkish words in between is hardly credible the english vocabulary is basically limited to fuck you bastard and the acting is worse than anyone can imagine apart from this racial tensions in germany can be an interesting subject but in the germany i know there are no gangs shooting each other in the middle of the street in clear daylight and if all that is not enough there is also a serial killer going around who kills turkish children and paints them white in order to create some tension we see the serial killer and hear him hum schubert's lullaby but we won't see his face br br i don't even believe they actually shot it in germany there are some street shots that are quite obviously in berlin but the actors are not seen in those shot it's probably bulgaria with some german signs added here and there
<START> ali g was funny at first his interviews were fresh and original the idea of a mock gangster wearing ott clothes and using street wise lingo was appealing at first br br but this film is just a rehash of old jokes the humour was mainly childish and revolved around the male sex organ for the most part the film claimed good actors like charles dance but their talents were wasted as they played silly 2 d characters it is not but isn't really funny at all a second time it could be said that the movie was ali g's last bastion of comedy after that he ran out of steam
<START> wow this is in my opinion the best sitcom since friends if you have had a crap day just sit yourself down with a beer if you are old enough that is if not a root beer will have to do and watch a couple of episodes it's the perfect recipe for happiness br br the thing i like most is that everybody in the show is very funny and they all have fantastic comedy timing after a while you become attached to the characters and really care about them i think the secret to the shows success is that they have an enviable life doug is fat but still happy with it he loves his wife his job and his friends the father in law is the fly in the ointment but hey nothings perfect
<START> brainless film about two girls and some guys they meet in an airport getting on the wrong late night shuttle bus and ending up in a whole world of trouble great twists and turns are totally and i do mean totally wasted in a film with a plot so incredibly stupid as to defy description what is going on in a general sense is okay i mean the idea of a guy kidnapping unattended girls for nefarious purposes is a good one the problem is that the details are so beyond belief that i would be shocked if you don't turn off the film in utter disbelief gee a guy who is suppose to be taking you home doesn't go any of the ways you know and you stay on the bus it get worse from there think of every bad choice and this film has the characters make it even to the point where they could just walk away but never do whats annoying is that some of the twists and turns might have worked if there was something intelligent before it but there is almost no intelligence anywhere in this film okay maybe there is the end the end is clever the end is the sort of thing that should freak you out it should be the oh moment and become a classic of horror cinema instead it just lies there among the stupid ruins of a stupid movie one of the most brainless films of the year
<START> j j jameson from spiderman 2 quote crap crap br br mega crap it pretends to be an homage un intentional to the coen brothers done poorly br br there is no real mystery to the plot br br diaz's performance is totally uninspired br br the quirky characters don't really work br br there are a lot of duh moments br br i love black comedy but this film isn't funny br br in my view it wasn't worth the electricity br br there are many films in this genre which are much more entertaining br br i hope you find this review helpful
<START> i am a massive fan of the log i thought the first two series provided some of the best comedy this country has ever seen and the third series though different was wonderfully dark and imaginative the thought of seeing tubbs edward and briss on the big screen made july 3 something to wait for yet somewhere it all went horribly wrong the writers had no story and no real ideas the part set in old england showed the glimmers of genius that we know the league are capable of but these scenes did not fit well with the film geoff provided the best of too few largely poor jokes and and briss's performances were big let downs if you love the league save yourself the time and money and watch episodes from the tv series again and again a massive disappointment
<START> i forsee many students now signing up for student exchange to barcelona and being disappointed when they don't have quite such an exciting time br br the movie was enjoyable it's of course always a pleasure to see audrey tatou br br however i have a very strong issue with part of the movie the lesbian roommate tells xavier that women like to be physically dominated which i take issue with and shows him some sort of butt grabbing move that's guaranteed to get a woman xavier then tries out the butt grab on a shy married friend who starts out saying no no i'm married i'm married but then somehow succumbs to the butt grab all of a sudden she's moaning yes yes and they're going at it on the benches in parc i found this really really offensive furthermore it is very stereotyped how often have we seen scenes where the woman says no but obviously doesn't mean it no means no grabbing butts physical domination isn't going to make it right it just totally supported the stereotypical rape myths br br i wasn't even sure how to read the next scene where he gloats to the lesbian about how it worked and how next time he was just going to demand suck it slut or something like that did he really think forcing himself onto a woman with no respect for her feelings was the way to go br br this section really ruined the movie for me
<START> k pax is exactly what a heart warming film should be the story is about a mysterious mental patient played by kevin spacey and his unbelieving psychiatrist dr played by jeff bridges the two have a very friendly bond and as their relationship grows dr can't help but wonder whether or not there is more to his mysterious patient who insists he is from another planet called k pax this film is very funny and kevin spacey pulls of well placed one liners as if it was his second nature k pax is a smart film and i wasn't expecting it to go where it did in the end i found myself thinking about the small things in life and the wonder and magic of the every day life we so often take for granted i left the theater with a warm fuzzy feeling inside and for families and couples on a date k pax is a splendid film that will not disappoint i highly recommend this film to anyone interested in something more than the monotonous releases of glossy action packed gore fests
<START> this young filmmaker has a talent for capturing his audience quickly with unusual camera work and sparse but intense scripts the concept here of combining animation with live footage is remarkably well executed and the soundtrack is very good br br the decision to release the movie in twelve parts online puts the onus on the director to make each episode fascinating enough for the viewer to invest in buying each upcoming episode i only wish all motion pictures had this kind of commitment to keeping their audiences entertained throughout their stories br br highly recommended
<START> this is possibly the worst movie i have ever seen can somebody please explain the plot of this movie to me yes i know the bus ran out of gas in the middle of the desert after the driver never noticed that his compass wasn't functioning but what then and how did it end maybe i'm to stupid to understand this movie but to me it was an absolute waste of time br br my recommendation do not bother there are far better movies to be seen this movie ranks with my other all time low going overboard adam sandler and fire on the amazon sandra bullock
<START> when i saw this movie for the first time i was both surprised and a little shocked by the blatant of the story it is a very artistic drama with incredible special effects spectacular acting not to mention a very excellent job in the makeup department jennifer lopez has pulled herself out of past roles that dug into her career with this movie portraying a very sensitive child psychologist who works with a team of engineers to enter the minds of comatose patients to treat them vincent d'onofrio played amazingly well his portrayal of a sadist serial killer was perfect to a t the sheer emotion conveyed by his performance is astounding vince vaughn isn't my favorite but still performed exceptionally well the symbolism and artistry was intriguing and titillating sometimes surprising and other times shocking overall i say this is a wonderful movie with excellent acting and beautiful artwork
<START> ok this movie wasn't good at all video games aren't what i would brag on if i was over the age of 15 cool to play games but writing a comment about video game players may like this movie for that it is that is strange just play a video game don't make up a sorry story about getting trapped in one i use my cell phone i hope i don't loose my girlfriend in that grease being the worst ever ok grease has a very well thought out story along with being a musical even if you don't like musicals anyone would say grease is good my brother plays video games all the time and he watched 30 minutes and left because it was so awful i feel asleep
<START> 20th century fox's road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more miscast is ida lupino in the leading role lupino a lady who was capable of exuding about as much sex appeal as a blood orange is here under the illusion she is rita hayworth playing the part of a sexy bar room torch singer handsome cornel wilde as her lover is as wooden as usual and totally wasted is the talented celeste holm who's role is little more than a bit part then we have richard widmark who has the most ludicrously written part in the picture when we first see him he is a nice o k guy who runs a thriving road house then suddenly and for reasons that are not sufficiently made clear he becomes insanely jealous of his manager wilde when the latter tells him that he is about to marry lupino you see widmark wanted to marry her himself but 1 he never proposed to her 2 they never had a relationship they don't even have anything that resembles a love scene together and 3 without telling anyone including lupino he has obtained a marriage license wow so how widmark was to achieve something like wedded bliss with lupino after such a courtship is anybody's huh well when widmark goes to pieces over the whole affair so also does the movie i am sorry to say from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing he finally goes over the edge becomes completely deranged and with a few tommy udo he laughably goes gunning for poor cornel wilde before biting the dust himself br br and if that isn't enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors there's not a single outdoor shot in the entire movie added to this 95 of the film takes place at night br br besides an interactive press book and a photo gallery the extras also includes a featurette widmark lupino at fox whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me as far as i know they were never before together in a movie at fox or anywhere else however this featurette is hosted by such heavy hitter know alls as robert osborne eddie muller rudy and a few others who amazingly heap praise on this wearisome and cringe inducing affair all i can say then it must be me i guess but road house up to now was a forgotten and buried noir and as far as i am concerned it should have remained so br br fox would do better if they issued dvds of superior and thus far elusive widmark movies like down to the sea in ships 1949 and the colourful red skies of montana 1952
