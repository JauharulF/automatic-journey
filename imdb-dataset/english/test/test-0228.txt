<START> tim taylor is an abusive drug addict he's a coward and a child and has absolutely no redeeming qualities as an actor or a person the only film with him in it that is enjoyable is galaxy quest and that just because his character a boozed out washed up actor from a former hit tv show was so close to real life for him the rest of the cast is equally bad i hate the mother and the actress that played her patricia richardson she sucks ever clichÃ© is there the stupid woman who is fat and likes opera and only cares about her children while in real life she's proclaims family values and gets divorced after having twins and the child actors were about as interesting as a root canal
<START> this documentary is as unique as it's subject and while d'amato's staple was erotica the film manages to show some decent clips of the films you may remember from old time late night cinemax one problem joe did hardcore porno at times mixed with softcore erotica even mixed in his gore films the gore films are cult classics going for like 20 a pop for a dubbed copy on the net not peanuts for 20 year old films folks i want to see why those are cult classics also as sweet as joe seems he did seem more elegant than one might expect the dude liked to shock both caligula the untold story and emanuelle in america show us hardcore rape snuff and beastiality in both you'd be suprised how far he goes in caligula ii with that one if you can track down an uncut print although these scenes may be in a documentary of a persons career hey he did it also i would have liked to see more interviews of people joe worked with maybe that's just me wanting to see what laura gemser looks like these days i still think she's a goddess and one of the sexiest women ever to grace the genre
<START> what an atomic bomb of a movie the story goes nowhere and comes nowhere it leaves the theatre goer with ones arm up saying is this it what happened to redford he was once a fair actor now he thinks that he can show up on the set and make a few scenes and it's a take wrong what an unemotional film i don't mean to be so so cruel but what crap of a movie unbelievable amateur crap if i was in this movie i would be so that i would not show my face i tell you what if i was associated with this movie i am in big trouble this movie will go down in the annals of movie making as the king of bombs with which all others will be compared to
<START> a sadly inferior precursor to who's afraid of virginia woolf this film drags on and on occasionally reviving your interest only to put you through more and obvious but patently overdone plot points br br it may list as 111 minutes but feels like three hours of painfully wasted time
<START> on a clear day you can see forever is nothing more than a new age update of the pygmalion my fair lady story a professor attempts to turn a common girl into an upper society woman this time however instead of using language skills the professor tries to do so by hypnotism and past life regression br br you know a musical has problems when reviewers constantly mention the sets and the costumes before they mention the plot and the music the songs are instantly forgettable no get me to the church on time here i'm afraid and the plot goes nowhere to paraphrase gertrude stein there is no there here the characters wander through the story without ever getting from point a to point b professor claims several times that he will get to the root of daisy's troubles but he never seems to do so br br all meaningful conflict is avoided for instance there comes a time when university demands he either stop his research into reincarnation or resign his position now there is conflict will he give up his career for daisy alas nothing comes of this development a scene or two later the university changes its mind and tells to continue on with his work so much for conflict br br the talent was certainly assembled for this movie directed by vincente minnelli written in part by alan jay lerner a cast of yves montand bob newhart and jack nicholson and oh yes starring striesand who was nearly at the top of her game at this point in her career br br but it all falls flat attempt to reincarnate his greatest success the previously mentioned my fair lady is as doomed to failure as daisy's attempt to revive the greatness of her own past br br if you enjoy movie musicals there are far better choices than this
<START> when i think of a 1970s period film this is not what i think of i don't want a monotonous one song robin soundtrack i want a soundtrack punctuated with the top 40 bubblegum songs of the day that epitomized the '70s the generic karaoke style disco music during the prom scene was especially annoying the acting if you can call it that was very wooden and seemed just read from script in monotone the film quality and camera work was horrid the dialog murky the script seemed thrown together without much thought and the plot was thin if not nonexistent i can't believe people are giving it the high ratings i've read here basically a forgettable poor attempt at recreating a beloved era of the past two stars is all i can come up with sorry guys
<START> based on a edgar rice burroughs novel at the earth's core provides little more than means to escape and give your brain a rest a victorian scientist dr abner perry peter cushing invents a giant burrowing machine which he and his american partner doug mcclure use to corkscrew their way deep into the earth to explore what mysteries it may hold they soon discover a lost world of subhuman creatures having conflict with prehistoric monsters br br cushing comes across as an absent minded professor to the point of being annoying instead of being a bold adventurer he comes across effeminate on the other hand mcclure overacted enough to make himself also laughable caroline munro plays the pretty princess dia that refuses to leave her world near the center of the earth also in the cast are godfrey james grant and michael crane
<START> does exactly what you expect and then some the first movie was a step up from the tv show with sicker stunts airing uncensored and a gnarly factor that had increased surprisingly jackass number two is even more twisted br br the stunts have become more dangerous and spectacular with some mind blowing painful antics sprinkled with good fun skits to keep that smile turning into a curl of disgust br br knoxville like always dominates the proceedings but this time he has reason to take centre stage as he volunteers for the most dangerous and idiotic of all the stunts with bam also proving himself as wild as ever despite having had his image toned down in 'viva la surprisingly the infamous wild boys steve o and chris pontius seem to take part in fewer of the skits despite being focal in the previous outings br br if you like jackass or dirty sanchez then you will definitely enjoy this film and will laugh your guts out for the 100 minutes of its duration if you see it as childish disgusting or a sad snapshot of the youth culture of today you will find it as offencive as ever so f k off
<START> at last sandra bullock is indeed a beautiful woman but i've finally found a film that she gets to be an actress forget the predictable keanu fodder of speed forget the predictable kleenex fodder of while you were sleeping this tests her br br and she is great a techno feminist role that really works well on screen on a subject that is very close to the bone the issues raised don't seem far fetched at all and the whole experience helped along by a fine supporting cast makes for quite an un couple of hours br br you may never enter another chat room again in fact i'm getting quite nervous just writing this review er bye
<START> if you have not heard of this film it follows two refugees from a refugee camp in africa to america where they convince themselves they will find success and riches life is harder than expected in the states and this film beautifully captures the frustration felt when things are not going right the lives are captured so well many moments seem scripted because they're so perfect whether it be on the job at school or the time in between the two boys peter and are very honest with the filmmakers and make some very thought provoking comments about life in the states it's one of the only documentaries i can recall that when it ended i wanted it to go on for another two hours it might be difficult to find this movie cause it didn't get great distribution but check your local art house or independent theater and give this one a go side note if you're reading this when it's already on video then definitely it's worth a rent rating 28 40
<START> if you thought this is the french the mummy and if you're hoping for another vidocq well look elsewhere it does have the same kind of story like the mummy concerning this book of the dead and a soul that needs to find 7 missing pieces that are scattered in the louvre i found the movie to be slightly entertaining boring for the most part the special effects aren't bad but it's nothing spectacular as i was expecting big explosions and perhaps the eiffel tower crumbling down until i realized that those kind of scenes were in the mummy and this is apparently based on a french cult tv series belphegor could have been so much better i voted this film a 4 10 only for the beautiful sophie she must be almost 40 and she looks breathtaking
<START> there's been a whole lot made about carlos mencia's mr excuse me theft of other comics' material heck even before joe had a blowup with him on stage i knew that carlos was swiping material from cosby and and a host of others br br to compound the crime of his theft he retold these comic geniuses jokes badly br br and that is a crime he continues to perpetuate on this show i'm sure the series writers have to share some of the blame it's got to be hard to write jokes day in and day out but that's why people get paid so darned much to do it these series writers need to go back to their day jobs of flipping burgers or whatever it was they were doing before they decided to embark upon a career of intellectual theft br br not to say that he steals all of his material you can tell when he has devised a joke on his own when what you are watching transcends the merely awful and goes straight into the territory of horrifyingly bad br br because he likes to call people b h on his show ten year olds call him a genius they're gonna grow up one of these days carlos and when they do you're gonna dry up and blow away
<START> the big problem i had with this movie was that lombard's character is as another user put it unnecessarily cruel lombard plays the role of ann smith who believes she is married to david smith played well by the sharply dressed yet appropriately bumbling robert montgomery the movie has some funny moments especially when montgomery's character goes to great lengths to try to get his wife back understandably she is upset because the marriage is technically not legal but she only finds out three years into it br br lombard's character seems quite cold to her husband's sincere attempts to woo her back while not being highly adept in that effort montgomery is nevertheless visibly loving and yet lombard is as cool as a pillar of ice there are almost no clues suggesting any sort of reconciliation between the warring couple for much of the movie and it is hard to see any sort of comedy even dark comedy in that aspect to some extent the movie almost suggests a sadistic undertone with lombard's character getting a kick out of her husband's feeble efforts while one might consider this another 'battle of the type of movie the reality is that it is a highly battle if that montgomery's character while certainly flawed is not flawed enough to make it a typical exemplar of the masculine chauvinist misogynist an excellent example of that is michael douglas in 'war of the in fact the character is largely effeminate as revealed by not only the sharp dress of montgomery which probably owes largely to the sharply dressed actor himself but also to his discomfort in attempting but failing to play the role of a womanizing bachelor his only major flaw is his vanity but that fault does not balance out with his partner's excessive cruelty and there is no suggestion that she is trying to instill any jealousy out of subconscious love this is what makes it so cruel and sad montgomery's character simply looks weak in reality no wife would want a man so weak unless she wears the pants in the marriage but then again a woman who wears the pants in a marriage would never seek to be so cruel because she has already affirmed that role early on hence the whole theme seems weird this movie is neither a champion of feminism lombard's character does show some signs of the sort of independent oriented woman of the 60s but that idea is soon quashed and the character falls back into the 1940s nor an even sided battle of the sexes as montgomery's character is truly a cipher of masculinity and therefore a lost cause br br this movie is on the surface a slapstick but beneath that veneer it is really much darker with sadistic undertones all of which makes its resolution appear well odd maybe that oddity was the whole point in any case slapstick this movie is not
<START> every james bond movie has its own set of rules just like every indiana jones movie has its own set of rules and the fact that screenwriters don't break these rules maintains the integrity of the characters with a completely unnecessary plot twist the integrity of both ocean films plummets somewhere between airplane 2 and a roadrunner cartoon br br imagine what would happen while teetering on the rope bridge outside of the temple of doom if indy told shorty and willie not to worry because throughout the entire first two movies he's secretly had super powers and can fly them both to safety br br entertaining sure for a roadrunner cartoon but spielberg would never have done that because it would have destroyed the integrity of the film more importantly it would have angered the audience they'd already sat on the edge of their seats through 3 hours worth of indiana jones movies and they were counting on indiana to get them off that bridge in a believable way if he were to fly off people would have walked out of the theaters the same way people did during ocean's 12 br br spoilers br br 1 julia tess infiltrates a museum by disguising herself as julia roberts a clever twist by breaking the fourth wall three hours after we've been introduced to these characters is this the naked gun 33 and 1 3 it's a textbook example of how a cheap laugh can ruin an entire film but wait just in case you haven't walked out yet br br 2 the suspense builds throughout the last hour of the movie how will they pull off the heist there are only 10 8 5 2 days left and then in the last 12 minutes of the film the only entertaining part of this movie we see that the heist was made days earlier and took matt damon all of 30 seconds to pull off the past 10 days a complete waste of your time br br back to indiana jones on the rope bridge just relax willie i stole the real stones back about a month ago besides i convinced them you were kate capshaw br br if you haven't already seen it cut your losses and go see the polar express i don't want to ruin the ending for you but there really is a santa claus most importantly you won't feel cheated leaving the theater
<START> journey to the far side of the sun is about the discovery of a planet on the other side of the sun which shares the same orbit as earth and therefore has been undiscovered until a space probe on the far side of the sun photographs it of course two astronauts roy thinnes ian hendry are sent to explore it but due to a malfunction they crash find themselves back on earth only 3 weeks into their six week journey of course they're berated at least thinnes is hendry is gravely injured and grilled and asked why they turned back on their mission but it's claimed that they didn't until thinnes seems to notice a few very odd things about being back home this is excellent if somewhat talky at times and the sets and feel aren't a far cry from thunderbirds territory but will live actors for once it's no big star wars type production but more quiet science fiction that one has to think about a bit well worth seeing and it's criminal that the dvd is out of print 8 out of 10
