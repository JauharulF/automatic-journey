<START> the writers and creators of this film should actually be sued for polluting the world with this crap man in the mirror is in fact beyond horrible way way way beyond br br and people i'm not just saying that because i'm a michael jackson fan or due to the fact that this is truly one of the most retarded depictions of his life i've ever encountered br br i'm saying it because this is a waste of time money and celluloid i feel ashamed of myself just having seen all of it that's 1 hour and 26 min of my life i'll never get back i'm telling you watching grass grow is literally more entertaining than this film br br consider yourselves warned
<START> whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely the lone ranger is not camp but the icon for good doers all over the world and it's a total violation of the spirit of the character that the only real lone ranger mr clayton moore was forbidden to wear his mask in public appearances when this movie was released br br long story short the single saving grace of this gross and poorly done distortion was that in that year i had the honor of meeting mr clayton moore in columbus ohio as part of a tour resulting from the bad press over mr moore's treatment needless to say mr moore's character integrity and presence far outshined the movie br br some things cannot be done better there is only one lone ranger
<START> these three directors are off to good beginnings the three stories are remarkably well done for independent productions and capture those traumatic feelings of coming out when you aren't really sure it's a good idea i laughed at those veiled glances around the dressing room in pool days i smiled at the notion that fans of bette midler judy garland and barbra streisand are assumed to be gay in a friend of dorothy ie browsing through the cd music racks and i cringed over the jock in the disco years whose memory of sweet sex was now blurred by liquor it all seemed so real i look forward to more offerings from this trio of directors
<START> i may be a good old boy from virginia in the confederate states of america but this man does it for me that mustache gets me riled up i remember when i first saw a video of his that girl he beat was amazing the depth of his acting when they cut to his weathered facade was a new level of masculinity it reminds me of the granite sculptures of our mt rushmore if i could ask him one question it would be if you were a hot dog would you eat yourself will be doing a reunion tour take note from the greats like gordon lightfoot true music from the heart never fades away vive la john denver gracias my friend o f f l fan for life
<START> although flawed in it's view of homosexuals this movie will shed light for the viewer about the myths and inaccuracies concerning aids despite the depressing subject matter this film depicts a warm friendship between two boys and will make you laugh as well as cry very well acted by all especially joseph and brad the language is a little strong though appropriate and it's an entertaining and intelligent film for the whole family but remember to have the kleenex ready
<START> a gem of a british caper comedy poor american schlub pinky green richard jordan playing another bad guy but this time an adorable one gets out of a british jail and tries to go straight but his maintenance man job in a bank is too attractive for his never reformed criminal friends headed up by a really nasty ivan david niven in one of his last roles pinky resists but the lure of all that money is just too much for him things unravel and and it's all joyous to watch jordan must have played 20 bad guys in his career but he never played the same one twice this one is just too lovable to hate niven never played a slicker bad guy oil all over two fine actors we've lost that i wish we had back
<START> martin lawrence could be considered a talented man but those days are long gone shows a man who at once tries to play the sympathy card to his plight yet takes responsibility for it whenever he thinks it'll benefit his ego the sad truth is that at this point in his life his best days were behind him his half funny show was dead in the water after his co star left and to today he faces a career of voice acting and god awful action films br br one gets the impression that this concert film wasn't made to give lawrence's career another boost after his humiliation but rather a childish attempt to clear the air by both trying to pathetically salvage what remained of his life and somehow twist it into something to be proud of some defining moment in which he showed himself to have his fame sadly the concert is nothing but a gravelly voiced martin incoherently trying to be funny invoke pathos and then claim he doesn't care about it at all because hardcore the sad truth is that this is the real public embarrassment for lawrence the way he rambles on invoking sad pity laughter makes you wish that he would just strip down to his underwear on stage wave a gun around and just reenact it all over again there is no real insight to his performance at all much like the childish title states martin is trying to make his ultimate moment of truth his own in his way and fails miserably he would have been better off waiting for the e true hollywood story instead of running on a stage and making an idiot out of himself for the second time br br perhaps the saddest thing about this concert film or rather career eulogy is that martin didn't put any thought into this what was this film supposed to prove sadly that his fame was fleeting he was a flash in the pan before the underwear incident and now that the only way he can get work is will smith or a pixar production they might as well called this concert because that's what it is martin lawrence just dies on stage here and with it goes what could have been an interesting career now just a pathetic side note in history

<START> the polar express was an awful movie what makes this movie worst is the hypocrisy to present itself as a innocent sugary and harmless tale for children about the true meaning of christmas i never read the book of chris van in what it was inspired but the most disappointing is that it was directed by robert zemeckis the same who made the great who framed roger rabbit a excellent movie where he proof that the animation could be appreciated for kids and adults equally while in this movie it seems that he was victim of his own ambition and he give too much importance to create impressive level of detail than a interesting story i'm sorry to say this but the polar express have so much artistic level as a publicity campaign of a video game or toy everything in this movie seems to be so lifeless the characters could look like humans but they don't have nothing of life on them and they have a malevolent touch in their eyes br br but the worst is the message in this movie you could see it at some parts of the movie and believe me it was vile take for example one scene where one kid refuses to enter to the polar express notice that the character that looks like tom hanks makes a gesture like saying you are stupid to don't accept my offering second when the girl says that the toys are so warm and things like that all the damn movie the kids keep talking about how big would be the gifts that santa would give to them there is even a song about the gifts the vagabond is a irrelevant and weak character and in the last scene the character seems to discover the true meaning of christmas and what would be what do you think the gifts many christmas movies are close to say something like it but the polar express it's a ode to the materialism and greed i refuse to call it a children's movie because if is that what the kids would learn i don't want to think how would be our future
<START> of hand' is my favorite rockford files episode of the entire series this episode shows a side of jim rockford that is usually ignored to wit jim is genuinely in love with a beautiful woman and is shown as a father figure to her young daughter the woman is recently divorced and she and jim have recently returned from a weekend getaway along with the youngster through a strange turn of events the woman is discovered missing after they return to her home br br recounting to his father rocky of the events leading up to the woman's disappearance is reminiscent of mickey spillane's mike hammer series from an earlier era after much brooding and reflection and with encouragement jim stumbles upon the clue that sends him off investigating the disappearance with his usual br br unfortunately jim's girlfriend karen unwittingly witnessed some mafia activity while they stayed at the buena vista inn the crime bosses responded by killing karen and substituting another woman into jim's car the imposter ostensibly asleep in the back seat made her exit immediately upon arrival at the home a couple of cover up murders ensue and jim proceeds to their solution while under suspicion of the l a police department even as warrants are issued for his arrest br br this episode evokes more emotional reaction than all other rockford files episodes combined james garner as jim rockford is seen at his most vulnerable moment and yet he retains the presence of mind to pursue the case this is personal for jim rockford in this case he is not hired to do a job but he is trying to recover his lost love to save her life unfortunately this is not possible but jim tries hard to sort out his feelings but it is apparent that he will not soon get over his hurt br br despite the appeal of the main story line many key questions are raised but never answered in this episode 1 what becomes of the young daughter of jim's girlfriend 2 what did karen actually see at the hotel that made the mafia kill her 3 how could jim drive for hours with an imposter in his back seat without noticing this 4 the daughter stated that mommy didn't come back with us so why didn't the girl scream or cry when she noticed that her mother was absent for the hours long car ride regardless of these ambiguities of hand is the rockford files episode which comes closest to being a tear jerker the suspense is compelling and the story is told in a sensitive and vulnerable style which makes us feel pain
<START> dead man walking absolutely brilliant in tears by the end you can not watch this film and not think about the issues it raises how can you justify killing whether it be murder or the death penalty and to what point is forgiveness possible not just in a spiritual way don't watch this film when your down but watch it
<START> pretentious storytelling such as this always uses the same technique 1 throw opaque unstructured threads around to perplex the audience 2 deal only in big' topics such as life death and god 3 make it appear profound with scenes of life death sky etc 4 depend on an intellectually weak audience to give you the benefit of the doubt 5 and finally laugh all the way to critical acclaim br br this movie is pretentious faux intellectualism at its boldest not only do these filmmakers not answer any questions they're afraid to pose the questions to begin with the film is held together by wisps directions are raised and dropped awkwardly pop cultural references are jolting and arbitrary there is so little to point at that any critical stabs will miss br br critics who found an intellectual base to this movie are afraid to admit the truth they have no idea what this movie is about good news neither do the filmmakers satisfying attempts at answers to profound questions about human existence demand wit intellect poetry and genius sadly this movie demonstrates none of these traits
<START> warning i advise anyone who has not seen the film yet to not read this comment br br when i first started to watch this movie my expectations were it was a vampire movie that is going to be awesome considering how rodriguez and tarantino both helped make the film i began about 15 minutes into it and already my hopes for this movie were down the drain which shocked me first the story it was going with was not at all appealing in anyway possible and just flat out boring and uncompelling to the point where i just wanted to turn it off i was getting more frustrated with this movie as it dragged on but i guess i had hopes that it would get better then when it finally showed vampires it blew my mind in a very bad way i thought okay this movie started with some horrible story about these two criminals then very slowly turned into some vampire movie which i thought it was going to be from the beginning in like the last 30 minutes to add on to that they try to make the main characters all cool and awesome and mean around the end when they're just not a bunny would've been more intimidating than these characters this movie is a horrible piece of crap from dusk till dawn disgraced me and left a terrible taste in my mouth disheartening thoughts in my head and left my body unable to move from the horrible shock that i just wasted 108 minutes of my life away on a horrendous film i do not understand how george clooney quentin tarintino cheech marin and danny trejo all being the good and honorable actors that they are could take part in this useless filth in my opinion from dusk till dawn is one of the worst movies ever made that i have suffered my eyes on do not see it you'll be doing a great favor
<START> all i have to say is that this movie is the bomb you are going to cry when you see this i mean this is a reminder for everyone how hard and easy it is to fall in love it reminds you of the days during your youth when you were carefree and everything that was bad for you was washed away with a single kiss even though i am still a teen this is how i live my life when i am with that certain someone everything that was negative in my mind was erased so i give this movie a 10 for it's heartfelt message and touching plot actors josh hartnett and chris klein i also give a 10 for having a cute face
<START> as i was watching it i was getting ready to compose a blasting lambasting critique of this film it is actually video but then i saw that someone already did i pretty much agree with him but then again it looks like a lot of effort and millions of lira went into it so i guess you gotta give them some credit for trying however that being said anyone who doesn't already know the lovecraftian world and that this is what they were trying to convey will probably think well i suppose that not only is it really bad but it makes absolutely no sense thank god i read part of the other review a little gushy maybe which revealed that this guy also did the shunned house which looked pretty bad judging by the dvd box so now i can avoid it and save my mind from any further exposure to such desecration of the brilliance of h p lovecraft
