<START> this movie attempts many things but never really accomplishes anything the plot time travels meanders and weaves along without really satisfying it left a hollow is that all feeling at the end unless its free to air and there is nothing else on forget about it
<START> this movie is ageless and would probably appeal to children today even if there isn't a jedi in the entire thing of course elizabeth taylor was the most beautiful child in the world and her acting is great too even mickey rooney is good so are anne revere and angela lansbury the world was a different place when this movie was released and it certainly is a great place to visit
<START> i thoroughly enjoyed manna from heaven the hopes and dreams and perspectives of each of the characters is endearing and we the audience get to know each and every one of them warts and all and the ending was a great wonderful and uplifting surprise thanks for the experience i'll be looking forward to more
<START> college students who are actually in their late 20's on campus in boston which looks strangely like the isle of man are menaced by a fierce monster assembled during a blue peter episode the new teacher must save the day even though he is really oh who cares br br i'll start with the positives there is a nice shot of eastenders new gal samantha can in the obligatory campus shower scene with her best mate katy lawrence a bit of side trivia katy was hired when she arrived at auditions with her sister just as moral support to her sibling but ended up landing a part oh joy picked from obscurity to flash her pert buttocks in a meaningless scene added for titillation then getting killed 30 minutes in for her troubles her latest and only other credited role is as probationary nurse 5 in atonement i wonder if she snuck a look at keira knightly if extras and stars are allowed to mix and wondered where did it all go wrong br br i'll give a few hints katy if all the other british cast members are asked to speak with american accents in a doomed attempt at mass marketing and the only person who can manage it is the b movie veteran usa native todd jensen you know you're in trouble if you look at your wage slip and it'll only just about cover your lunch and your bus ride home you ain't starring in a movie with a trillion dollar budget if the premiere is attended by loads of family members of the fourth assistant director and provokes gales of laughter when the tape monster rampages through the sewers it should dawn on you that this isn't exactly alien or even a critters iv come to think of it so katy in your next life i'm a buddhist you see perhaps you'll be a bit more selective in your choice of debut feature rather than impulsively jumping at the first pile of crap that heads your way flashing skin in your first movie does not guarantee long lasting success unless you're sylvester stallone and he had the script to rocky to back him up br br to all intents and purposes this is as 0 10 a movie as i've ever seen however for sheer unintentional laughs and pure camp value it gets a 1 well done
<START> with al jolson at the height of his popularity and warner the jazz singer having been the highest grossing film of 1927 it was inevitable that the other studios would churn out a few vehicles for their own jolson esquire characters but while the jazz singer was a sensation for its being the first part talkie the matinÃ©e idol lacks the singing voice of its star the now obscure johnnie walker and has to make do with just his visual antics br br the matinÃ©e idol was an early directorial assignment for the renowned frank capra capra's first couple of full length features for harry langdon reveal a very showy excessive style which made langdon's already mediocre slapstick almost unwatchable a couple of pictures later and capra has learnt to ease off a bit with some fairly regular and decent camera work however he still shows no aptitude for shooting physical comedy the longest comic routine the stage performance seems to have a few good gags but it's all cut up into lots of different camera angles and there is no chance for the comedy to flow naturally from the performances theoretically a good portion of the jokes are in the intertitles but there are far too many of these and none of them is especially funny br br of course capra would eventually mature into a fine dramatic and romantic director and you can see him beginning to develop in this respect he cuts down the line closing in on walker and bessie love in the scene where she first lays eyes on him in his don wilson get up neatly establishing the wordless connection between them then there is some beautiful and tender framing of the couple in their scene together at the masquerade which is all very reminiscent of the love scenes in capra's early 30s output br br johnnie walker columbia's answer to al jolson is not an exceptional talent his comic timing is good but there is nothing to make him stand out bessie love on the other hand is a pretty good actress too with a very expressive face kudos to her for getting involved with the physical comedy and losing her dignity with the boys there's also a good role for lionel belmore that rotund and jolly character actor who seems to turn up in absolutely everything in the late 20s and early 30s br br the matinÃ©e idol is one of those pictures that has gained more than its fair share of attention thanks to its director later having made a handful of masterpieces in and of itself it is a very uninteresting piece and like most of capra's work before he met robert a disappointment
<START> scenarist frederick fox's sometimes memorable dialogue and a study cast of old pros cannot save this lukewarm western about whites pinned down in the desert by a band of bloodthirsty cheyenne indians other than his occasionally catchy dialogue you won't find any surprises in fox's screenplay about this run in between whites and indians the characters in dakota incident generate only minor interest certainly not enough to make them stand out as much as some of fox's choice dialogue unfortunately good dialogue is fox's only contribution because this conventional little withers with a lackluster ending that contradicts its previous 80 minutes the ending is as contrived as they come and lacks credibility most of the characters are sympathetic but some just plain lack common sense br br dale robertson is appropriately tough and as outlaw john banner one of three bank robbers who has to shoot it out with his low down no account partners veteran western character actor john doucette rick largo fares the best of the badmen while skip wasted in an inconsequential role as banner's brother frank banner later dies from an indian arrow doucette tries to gun down banner at the outset of in the action but our left handed gun toting hero fakes his own death tracks down largo down later and slaps leather with him in a town called christian flats naturally largo bites the dust this time but banner makes an interesting discovery one of the passengers on a stagecoach from christian flats to laramie turns out to be none other than the bank teller from whom he stole the money not only is john carter john lund on a quest himself to find banner but also he wants to clear his own good name with the bank that has issued wanted posters for his arrest evidently the authorities have mistaken and enlarged carter's role in the robbery carter is prepared to take banner to laramie and turn him over to the law but banner has other ideas about laramie banner's ideas change when he crosses paths with amy clarke former twentieth century fox beauty linda darnell who wears a bright red dress and still packs quite a bosom as everybody else here has mentioned in their reviews republic studio's brings out the red in everything from fetching outfit to the blood spilled on the ground the problem with director lewis foster's handling of this run of the mill oater is that everything bogs down after the stagecoach loses a wheel and our heroes hole up in a dry wash to defend themselves against the cheyenne the good guys and the cheyenne eventually run out of ammunition but dakota incident never runs out of clichÃ©s ward bond has several interesting moments as a politically correct politician who defends the way of the by the time that this 88 minute dust raiser concludes you'll feel like you've been trapped in a gulch and menaced by marauding cheyenne yourself
<START> simon pg 13 thriller about a babysitter who gets disturbing prank calls while sitting at a mansion is neither original nor exciting enough to be called a good film although there are some elements of suspense good eye candy and decent characters the film is just another i know what you did last summer as it falls short of being taken seriously the performances were alright but nothing special with this flick i say skip it unless you are looking for a mediocre movie you can find better films than this on lifetime sometimes okay maybe not lifetime but at least usa or somethin haha br br 7 10

<START> reality before reality tv copy of fast times at ridgemont high a precursor to say anything that's grittier i can't decide but the soundtrack is the 80's blondie journey devo lionel richie and u2 i can't believe this they would never throw all those genres together in a teen movie of today br br i remembered this like a teenager mainly the sex parts and not a hint of the altruism why i was a horny teenager in the 80's watching it again i just can't describe how much i love that rose play by kimberly richardson turns out to be the voice of pepper ann in the 90's and she was almost 30 when she was in last american virgin playing alongside 16 year olds fantastic complete cheese reality fantasy and comedy with a sincere cherry on top
<START> the first music video i ever saw thriller my mom told me that she took me home from the hospital and when we arrived my sister had mtv on the tv and thriller was playing my mom said that i smiled silly i know but i have loved michael jackson since that day the music video thriller inspired me to dance still i have the dance memorized to this day i even performed it for an audience 3 times words cannot describe the power of this song that makes you wanna sing and dance but michael of course had to raise the bar for mtv at the time by signing on american werewolf in london director john landis and directing the one the only thriller br br michael and his date ola ray run out of gas in a dark wooded area they walk off into the forest and michael asks her if she would like to go steady she accepts and he gives her a ring he warns her however that he is not like other guys no really not like the other guys a full moon appears and michael begins convulsing in agony Â transforming into a horrifying werewolf his date shrieks and runs away but the werewolf catches up knocking her down and begins at her with its claws the scene cuts away to a movie theater where michael and his date are actually watching this scene unfold in a movie called thriller michael smiles but his date is frightened and tells him she's leaving michael catches up to her and says that it's only a movie but she doesn't like his jokes on her and she starts walking away michael and his date then walk down a foggy street and he teases her with the opening verses of thriller they pass a graveyard where corpses suddenly begin to rise from their graves as vincent price performs his rap michael and his date then find themselves surrounded by the zombies and suddenly michael becomes a zombie himself michael and the undead perform an elaborate song and dance number together followed by the chorus of thriller br br thriller is arguably the best music video of all time funny thing is people who wanna argue that is with other michael jackson videos but what makes thriller so special is the dance the story the effects this at the time was the most expensive music video of it's day michael of course rose that bar again with his famous music video scream and then again with ghosts but say what you will michael was the star of the 1980's there was no celebrity like him he loved the life he lived it breathed it and embraced it thriller is proof that he was willing to work to make the best and that's what we got with the legend that is thriller br br 10 10
<START> this movie reminds me of great movies that temporarily wake me up with the realization that the emperor is indeed naked our election process is unclothed and dismal my awareness is heightened and i want to see the world change after a short while i am lulled back to my little complacency and bubble life in the best sense of film this work will ferment into an edible stew for me and like in network i want to be convicted to as mad as hell and i'm not going to take this anymore ' but to whom my vigorous youthful idealism has been slowly reduced to concerned parent with quiet convictions or rather beliefs man of the year reveals how much i yearn for honest and sometimes humorous takes on our current political situation line i did inhale because i thought 'what the hell it's lit it's in my hand i'll inhale it ' was refreshing or would've been when clinton was president why can't politicians be honest and set that tone for debates we people must realize how much veneer is being put forth as real i am sick of this election process already anyone else let take off the veils and set an agenda for our elected officials and take them to task not re elect when they continue with evasion and non representation of citizenry this movie can inspire us to increase our expectations of politicians that spew rhetoric great film
<START> a terrible movie that is amateurish on almost every level a boring and derivative screenplay filled with stereotyped characters played by embarrassed actors for a director lacking the most rudimentary understanding of his craft the whole thing stinks it plays like a slasher movie from the early eighties down to the crappy score and ketchup sfx but without the childhood nostalgia that is required to look fondly on such dross one of the worst horror films i've ever seen definitely the worst that received a mainstream theatrical release i've never walked out of a film in my life had i been unlucky enough to see at the theater it would have been a first avoid at all costs
<START> the english are a little too evil the scots are a bit too br br heroic the dialogue is overly dramatic at times and the br br transitions between scenes could be smoother br br still the bruce has the feel of authentic if unpolished br br history even if it does play loosely with some important br br facts br br sandy welch is no gibson or branagh but he makes a stalwart br br bruce and brian blessed chews the scenery in delightful br br villainy as edward i br br while lacking the budget needed to make the final battle truly br br impressive they still an impressive crowd for the br br english and scottish armies it is according to filmmakers the br br largest filmed reconstruction of medieval battle ever staged in br br the british isles br br allowing for a few failings and shortcomings the film still br br does a convincing portrayal
<START> season on the brink is one of my favorite books of all time an insightful unflinching look at bob knight and his indiana hoosiers and dennehy is one of my favorite supporting actors of all time so i made a point of watching this adaptation br br it disappointed on every level performance was less than inspired and he seemed unprepared to play knight like he had accepted the role just prior to filming the rest of the cast isn't much better br br and it was obvious that this was first movie it was poorly directed poorly filmed and the lack of budget was obvious anytime games were being simulated smaller empty seats etc skip this adaptation and read the book it holds up well to this day
