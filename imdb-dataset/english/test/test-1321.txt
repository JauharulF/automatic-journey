<START> four daughters introduced john garfield to audiences and that is what is remembered most about this film today unlike some actors who appear in several films before their screen image gels garfield established his immediately with a cigarette hanging out of his mouth and talk of the fates being against him br br it's actually the story of four girls their widowed musician father claude rains and their various suitors one of whom felix is played by handsome jeffrey lynn he's the one they all have a crush on but he's in love with buff priscilla lane then she meets ne'er do well mickey borden who falls for her as well when buff realizes that one of her sisters is in love with felix she leaves him at the altar and marries mickey br br this is a fairly formulaic story given life and sequels by the acting garfield has already been mentioned but priscilla lane was by far the strongest of the daughters the most interesting and the best actress jeffrey lynn was a fresh and good looking leading man and this film got him off on the right foot with warners however true stardom was not to be like many others of the era he went into the service and when he came out he had a bronze star but not much of a career he later went into television and real estate claude rains is warm and wonderful as the patriarch br br so popular was four daughters that it inspired four wives and four mothers as well as reuniting much of the cast again in daughters courageous where the actors played different characters br br very enjoyable a nice remembrance of simpler and probably happier times and a chance to see john garfield in his first film
<START> this show is up there with the best comedys made in australia as it makes fun of pretty much anything which is what lots of our public want some of the best bits in the show are the ad road test which tests out how an ad would do in real life what is really great about the show is how original it is and the fact that it has people the chasers who love doing what they do and who would n't this show has loads of bits in it that can crack up anybody like the ad road test which i've already mentioned mr ten questions where he asks 10 questions really fast in front of famous celebrities like hugh jackman and the beach boys temporary ones like the chasers emmys and ones that have been there from the start like what have we learnt from current affairs this week overall i rate thin show 98
<START> because disney more often than not ignores the animation quality and a need for a good plot in their sequels this was actually a nice surprise i don't know why disney does not pay more attention to their sequels the graphics quality is always inferior no backgrounds worthy of the name disney inane plots and worse dialog with little or no attention given to the actual story and the caricature drawings are almost always worse than saturday morning cartoons in detail and quality br br the animation quality is still poor when compared to disney originals and the dialog is quite trite the story line and overall execution was really quite enjoyable br br while it is not as captivating it does not completely fail to capture the charm and or mystery from the first there is some hint of it tucked away here and there br br the children will like it at any rate br br it rates a 4 5 10 from br br the fiend
<START> following a 19th century gun dual that goes awry a charming young woman becomes a vampire not only does she become one of the undead she uses her goth temptress persona to sustain her talents as a cold blooded assassin this is a low grade b feature that should have went straight to video the violence is vicious and gory but actually quite mild the story line is so weak and dialogue so haphazard it is hard to work up much interest eileen daly is the lead character lilith silver also in the cast are mark kevin howarth and isabel brook
<START> to say i wasn't expecting much sitting down to watch the couch trip is an understatement i had no idea what it was about i thought it was going to be a journey into the realm of sexuality when i heard chevy chase played a condom man and the movie's title involves the word couch trip wink wink then i figured out that it had something to do with a mental institute and a patient escaping my expectations dropped even lower br br i was literally expecting a grin movie the type where you grin once and walk out feeling a bit cheated and in a way this is cheap comedy it doesn't have the greatest gags the plot is ludicrous but you know what i had a big dumb smile on my face the entire time i was watching it br br dan aykroyd plays john burns a patient at a mental hospital who may or may not actually be mental he gives the psychiatrist lawrence david plenty of grief and misery which leads us to believe he is a sane person after all br br following a little bit of a riot in the mental institute's cafeteria burns is awaiting a tongue lashing from in his office when the phone rings burns picks it up pretends to be and finds out the caller on the other line harvey michaels richard romanus wants the real dr to come fill in for a radio shrink named george charles grodin who is taking a vacation with his wife vera mary gross michaels wants so bad he has even booked him a ticket on an airplane br br burns escapes the institute with the help of a receptionist and drives to o'hare he gets dr ticket gets on the plane and eventually poses on the air as dr his show is a phenomenal success people love him one man says and the other man replies it's because he actually cares about them br br donald becker the late great walter matthau is an ex mental patient who recognizes burns' clothes to be confinement issued pants and shirts to keep him quiet burns promises becker a percentage of his income the secret is kept closed br br meanwhile and his wife get in an argument he flies home to end his vacation short and realizes that the man on his talk show is not in fact dr after all but no one believes him he gets the real dr but unfortunately he has lost his id so the police take them as nutcases and don't listen to their story br br let me name just a few of the plot holes i noticed while watching this film burns poses as dr but is never asked for his id even when claiming his plane ticket he was robbed he says but they would still make sure he is if burns becomes so very famous how come the real dr in chicago never heard people talking about him word travels and finally why would the police ever arrest and the real that is without following up on their stories br br to be frankly honest i couldn't care less i went into this movie with a closed mind and it surprised me i really liked it it entertained me its ideas are essentially ludicrous and not at all realistic but dan aykroyd gives a truly spirited performance as a half a loon that makes the couch trip a trip worth taking br br 3 5 5 stars br br john ulmer
<START> i stopped this movie at 48 minutes and change i don't know maybe it's because i'm not swedish or french the cannes commenter or any of those other sleepy places from which the previous reviewers held forth born and raised in ny lived near san francisco for a quarter of a century and now holland i love a good independent film as much as the next movie enthusiast but this in a word isn't funny see now that's funny that you're thinking that i made a mistake i said 'in a word' but then said funny' nope no mistake if this is your type of humor i'd say you haven't really had much of a life consider your appreciation of this film a symptom and please don't ever write another review i have a tendency to believe them when they're unanimous even if there only were about 3 reviews before mine i figured i might actually be able to save someone else the boredom the anticipation of laughter that never materializes i did smile once or twice though when i started the movie and when i stopped it that should be 10 lines
<START> having watched this film years ago it never faded from my memory i always thought this was the finest performance by michelle pfeiffer that i've seen but i am astounded by the number of negative reviews that this film has received after seeing it once more today i still think it is powerful moving and couldn't care less if it is based loosely on king lear br br i now realize that this is the greatest performance by jessica lange that i've ever seen and she has had accolades for much shallower efforts br br a thousand acres is complex human vibrant and immensely moving but surely doesn't present either of the primary female leads with any touch of glamour or sexiness i don't think this is well received in these times br br perhaps one reason for this film's underwhelming response lies in the fact that the writer jane smiley screenplay laura jones and director are all women i know that in my younger days i wouldn't have read a book written by a woman i didn't focus on this fact until years later br br if you haven't seen this movie or gave it a chance in the past try watching it anew maybe you are ready for it
<START> i just found the entire 3 dvd set at wal mart in the bargain bin for 5 50 so i thought i would take another look total of 13 hours to watch it all 26 episodes i was born in 1948 and saw most of them on tv in the sixties many independent stations repeated them for many years br br better than i expected actually time has been kind to the obvious sincerity of it's creators and to the obvious gratitude and respect they give to all the allied fighting men and women more abstract and arty than a straight forward documentary but very truthful in it's depiction of the causes and final results of wwii that war was greatly dependent on sea transportation and the final victory was dependent on who achieved the final mastery of the world's oceans the allies were the ones who were able to do it br br interesting too to see how they try to strike a balance between big events and the individual soldiers and sailors that made them happen the score is impressive if a bit too much by today's standards i read somewhere that robert russell bennett contributed just as much as richard rodgers to final score i imagine that rodgers provided all the major themes and it was up to bennett to fit them to the images great job br br should be seen by every ruler or potential ruler a warning to tyrants that wars are eventually won by ideals determination and the supplies to back them up logistics their quality and delivery will determine the eventual victors the allies and surpassed the material quality of the axis attacked their very source in the process and insured their eventual defeat br br sorry to see that the producer henry lived a very short life imdb's facts were rather skimpy i have to find out more about him he did a few more outstanding documentaries before his early death might have more to say at a later time br br trivia i had all 3 lp records made of the background music pretty good overall unfortunately the producers decided to add sound effects to the last one immediately to just novelty status rather than for serious music listening too bad too because it contained some interesting but more minor themes in the series silly stuff like 16 inch guns firing torpedoes being fired bulldozers planes just for kids mainly br br
<START> from the title the tag line the plot summary on the dvd etc i expected something at least slightly epic with the historical fiction and the romance to thrill you that's what they did in last of the mohicans for example and i think they did a superb job maybe i had standards too high for this movie and didn't give it a fair chance but the scenery was barely ok how could they not come up with something more beautiful when they have such landscapes to work with the two lovers had no chemistry whatsoever and the plot was just so predictable it felt like it had been drafted in 5 minutes by a twelve year old and not a very imaginative one nouvelle france is a love story set in an eventful historical age but the history of nouvelle france is hardly a side note and the love story is banal and fails dramatically to make the viewer care for the lovers' fate surprisingly the only good parts about the movie came from something completely unexpected and the relationship between marie the heroine and her children one natural one adopted if only they'd concentrated on her family and forgotten about the love story it would have been a much better movie marie parents should have been given more screen time and character development the politics going on in britain should have been more than a three minute scene with barely any connection to the rest the rotten baddie should have been either more developed or removed from the script completely why hire actors like vincent perez tim roth or jason isaacs to misuse them so badly bad work overall
<START> at the very beginning the look at a control panel that reads 8 miles of the cost of california and no i didn't that they really did not realize the put of the cost instead of off the coast these people must have been morons br br it's good if you're into terrible movies but the sheer fact they couldn't catch a simple spelling issue make me believe they really didn't put any effort into creating the movie whatsoever the navy uniforms are not correct at all in any manner whatsoever br br wow completely ridiculous but good if you are looking for something insanely stupid to watch how these folks made any money off this is beyond me
<START> rated tv 14 for sexual content and language br br i remembered hearing about this show back in 1998 when it used to play on the channel i didn't watch it then but now it plays on the channel razer i have seen about four episodes of this show and i must say it is fairly intelligent and funny br br the show stars jason alexander of seinfeld fame and also tim curry of rocky horror picture show and it fame the show is about a duck who is a police officer he basically does his job as a policeman while coping with personal problems this show is fairly funny at times and fans of animated comedy will like this
<START> the giant claw is in fierce competition with films like 'robot monster' and 'plan 9 from outer space' for worst film of all time a phony looking giant attacks in this completely unconscious film the script is so bad that everything the characters say to one another is ridiculous it's no wonder that this film is a prime target in the movie it came from hollywood where this gem is hammered for the line 'a bird as big as a with gleeful endless the line pops up relentlessly through the course of the film so there's no escaping it there are several shots from 'the beast from 20 000 and 'earth vs the flying saucers' among other sci fi films from the 50's to beef up the scraggly attacks at one point the big is responsible for a few deaths so the military puts the entire world under martial law and no one is allowed to go out of their homes of course the huge buzzard is mainly concerned with pursuing the stars of this classic jeff morrow mara wherever they might be yet the director is so lame that he doesn't even provide for a few honey shots of pretty mara in a decent dress and black heels for a little relief from the tedium of this zero star thriller that's the second time this blunder has been made in mara struts around in hot dresses for the whole film but is relegated to pants throughout 'the giant the budget for this film must have been not more than thirty or forty thousand dollars and i doubt whether morrow or got more than three thousand to make it it looks like the whole thing was shot right out of somebody's garage
<START> michelle was so nice and i really fall in love with her she died a few months ago friends really the best movie of my youth the seasons reprise of elton and his arranger paul buckmaster sings in my head forever please if you know where i could find a vhs of the film mail me my husband of 26 years i saw this as juniors in hs yes he was my boyfriend then and still continues to be i think we both cried our eyes out i think possibly we were drawn to the movie by the elton john music in it but were then swept away by the teenage angst of it all paul and michelle were just about our ages when we saw the movie so very easy to identify with it is wonderful to hear that sean is doing well i am also in the helping professions an rn i thought his performance was good and very believable michelle came across as very sweet fragile and vulnerable i think the main theme is that if they didn't have to deal with the real world then they could be happy and continue to be in love how many times have all of us wanted to just have a moment if we all had no outside worries and could just deal with our basic needs it could be somewhat easier i have a 15 yr old daughter and wouldn't have a problem with her seeing this movie kids see so much worse these days that this is very tame for those of you who are trying to locate the cd my husband a huge elton john fan was able to get a 2 cd set which came out in 1992 it is called elton john rare masters polygram studios this has all the friends songs as well as many others as far as we know this is the only cd with the friends music we also had the lp years ago and were thrilled to find the cd good luck i recommend this movie for anyone who loves the young love theme i only wish it was on dvd now
<START> and are two that rob from the rich in order to give to well the rich comparatively they are the rich but we know they're the good guys because the chap behind the forces of law and order a mr chance is just so evil he rapes women or tries to he beats up his underlings he commits murder he has bad breath he doesn't shave properly he has no fashion sense he tortures puppy dogs that last one is just an inference of mine we don't actually see him torture puppy dogs but i'm sure he does little of chance's villainy has much to do with his pursuit of and it's just something he does in his spare time a kind of a hobby he takes up to make absolutely certain that we don't like him he needn't have tried so hard no one in this film is likeable br br let's take stock appealing characters there aren't any i believe we've covered that swashbuckling not a swash instead we have a kind of grimy heavy breathing dash sparkle vigour all gone the way of swashbuckling i'm afraid realism none of that either i think they were trying for realism since everyone was so filthy but the characters and action had all the plausibility of errol flynn with no sense of exhilaration to back them up beauty nope fine camera work for a tv crew perhaps humour you might giggle once or twice if you're in a benevolent mood then again you might not dialogue see humour' above music don't even get me started on the music the music in was by comparison uncannily apt and at least the misguided aesthetic of that score was a consistent one br br ugh i apologise to for even thinking about it in this context br br to sum up there's much positive badness here and nothing good unless you count liv tyler which i'm in two minds about doing br br i feel as though i've just written a review of the pox not very good ' the review says it would be much more interesting if i could somehow defend the pox to claim that critics of the pox have got it all wrong but i don't know how i'd go about doing that
<START> i have an affection for these twists on british social norms and it is rare that one loses me but our betters did lose me a bit it's a tale of social climbers and their joy at breaking the rules but personally i found it a little dull br br i liked the duchess though she whines a little too much and constance bennett amiably fills the role of lady a role that bette davis could have played backwards br br but the movie comes the life in the third act when ernest joins the party he is so lively and fun and in truth probably wears more makeup then lady he gets the last line of the film and it's a gas
