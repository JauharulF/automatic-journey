<START> one of the commenter's is wrong this is not the only pat patterson film and he didn't die two years after this was made he shot a film called the electric chair in nc he shot this a few years after doctor gore patterson died in the late 70's i know this because he used my house and he left a cat there it sucked also this was a big deal when the movie came out no independent horror films were being made in nc this movie didn't help matters patterson used to do gore effects for h g lewis he was also good at magic his gore scenes in body shop were actually well done the film was shot in a building that also housed a 7 11 you can actually see the tops of the walls in some scenes the budget was less that 20 000 and the script looked like a child wrote it only patterson could understand it still it's entertainment and it's a classic
<START> i hate vampire movies with that said this one was very interesting to me i do want to point out one thing tho literally means bat in korean and we all know that in many classic vampire stories you see count dracula or vampires turning into a bat and fly away or we also know that bats are mammals that can fly thus many them to be exceptional as i watched the film i realized that the theme of bat is deeply embedded in this movie more than just to make the bat vampire connection br br duality of human nature if you ever read fables there is this one fable where mammals and birds are fighting and a bat just can't seem to take a side and it tries to play both sides to his advantage mammals and birds find out what this bat has been doing and banish the bat out of their lands at the end of the story br br the two contradicting sides of human nature are constantly at battle throughout the film ex sang blind priest friend sang effort to quench thirst and his sexual desire tae ju playing both sides her ordinary boring life vs her thrill seeking vampire adventure etc won't ruin too much u have to watch the film and this theme is beautifully presented on a plate with delicious sides of romance sex violence religion dark comedy tragedy vengeance you name it br br i feel like many would find this movie boring and too long but this film is very fresh and new something that i haven't seen b4 yet i wouldn't say this is cw park's best work but it is mos def the strangest to comprehend yet darkly intriguing
<START> i was sitting at home and flipping channels when i ran across what potentially sounded like an interesting film i like destruction type movies and decided to watch it i don't know why but i ended up watching it the whole 2 hours we have seen this type of movie i don't know how many times br br back in 1998 2000 there were dozen of films that dealt with global destruction of some sort the best one on my list so far is deep impact which was more believable than this one here are my problems with this film 1 cheap special effects like something out of the old computer 2 no background information or explanation on weather patterns if you are going to make a movie about weather at least have some decency to entertain the viewer with technical details 3 how come only 2 or 3 people figure out that the storm is converging on chicago no more experts left in the field 4 where are some interesting characters i truly don't care for anyone except maybe the pregnant woman i felt that there was no character development 5 no thought provoking moment what so ever and factually incorrect theme and this is only the first part of the film i bet the conclusion will show us few destruction scenes and a search and rescue operation just like it has been done many times before and judging by the special effects in the first part of the movie i can only imagine what we are to expect of course at the end the main characters will survive and life will go on how original
<START> i do not fail to recognize haneke's above average film making skills for example i appreciate his lingering on unremarkable natural day lighted settings as a powerful way to force a strong sense of realism however regarding the content of this film i am very sad to see that in the 21st century there is still an urge to pathologize domination submission relations or feelings and or bdsm practices the problem that the main character has with her mother is unbelievably topical as is the alienation and uncomprehension felt by walter i don't mean the frustration of a lover which is not loved back in the same way which is understandable i mean that he looks upon her as if she were crazy or as if he was a monk come on i mean d s is not something new in the world and i think it is rather silly to treat the subject as if it were something freakish or pathological it isn't in general films dealing with this subject are really lagging behind the times br br so for me i feel that this film ends up being quite a programmatical film worried with very outdated psicoanalitical theories isn't it nearly embarrassing and that does not really relate with real life lives and experiences of those engaged in d s relationships personal experience forums irc chatrooms even recent scholar studies will show this
<START> film certainly can be a narrative medium but by no means is it the ideal medium literature best carries a plot because the reader can supply the imagination necessary to complete the structure film is appreciated best when viewed for what it is a series of images grouped together what soderbergh does in ocean's twelve is combine impeccable film making technique with the free flowing form of american movies from the 1970s from looking at the comments posted recently most people went in expecting a standard issue heist movie a la entrapment it seems people actually miss the tiresome clichÃ©s of romance disguised as tension between the leads and ridiculous plot twists designed to keep the audience awake soderbergh's directing prowess is reason alone to see this movie but close ups of pitt and zeta jones forty feet high on the screen don't hurt either a true treat for those who love the flickering of lights on the silver screen and a disappointment for those trying to make film something it's not
<START> as a cartoon the movie was pretty bad it is only 44 minutes long yet several battles occur culminating with the destruction of the cobra headquarters one downer was the very beginning of the movie an animated battle that was better than the rest of the movie turns out to have been some kind of battle simulation that right there was a major turn off and made the rest of the movie lack credibility then there was the issue of shipwreck tied up along with his parrot and tossed into some room where nobody had checked for several days whatever happened to surveillance cameras br br the cobra base only had a handful of characters and the rest were bat robots aside from a lot of corridors the cobra base did not seem to have any weapons tanks trucks or any other equipment then there was the silly notion that 100 complex androids could be created overnight the plot was silly even if this was intended for small children spongebob powerpuff girls and even barney the dinosaur give more attention to their plots br br the characters were not bad except that i could never understand anything was saying and the cobra commander was silly and not much of a villain in fact except for storm shadow and the rest of the cobra characters were comical and hardly impressive the gi joe characters were pretty good scarlett agent faces road block and snake eyes were my favorites here shipwreck and beach head were the worst shipwreck is written as a goof ball and beach head sounded like some 1990s surfer dude i guess the writer larry hama was trying to make a character that appealed to teenagers but he was a decade off the mark just listening to beach head's surfer talk fast times at ridgemont high i was wondering if the new gi joes were going to smoke a before the big mission br br the cgi was pretty good except that cobra commander had a jerking spastic walk and the vehicles did not look very realistic at all the flying tank and the explosions were not very impressive old style animation would have been much better than this since reportedly likes to do things cheap they got what they paid for i had trouble watching the whole thing it was just boring and lacked any soul or gi joe spirit even the old gi joe commercials would have been better in fact the dvd included extras such as four or five current commercials for gi joe spy troops and those commercials were much more entertaining than the movie the commercials had more kid oriented fun and spirit the commercials were lively while the movie was dull
<START> in my opinion the movie is an excellent example of the realities of war and a tribute to the soldiers of all nations who fought and bled into the soil gallipoli the lack of violence in no way detracted from the magnitude of the tale in hand it is honest true and brave just like the men that fought and died at the the lack of brutal depictions of violence are just and proper those men suffered enough for freedom liberty and the right to self determination in a free and better world they never wished to ever see such scene's again that is the legacy of the event of gallipoli to suffer scene's of gratuitous pyro and blood and gore is best not shown for the maintenance of proper respect for the combatants of this crucible of br br this film glories in the magnificence of men fighting for their lives with honour courage dignity and irrepressible spirit and humour in the face of appalling adversity this film is not interested in making a spectacle for fools to cheer over the brutal outcomes that from these personal combats of these men is not a thing that those that survived ever wished to see on a screen for entertainment they saw enough of that at the time and would much rather have never seen it at first and never wished to review such scenes again on a screen in the name of entertainment the brutal horrors of the actualities of the vicious combat fought at gallipoli were scenes that haunted their waking and sleeping hours for the rest of their natural days it was the painful internal scars they the men of all those nations who fought carried inside to their graves they all fought and many died in the face of it all and somehow they those mighty hearted men managed to laugh in the teeth of constant dread death because they would'nt insult their mates by not being prepared to die game beside them that's for brave game is but it applied to all combatants to a greater or lesser degree but word from the boy's that fought was that johhny was as game that is as brave as you would ever wish for a soldier to be br br and turks were fighting to establish their place on the world stage and from 25 04 15 onwards their respective claims for equality in were made known and undeniable to that world the director has made a masterpiece that truly honours the spirit and memory of those soldiers and serves as a reminder to future generations of all ages for children can be taken without fear of frightening them for the sake of visual horror and it's morbid and pointless appeal and children should attend this movie so as to learn what happened at that sacred shore before they were born so that they can remember for it is the nature of men that they soon forget
<START> just to let everyone know this is possibly the worst movie i have ever seen and i've seen pretty much everything if you're thinking of renting it don't it's not worth the cardboard container that it came in
<START> personally i regard the egyptian in an extremely favourable light br br it was introduced to me by a well known australian movie commenter critic named bill who was renowned for his insight broad vision of people places particularly of films this movie fitted the bill perfectly i came to appreciate his commentary enthusiasm for this movie that emerged all the more as i watched it as i was literally drawn into it minute by minute beyond his introductory comments on my initial viewing many years ago br br to me it was propelled layer upon layer within half an hour into an intriguing fascinating production yes i am aware of its flaws but it was so enticing Â the young man of idealism learning from inspired by his father Â the peasant treated like rubbish in his suffering Â the opportunistic friend however flawed but nonetheless loved by his friend the central character Â and to be sure a flawed hero too like so many across humanity of all societies across all lovable worthy of love too yes i believe in a christian god but too i acknowledge the rights respect that should be due any human being of good heart who would not or will not disrespect the rights of his without just cause as such i endorse this film its presentation of a man of good heart conviction in his belief in the sun god he was devoted to such people will always be welcome in my world vision and hopefully in many more beyond br br so too the drama in the ensuing movie i have watched often as surely as it has touched my heart soul as surely as it seems to have infuriated critics in its era it is captivating watching the struggles grief loves of the physician when i watch it again i am always reminded of my friend in heart bill the film critic who dared to oppose all the critics long ago who it he added criticism of too many critics Â that they make statues to honour stars on the screen or in history but they do not make statues to honour critics and beyond all this i am reminded with each viewing of a superb touching spectacle of a beautiful well presented drama that was not just relevant to the 1950s or some bygone era it was meant for you me across time place to every man woman child to their personal aspirations for love freedom overcoming obstacles to misunderstanding gross injustice tragedy appealing to those of simple faith of many religions that it seems too many regard as cause for war take a night off from invitations or unjust violence from bigotry judgemental attacks on others executed consider the merits of this offering not to the sun god or to power that proves time again to be so let this outstanding movie wash over you like waves onto a beach like the passing hands of time Â like life was meant to be and maybe you will find yourself carried into its world of possibilities lost offerings no more 9 9 out of 10
<START> anatole litvak directed the 1959 film the journey starring yul brynner deborah kerr robert morley e g marshall anne jackson and jason robards br br the film takes place during the 1956 hungarian uprising and concerns a group of travelers having problems getting out of budapest because of political problems in that part of the world they are put on a bus to vienna but the russians led by major brynner their passports and hold them for questioning one of the passengers is paul fleming robards posing as an american but in reality a hungarian freedom fighter whom the major believes is being smuggled out of hungary in fact lady kerr is hiding him she becomes the focus of the romantic attentions br br very good film that conveys the tension and hassle of the cold war and all of the performances are wonderful brynner is particularly excellent as the passionate major who isn't all bad and anne jackson gives a realistic powerful performance as a pregnant woman who doesn't want her child born in a communist country br br good script good director good cast there should be more films like this highly recommended
<START> it would be wrong and reprehensible of me to advise you to watch killjoy 2 you must have better things to do washing the car throwing stones in a stream but at the same time it's nowhere near as awful as you probably think it is it's almost a proper film which a lot more than most straight to dvd sludge can manage killjoy 2 is helped a great deal by trent manic turn as the eponymous clown he throws himself into the role with such fevered abandonment that he almost tips the scales in the movie's favour but of course it takes more than one man in big shoes tammi sutton gives the most entertaining director cameo since roger corman in creature from the haunted sea and the whole thing is nearly destroyed by the rushed sugary ending all over the place and almost good fun
<START> i tried god knows i tried to like this swiss cheese of a movie but the story was too full of holes some big enough to drive a horse drawn carriage through the acting overall was even and the characters endearing enough that you regretted they died off like recently sprayed roaches scattering off to die their own gruesome deaths overall however it was not really very scary afterall we have seen spooky quickly moving figures in the background since the brood why back when and it was scary then just briefly this film just never resolved the basic plot points and thats the writer's job naturally you would expect the director to pick up on the fact that the story did not make sense like who's was the secret room behind the wardrobe why did the blood hungry ghost not die when she received the nails as prescribed by the book they read earlier why did the computer say game over for frankie's character even though he lived the list goes on and on i don't really feel comfortable recommending this film as its makes you feel like you wasted your time and there was not enough payoff in truly scary moments
<START> the one line summary is actually the punch line of a very old joke that begins what is a jewish porno film br br while this film had its interesting moments it was far too slow moving and did not do enough to explain to those of us in the audience unfamiliar with orthodox jewish custom exactly what was going on and why how many people who came across this film would know that the bathtub the female characters were washing in is in reality called a which is a ritual bath used to cleanse spiritual the same question might be asked of why the bride was walked around the groom a dizzying number of times while her face was covered just prior to the marriage vows being performed these two examples are but two of a large number of such moments that remained completely unexplained to the uninitiated audience br br this film does have its touching moments along with expressions of great love and emotions the characters are presented very authentically right down to the number of garments an ultra orthodox jewish male must wear as well as the religious rituals he must engage in upon awakening in the morning to begin his day the attitudes orthodox judaism has towards women in general and wives in particular is both intriguing and at times maddening this is another reason why more explanation is needed if this story is to be understood in context br br i recommend this film to people who are familiar with orthodox jewish tradition and ritual as well as those who might be interested in getting a brief peek at what the lives of people who practice this way of life is like br br the story itself about two sisters who in their own ways rebel against the system is of moderate interest at best
<START> found this movie in a rental store never heard about it before but it was a good movie great acting and thrilling story line great kudos to vincent ventresca he made thomas character very attractive and brought a special atmosphere to this movie br br nj br br
