<START> the man who knew too much falls into that hitchcock middle ground that characterized many of his films during the 1950s not a masterpiece of suspense by any means but an awful lot of fun nonetheless br br james stewart and doris day play a vacationing couple who get caught up in a plot heavy on foreign intrigue the famous climactic scene takes place at a classical music concert where someone is going to be assassinated during a particular cymbal clash in the score the impish hitchcock of course lets us know what that point is so that the race to stop the assassin becomes a nail biting race against the br br so much of this movie reminded me of the 1978 chevy chase goldie hawn comedy foul play that i have to believe that film was inspired by this neither film is a big deal but both are easy to enjoy br br grade b
<START> while killing time on a saturday morning looking for lola came on hbo i decided to give it a shot even though the description of the movie looked pretty bad it was even worse than i could imagine the movie was incredibly unbelievable and there was absolutely no on screen chemistry between the lead actors that i found myself shaking my head almost every 10 minutes between mike lead actor in scenes in which he skips the bill at a fancy restaurant and where lola lead actress allows him to use her boss' house to fool his parents into thinking he's rich it was almost as bad as him daydreaming about people around him doing the macarena it was horrible and the two actors ultimately falling in love i kept wanting to change the channel but i was trying to give it every chance into becoming a cute love story with a few chuckles it never did in fact it became so bad that i decided to finish it just so i can claim that i watched one of the worst films ever made in it's entirety instead of being criticized for not giving it a fair chance the last scene where lola tries out for a dance part was the culmination of the movie she comes in late after getting married even that scene where mike tells the priest to hurry up and then just snatches the papers away claiming that it's done was in tune with the believability of this movie and then somehow convinces the judges to give her a look the two male judges are already put off with how late she is but after watching her waif around the stage ok she dances fine but not overly impressive everybody joins in including lola and mike's families other dancers that were there and cough even the judges bad horrible terrible it was so bad i had to write a review watch at your own risk
<START> top gun without the in house animosity or class or money or cruise an excuse for an upwardly mobile cast of next big thing actors to market their ability to lead a matinÃ©e this doesn't really have anything anyone can get their teeth into it's a shame because the opening shot of charlie sheen opens out with great promise which is squandered almost straight away with a preposterous wedding set piece barking br br dennis haysbert is a changeable actor for me but in this film he is fine particularly the action sequences michael biehn is a first class action hero but not a leading man charlie sheen is to all intents and purposes the leading man but never quite an action hero there's a stunt cast of hundreds who are also 3 10
<START> jon cryer reprises his role as a neurotic guy in two and a half men which he perfected in this series he longs to have a good relationship with a girl like his coworker has developed and the tet a tet between him and his partner's girlfriend's best friend are pretty funny then they realize that they're attracted to each other and start dating in one of the funniest lines on tv ever i think in the final episode he and his partner are discussing that he wants to propose to the girl br br his partner prepares him for the moment by suggesting what's the worst that can happen she says no br br armed with newfound optimism he proposes to his date over dinner to which she replies br br god no br br i laughed so hard i cried
<START> terrific movie if you did not watch yet you must watch geena davis and samuel l jackson are amazing in this movie br br great actors good story incredible action scenes the long kiss goodnight br br i give it a 10 a 4 stars
<START> what can be said about one of the greatest n64 games ever that the action is fast enough to keep even a seasoned fps veteran sweating bullets quite literally that the graphics are great down to the explosions that everyone loves to see that nothing is quite as fun as playing multiplayer mode and shooting your friends and siblings in the back with submachine guns br br very little beats goldeneye 007 about the only thing missing was voice acting and a bit more intelligence in the enemy soldiers if you have an n64 and you like shooting people and things crossed with espionage get a copy of this
<START> the movie jennifer with ida lupino and howard duff is film noir magnificence this is a mostly unknown movie that all film noir fans should see jennifer was filmed with the most unusual camera angles for that time which made the movie have a surreal like quality at times i love the stark black and white film noir movies film noir in color is not as good the cast and script is excellent the rather creepy music is fun to listen to ida lupino is one of the best and talented actresses to ever grace the screen i have never seen a production that she was in that i did not like she was not only breathtakingly beautiful she was a fine actress the first movie that i remember seeing ida lupino in was roadhouse with richard widmark and cornel wilde i never forgot the movie or her i saw her last films like food of the gods and women in chains and even though the movies were not her usual fare she was still delightful in them as an actress howard duff is always terrific to watch i highly recommend this masterpiece to everyone i have this movie on vhs tape
<START> i didn't really get this movie because i'm not some perv like you who is into lesbian stuff br br the girl in the red wig tries too hard to be funny her lips are so silicone but she's really lame and insecure she tries to come off like a surfer guy better than dressing slutty but still weird and definitely the movie doesn't explain why she's trying to pass herself off as a man oh right to get the poor dumb girl i forgot she makes all these dumb inventions which are not funny and she's a really lousy actress plus that waif look is so out br br this dumb blond girl from melrose place plays surprise a dumb blond br br she thinks the girl in the wig is a guy they even make out ewww i guess that part was sort of funny
<START> this is a quirky heist caper film one that seems predictable at first then keeps surprising until the last scene the protagonist is a grifter who goes to work in a little carnival where he's paid to kill the manager's belly dancer wife then ends up falling for her himself she's alluring tricky and deadly and she keeps disappearing and popping up again like some sort of magician's trick the film's other props include her duplicitous husband employer played by the talented armand assante some nasty dominican mobsters and most important to the plot a suitcase full of money just like the old shell game the one where you have to guess which one the under you'll be guessing who's got the money and like the victims of the hucksters who run such games you'll probably guess wrong as lovely is a talented performer and an eyeful whether she's dancing with the huge snake around her shoulders or working her grift on all the unfortunate men in her orbit norman reedus is fine as the young con who is by the elusive beauty he was paid to kill don't count him out however for he turns out to be smarter than anyone gave him credit for this oddball film is worth a look
<START> since this show was changed from the screen to attack of the show it has gone down hill with yoshi and kevin rose alex etc made the show awesome then they got fired from for an unknown reason when the show switched to it became less about computers and more about gaming and magazines it also promoted bands that nobody had heard of or cared about finally i couldn't watch it anymore once kevin rose left he kept it interesting but he went off to do his own thing which is good kevin rose now has several online pod casts and shows etc on the rev 3 network check it out com i think you can get to it by going to www org if you want a real tech show rather than then go watch kevin roses shows or listen to the twit br br j
<START> a clever overall story location for a story action is respectable the children are annoying and their motivation is unclear the leading villain was a nice change but could have been better i love you was more overplayed than you complete me but at least van damme got a chance to show a little tenderness one of van damme's better movies
<START> this movie started out cringe worthy but it was meant to with an overbearing mother a witch of a rival and a hesitant beauty queen constantly coming in second there was some goofy overacting and a few implausible plot points she comes in second in every single competition all of them unfortunately the movie suffers horribly from it's need to well be a tv movie rather than end at the ending of the movie an amusing twist in which the killer is semi plausibly revealed the movie continues for another twenty minutes just to make sure that justice is done of course now that the killer is revealed she suddenly undergoes a complete personality shift her character gets completely rewritten because the writers don't need to keep her identity secret any more the cheese completely sinks what otherwise could have been a passably amusing movie
<START> the dune miniseries opens with a flashforward montage of action sequences the realisation quickly dawns that these are the best scenes out of the minute running time and they're not good not good at all oh dear br br but let us not judge a book by its cover even though that's exactly what we're being invited to do let's give dune a chance to redeem itself br br well here's the expected watery opening on but who's this petulant strangely ugly man paul atreides this is paul atreides this generic plastic puppet and why does he look so old what's that the actor's only 25 well he doesn't look it and that's way too old anyway br br but at least he has charisma right wrong alec newman is a stumbling mumbling buffoon i'm picturing him being discovered sitting in the dark in a remedial acting class because nobody liked him enough to tell him the class was over and he's just too dumb to realise it when your paul atreides has all the screen prescence of soggy toast and an acting range from petulant to blank your production of dune is doomed from the start br br the other actors take pity on poor alec though and give uniformly insipid and incomprehensible performances so that he doesn't look too bad by comparison at least i assume that is what they are doing because i'm charitable you see br br to be fair they are clearly being given no direction at all random gestures blank or inconsistent deliveries missing their marks it's all here this is like a master class in how not to do it br br and sure there are more elements of the book in this miniseries than there are in the 1984 movie but there aren't twice as many because of all the pauses to fill time br br but we can forgive all this because of the small budget of 20 million or only 5 million per hour nobody could be expected make quality science fiction on that sort of budget br br except perhaps stargate sg 1 which makes do with 1 4 million per 50 minute episode or farscape at 2 million and frankly i'd rather watch four episodes of either of those while being punched in the kidneys than have to sit though the travesty that is dune the miniseries again
<START> yes let's get this out of the way before we begin this is the one that sean connery returned to in 1983 after the stint we had of roger moore it's connery's last film and yes it's a kind of remake of thunderball but more of a film inspired by it if all you bond purists out there think i'm gonna get controversial you're right bond is one of the greatest movie series ever but that doesn't mean that a series should go on forever this i think is one of two films where they could've done themselves a huge favour and ended the bond saga not offended yet then i'll continue hey if you're thinking i'm indifferent about bond flicks you're wrong i grew up with my mum being obsessed with them any spare moment bond and his antics would be on the tv bond rules and 'never say never again' directed by irvin strikes back' kershner is one of the best it may not be 'goldfinger' or 'from russia ' and may not have been done by the same production house as all the others which i hear is why they refuse to accept it was ever made but still stands head and shoulders above the recent brosnan outings if you haven't spat at the screen read on characterization something so many blockbuster films forget about these days but something which is essential to telling a good story played a superb hand by treating 007 like he had been ageing since 'dr no' he's 'getting on a and so has to do things like go to a health farm a direct order from 'm' yeah if you haven't seen this film i won't give too much away with the plot because a loads happens and b obviously i want you to see it for yourselves don't be put off by my 'old revelation connery still get plenty of superb set pieces to charge swim punch speed smash and snog his way through the man is a legend and this film is one of his most enjoyable outings as bond high tech gadgets galore some great villains and an excellent supporting cast including a fantastic cameo by rowan atkinson lift this movie high above audience expectation br br this could've been the last bond film ever and it would've been a party to remember playing the secret agent as someone nearing retirement was refreshing stroke of genius the last scene wraps things up perfectly for the series but still we had more and then more and more still and one more moore still if you fancy finding out what blush is all about get this film then you can at least pretend 007 spent his last moments as a wisecracking secret agent in the arms of kim basinger and smirking at mr bean p s that other film that i think could've finished it all off the gritty to kill'
<START> what often gets overlooked in agatha christie's stories is her progressive anti conservative attitude on a number of issues from the role of women to the effects of tradition to people's belief in the supernatural in nemesis you can spot a lot of those subtexts but you can also find a good old fashioned intriguing mystery that keeps you in the dark for most of its length also lifting nemesis above other series entries they do it with mirrors 4 50 from etc is the fact that in the crucial moments before and after the revelation of the killer you can actually feel the suspense and finally jane booker is welcome to guard my body any time
