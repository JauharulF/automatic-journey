<START> after traveling around the world it dawned on me that australia really lacks one thing that other countries have history br br fortunately or unfortunately australia wasn't establish following a war it has not had a civil war and most of its political history is rather boring nothing big happened to mark some sort of turning point in australia's history until the dismissal of the government by the governor general of australia john kerr br br for those who are australian you can skip this paragraph and move onto the next this is for the benefit of curious non australians australia was colonised by the british as time went on it became apparent that australia was capable of standing on its own two feet accordingly the uk granted australia permission to establish its own laws courts and so on the law and politics of australia would no longer be provided directly from the british rather australia would be run by australians in their own right even though the courts precedents parliament and so on is largely modeled on the british system this shift was in the australian constitution despite the fact that the constitution establishes australian governments law making procedures courts but for those who are curious no bill of rights their are two pro crown sections that were included and remain there to this day these are more or less regarded as the reserve powers of the crown king queen of great britain the first group of sections relates to the creation of the office of the governor general briefly the governor general is considered the queen's chief representative in australia and is described as the executive branch of the australian government when a piece of law is passed by the australian parliament the constitution states that it only becomes law when it is signed by the governor general as such the general is regarded by some as nothing more than a rubber stamper performing an archaic and unnecessary constitutional function on behalf of the crown theoretically the governor general can refuse to sign a law passed by australian parliament if he thinks fit for instance if parliament passed a law which allows the police to shoot dead any australian over the age of 50 hypothetically of course then the gg could refuse to sign it and it would not become the law of the land however this power is theoretical and has to date never been exercised by convention which is the buzz word of the events leading to the dismissal the governor general virtually acts at the behest of the australian government and therefore if the government passes law and the prime minister instructs the governor general to sign it he will almost always without question in fact by convention the governor general acts in accordance with the advice provided to him by the prime minister of the day and the prime minister alone the second aspect is section 64 of the constitution which states that the government ministers hold office at the governor general's pleasure now the events of 1975 covered in this film gave rise to a precedent on this particular section if the governor general is somehow with the government and or prime minister it would appear that this section allows him to sack the government which happened in 1975 hence the title of the film the dismissal whether 'at the governor general's can be construed as the unfettered right to dismiss is a contentious point though that led to rather heated exchanges amongst australians at the time especially considering that the governor general is not elected by the people of australia br br now that this background aspect is out of the way let's get back to discussing the film it was well made the pace was patient but didn't drag at all the drama was well contained and very realistic it didn't over the events and most importantly it did not present its point of view from one political perspective on the contrary i felt that it was fair and balanced even though concluding text before the credits indicates that the film makers probably didn't approve of the governor general's decision to dismiss the government but i wouldn't describe the film overall as bias in one direction or the other br br in terms of accuracy it was virtually spot on the film makers certainly did their homework and evidently read the books and writings from all the principle players concerned there were a number of finer details that were somewhat skipped over largely because they took a long time to explain and ultimately had little impact on the events of 1975 so i forgive them for that further i think it was difficult to recreate the public sentiment of that post vietnam war era but pretty much pulled it off br br finally i was pleased that the film attempted to raise individual policies of both sides without becoming analytical obsessive or judgmental over them moreover any that we're raised for example connor's pipeline had a great deal of relevance to the story the film makers realised that their task was to tell the story of the events leading to the dismissal and not to present a political endorsement or opposition in relation to policies and viewpoints this was smart because it meant that the film can't be accused of one side's policies br br the dismissal is probably the most incredible piece of political history that has occurred in australia in its short life i am glad that it has been crystallized in celluloid essential viewing for any australian
<START> hick trek is clearly a film that is envious of even an el mariachi level budget 7 000 still the creators are able to pull off decent effects at times often due to great editing such as the the situations aboard the cat ship and slim t unique way of communicating with his ship without use of a traditional communication device br br the acting does have its rough spots but the portrayal of horns is excellent and fluffy is certainly not too hard on the eyes br br i do wish that the film had been longer than its approximate hour and that should be seen as a compliment this movie is a success due to the sincerity and hard work of those involved
<START> a twist of fate puts a black man at the head of an old school white bred advertising firm and he intends to make a few changes br br one very strange piece of cinema you'll either love it or hate it either way you've never seen anything like it
<START> the worst film ever made bar none give yourself a pat on the back if you can possibly sit through every excruciatingly painful minute of it except for the bit where the hard luck loser turned deranged psychopath from forced medical experimentation pours his pea soup on the doctor's head and laughs like any good raving lunatic should that's all
<START> a film of high intelligence and activity as well as being a strong capsule of the time and persona that was the 60's the film is also truly a surprise in its forward thinking themes and the unique presentation of the system of power in a group william greaves appoints himself to the authoritative role in the group he asks his crew members to film and film and keep filming first the two actors then the crew filming the actors then the entire set including bystanders policemen and finally a homeless man whose been living in bushes in central park for 9 weeks br br greaves edits the film thousands of feet together and surprisingly makes a strong narrative with an interesting arc and motivations don't expect to be bored by this film each of crew make for engaging and often times are voicing the thoughts that the observer has watching this film greaves does well at integrating the multiple camera takes using synchronized three in one pictures and other attention shifting methods br br in the end the film will really only be effective if it's what you're looking for if you're looking for some abstract arty film that feeds your own self indulgent ego while never having a point look elsewhere if you're looking for a film that will have you talking and thinking long afterward about the desire for honesty and sincerity in documented reality and the inevitable transparency that comes of it then this is the perfect film
<START> i was very surprised to learn that goldie hawn won an oscar for this film she seemed very lifeless and completely schooled by the 54 year old bergman in the scenes where they are side by side if it had been written today i think that bergman and the young man ivan would have wound up together ingrid is so much hotter than goldie and the two self absorbed characters played by matthau and hawn would be left out in the cold but it was written at the end of 60's and feels like plaza suite or barefoot in the park however matthau's one liners hawn's innocence and bergman's classy performance make this quite pleasant to watch
<START> ah how refreshing to see a vision of 18th century england complete with mud the pox and and accompanied by a delightful techno soundtrack to boot this is the story of downtrodden highwayman robert carlisle and gentleman fallen on hard times captain jonny lee miller and how they get together and rob the pigs is a hard nut but is far too polite for that and thus becomes 'the gentleman he falls in love with lady rebecca liv tyler who to be frank is the only weak part of the whole shebang and wants to impress her br br the costumes are fantastic big colourful historically beautiful togs alan cummings gets all the best threads and the best lines as lord rochester sporting a very non 18th century eyebrow piercing the music shifts between swooping glorious choirs and thumping bass laden techno which doesn't as you think it should do in a historical film the script is fast moving and peppered with modern day colloquialisms merchant ivory this is not there are hilarious parts disgusting parts sit on the edge of your seat and nibble your fingernails parts but the whole thing chugs along and is wonderfully entertaining throughout this is cheer in the cinema stuff unmissable
<START> truly unique and stunning film of jules verne's for the flag by the czech master director karel zeman although the story is enacted in a rather understated late victorian style the visuals are a knockout zeman uses animation graphics painted sets model animation combined with live action to create the atmosphere of verne that the reader associates in his mind the style resembles the steel of dore and bennet and that illustrated these stories with a healthy dose of georges melies added photographed in beautiful black and white the animation is of the highest order and not of a saturday morning variety there are underwater sequences where the fishes swimming about are so accurately drawn they can be used in a field guide there are images of ships submarines flying craft castles and machinery that are drawn in such accurate detail that one must have a freeze frame on his vcr or dvd to pause the scene and study the remarkable detail that went into this production the late victorian atmosphere is designed to look like this world that never was and delight us in the magic of science that made verne the great father of the genre if this is not enough there also is the film score that probably is one of the best ever created for a fantasy or sci fi film truly a forgotten classic this one is worth hunting down and buying always one of my favorite films of all times it is sure to be one of yours too and remember this was done decades before cgi or computer animation kudos to the great artists who obviously put their heart into it it shows jules verne himself would be proud of this movie a film that deserves to be better known but those who have seen it love it and treasure it an outstanding achievement this remarkable film just gets better every time you watch it a true cinematic work of art from a visionary director
<START> i have been watching lost with my family since the first episode it used to be great the last season it was very disappointing it seems as if they writers don't know what to do with the show so they keep trying to make it up for it by stretching one story line in a whole episode the present season which by the way i decided to keep watching only to see rodrigo and also with a tiny little hope that things would get better has been one disappointment after another my husband and son even stopped watching first of all he only appears for 30 seconds in each episode but the real problem is with the story line there is nothing really happening each episode could be shown in 15 minutes we watch each episode waiting for something that never happens i am not asking that every secret be revealed at once but how about some variation in the story lines in the first and second seasons we had different story lines we saw the characters history a little action a little romance now is like one big event that takes the whole episode to unveil it is almost tiring to watch it when it finishes you have a feeling that you lost your time now it is important to note that the actors still great i can't believe they killed mr eko he was great jack mathew fox is still incredible the perfect hero so kind magnanimous brave sawyer josh holloway the bad boy is kind of because of kate evangeline but that's cool i miss sayid andrews sun and jin yoon jin kim daniel kim they are all an important part of the plot or should be but we barely see them i hope paulo rodrigo will have a big part on the show if not why did you make such a big deal of him joining the show access hollywood etc sorry if i've been rumbling for too long but i feel cheated by this show when i started watching it was great i got used to it and now it is very disappointing to see the way it is going i'll be here hoping for the improvements katia
<START> i've just watched this again on the bbc channel 4 it's not jane austen's best novel by any means but the film is a reasonable interpretation i suspect the assembly rooms at bath would have been rather more crowded than shown perhaps they couldn't afford the extras also why does everyone shut up so that the dancing couple can have an audible conversation i've never heard anything anyone has ever said to me when i've been dancing and i suspect it would have been the same in the 18 19th century in bath br br i cannot believe the us canada reviews they completely miss the ironic element that is in the film throughout the gothic scenes are quite cleverly presented but you need to read them properly i'm sure jane a would be mildly amused by those reviews a of nothing does anyone else think that peter firth gets to look more like colin baker a former doctor who or vice versa the older they both get
<START> there is no fun poking fun at the desperate plight of illegal immigrants or the desperate plight of head shop owners for that matter that the richer than god brian didn't see the irony of having the heroes do exactly what the villain does rob honest hardworking people of their life savings doesn't surprise me hell how do you think he got to be richer than god br br in this alleged satire about greed these mental midgets reveal their own hypocrisy the the the the who are paid peanuts to take care of the the and the but the main problem aside from the revolting bigotry is the premise as the former executive of a now infamous company dick would be the big scalp for every corporate in the country no soup kitchens for him and raking in high six figures you'd think he wouldn't be caught dead around a gore poster
<START> piece of junk would've given it a 0 if i could have animation is good but not quite good enough storyline is absolutely the most ridiculous i've ever come across and that's saying a lot this 'movie' tried so hard to be interesting but failed miserably it's almost as if the writer started one story then got another idea and attempted to mesh the two together don't waste your time on this believe me you'll be as ticked off with yourself as i was the only actor of any note in this was james woods and his part was peripheral at best i'm all for doing stuff that is edgy that pushes the envelopes but this simply didn't cut it
<START> the nyt review says that sigourney weaver's character is taut and frustrated and later that she could be the sister of character in ordinary people say what no way this lady was quirky from the start nothing like mtm in ordinary people sorry br br next the nyt goes on to say that sigourney weaver's sandy travis and jeff daniel's ben travis are 40 something year olds children of the 60s ms weaver must be dancing a jig i believe at the time she made imaginary heroes she was in fact 55 years old she was born in 1949 br br nyt perception corrections aside this was a pretty good movie considering it was made by someone so young obviously sigourney weaver thought so and so did jeff daniels the young man playing tim was outstanding br br there are some critical comments i could make about the script such as that i never really got a good sense of why sandy travis missed her son her sort of blown apart behavior was perhaps triggered by his death but that such behavior lasted Â¾ of the way through the film i felt had more to do with her stagnation marriage her relationship with tim and where he really came from and other unresolved issues than from any mourning of her elder son ben's mourning was much more clear br br so matt travis was an asshole did his mom think so too still a very watchable film what is becoming clearer and clearer is not that there are no roles for women over a certain age rather that what it takes is a director such as this one to be so clearly in love with an older woman ms weaver and to almost make his film an homage to her sort of an anti woody allen
<START> congratulations to christina ricci for making this movie and putting her mojo behind this important subject and trying to make a great film ricci is my favorite actress she is so gifted so natural her reactions are perfect and so is the energy she constantly radiates which gives credence to the often term star br br the film misses its mark for lots of various reasons but perhaps most notably for the story's seeming to the screen in making it a compelling narrative more on that later the cast at first glance is excellent but come to think of it jessica lang as the jewish mother is too protestant and not exactly right ann doesn't come close to showing the compassion and dedication of the psychiatrist from the book and when your making a movie how can you justify saying no to anne heche and jessica lange but the real problems are in the film's construction first in the failure to elicit any kind of lasting sympathy for the elizabeth character and second to say anything meaningful regarding the all too common and horrible situation that this poor girl finds herself in br br unfortunately do to the flashback construction lizzy merely comes off as certainly more affected teenager than most but not nearly as devastatingly ill as she comes off in the book this is a major problem this story had to be told from beginning to end and from the therapist's couch she is only eight or nine when her depression starts due to devastating social factors both society and the home and this is a crucial point in not only eliciting the proper sympathy for her but also of the gravitas of her case she is so talented and such a vulnerable and disaffected spirit so early on that one's heart can't help but reach out to her due to her victimization this is missed on the film br br ultimately one has to come to terms with what the film is trying to say it is a biopic of one severely affected girl but also it is a film about a nation who can't get its act together that is very clear in the book but interestingly not in the film where the chosen at harvard are even more messed up than the average college the film finally isn't able to get either of these messages across compellingly and that's too bad is prozac a good thing or is it a bad thing or a mixed blessing or a seeming necessity in a country in which so many people can't function without a chemical crutch these are tough and challenging concepts to work with and the writing does not really attempt to address any of them in a more or less engaging way the challenger disaster is an interesting image to symbolize a dysfunctional america but that doesn't have the effect it's suppose to have due to the crosscutting and insufficient earlier development of controlling themes br br ricci's performance is tight and heartfelt and one of the best of her acting career br br michele williams is also superb in her role
<START> by far this has to be one of the worst movies i've ever seen in my life i watch practically every movie that is on at night either showtime hbo cinemax etc three aka survivor island keeps you in as much suspense as watching paint dry only to let you down even more miserably if you want to feel like you just wasted what seems like an eternity on the worst film ever created then by all means watch this movie i must have screamed at a minimum 900 times from the idiotic twists if i had 4 hands i'd give this movie 4 thumbs down br br in my personal opinion i believe the only people who would like this movie are those with terrible morals
