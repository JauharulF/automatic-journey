<START> so tell me what serious boozer drinks budweiser how many suicidally obsessed drinkers house a fully stocked and barely touched range of drinks in their lonely motel room that a millionaire bachelor pad bar would be proud to boast and what kind of an alcoholic tends to drink with the bottle held about 8 inches from his hungry mouth so that the contents generally spill all over his face not to mention wasting good whisky by dousing your girlfriend's tits with it just so the cinema audience can get a good eyeful of elisabeth shue's assets br br cage seems to be portraying the most attention seeking look at me alcoholic ever to have graced the screen while shue looks more like a berkely preppy slumming it for a summer than some seasoned street walker she is humiliated and subjugated as often as possible in this revolting movie with beatings skin lacerations anal rape and graphic verbal abuse all of it completely implausible and included apparently only to convey a sense of her horribly demeaned state and offer the male viewers an astonishingly clichÃ©d sentimental sexual fantasy of the with a heart' br br still i did watch it to the end by which time i was actually laughing out loud as shue's tough street hooker chopped carrots in the kitchen pathetically smiling while cage all eyes popping and shaking like like a man operating a road drill in an earthquake and mugged his way through the final half hour
<START> i have been a huge rush fan ever since moving pictures and this concert is simply and example to everyone who is a fan why rush is so popular they completely admitted to playing their biggest concert yet and despite the rain in a soccer arena they still manage to give an outstanding performance from start to finish a real example of this is during the entire crowd start to sing along to it in a real classic manner in perfect they really play all of everyone's favorite songs with a real powerful lust that rarely happens anymore you get the best seat in the house for one of their best concerts given the second dvd is a fascinating documentary of the band while they are in brazil and shows you a lot of the backstage things going on and it allows you to see them not just a musicians but as actual people in their everyday life this dvd gift set is a must for any rush fan young and old and is definitely a keeper for your dvd collection their is even a cd of the concert for those who just want to listen to the music this dvd is worth it
<START> ugghhh this is exactly the sort of pre code film that could incorrectly convince the viewer that films from this time period are lousy and they are not it's just that this particular film is horrid horrid because while the film tries very hard to be hip and adult it also is so hopelessly old fashioned dull and hokey that i was torn between laughing at the film or just falling asleep this is a unique combination to say the least br br so why exactly did i hate it so much well the film is incredibly sleazy but has no style and the film is meant to shock but lacks subtlety and takes too many ridiculous turns to be believable the film begins with a clichÃ© a hooker with a heart of gold dorothy is a prostitute and she appears to accidentally kill a man shortly after making her escape she meets up with an old boyfriend who insists on marrying her he doesn't realize her profession seeing this man's innate goodness she determines to change her life and stop living the wild life this is tough when she hides out on a fictional caribbean island here alone and waiting for her man to return there is nothing to do and the place is infested with super horny and totally unappealing men in fact this portion of the movie is so dull that the audience might have a hard time staying focused the men on the island are so by the presence of that they perpetually seem on the verge of raping her only to be rebuffed because she isn't that sort of girl any more frankly i got very tired of all these salacious scenes there is simply too much eye rolling and tongue wagging to make it seem anything other than a very bad film and looking at all these ugly horn dogs was just annoying and stupid br br but wait it gets a lot worse the man she thought she killed shows up on this tiny island what are the odds and he tries to rape her as well however he's not to be dissuaded and she ends up shooting to save her new found virtue while the jury on the island is about to acquit her she rushes back into court and lies telling them she meant to kill the man and it was premeditated because even if she's acquitted she knows the evil jailer will have his way with her when she is sent to jail for a gun possession charge given that the jailer himself gave her the gun to set her up her rushing into the court and saying she was guilty seemed really really silly why didn't she just tell them the twisted plan supposedly she did this in order to preserve her virtue but to admit to killing someone so people will think you are a virgin so in order to avoid a short jail sentence and once again the threat of rape she doesn't consider telling the court that he is trying to force her into a sexually compromising situation the jailer has promised to rape her when she is locked up and just before she is taken to the gallows in order to avoid the rape the boyfriend shows up in time for her to send him off and the credits roll br br impossible situation and coincidences abound coming so often that the film is just dumb combining this with all the sexual innuendo this makes for a bad and sleazy mess of a film which will only appeal to the most die hard fans of pre code films all others beware this is very sticky and silly from start to finish
<START> i was fortunate enough to see the last stop here where i live at the moving pictures film festival for those of you that don't know the moving pictures film festival is a tour of canadian made film in canada i was told just before the movie started that it was the world premiere and that it was on the verge of getting an american distribution deal which added to my excitement br br i'm a big horror movie fan and yes i love the scream trilogy as well so when i found out that rose was doing a ten little indians type of movie i knew that i was in for a treat rose was the biggest name actor actress at the entire festival br br the best way i can describe it without giving away too much of the plot is that it's not quite like scream and it certainly is worth seeing it's set in the middle of a snowstorm it was filmed in vancouver b c canada at a motel which adds to the suspense rose puts in a great performance as the girl next door along with the rest of the cast and as for what happens at the end well the only thing i'll say is that you'll never guess the ending br br sadly it probably won't make it into mainstream north american theatres because the only decent money maker in it is rose but if you get the chance to see it i would recommend you do and if worse comes to worst there's always video br br i gave it a 9 out of 10
<START> i've been looking forward to watching since having happened across schaffer's fall unfortunately i found ws to be a wandering unengaging boring bunch of claptrap pieced together with what apparently is schaeffer's signature a mix of story narration and poetry the film recounts the sexual and other experiences of a manhattan man about to be married through self narrated flashbacks like beads on a string schaffer apparently has strung together every little sexual life experience while neglecting to tend to the beauty of the necklace the result is a disjointed rambling story about a boy growing up which fails to engender empathy and leaves the viewer disconnected unsatisfied and with a bad after taste which taints the mechanical feel good ending a mediocre indie and a step backward for schaeffer
<START> alright a sci fi horror action b hybrid directed by jim wynorski and in the final scenes we get to see a cyborg with a metal head killing off multiple people as with any wynorski flick he throws in a whole bunch of crazy ideas and subplots that mostly don't lead to anywhere but storm trooper is more like a two movies for the price of one kind of deal on the one hand we got the drama thriller part as such the film opens with carol alt killing her incredibly annoying ungrateful husband a plot that simply leads to nowhere and on the other hand we got the cyborg on a part night of the living dead style with carol and the cyborg being the ones trapped inside the house and a bunch of special ops bounty hunters playing the role of the zombies trying to break into the house needless to say this flick is not up there with the greatest zach galligan of gremlins fame especially is painfully bad and corey feldman in a small supporting roll is once again completely wasted on this movie wynorski even rips off one of his own movies here since i am 99 sure he used some stock footage of his previous film evil ii the scene with the exploding truck and the motorcycle yes it's so not good and so much fun this is strictly for wynorski fans only and i am one of them in case you didn't know already
<START> the most famous thing about this movie is that this was the first time garbo talked in a motion picture aside from that if you want to call it that this is a movie that doesn't go beyond creaky melodrama with garbo trying her best not to fall asleep br br the plot involves greta garbo returning to her father after 15 years abroad her father who is a captain on a barge is happy to see her even though she's acting a bit cagey she soon falls in love with a grizzled seaman who also notices that something a barrier if you will is holding her back br br anyways the two fellows don't particularly like each other and soon come to blows over garbo when she diffuses the situation by revealing her big secret which is no surprise to us if you've read the video box damn you mgm garbo is nothing but arms in this movie she acts and acts flailing her arms about and gets grating quickly the two male leads are alright probably the best performance comes from the classic silent actress marie dressler who plays the drunken captain's even girlfriend what a performance it's too bad the tagline couldn't have read dressler talks
<START> this movie brought together some of the old spinal crew for another mockumentary film this time revolving around the world of the dog show how their owners prepare and train for the show before moving on to the show itself br br we meet several teams as they hope to win the top prize the cookie who seems to have slept with every man ever and gerry who tries to cope with his wife's old escapades and the fact that he literally has two left feet harlan whose dog talks to him and enjoys the who have taken far too much coffee and scream at each other and the gay couple and cabot and cummings who have won the last two years fred willard on the show and is very funny as always funny scenes include the 'look at me ' scene and any with levy unfortunately some of the best scenes were deleted or filmed later willard interviewing leslie cabot and the alternative epilogue with gerry is one of the funniest things i have ever seen if these had been included i would give the film an extra mark but br br 7 out of 10
<START> two actors play rival gangsters in three films the final of which is a sci fi film that nods strangely to william s burroughs philip k dick and anime all at once the robots are actually called a reference to dicks blade runner several visual allusions to the film can be found as well and the bad guy is a psychotic gay mayor obsessed with limiting procreation through use of a compulsory drug for heterosexual love is fleeting and homosexual love is eternal martial arts fights ensue a first for the dead or alive films the hilarious climax involves the two leads morphing into a winged robot with a gigantic phallus for a head who personifies destruction which has been the path of both characters thus far their individual minds and later literal heads functioning as something like testicles the film ends with the mayor f ing his free jazz playing boy lackey as the robot apparently tears down a wall around them the last words of the mayor oh f followed by a quick fade to black part of me felt cheated part of me confused but mostly i was just laughing a lot of the film is quite boring though the best scenes bookend the film while the rest is far too slow takashi miike has always mined the sexual motifs beneath male violence in action films and this film with the exception of gozu reinforces this theme more than any other sex and violence are two pretty basic themes but like who the jazz interludes may be a homage to ala naked lunch miike is able to show where the two connect to hilarious an oddly cohesive effect
<START> will smith is perfectly endearing as the relationship doctor here to heal all your relationship woes br br i expected this to be a standard romcom with little to amuse i'm happy to report that i was wrong will smith is delightful and unexpectedly fresh in this andy tennant vehicle surrounded by a great supporting cast an interesting story and fed with witty dialog i was thoroughly engaged br br we found this one cute quirky and inspirational without being preachy br br it rates a 7 4 10 from br br the fiend
<START> it might be a stretch saying this as a die hard carlin fan but the material both written and as performed in it's bad for ya is some of the best late era material yet at 70 carlin bounces back from the level of despair and some of the stumbles in the act itself from life is worth losing to a special that is firmly structured but loose and playful or as much as the old f can get and is continuously ceaselessly funny and funny as in reminiscent of what some of us had going on when watching back in town or the first time the material even if sounding at times a tinge of the previously done i e the whole bit on children in school and camp like the children segment in diseased is always fresh and with such a sting of truth to everything that it the mind while here goes tickling the funny bone br br going from the topic of death how long to wait to scratch off a name from the book six weeks unless if on the computer the facets of communication looking down from heaven spots of god naturally kids and just troublesome gestures involving hats in religion and if people really have rights make up the bulk of the special centered around the premise that what's bad for you plain and simple is bs total complete bs which as we also learn or if you've really learned it you're like the kid waiting at the street corner for a week following dropped off not quite randomly by the parent holds the country together carlin isn't necessarily angry though even if disdain seems to spout out at most turns even just to observe how horrifying children's teeth coming in look it's skepticism tinged with the feeling that everything is not going to be fine br br what it comes down to is this carlin is to dirty witty cautionary stand up comedy what yoda is to jedis everywhere which is a small spark of hope via crystal clear wisdom in a world where it's pretty damn hard to get any at the least we get classic gc outrageous lines and bits from the man's 13th or is it 14th comedy special including as far as an eyebrow raising observation on people who play mozart music during a birth
<START> after the wife of a plastic surgeon dies he gets his hunchbacked assistant to help him bring her back to life with various parts of other nubile young girls this film wants to be a gordon lewis type romp but fails miserably the acting is beyond bad the gore effects atrocious no not in the good way the plot almost none existent and no fun to be had skip it you want to know how incompetent it is at one point you can actually see a movie quite obviously br br eye candy candy gets topless and again in a flashback br br my grade f br br dvd extras commentary with jeffrey hogue and cynthia a second feature how to make a doll alternate title sequence with gordon lewis intro 2 shorts quest of the perfect woman and maniac hospital cover art gallery with music by the dead trailers for dr black mr hyde boots and the preacher the doctor and the the gruesome twosome wizard of gore awful dr wacky world of doctor morgus lust monstrosity fanny hill meets dr and i marquis br br easter eggs theatrical trailer a scene from just for the hell of it and a trailer for axe
<START> unlike terms of endearment and steel i left the movie theater feeling very disappointed i started to get into the characters and their complex mother daughter and father daughter relationships at the beginning i even cried but i had no sympathy for the characters with the ending the final act did not seem in line with the mother's character at all so although the acting was pretty good i thought the movie on a whole was disappointing
<START> in my review just submitted i referred to the young actress lead as when it should have been veronika i was so involved with character and the action i guess that i wasn't that concerned with names anyway she and the film are brilliant as i said the cinematography and the director's use of montage are worthy of eisenstein and his cameraman the production design is top notch the placement of actors in the foreground middle ground and background within any given mise en scene is worthy of study stunning memorable camera movement and an ending that has an emotional punch that leaves hollywood films far behind gee heroic self sacrifice instead of walking into the rainbow thanks again john hart
<START> i was stunned by this film afterwards i didn't even want to see any films for a long time any other film would be so unsatisfying by comparison br br for many it may be the worst of antonioni very slow without an engaging conventional story line microscopic examinations of human emotions and interactions and the worst of wenders verbose confused it is composed of short distinct episodes linked by wenders' typical meandering hero's stream of consciousness so it doesn't produce the temporary oblivion of escapist cinema br br but for fans the worst is the best and the disjointed story line is sketching a single poetic image that stretches across the film wenders and antonioni create a discourse between their segments that seeks out the heart of things br br
