<START> i normally hate puns but this seems the only appropriate summary for barnyard i suspect i am not the first and i'm sure many many comments focus on the idiocy of bulls with it certainly bothered me right off the bat but there's much more wrong with this movie than a fundamental lack of knowledge about how mammals work br br personally if i was a parent i would be irritated by the violent turn it takes near the end in the showdown with the coyotes although for me it at least injected a little action and from a conventional screen writing point of view you might expect the coyotes to play a greater role in the conflict gee you have a widow cow maybe her husband was killed by coyotes nope there's a much dumber explanation and what kind of a farm is this otis vows to protect all the animals from harm but there certainly seems to be no threat from humans they make reference to the farmer being vegan but what is he raising pigs for in all children's animal stories babe charlotte's web you name it the reality of farm life is at least touched on perhaps our friendly farmer is running some sort of rescue shelter there is some reference to this but it's never explained but all the farmer gets in return is abuse from a horse in a scene that is supposed to be funny but left me seriously wondering if he was going to wind up buried in a shallow grave behind the barn and what the heck is the deal with wild mike it was like the gimp scene in pulp fiction without the ball gag br br add in some truly awful attempts at emotional scenes a nearly complete lack of laughs and those and you've got the worst kids movie i've seen in ages i generally only post to imdb to highlight a film that's not so well known not to slam the current 2 box office hit but this movie angered me it was taking up space in my local theater space that could have been used to show something worthwhile there's been plenty of good family entertainment this summer in fact there were at least 2 more kids films playing at the same multiplex but i'm not allowed to see something like little miss sunshine so can cheat families out of an extra 30 at least i had a free pass br br i know that as a 35 year old with no children this film was not designed for me but there's just no excuse for such a lazy dreadful children's film as barnyard in the age of pixar i was bored by the ice age films but they certainly didn't anger me like barnyard shark tale was a weak attempt at street hipness but it had quite a few laughs for that matter you could turn on nickelodeon at any time of the day and see something more entertaining and intelligent which is why they should be ashamed for putting their name on this garbage br br i'm giving it a 2 out of 10 only because pip the mouse was sporadically amusing and maria had a few amusing lines as the farmers wife well not the farmer's wife some other farmer they didn't really explain who she was they didn't explain a lot of things especially not why sam elliot the ultimate man's man had an udder jiggling around down there creepy
<START> the only pure life is one that ends with a signature in blood br br so says mishima anyway a young sheltered boy who becomes a celebrity author the life of one of most celebrated literary voices is told from three perspectives his life just before he and four members of his private army take over a japanese military base and commit ritual suicide shown in color flashbacks shown in black and white and scenes from his novels shown in a kind of dreamy technicolor set design somewhere between traditional theater and the wizard of oz these stories are often told at the same time but are edited to reinforce the slow fusing of life with his fictions until the end or the beginning when like the ancient samurai he so admires he will be at a balance of pen and sword when his words and actions are the same and he is a full and pure being br br paul schrader wrote the screen play for taxi driver and directed cat people a bizarre erotic horror film which left strange impressions on me as a boy and in mishima he comes closest to making a really excellent film br br whats interesting is to watch the poet the homosexual the shy and awkward man with a low body image who overstates his tuberculosis to get of of ww2 of which he seems forever ashamed become a body building samurai obsessed a sexual media phenomena all the while still writing prolific amounts of novels plays and short stories br br a short and sweet version is to say mishima has no father and becomes obsessed with masculinity beauty sex and self destruction in some tragic attempt to feel connected to something bigger than himself that he was always missing watching him with his fellow suicidal cadets you see him happy delivering his big paternal speech giving orders and loving the control until the speech itself the point where pen and sword meet of course this ignores the subtlety of the story telling craft here which makes this transformation so natural and remarkable br br though the story fascinating at times really isn't this movies greatest success the cinematography performances editing music by philip glass and set designs are really what make this worth seeing and more than a traditional bio pic br br one day i will pick up a mishima book he does seem to have an ear for prose and for staging ideas but for now i'm satisfied with the film br br those interested in japanese literature and post war culture should check out fans of inventive combinations of facts and fictions should enjoy as well
<START> this movie was extremely disappointing i thought it would be another comedy' but don't be mislead it's not at all there are barely any weed related jokes that come to mind i don't even think they smoke any weed in this movie the marijuana field is merely a plot device br br my impression after seeing this film was that four friends were bored one summer and decided to write up a script full of their idea of witty dialog and make a movie the product is bland dialog supported by mediocre acting to say this movie has no is a huge understatement don't waste your time or money
<START> watched this when it was first screened and then missed it when it disappeared of british screens it showed a different side of old australia that we need to see more of good juxtaposition of old hand and young then the realism of the hard out back was fantastic it was sadly missed this show was a cold look at the old way of looking at australia hard living and hard working the young idealist clashing with the old practical head real fighting with the young upstarts of new labour to add modern political vernacular br br this show was the first of its type that i came across that did not try to do a tourist job on australia it was a great showing of the realistic br br come documentary realistic type of show some good films were out at the time doing a similar job it would be great to see more of this type of tv come from australia for it has been sadly missing this last twenty years for all we have been fed is the soap pulp of varying quality
<START> forget every spy movie you've ever seen this is what life was like in the ussr and still is in many places in russia and the ex soviet countries vera dreams of life of leisure as she imagines the west to be her reality is very different with a bitter mother a violent father and the ever present alcohol and her prospects for the future are not much better she finds a man and they try to patch up a life together but he is afflicted by the same environment both socially and physically the scenery in this movie is brilliant sitting comfortably in the company of post apocalyptic movies but obviously done with no special effects they have just walked in and shot whatever happened to be in front of the camera br br forget your stereotyped cold russians of spy movies this is the real deal people are passionate vibrant and present in a way you'll never see in a drama from the west
<START> lone star productions sure churned them out in the 1930's and star has the feel of one of the more rushed ones john wayne is u s marshal john travers investigating a crooked hoodlum known only as the shadow responsible for stealing cattle stage and the like and giving orders from behind the door of a phony wall safe yakima canutt is trusty indian sidekick appropriately named as well yak br br early on we find out that union head matt matlock george pre gabby hayes is really the shadow the dead giveaway is when he offers to buy out his supposed niece anita's half of the matlock ranch since this is no place for a girl as anita verna doesn't have much to do in the film although in a comic moment she gets to use a six shooter to blast the butt of one of the villains in a night time scare raid br br there are a few in the film for one wayne's character alternately rides a white horse and a dark horse in the first half of the film in what could have been a neat device a hollowed out tree stump used by a henchman is located right in the middle of the street and finally the movie doesn't truly live up to it's name as sheriff travers never wears a badge throughout the film that is a star without a star br br the horse chases the runaway stage scenes the stagecoach off the cliff another curiosity the horses conveniently get loose from the stage are all pretty standard stuff but john wayne fans will want to see this one for the charisma he displayed early on in his career for those more critical the white worn around the forehead by the good guy posse could only mean that they all had a headache
<START> alice florinda bolkan a translator living in italy discovers that she has a memory loss and can't recall the last couple of days she starts to follow a trace of memory fragments which leads her to the small town of people in the town seem to recognize her and she's beginning to suspect that the re occurring nightmares of astronauts conducting horrible experiments has something to do with her own amnesia br br the movie is interesting and the plot is good but it's a bit to slow moving and arty for my taste the plot takes some nice twists and it's really hard to figure out where it's heading florinda bolkan is good in her role but even better in flavia the heretic and it's always nice to see star child actor klaus kinski's role is too small though this is not a movie for the die hard gore hound or exploitation addict but still a very nice hour and a half mystery
<START> this movie was a big disappointment the plot sounded great about a half human half leopard creature in africa that becomes the subject of a documentary by young american adults when many of the crew members are found dead the 2 survivors are taken into questioning i wouldn't even call this a horror movie since most of the movie is actually about the mis adventures of the aforementioned narcissistic 20 somethings which include sex and smoking animal dung to get high isn't as entertaining as it sounds trust me you rarely get to see the creature and the main actor who also happens to be the director screen writer editor and producer is incredibly annoying br br i was finally so annoyed by the never ending dialogue that i fast forwarded to the end i had guessed the ending in less than 10 minutes into the movie and i was right thus this awful movie is utterly predictable too as if it wasn't bad enough moral of the story avoid movies that are acted directed edited produced and written by the same nobody and avoid this movie unless held at gunpoint
<START> this movie used to be played constantly on the disney channel when i was a bit younger and i really remember liking it however i didn't have great taste back then not to say that i do now so i can't vouch for my nine year old self too well the movie was probably a 7 10 but it had some good music so i gave it an extra point yeah worth watching i know that some fans of this movie are wondering what a certain song is the one that appears when she is in the car crash the song is play a love song by the and it is very hard to find and obtain in fact this movie is too i can't find it anywhere online or on dvd or on vhs i'd like to see it again so i can gauge if it was actually a good movie oh well
<START> i love a good western movie but this was more like watching a play on stage or an act at the local street carnival show i could only stand 38 minutes of it in hopes that it would improve but it only got worse and i had to end it each actor s stated the lines as if reading directly from the script or cue cards there was too much predictability to the lines and actions not as if a natural occurrence or conversation the wig on rachel was obvious the actresses playing native american sisters could have played non native parts and should have wardrobe for the native americans could have been better and a little more authentic looking if i decide to watch it with any friends in the future i will do so not with the expectations of watching a good western but with the expectations of watching an amateur comedy film production
<START> plot ed and alice are engaged they live together and are living the dull life he has slept around before meeting alice she has a lot less experience she decides she needs to sleep around before marrying he very reluctantly agrees they should both see other people for a while br br at first he is not really into it his wild days are behind him and he is simply content until one day alice comes back and tells him she made out with some random guy who of course starts to fall for her br br of course this is a bad idea which causes extreme strain on the relationship br br good movie you can see the train wreck coming but still good br br worth a rental
<START> frederick forsyth's books are always so intricately plotted with twists and turns and usually a great surprise ending this adaptation had none of that br br so much of what was great in the book the history of monk and the betrayed agents the plot to influence the outcome of the russian election were completely missing in this adaptation instead there's this completely new plot about bio weapons that was a yawner br br forsyth's protagonists always operated in the shadows forever just slightly beyond the reach of the antagonists the joys of his books have always been the machinations of carrying out their mission this film resigned itself to gunfights and car chases early on br br swayze's monk might as well have hung a sign around his neck saying i am a secret agent for all the attention that he called to himself during the film and with all of that attention the amount of time that it took the bad guys to catch up to him was surprising br br granted there was some energy to this film which is why i'm giving it a 3 instead of a 1 it was also great to see some underutilized pros like patrick bergin ben cross michael york and barry morse br br i hope that someday someone will once again do justice to a forsyth film adaptation like day of the did
<START> greetings from lithuania br br this is the first question that comes to head after watching this movie br br you know i saw a lot of bad movies in my life but after watching this one i only had two questions 1 is this was just a parody spoof br br 2 how could people create such a thing br br if you never saw this film than you really don't know what is a really bad film i mean bad the script are you kidding my acting is so horrible that i thing the actors where just having fun in this movie i know this is b movie but come on is this have to be a reason to be such a garbage br br oh and what an ending a must miss ending just when you thing that this is the worst thing you have ever saw wait until the ending because that kind of ending you have never saw before and i hope you will never see br br this movie at any cost and don't say i didn't warn you
<START> this is beyond stupid br br two high school graduates travel to for the summer and find situations there that are absolutely revolting br br demi moore co stars in this one as the film was in 1986 was ashton kutcher just a babe in the woods at that time br br moore's grandfather has died and his home is on the verge of being sold to ruthless people with a father and son who bring a new meaning to the term mean br br bobcat goldthwait with that obnoxious voice is in the film as well as two brothers who make dumb and dumber look more and more intelligent br br the writing is absolutely ridiculous highlights of the stupidity are where one person says to the other did you ever notice that when people die they go in the papers br br i rest my case
<START> a pretty awful film i'm amazed the likes of derek jacobi vanessa redgrave agreed to be in it it's like an overlong episode from a poor tv detective series br br the biggest flaw has to be vinnie jones he simply can't act whoever had the bright idea of casting him as a leading man wants their head examining unless he put his own money into the project he should stick to playing thugs looking menacing not speaking br br also was central heating around in dickens times as there were three big behind his desk br br no wonder they gave this away free with a newspaper as no one would pay to see it
