<START> br br what more can you ask for a great screenplay based on one of the finest plays of the latter half of the 20th century two fine emotional performances by courtney and finney a realistic vision of war time london a great supporting cast this film takes you on an emotional rollercoaster through humour sadness loss and fulfillment if you are in the theatre it is even more effective this is a true 10 on the rating scale
<START> and one of 'em are bad movies the title as it turns out refers to a killer of the human male variety not fish this is not the dante directed piranha of '78 which did have the fish and is also known as piranha piranha a trio of photographers 2 men and a woman hook up with a local hunter trapper named somewhere in the amazon jungle unfortunately they are not familiar with the film resume of william smith who plays otherwise they would have known immediately he is the villain of the piece smith may have also refused to film the ending or cut out before they finished filming see end of this comment br br as mentioned elsewhere this pic has a lot of filler lengthy shots of the local wildlife birds and the central set piece a motorcycle race which goes on too long the reason this gets a second star from me is of course william smith who can't really save this sludge but once again proves why he was the 'go to' guy 30 35 years ago if you needed a really nasty villain at his best smith could be really terrifying he's the type who enjoys killing possibly in sadistic fashion and you get that sense from the evil grin he usually puts on when a mood strikes him physically he's very imposing and you know the other 3 characters are pretty much doomed within the first half hour this was what smith brought to most of his roles it seems hopeless for the other characters against this monster unfortunately the movie continues to muddy things up to the very end as if a minute of footage was lost a confusing incomplete climax
<START> nuts in may may be one of the worst films i have ever seen if ed wood was still alive this would be the type of movie he would be doing to say this movie is bad would be the understatement of the century but how bad is it really well here are two levels of bad i go by it's so bad it's good or it's so bad it's god awful this film falls into the latter section what little unintentional humor it has does not make up for the slow hard to understand boring majority of the film br br summary spoilers br br two middle aged anglos take a trip to the countryside for some r r and camping there they met ray soon to be jim i'll explain later who's tent is next to our main couple throughout most of the movie the two leads go sight seeing on the beach at a rock quarry and other exciting locations in between these adventures they talk endlessly about the environment vegetarianism fossil collecting the duty of a proper citizen and proper diet all thing i want to see in a comedy they bore anyone who will listen to them the dialogue is not only bad but the pacing in some scenes is so slow i sometimes felt like off scenes would go on forever and just when it begins to build up and something is about to happen the scene ends half way through the movie i thought to myself nothing is going to happen in this thing it is truly a movie about nothing br br the characters are annoying and constantly repeat things at one part i felt the director was playing a cruel joke on his audience the scene i am referring to is the sing along scene in it our two brits play some of there music for us actually it was the same 4 four lines over and over and over and over the idea was to get ray to sing along with them but ray knew as well as us that they are the worst songwriters known to man this scene was beyond tedious by the fifth time the song was played i started to question the existance of a merciful god br br words can not describe the awfulness of this film the first thing that strikes you is the indecipherable british accents that most of the cast has remember the thick scottish accents in trainspotting times that by 10 br br towards the end our tree hugging incoherent couple get into a fight with some of ray's friends that have complete disrespect for the rules of camping our hero becomes so incensed that a climatic battle ensues between our hero and the head hellraiser to settle their dispute the two men engage in a stick fight that's right a stick fight now this is where the humor starts i laughed so hard at the ineptitude of it all that i thought this may make up for the other 80 minutes after this battle our hero runs behind some bushes to cry his eyes out and the other man calls ray over by calling him jim for some unknown reason br br a stick fight a crying nature loving 40 year old and a character name change 3 4 into the movie ed wood would be proud br br though i was again forced to endure the last 10 minutes which to sum up ends with a long take of a pig why who the hell knows at one moment we see a pig grazing and the next the credits start to role over the screen one of the worst endings to a one of the worst films of all time
<START> the plot seemed to be interesting but this film is a great dissapointment bad actors a camera moving like in the hands of an amateur if there was c movies this would be a perfect example a plus for a nice dvd cover though and a great looking female actor
<START> boogie nights was without a doubt the best film of 1997 i could watch this movie over and over and over and still love it i'm in no rush to watch that overblown romance disaster epic titanic again the fact that boogie nights did not even receive a best picture nomination just goes to prove how predictable and narrow minded the academy is only atom the sweet hereafter and robert zemeckis's contact came close to being as great as boogie nights no other filmmaker in recent years has come even remotely close to making a film as good as tarantino's pulp fiction until now paul thomas anderson rose to the challenge and succeeded just as tarantino gave john travolta's career a kick p t anderson has given burt reynolds the kick that his career needs boogie nights will also undoubtedly make stars of don cheadle heather graham and john reilly overall a wonderful film the best since pulp fiction maybe even better
<START> a man in blackface lands in a spaceship and meets a girl who lives in some sort of shack with a monkey he hooks her up with a telephone and she teaches him how to charleston then they fly off in the spaceship leaving the monkey behind cringe inducing blackface aside this short film makes no sense i think that's the plot but i'm not sure by a long shot you can't tell that this is renoir at work despite his characteristic humanism good use of slow motion though can be found on the ny film series of experimental film videos no 18 i believe
<START> i for one was actually expecting this movie to be pretty good maybe my expectations were a bit to high but the fact is i love judd nelson in fact he is the only reason this movie is worth watching and really his role isn't all that great the main highlights of this film are raunchy sex scenes and boring dialog if those are the highlights i'm sure your getting a pretty good idea of what kind of film this is there is definitely a reason this was a made for television film only see this one if you have nothing better to do on a friday night or just like to waste money on video rentals save your time and rent the breakfast club
<START> what a total lump of this was you've got to be kidding people any positive reviews of this movie are plants or insiders from the movie makers themselves disgusting movie not gross but just plain awful
<START> the entire movie an artful adaptation of one of joyce's dubliners stories takes place on the night of january 6 epiphany 1906 most of the film takes place at an annual party given by three spinsters two sisters and their niece where a group of upper class dubliners gather for an evening of music and dinner while there is very little plot per se the interaction and conversation among the group reveals much about dublin in the early 20th century when the stirrings for independence were just beginning the cast all talented irish stage actors with the exception of anjelica huston are universally wonderful and one actually feels he is a guest at the gathering himself the poignant final scene between ms huston and the amazing donal mccann reveals much about the marriage of the characters there is poignancy mixed with humor and insight and for those who like quiet thoughtful movies the dead is highly recommended my wife is from dublin we make a ritual of watching this wonderful movie every january 6th after many viewings it never fails to move me and each time i glean something that i've missed before
<START> this proved to be a rare case of a made with british funding unfortunately the result is undistinguished except by its exceeding unpleasantness and borderline camp approach despite stars and director the former is led by a wooden franco nero and an ultra hammy telly savalas as a couple of would be robbers if anyone is able to believe either actor Â who generally exude cool Â as a duo of bumbling crooks he's more gullible than i am br br their goes awry ending in murder and saddled with cases of cutlery instead of jewels Â however the mismatched criminals see an opening to their dilemma when they inadvertently the son of a british diplomat a miscast lester who even gets to kick trigger happy savalas where it hurts at one point still they never actually ransom him and their sole intent is to cross the border into france tagging along with them is nero's girlfriend a wasted ely soon enough though she's had enough and decides to run away while the others are sleeping the crazy savalas notices this and following the girl kills her in the meantime nero and lester have woken up Â the former thinks his accomplices may have double crossed him so he goes on the lam with the boy in tow after a brief spell at a rich old lady's country estate which features totally gratuitous rear nudes by both nero and lester savalas catches up with them they continue their trek where the trio run into a family of german campers the situation degenerates to the point where savalas shuts them inside their trailer and tosses the lot into the river Â though he's badly hurt in the process himself typically it all ends with the getting killed just as they're about to reach the border br br the film therefore contains most of the genre's typical elements Â sleaze sadism violence chases the aftermath of the opening robbery when the getaway car causes havoc in the city's narrow back streets and even disrupts a funeral procession is downright farcical etc one mildly interesting aspect to it is that by the end lester himself is seen to have been definitely irrevocably marked by the experience Â coming to feel excitement when an act of violence is committed
<START> had no idea what i was going to experience viewing this old film from 1940 however i always enjoy viewing laraine day katie who plays the role as a younger sister to jean muir helen and also their mother billie burke mrs julia thought i was going to be bored with the story of two sister's and a mother who is overly protective of her daughters until they meet up with robert cummings ridley crane who has the reputation of being a millionaire playboy who has plenty of gals and is a heavy drinker who parties all the time one night helen goes on a date with ridley and he proceeds to get bombed out of his mind and simply cannot drive his car it is at this point in the film when this becomes a drama and changes the complete direction of this film which will definitely hold your attention right to the very end of the film
<START> it may be a little creaky now and it certainly can never have the impact it once had but this is still a thrilling reminder of what michael jackson could once do looking back on it now for the first time since its initial prominence i was struck not by the horror trappings quaint but fun and vincent price has never sounded so genuinely un sic menacing than its absorption of the horror film allowing jackson behind genre and make up to give us a bravely revealing portrait of male sexuality br br because thriller isn't really about horror in the way horror isn't really about horror it is about that age old theme the sexual awakening of a young woman the film opens in a cinema with jackson's girlfriend uncomfortable with the imagery and the aggressively gendered response of course she is on a date and she is less scared by the film than what she knows will be expected by her boyfriend br br the mainstream imagery of the film they watch the group atmosphere all suggest the socially conditioned expectations this leads her not only to think of the body in disgust hence all the decaying ghouls the loss of her virginity is seen as a kind of death but the sexual rite is not just about her boyfriend but her peers her society hence its as a gang violation br br this is brilliant disturbing stuff the best thing director landis has ever done jackson the most popular artist on the planet was still willing to show that the fixed image of a star contained multitudes not all of them reassuring the song itself has held up remarkably well the creepy insistent bass rhythms the extraordinarily salacious lyrics the beautiful 70s disco ecstasy tailing the chorus shattering timelessness revealing the milky desire behind the fear
<START> possible spoilers ahead br br i'll only say what hasn't already been said here and i'll continue this for the rest of my wwf wwe comments br br if you're going to have a women's title match at least make it interesting rather than just a squash to put over the current champion i guess moolah couldn't handle an intense match but they wanted to have the legend in a wrestlemania br br i thought the killer bees were wasted in wrestlemanias especially here i became a fan in 1989 about a year after the b brian blair was gone and jim brunzell became a canvas back so i didn't realize for a while that they were a top tag team even top contenders br br but i loved seeing bill in the battle royal he really came into his own here creating a cocky heel character in a pre match interview and even making an elimination in the battle royal besides steve mcmichael and kevin greene he is the only professional athlete from my generation with any respect for wrestling anyone remember dennis rodman and what was with the hart ridiculous green tights
<START> this short was in part four of the short cinema journal a film i rented from netflix but which appears to have originally been a monthly film series for people who like mediocre modern short films and love to have the dvd chock full of commercials i have so far tried two of the dvds and felt enraged at the horrible way that a viewer needs to navigate the disk in order to see the films talk about an over produced and overly complicated way of doing this while i have and will continue to see as many shorts as i can i really doubt if i'll bother with the journals because of these factors br br now it could be that because i disliked the disk so much that i was not favorably disposed towards this portuguese animated short this is definitely possible however even if this is the case i feel that the other reviews were way too positive about this simple little film some of the artwork was indeed nice i liked how the simple black and white drawings suddenly became 3 d environments as the camera went from a dull distant shot and dove into the city below this was lovely and took some work but as for the story about a cat who wants to go to the moon it just did nothing for me br br important update i saw this film again on a dvd entitled cartoon noir on 5 09 it was a pretty unappealing collection of art films however this time i saw the story of the cat and the moon with an entirely different audio track and boy did it make a difference instead of portuguese with subtitles it had a french accented narrator who spoke english in a film noir style while i usually hate dubbing this time it really made the film the narration of the portuguese version leaves a lot to be desired if you don't know the language or understand the subtleties unless you speak the language try looking for the other version provided you understand english
<START> i think it's the sort of film you either love or hate and i'm really not the type to go in for arty movies my mother rented dr the other night and i nearly ran from the room ha but i love this film br br we recorded the beat one night when we had just let the tape run and got a great film that way by accident saved that tape and watched it a lot i eventually got the vhs to add to my collection i've watched it many times and at one point copied down the poems i even tried to preform one scene for my high school drama class she had said we could do any scene we wanted and just cut out the bad words she refused to let me do it if it could upset my drama teacher that much it has to be good honest she never treated me the same after that br br i liked the acting it came off very true and honest it wasn't clean and polished but it was better than that it was true to life how anyone would truly behave and display emotions not how hollywood does it was great acting especially by the one playing rex br br the story was original not only do the characters get drawn into his world but you do too not your typical person meets inner city kids and saves them through knowledge film at all simply caring and friendship make things a bit better br br the only thing is that even in the 80's there was more gun violence and less simple stuff like rock throwing but that little bit of innocence didn't hurt this film br br i think it's a must see you will either love or hate it but either way it makes an impact and that makes a good film that you will remember and talk about later
