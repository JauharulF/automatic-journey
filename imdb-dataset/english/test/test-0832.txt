<START> greystoke is without doubt the best tarzan movie i have ever seen christopher lambert portrays a very believable man trying to return to the world of mankind alongside the fantastic ian holm the struggle of john to leave the jungle and the apes who raised him is quite stirring some very memorable scenes including where lambert makes the jungle noises to the romantic interest and the scene where he witnesses his ape father's death tarzans feelings for both worlds is well developed and really makes you feel for him br br an excellent and underrated movie
<START> after seeing the trailer it was an easy decision not to see this film i mean i don't care for stupid stoner comedies i'm sure it was also an easy choice for a lot of people to get together smoke a bowl and go check out this flick with the guy from the simpsons and some guy named billy bob should have been a good time but the film's just not that funny too bad somebody had to go and bum their high br br unfortunately i found out that the trailer was misleading after it had already left the theaters so i had to wait for the video i really enjoyed it nice locations quality production and excellent performances from the entire cast looking back at it the plot twists weren't totally unexpected but i didn't find it cumbersome because the premise was so engaging br br so why was this absorbing drama marketed as a comedy did something happen to the producer leaving the associate producers to do the marketing by themselves
<START> this movie is truly unique it really captures the spirit of the play but makes it entertaining to the modern generation the romance between tromeo and juliet was believable and erotic not pulled off by many adaptations it is also so funny i was almost crying with laughter br br like with most troma its in your face taboo subjects gore and sex and yet add in some really good acting and a shakespeare plot you really have to see this movie to believe it br br there are some hillarious jokes in the credits best credits i've seen since hot shots loads of troma in jokes as well as general satire and shakespeare refs and from the house of motorhead narrates i lent this movie to a friend and had an almost impossible job of getting it back troma at its best this film really is a gem and goes in my top 5 favourite movies of all time br br though its not the sort of film you'd watch with your mum and might offend some people for anybody bored with run of the mill cinema with a wacky sense of humour you must see this film
<START> it's some years since i've seen this movie so forget most of the details however i loved it at the time and found the plot intensely gripping the climax heart stopping i remember being literally on the edge of my seat at the theatre back in 1979 br br jane fonda plays a los angeles reporter kimberley who stumbles upon an accident at a local nuclear power facility she wants to go public with the story aided by her hippie cameraman michael douglas who has photographed the event but a sinister conspiracy attempts to cover it all up jack lemmon is absolutely wonderful in the role of the nuclear plant's conflicted middle manager torn between loyalty to his company and 'doing the right thing' by reporting the perilous situation his facial expressions speak volumes here br br apart from the engrossing plot and riveting tension this film is all about jack lemmon his character and his superb acting performance as for jane fonda i was a huge fan of hers at the time i suspect she just moved on from her anti war protests to taking on the nuclear industry br br this movie seems intended as a nuclear scare tactic and three mile island notwithstanding they're different types of reactors our canadian reactor is safe and well respected around the world i wouldn't hesitate to reside near the nuclear power plant about an hour's drive away where my friend works as a very competent engineer apparently they shut down for every teeny problem irregardless of the financial loss i sincerely doubt that there are any conspiracies afoot there one can hardly imagine any of the managers or highly trained operators willing to risk any sort of meltdown or whatever it's absolute tomfoolery of course the moral here is to spare no expense or effort either in building the facility or ensuring its ongoing safety br br if we want our western lifestyle we have to get our energy somewhere for those who claim nuclear power can never be made completely safe true of course perhaps they should volunteer as a coal miner or else return to pre electricity horse and buggy days br br by all means enjoy this entertaining and highly suspenseful movie which apparently is based loosely embellished on a true story it's a real chiller a thriller and maybe even a killer but please don't get your attitudes about the operation and safety of nuclear power plants from it
<START> this intelligent moving and beautiful film is a study in the ways people react to tradition reminds me of william novels br br the characters all feel trapped by the weight of the roles they are expected to assume and seek for a way to live within those roles rather than throw them off altogether but as the story develops the two wives trapped in loveless marriages draw together drawing on the strength of their friendship and love they give each other the courage to abandon their roles br br they have found that living within their traditions is no life at all it is a sort of living death without passion without true connection to others without fulfillment although they know there will be a price to be paid for their rebellion and freedom it is a price much less dear than the sacrifice called for by a comfortable predictable existence br br the screenplay is wonderful the acting marvelous near perfect
<START> notwithstanding that the house of adam is meant to be a mainstream gay movie that anthony john shaw who is gay curious and a major cutie hunk and adam jared who is openly gay and a close second in looks that there is a whole minute of wonderful convincing and naked lovemaking sorry no frontal between anthony and adam 41 minutes into the movie that alone may be sufficient for many of us notwithstanding all that to which i give a thumbs up the house of adam is a horrible movie by most any other movie making standard a big thumbs down br br shaw's and acting abilities are either sophomoric or else truly suffer from the bad script direction and editing or rather the lack thereof their lovemaking scene is nevertheless convincing and may have more to do with their really being into each other considering the rest of their scripting and acting br br writer director jorge bonus feature self congratulation as to his movie making skills is off the wall br br so the script and lack thereof is a thumbs down overall the acting is thumbs down with just the slightest exception for shaw and alexis as nina might have been the best except for the limitations expressed above far and away the absolute worst and insufferable acting was by thomas michael as albert ross anthony's father having not even of elementary school acting quality he truly represents a colossal casting failure br br the actors playing the new cabin owners are worthy of truly bad acting nominations as well br br if only the production editing and post production were as good as the trailer this movie would have been quite something else the trailer presents well put together clips of scenes that drew me into renting the movie in the first place that and the hope that this gay centered movie was supposedly prominently played and touted at gay film festivals br br overall the movie is a big thumbs down br br is it worth buying renting and watching it only if you have an irresistible yen to see the naked love making scene and a few minutes of semi convincing dialogue between anthony and adam or if you truly just enjoy watching bad movies
<START> i absolutely loved this show never understood why it was called bug juice though i must have been about 13 when it came out i remember they ran it over the summer holidays on channel 4 between re runs of summer and saved by the bell or something like that i remember sitting there and wishing i was at summer camp too ha ha all the kids in it looked to be having so much fun it was all about discovering who you are and growing up first kisses and all that stuff i remember there was this really cute guy in it i think he was the main reason i got up in the mornings that particular summer they should have more teen docu soaps like this i thought it was great
<START> the box to this movie totally misrepresents itself the cover shows a view of legs panties in a short skirt the title is tart ' the synopsis on the back of the box made it seem as though cat the main character was an outcast who became one of the popular students but that popularity lead to a bizarre lifestyle that she could not escape from everything that the box built this movie up to was a horrible lie i expected a sort of crappy direct to video version of targeted at the teenagers of today br br let me tell you what was really about yes this really is the plot so if you don't want to know what happens stop reading we have one unlikable boring rich girl this unlikable girl's best friend is a skank the skank gets expelled from school so the unlikable girl befriends some british girl this leads to the unlikable girl dating this boring guy who the box refers to as the most popular boy in school ' if that guy was the most popular guy in their school i wish i would have gone to that high school because i could have kicked the crap out of him anyway as any movie will tell you the most popular guy in school is invariably a murderer or drug addict or thief or in this case all of the above anyway everyone ends up disliking the unlikable main character because she is jewish then the most popular guy in school beats her best friend the skank to death with a rock because the skank caught the most popular boy in a homosexual act the unlikable girl's stoic mother and hypochondriac younger brother are there for her at the end oh and the entire movie is about snotty rich kids and their horrible parents too gee what is wrong with that that sounds like a fantastic movie well that's what i thought but you see there are no likeable characters in this movie the main character is boring the filmmakers made her average while during the film she keeps spouting off about what a freak she is the skank is not skanky enough and has little screen time the popular guy is nothing to write home about the popular girls are just your run of the mill rich girls there are no moral lessons cat the boring main character is not a freak does not ever become one of the truly popular girls and worst of all after all the crap she goes through she thinks she is still too good to befriend the only nice girl the dorky girl to be honest i have no idea why the movie is called tart i kept asking who's the tart is she the tart are they all tarts at 94 minutes theoretically this is not a long movie but after actually watching this awful waste of a vhs tape and not knowing who the tart was i was surprised that the movie was only an hour and a half the movie felt like it was two hours and some change after a while i was hoping the movie would be about pop tarts at least when you look at a box of pop tarts you know what to expect
<START> special sneak previews are always a good time no matter what movie it is you are seeing the theatre will always be packed by people who have been awaiting the film like free stuff thought it'd be something to do or just got lost either way no matter how good or bad the film the audience alone will make it enjoyable now when said movie is a pg 13 pseudo horror film can you really delve into horror when the mpaa is on your back censoring everything you know there will be chatter laughing and breath holding with the the crowd did not disappoint giving numerous outbursts and warnings to the characters on screen as for the actual movie i feel sorry for those involved because it really could have been much better had it been paced right and allowed to stretch its legs beyond the scare fade to black show aftermath progression these films have in the end we are shown a boring plodding story with no surprises and few moments of actual suspense br br the story is a common one a family moves from the big city to the country after a traumatic event to try and rebuild their relationship with each other once settled in the spirits of the house come out to the reformed troublemaker child whose past makes it even easier for the parents to disbelieve everything told to them of course the child is not crying wolf and those around only find out when it is too late i will credit the pang brothers directors of the acclaimed the eye that i would like to watch more than before to see what they can do without hollywood reshoots on the were done by someone else but the brothers retained credit it's a shame what our studio system does to foreigners especially when it was creative independence which made the films that brings them in and not bottomline interference for really having a fitting style and for keeping the tired plot line somewhat fresh unfortunately though i also must give them credit for the almost unbearable slowness similar to why i disliked what lies beneath i couldn't stand the drawn out suspense which goes so far as to make it laughable when our heroine and her brother stand in a hallway with a ghost behind them the scene lasts about eight minutes with just static oddly composed close ups and depth of field focus changes to end up culminating to absolutely nothing for being only 84 minutes i almost think it would have worked better even shorter br br besides a very effective opening sequence featuring the fantastic jodelle ferland strangely playing a boy and a great atmospheric credit sequence the only thing that saves the film from utter garbage is the acting except for penelope ann miller who first made me wonder what ever happened to her and then after a few scenes made me understand why i never asked that question in the years she was absent and dustin milligan completely lacking in credibility the acting is very strong dyan mcdermott does a nice job as the father trying to keep his family together through all the tough times he has many little moments of light comedy to counteract his serious dramatic role william b davis everyone's favorite is used effectively as an almost foreboding character sadly not utilized more our true stars are kristen stewart and john corbett stewart plays the emotion very well and shows some promise as an actress with this and panic room on her resume as for corbett if he didn't pull off his role the entire movie would have unraveled completely i do wish he would be given more work as i've enjoyed him since the under appreciated series the visitor still need to check out his first role in northern exposure a show i haven't yet been able to catch up on it's a shame he will probably be most recognizable for the overrated my big fat greek wedding br br if anything the gave me a nice introduction to the pang brothers' work and reinvigorated my desire to check out their chinese horror catalog the mood and performances were there it was just the simple and vacant story that needed way too much padding to make a feature film if they delved more into other characters rather than just stewart's it could have been more effective while also having something more to show then ten minute scenes of nothing if our protagonist is the only one being attacked there is no suspense as to how far the creatures will go to harm her the moments of danger had no gravity to them and until the ending really just stood in as filler i am excited however for the free comic book given away after the special screening as hopefully the medium will allow for a faster paced story that engrosses before it tries to surprise
<START> a friend gave me this movie because she liked it i decided i would finally watch it it was sooooooo long i kept waiting for the suspense to happen but it never did i kept waiting for something to happen after the opening scenes and it never did i stopped the movie and came back later i actually forced myself to watch the rest of it hoping it would get better it got worse i kept asking myself who are these people do they have feelings are they just robots i'm glad i didn't pay to see it or pay to rent it the end would have been better if dutch died from the gunshot wound at least we would have gotten some emotion from the audience or maybe not
<START> even if i had never seen or heard of georgetown co this would be a sweet little movie but my dad was born and raised there and those are my uncle's horses you see pulling the sleigh so this movie is very special to me a lot of the interiors are shot in buildings and houses i recognize and are very realistic the story is a little hokey but georgetown is that kind of magical place where things like that could happen john denver was a better actor than a lot of people give him credit for mary wickes plays the kind of common sense lady with a lot of sass she played so well in many other films most notably white christmas i usually don't get to go out there in the winter so i like to see this movie at christmas time to tide me over until my next trip
<START> this is the most inaccurate and disgraceful biblical film i have ever has the misfortune to watch i would like to know why anybody on earth could enjoy viewing this i am so surprised that a big name like jon voight would agree to act in this disgraceful piece of garbage many people who may not have read the bible will now be mislead by believing this film was accurate and the thought of that really bothers me i think the makers have a lot to answer for the worst thing is that i believe nobody could make such obvious mistakes with a biblical film since they can research the bible for the truth so i believe the makers deliberately twisted what the bible says and that is something nobody has the right to do and i find that very offensive there are no words strong enough to describe exactly how i feel about this
<START> the biggest tragedy surrounding this thoroughly delightful movie is its lack of u s distribution i was fortunate enough to see this film at the boston international festival of women's cinema and highly recommend it to anyone who gets a chance to see it terrific performances and thoughtful script and great direction from the talented and funny rose all combine to make this film a winner
<START> the china syndrome launched a whole string of films about the potentially devastating effects of misused nuclear power a black cloud of paranoia that would hang over america for much of the reagan years it's a well made and effective drama given an extra punch by its high power stars notably jack lemmon who plays a senior official of the nuclear power plant who suffers a crisis of conscience but one can't help but think that it was the serendipitous timing of the three mile island nuclear accident that occurred just a couple of weeks after this film's release that has given it its lasting appeal as a classic from the 70s as watchable as it is it's certainly no classic br br with a red headed jane fonda as a news reporter and a bearded michael douglas as her camera man and the film's producer by the way br br grade b
<START> in michele soavi's confusing art house zombie film rupert everett plays francesco a caretaker in a cemetery where the dead don't stay buried for long aided by his simple assistant francesco deals with the zombie problem by either shooting the undead in the head or splitting their skulls with a spade br br however soon after falling for the mysterious beautiful widow of one of his recently interred francesco finds himself than ever br br having garnered some particularly favourable comments from some of imdb's more respected horror i decided to see what the fuss was all about i've just finished watching the film and i can honestly say that i haven't been this disappointed by a horror film for quite some time br br with its dreary muddled pseudo philosophical plot and an extremely bland performance from leading man everett is an irritating and plodding mess that not even some splattery gore courtesy of sergio stivaletti and welcome gratuitous nudity from busty anna can save i am at a loss to understand the amount of in depth analysis and discussion that this pretentious bilge has received from its misguided fans
