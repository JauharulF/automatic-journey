<START> as with some of the best films and series i stumbled across this quite by accident it was late a storm was in full force outside and i was sitting comfortably on the sofa when i flicked past a channel that was just about to show one of the episodes i intended merely to watch a couple of minutes while waiting for the commercials to be finished on another channel before switching back to some or other sitcom about an hour and a half later i remembered my resolve and was so happy that i hadn't done that needless to say i made sure i saw all the other episodes br br john hannah has been brilliant in almost everything i have seen him in and he does not let down here either all other cast members do a stellar job too my personal favourite aside from john hannah of course is gerard murphy br br the only negative side to this series are the limited amount of episodes only 8 with himself and an additional 1 with someone else i would love to see mccallum back on the screens though it would have to be with
<START> having seen the uncut version i thought this film was beautifully made it captured my attention from beginning to end the tension was wonderfully conveyed ka man portrays the typical filipino family with accuracy in its presentation of secrets and lies even the religious culture the human tendency to keep up appearances and maintain a pure reputation is shown with stark vividness in gloria diaz's character there is not a little scene in this film that does not have a purpose the cinematography is excellent and the writing brilliant br br although the plot is great i personally found that the twist at the end the revelation to do with character was not as much of a shock as it should be but then maybe that's just me because otherwise ka man is a very cleverly made film br br the casting was good to begin with but and acting were the icing on the cake not one to miss if you're looking for a filipino film that will surprise and surpass expectations thumbs up to the director
<START> clifton webb is one of my favorites however mister is not one of his best his patented curmudgeon role seems forced and even unpleasant rather than funny the film itself is overflowing with mawkish sentimentality in addition the viewer is presented with numerous ham handed references to religious faith and u s patriotism that come off as over reverent rather than genuine clifton webb does his best with a poor script edmund gwenn plays yet another jovial clergyman and is given nothing to do the child actor lead is played by a talentless child who displays a flat affect throughout the entire film his sole claim to fame as a performer evidently is a like low voice unusual for someone of his age however once you've heard it you've heard it and you don't need to hear it again unfortunately he is in the majority of the film's scenes i find this child so irritating that i fast forward whenever he shows up since he has a lot of scenes in this film this means that i fast forward through a lot of the film there were and are so many talented child actors it's a pity this film doesn't have any of them in it still clifton webb in the traditional broad hat and shorts is a sight worth seeing
<START> i really wanted to like this movie but the pacing was just way too slow br br it was a nice story but it was really like watching a slug race br br the movie would have been better served if it had some more action i don't mean anything grand but at least something in the background br br it could have also been helped by songs that set the tone mood of the more lengthy periods that were absent of dialogue br br it's been about 10 years since i've seen it so i may have to give it another chance br br 3 10 or 1 2 out of four
<START> this is by far the best movie i've seen in a long while it is a wholly original and beautiful plot it is not boring nor is it too dramatic the characters are tangible and realistic but it does not take away from the story line the fact that is not in english is most likely the final touch the end leaves you fulfilled in a way i've never experienced in a movie before br br i wish i had found this movie earlier br br more lines br br more lines br br more lines a lot more lines c'mon i'm done
<START> one of the best movies i ever saw a classic matrix movie for many years i have been trying to get it on vhs or dvd to no avail the german movie tv industry still prefers to let valuable cultural contributions and this is fassbinder after all rot away and collect dust in some archive rather than distribute it commercially and make a lot of money with it if that is what stimulates them instead of the promotion of creative thinking though the once told me if i paid dm 200 00 to check the copyright non and then dm 8 per minute of copying plus the cost for the materials then they will consider preparing a single copy for me some way to sell something the same problem we have with many other tv movies or series like so die and others excellent tv series never to be heard of again germany wake up br br update from march 2007 last year i finally could get a dvd copy from the of the for about 50 euro great
<START> oh how i laughed during those first couple of scenes this silly little film about an 11 year old who carries a gun steals cars robs stores burglars houses extorts money from other kids burns houses shoots rats buys drugs distributes drugs to his mother and his friends and then kills a guy what a great comedy but it wasn't intended to be a comedy it was intended as a social drama how can this be the events in this film are absurd and ridiculous the characters are all stereotypes right out of a 4 year old's comic strip induced immature imagination the dialog is laughable people talk like morons it's a very dumb film br br the first scenes are indeed very funny for all the wrong reasons but the unintentional hilarity of the idiotic premise runs out after a short while and after that the laughs come only rarely by that time the viewer can't believe what he is seeing and is alternately amazed and bored by what follows if he has at least half a brain cell br br a short film but feels like an eternity the film actually is a seriously intended attempt to show the world of a young degenerate while imitating movies vastly superior to it like fun there is just such an air of phoniness about everything the kids the adults everyone lacks credibility both in their actions and dialog the kid in the lead mugs his way through the film as though he had seen all the jimmy cagney movies at least a hundred times and typically enough the kid isn't portrayed as a reservoir of evil but instead as a misunderstood little artistic talent but of course every young hooligan is misunderstood society made him bad poor child br br the film is embarrassing a collection of stale occasionally hilarious clichÃ©s put together to make a movie that lacks intelligence and meaning the intellectual level of the film is zero
<START> a few buddies and myself have the strange hobby of seeking out really horrendous and utterly obscure for a good reason horror flicks and then subsequently watching them under the influence of mind consumer goods like alcohol and or soft drugs surely a lot of people do this but they watch movies like the godzilla remake whereas we torment our eyes and brains with stuff like the loch ness horror and eureka this is a prototypic bad movie we open traditionally with bag pipes music during the opening credits this is of course to emphasize extra to us dumb viewers that the story is supposed to take place in the scottish highlights and not in director larry birthplace texas for that exact same reason the cast members are seemingly also instructed to overact tremendously and talk with talk with atrocious accents the american marine biologist prof george sanderson arrives in loch ness with some brand new and highly sophisticated sonar equipment to track down the whereabouts of the legendary monster in the lake meanwhile there are many other parties hanging around the lake like a group of kids on a science camp what a boring way to spend your vacation retired army generals looking for a luftwaffe plane that crashed in the lake during wwii and a bunch of thieves and failed scientists that are the monster's egg you would think that these numerous sub plots bring some diversity and excitement in the plot but unfortunately that's not the case loch ness horror is an overall boring flick with only a couple of noteworthy elements the monster itself for example is a delightfully cheesy creation with cute eyes and a smoky breath his teeth also glow in the dark which is quite useful when you're dumb enough to go out on a boat ride in the middle of the night near the end of the film the remaining cast members were more interested in the lost luftwaffe plane than in the monster so it was about time to wrap it up loch ness horror is carefully recommended in case you're a fan of bad b movies from the 80's but be advised that it contains an overload of senseless dialogs and a bizarrely rushed ending that makes it look as if the film suddenly ran out of budget
<START> this is one of the best romantic movies i have ever seen especially girls who can identify with nicole will love it not only because of the handsome dalton james i also liked the music very much a highlight was land of the sea and sun from man so watch the movie and enjoy it
<START> duck of death needs to watch this film again as his major criticism is completely baseless the film never once forgot about the time delay and it was mentioned explicitly in a couple of places the crew were never shown having conversations with mission control that didn't obey the time delay rules br br one thing i did think was a bit far fetched was the amount of risk involved would a crew land on a planet on which pressure suits would only last two hours i doubt it would a manned space ship go into a star's corona i doubt it would humans land on a moon that was being bombarded with huge amounts of radiation i doubt it also the ship seemed overly sturdy would a ship designed like that risk atmospheric flight to slow it down i doubt it would it survive being hit by comet debris i doubt it i think in both cases the stresses on the structure would be too much but all in all the unlikely scenarios were compensated by some nicely done special effects good editing and production and some good acting especially by the actors portraying the ship's commander and the russian
<START> this is the second and best in the hunting trilogy what makes it the best is the clever dialogue br br bugs do you want to shoot me now or wait till you get home br br it was kind of funny how they kept that going through out the short
<START> very odd this seems like a very average movie to me if not slightly less it is brilliantly shot but together with the performance of r lee ermey that's about the only redeeming aspect i found in the movie which consists of two separate parts br br the first part covers the basic marine training which watching it in 2007 comes off like something i've see a zillion times before in dozens of other movies and series and it's not particularly gripping after 30 minutes i got the idea and wished they could just get on with it the drill sergeant is about the only believable character while everyone else seem to be just cardboard cut outs the general acting is staggeringly haggard and the screenplay is devoid of anything interesting and consists of little more than the sergeant shouting the boys make it through their training and end up in vietnam oh and the fat weirdo shoots the sergeant what a surprise probably in the mistaken belief that it was actually the scriptwriter br br so one hour passed and nothing worthy of note happened nothing br br then we have the vietnam part br br it opens with a bunk scene where reporters of stars and stripes are bored and are making small talk to pass the time at first i thought they were re enacting some movie scenes from old films it sounded pretty bad but no they were actually muttering their script lines then the camp is besieged some 20 vietcong enter the camp through the main gate too bad for them they are being dropped like flies because they simply walk into several manned gun posts with no means of cover is that normal behaviour were the vietnamese all suicidal if so how come the us didn't win this war during the first two months of engagement the rest of the movie continues with even more completely illogical war scenes br br furthermore the whole plot is altogether pointless none of the characters inspire much sympathy and the story is frankly rather uneventful it shows little more other than some war reporters hooking up with a platoon with some guys getting shot because they are disobedient morons and who also seem to think that somehow a gaping hole in a wall will protect you from bullets br br what was the message of this movie that people died in vietnam that people are animals in war situations that if you want to dispose of really dumb people you send them to a war zone or that somehow in vietnam concrete can actually burn br br i'm sorry but if this movie deserves an 8 3 then apocalypse now deserves a 38 3 br br 5 10
<START> just before dawn came out during the golden days of the slasher film the backwoods slasher pretty much started with films like friday the 13th the burning and madman just before dawn is a step ahead of the typical backwoods slasher flick the cinematography is gorgeous the acting is top notch the heroine of the film is not your typical 'final girl' br br constance is a girl but when it comes down to the primal instinct of survival she's a step behind not until it comes to saving the life of her and her boyfriend does the primal notion of survival kick in there's a subtle transition that gradually focuses on the final girls hidden sexuality coinciding that alongside her will to survive br br just before dawn isn't for everyone but for the slasher fan it's as close to perfect as you can get the killer s are very menacing almost like it's a game to and murder anyone who crosses their territory the end scene is a bit off kilter for the first time viewer it may be a little shocking i'd recommend this to anyone who's a fan of the backwoods slasher even non slasher fans will find something to like about it the setting is eerie and makes one feel uneasy the death sequences aren't particularly gory but i'm not sure the film needed gore see it
<START> dan dailey gives a sincere and colorful performance as the great dizzy dean his handling of the character is very true to life and captures the flavor of dean's background and limited education the film of course centers around dizzy deans rise to fame and his sudden trip to the sidelines with an injury he chose to ignore much to his regret his wife is splendidly portrayed by joanna dru who gives a very down to earth quality to the woman who loved and supported the ballplayer who rose to a dizzying height so quickly the portrayal of later career as a sportscaster is honest and unflinching reflecting his troubles which stemmed from his poor education and his colorful language both on and off the air dizzy was quite a character and daily has breathed life into his story with admirable skill if you enjoyed this film i recommend the comedy kid from left field 1953 wherein daily plays a down and out has been ballplayer idolized by his young son billy chapin daily again fleshes out a ballplayer in a completely satisfying manner i heartily recommend pride of st louis to baseball fans everywhere
<START> having recently purchased universal's marlene dietrich dvd collection i was somewhat reluctant to watch golden earrings the idea of a 40 something marlene dietrich as a gypsy in a war time romance seemed unusual and implausible i should not have worried with all the professional talent that went into these old movies it's hard to miss really the movie was a joy to watch it's a classic br br the most interesting thing about the film was dietrich who pulls off the gypsy role perfectly the makeup lighting photography and her performance all add up to make a really startling and memorable character i had never seen dietrich play a good woman convincingly before but she does here she played a lot of heartless vamps in those great sternberg films so it is refreshing to see her in a more down to earth relaxed role playing an exotic but very human character br br overall a very nice romance the love story is believable optimistic and the happy ending is extremely satisfying
