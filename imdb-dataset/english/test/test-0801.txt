<START> updating of the clare booth play and the 1939 movie is a major disappointment the cast of women is excellent most of the individual scenes work but nothing hangs together there is no connection from scene to scene almost as if the film was crafted in parts and then assembled in a vacuum granted the story of a woman dealing with her husband's infidelity and how she is helped and hindered by her friends is a less shocking one now in an age when divorce is so common but at the same time its just as timely as ever i just wish they could have managed to connect all of the pieces together because as it stands now you really don't feel pulled along by the plot wait for cable
<START> i saw this movie on vhs some time ago 27 jan 2003 just because of the name of paul rudd on the cover i liked his performance in the object of my very much and i really expected a good work however i found this film a complete mess the story has a very confused screenplay and the characters are not well developed further the low budget special effects do not help much i do not know the previous generation of gen y cops but this next generation is not good i do not recall exactly why i gave this grade and i do not intent to see this movie again but my vote is four br br title brazil gen y cops a nova gen y cops the next generation'
<START> this film is great i watched it with some friends and we thought it was proof that a film doesn't have to see commercial success to be a hit is what i would love to be able to say about this film in the words of the film itself you are very very bad i went to see an unlicensed once so generally agree with the moral of the film though br br i'd include a spoiler but the lack of plot makes this very tricky overall a cinematic disaster br br quotes 'you're not a leper at all ' 'you're beautiful and i bet you're nice too' 'have you ever seen a naked man's body ' 'you couldn't break a piece of straw ' br br cameos in dubbing micheal cane harold bishop steve benjamin yoda
<START> this time the lovable dimwit gets summoned for jury duty where a corrupt attorney notices that he looks like a jailbird who wants to break out so the two get switched of course most of the movie is a series of gags in ernest goes to jail most of the gags relate to electricity i really liked the whole vacuum cleaner sequence early on overall the point of the movie is just to have fun and i'm sure that you will this is possibly the ultimate movie that you watch with a bud it's quite safe to say that jim varney will truly be missed fyi the only other cast member whom i recognized was randall tex cobb who played lyle you've surely seen him somewhere
<START> watching this film caused quite an emotional reaction this is what today's documentaries are all about it's refreshing to watch something so personal honest and real mr thoughts opinions and disclosure are rarely seen these days and are incredibly well displayed here it's a fine line to walk between personal truth and exploitation this film treads very carefully and quite successfully br br one would think that learning about how a seemingly normal couple falls short of society's expectations would give birth to pessimism but it doesn't quite the opposite it made me feel good i feel that i now know more about marriage about women br br definitely check this out it'll make you think exactly what a good documentary should be designed to do
<START> flight of the living dead sports production values that belie the substandard script from director scott i'm a producer tell thomas and two hacks who shall remain nameless because i feel sorry for them having to attach those no names to this turkey apparently actually shot on film this direct to dvd release has almost nothing going for it that you haven't seen or heard a hundred times already br br despite the presence of a number of recognizable character actors like richard three o'clock high tyson erick stargate and raymond j little children barry and a slew of others not so recognizable fold is predominantly populated with cardboard most of which ends up soaked in unconvincing fake blood there are a few precious few gags that work the umbrella and the zombie trapped in his seat both come to mind but most of the scripting is pedestrian and comic book stupid and i am here to assure you that we're talking pedestrian and stupid you'll never for a second believe that fold is anything but a cheap cash in movie with pretensions of cool god forbid it ever spawn the sequel its idiotic ending promises br br strictly freebie viewing depending on how impecunious your local library is and otherwise suitable for insomniacs and the indiscriminate only
<START> essentially plotless action film has two good guys fong and roundtree pitted against two bad guys mitchell and pierce fong is perhaps the most uncharismatic action lead of the 80s small part is a far cry from his shaft days and cameron mitchell adds another shameful role to his career one to sit right next to his laughable turn in the toolbox murders this man was a respected actor once now he has come down to wearing flowers in his hair and complaining about people bleeding on his carpet only stack pierce acts with some dignity as for the violence don't worry most of it is too badly done to offend anyone 1 2
<START> i have wrestled with death it is the most unexciting contest you can imagine it takes place in an impalpable with nothing underfoot with nothing around without spectators without clamor without glory without the great desire of victory without the great fear of defeat in a sickly atmosphere of tepid skepticism without much belief in your own right and still less in that of your adversary if such is the form of ultimate wisdom then life is a greater riddle than some of us think it to be marlow in joseph conrad's heart of darkness br br it's difficult to make lyrical the subject of death in any work of art yet movies have recently made bold attempts to humanize it to the extent that it is embraced as a part of the cycle of all living things and it can be chosen rather than chosen is the operative word for alejandro amenabar's sea inside based loosely on the true story of the sailor ramon it is a drama about euthanasia without prejudice clothed in love poetry and friendship if it sounds like barbarian invasions 2003 in which a cancerous professor says farewell to lifelong friends and loves before he takes his life then you are right in fact sea is better because it spends more intimate time with the protagonist before he goes a remarkable feat with not one of those moments in the least dull or uninteresting br br javier bardem as ramon has expressive eyes and commanding voice for the romantic a combination of tough realist and poetic sufferer belen plays the disabled lawyer julia who becomes an imaginary lover for ramon increasing in radiance as her life degenerates with disease added to the already almost soap opera circumstance is lola as rosa a blue collar visitor who initially tries to dissuade ramon from seeking death but quickly falls in love with him talk about romanticizing guy has unbelievable luck attracting substantial women and he can't move a finger but talk he can proving the ultimate argument about what women want love that speaks not just makes br br i will refrain from mentioning the major motion picture now up for an oscar that features euthanasia as its climax in order not to spoil the experience for first timers sufficient it is just to say both films are successful in opening up both sides of a contentious subject without forcing a specific point of view the religious right has a right to complain that the former film and barbarian invasions celebrate suicide it has no right to accuse the beautifully balanced sea inside of the same br br a life in this condition has no dignity ramon says the irony is he conducts himself with supreme dignity that makes anyone question his determination to end his life the sea inside is a formidable entry in 2004's oscar nominations for best foreign language film
<START> this movie is soo bad that i've wasted way to much time already talking about it soo bad really bad and i'm not even that critical i'm almost ashamed to admit to having seen it sandra's few minutes show you how far she's really made it i mean really anything next to this is really oscar worthy for her i suppose the only way for her to look at it is there's no way but up after this one i suppose she had to start somewhere but really soo bad awful really bad is too good a word for this s t but i don't want to get mean now but really how can u not after wasting 90 minutes 90 minutes of my life that i'll never get back 90 minutes i could have spent doing something better like sitting on my butt and staring into space that would have been time better spent walks away shaking head
<START> david comments nearby are exceptionally well written and informative as almost say everything i feel about darling lili this massive musical is so peculiar and over blown over produced and must have caused ruptures at paramount in 1970 it cost 22 million dollars that is simply irresponsible darling lili must have been greenlit from a board meeting that said hey we got that pink panther guy and that sound of music gal lets get this too and handed over a blank cheque the result is a hybrid of gigi zeppelin half a sixpence some mgm 40s song and dance numbers of a style daisies and boaters so hopelessly old fashioned as to be like musical porridge and mata hari dramatics the production is colossal lush breathtaking to view but the rest the ridiculous romance julie looking befuddled hudson already dead the mistimed comedy and the astoundingly boring songs this spectacular film into being irritating lili is like a twee 1940s mega musical with some vulgar bits to spice it up star released the year before sadly crashed and now is being finally appreciated for the excellent film is genuinely is and andrews looks sublime mature especially in the last half hour but lili is poppins and dolly frilly and i believe really killed off the mega musical binge of the 60s and made andrews look like poppins again which i believe was not edwards intention paramount must have collectively fainted when they saw this and with another 20 million festering in catch 22 and 12 million in on a clear day and 25 million in paint your wagon they had a financial abyss of cleopatra proportions with 77 million tied into 4 films with very uncertain futures maybe they should have asked seer daisy gamble from on a clear day lili was very popular on immediate first release in australia and ran in 70mm cinemas for months but it failed once out in the subs and the sticks and only ever surfaced after that on one night stands with on a clear day as a sunday night double thank god paramount had their simple 1million yes one million dollar film love story and that 4 million dollar gangster pic the godfather also ready to recover all the 77 million in just the next two years for just incredible
<START> ed gein the butcher of is set in the small american town of in wisconsin during 1957 where loner ed gein kane hodder lives by himself on a farm after the death if his mother brother the local police have had a spate of grave robberies to deal with when local barmaid sue layton suspicions grow that something nasty is going on ed is a violent sexually deviant man who kidnaps girls murders them will the police figure the truth out in time to save erica adrienne the sheriff's timothy daughter br br written produced directed by michael this was an attempt to base a horror film around the true events surrounding notorious serial killer ed gein turns out to be pretty crap the real life ed gein was only ever convicted of two murders died in 1984 but several films have been inspired by him including the texas chainsaw massacre 1974 deranged 1974 ed gein 2000 with this fairly recent addition possibly being the worst gein film ever even though ed gein was real next to nothing in this film is based on fact gein never had an accomplice none of his victims were related to any of the investigating officers there was no car crash victim although gein keeps his name other people have had name changes the kidnapping murder of the two women depicted here actually happened four years apart in reality but in this film it happens over the course of a couple of days while here gein is shown as a large hulking muscular man in reality he was a scrawny thin old quite short as a factual drama ed gein the butcher of is worthless as pure entertainment it's no better with a deadly dull pace feel to it the character's are all boring when he isn't killing someone gein is shown working or just walking around it's very dull there's no suspense because we know who the killer is it's just a tedious wait until he gets caught at the end there is no real attempt to get into mind with the makers giving him no more motivation than him occasionally having hallucinations of his domineering mother br br there isn't much gore here there's a scene with a woman hanging on a meat hook there's a really badly edited scene of gein cutting a leg off there's the usual jars of bodily organs skulls lying around as well as a bit of blood but there's really not much here to get excited about the film was obviously processed to bleach a lot of the colour out of the picture as it's not far off black and white at times i personally think the lack of colour makes it even duller to sit through br br with a supposed budget of about 1 500 000 i can't really see where the money went in a very forgettable production although set in wisconsin this was filmed in california kane hodder is all wrong for the role of ed gein just from a physical point of view hodder doesn't look even remotely like gein he gives a pretty poor performance to as he just stares at the camera a lot making silly faces br br ed gein the butcher of is crap it's as simple straightforward as that as either a factual drama or pure exploitation entertainment this is total tripe from start to finish with nothing to recommend it
<START> i think this is the best norwegian movie i've ever seen it's about 40 year old andreas who gets hit by a subway train and suddenly finds himself in a strange city however everything here has been made ready for him he has got a job a house and clothes at first this city seems perfect no death no pain and no problems everywhere there are men in gray suits who cleans up and fixes everything that doesn't fit into their definition of perfect however andreas can't really seem to fit in and starts to long back to his old world and tries with all means to get back br br the thing that impresses my the most in this movie is how they way of making the city seem so surrealistic even though i have seen a lot of these places in real life they seem so distant another thing that contributes greatly to the is the performance from the actors is just the perfect guy to play the confused and bothersome andreas and all the other characters are also doing a great job by playing apathetic sounds like a hard job doesn't it the strong difference between andreas and the others leads to very amusing situations as well br br all in all this is a fabulous movie the plot may be a little confusing but the movie has such a great atmosphere i would recommend that everyone should go see it br br and i wouldn't recommend listening to as it seems he has seen too many commercial american movies and seems to have became too used to just getting served the moral on a silver plate the way i see it there is not much in this film that tries to tell us about suicide being right or wrong i consider it more of a warning of a direction our society seems to be taking but sure everyone can see a film in their own way
<START> fame had been one of my favorite movies for years it is not just an 80's musical movie of that high school in nyc it is legendary people no longer refer to the high school of performing arts but the fame school br br the characters are real they are not hollywood and their stories are real the film follows them through the four years of school starting with a powerful monologue by one student at auditions and finishing with a spectacular graduation show br br apparently some find the broadway show better however it is my opinion that you should definitely see this movie anyway and then have your own view for anyone who enjoys movie watching and would like to have the classics down this is surely one of them it is an example of one of those movies that was really great with actors that we loved for those 2 hours and then never saw them again they are classic fame students br br make fame live forever
<START> a fabulous film which i have now watched several times over since buying the video only four days ago yes i am a colin firth fan and colin was his usual talented natural gorgeous self br br the interaction between colin matthew field and sammy 7 year old son was very special and so natural to watch they were hilariously funny together and also touched my heart strings the scenes which i loved the most was sammy and matt sitting on the wall chatting and matt then falling backwards off the wall in an hilarious fashion i won't reveal the content of their discussion so as not to spoil the plot also very hilarious was sammy matt about sex colin and were perfect in this scene and making what can be an awkward subject between adult and child just so natural words and face at the end of that scene were so delightful and said it all just brilliant credit of course must also go to roberts for his delightful portrayal of sammy he played such a lovable and cheeky child character the two actors were just perfect together br br the interaction between colin matt and was perfectly balanced and i couldn't agree more that the chemistry between them was wonderful to watch displaying love tension and of course passion it was exciting to see how their delicate blossoming romance gradually unfolded also showing how their cultural and social divides affected their relationship and was good to see how colin and sensitively portrayed matt and discovering accepting and overcoming these differences it kept me fixed to the tv and guessing right until the end of the film br br portrayal of matt's vulnerable and juvenile side was also perfectly portrayed so much so that i found it was difficult to watch when matt was so mean and childish towards sammy because he matt felt that sammy was getting in the way of his romance relationship with sams mother one couldn't help feeling very disappointed angry and frustrated with matt for treating sammy this way and this in turn threatening to spoil matts special relationship with sammy and special talent of 'getting inside a character's head' and displaying to the audience the different sides of a character was very much in evidence here and pure magic to watch i must also mention that colin also has such a good rapport with young actors see also 'my life so wonderful and not to be missed film br br i also loved the relationship between matthew and his wife jenny both were excellent in displaying to the audience the dark side and tensions within their marriage and that not all seemingly 'happy are quite what they may seem from the outside br br i mustn't forget to mention the reverend whom i thought was very funny in a serious sort of way also mother and family were hilarious as well as bringing across the importance of culture and her situation br br the downside i can't really find a downside but to be objective about the film and to give credibility to my review the only negative comment that i would make is that the script writers didn't explain in enough detail as to why matt collapsed in the car there was only a vague suggestion from of something being wrong with his heart however this didn't detract from my enjoyment of the film far from it i just needed to rewind the tape a little for a 2nd take br br i felt that this film had it all entertaining uplifting and i loved the rich colours and sunny scenery the film warmed up a cold winters day and made me smile all the essential elements were there laughter love tension sadness anger drama and a warm feel good factor with yes plenty of those delicious colin firth moments including a very soaked colin in a shirt scene' not to be missed by any fan what more could a girl want br br i would strongly recommend this film specially to any colin firth fans
<START> random hearts snuck up on me criticized for the implausibility of a the premise and b the pairing of an ia cop and a congresswoman as well as for its slowness the film felt just fine to me and even ended up being surprisingly absorbing i found my interest engaged as the film cut back and forth between ford's and thomas's lives as they first found out about and dealt in very different ways in very different environments with their deaths and the subsequent revelation that they were involved with other people it could happen two people's philandering spouses could be on the same plane the plane could go down the survivors could be brought together by the aftermath so what if it's improbable improbable is not the same as far fetched so what if it did happen why not speculate br br ford's and thomas's performances are believable and nuanced instead of finding their coupling implausible opposite sides of the tracks give me a break i felt it driven by a grief and betrayal neither party knew how to deal with the script does not bring them together too soon or too easily and the end of the film does not resolve their relationship conventionally either where i find it unsatisfying is when the dialogue brings up interesting wrinkles in or insights into the ramifications of the situation personal and professional but never seems to pursue any of them very far and if you make the mistake of thinking about it too hard harrison ford does seem about 10 years too old for the part br br for five and a half bucks at wal mart with full length director commentary and behind the scenes featurette the dvd is well worth owning i don't think i would pay 20 for it on a bet but my wife might ok ten
