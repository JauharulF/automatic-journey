<START> the only interesting part of this movie was it's jazz and reggae new orleans back drop it tries to be one of those movies that has two struggles the heroine has to overcome one from the past and one from the present which she fails to do convincingly the acting's bad and the direction is even worse i'm not surprised at all that this went straight to video the end result of this film leaves no one satisfied or convinced including the actors themselves
<START> am i the only person who thinks that the entire forensics and scenes of crime community in the usa must detest this almighty slap in their faces a rookie cop is first to a crime scene where her back up is so slow to respond that she has time to send the kid who found the body to the local store to buy a disposable camera by the time he returns still no senior cops or other assistance for the lovely jolie this is new york isn't it it has started raining and she gets to work photographing the evidence only after she'd stood in front of an to stop it disturbing the scene br br i want to know the name of that camera as the photographs were so incredibly detailed that no amount of zooming in distorted the images the horror continues not in the film itself pretty ordinary i'm afraid but in the lincoln rhyme character as played by mr washington this man is a highly dedicated forensic crime scene examiner with years of experience who instead of the highly trained but invisible local crime scene entrusts the work to an untrained cop a rookie cop who proceeds to find the very obviously placed clues and move them before photographing them thus contaminating every item and making dna profiling well nigh impossible now that was a bright idea eh i know one should be able to suspend disbelief to a degree but those who say this film is intelligent must have entirely disengaged their ability to think in order to find this film believable br br i have given this film 4 10 for the superb acting of denzel washington and for miss jolie's lips which are the only items requiring my disbelief to be suspended
<START> this movie starts with interesting set design and a promising premise but fails to provide the cult movie goods set in a gritty parallel universe where everything is owned by the corporation it concerns a horrible stand up comic who finds success when he grows a third arm out of his back br br all the potential for great cheese is here washed up 80's star judd nelson wayne newton offbeat visuals and strange plot digressions obese women in skimpy lingerie necrophilia but it never pays off br br the pacing is the main problem each scene is slow nelson's stand up routines are supposed to be funny because they're pathetically not funny but each performance drags on until it's not even tangentially funny just boring br br imagine someone telling you the longest weirdest joke imaginable full of smirky self congratulation for how funny and weird he thinks it is imagine after a stultifying two hours of this you never got a punch line you've just saved yourself the trouble of watching the dark backward
<START> i have to admit that when first saw madonna performing holiday on top of the pops many years ago i said to my wife another american one hit wonder getting the whole thing wrong well she was wearing a fright wig and was appallingly dressed i have never grown to love her the way my daughter does but i have to eat my words i do like some of her stuff and sometimes enjoy her filmed concerts this confessions tour film is great even if the music is not and its not i was impressed by the staging and concepts madonna's own performance was enhanced by the incredible dancers she chose to support her my daughter was at the london gigs and was crazy about it the lady madge has proved my initial assessment of her so very wrong
<START> i had only written one review on imdb prior to this as i consider most games as unworthy of the time and effort curse of monkey island is different br br having played and been impressed by monkey 1 and 2 i had great expectations for the third release and was not disappointed the first thing that hit me was the substantially improved graphics don't get me wrong for games made in 1990 and 1991 respectively monkey 1 and 2 were ground breaking and provided the goods well but steps up and delivers a superb cartoon style game play which is both fun and satisfying all scenes and settings have been carefully crafted and well thought out and suit this type of game perfectly the animation cgi is a mixture of realism and exaggeration a fantastic combination in this case br br for me the script has been crucial in the success of the previous two games the script is clever appropriate and above all absolutely hilarious added to this the script is now audio unlike the previous two where speech is displayed in text format at the bottom of the screen dominic voice is perfect for witty clear and slightly naive all other voice talents fit their characters perfectly especially earl boen who is the voice behind i loved every single character throughout the game not just their personalities and wit but the way each character is animated superbly and distinctively whilst on the subject of audio effects the soundtrack is worth a mention the soundtracks for monkey 1 and 2 were both monotone and despite this were very effective at giving atmosphere and representing a change in mood soundtrack is once again a step up each scene is complemented by a catchy subtle playful and if that's a word tune with a change in setting or mood the music also adapts adding to the entertainment and amusement that the game offers br br the whole idea behind monkey island is to solve puzzles and problems in order to progress this might sound easy but is actually devilishly tricky in many places some may be put off by the level of logic and amount of thinking that goes into monkey island but in reality this makes the game even more entertaining and fun and also adds to the replay value the option of the curse of monkey island or the curse of monkey island mega monkey which involves trickier and more abundant puzzles suits players of all abilities and also gives good cause to play the game at least twice whatever difficulty level you choose you are guaranteed a different game each time you replay with numerous speech options and other puzzles to solve that don't affect the outcome of the game but are just there for fun the most entertaining section of the game is ship combat and the sword fights that follow these were particularly well thought out and make the game completely worthwhile add to this a stupendous story that is non violent and suitable for all ages which will keep you hooked and wanting more until the very end br br finally in conclusion a uniquely special mention must go to the designers of this game the way each complex puzzle and problem is thought out is simply astonishing whilst gathering up items and objects during game play you can't see how each one is going to help you progress but with a little thought and perseverance solutions present themselves and for that the designers of must be highly commended br br 10 10 for the best game i have ever played not an exaggeration
<START> lights of new york originally started out as an experimental two reel vitaphone short that eventually into the first all talkie feature film was supposedly one of the most beautiful actresses in hollywood and sister to in my opinion the real beauty dolores costello who seemed to get all the breaks poor is best known for appearing in this pretty dreary film that bought a revolution to hollywood br br two bootleggers on the lam in main street convince a couple of small town barbers to try their luck on broadway the barbers eddie cullen landis and gene eugene palette don't realise that their barber shop is soon a cover for illegal bootlegging activities they soon do realise it and regret the day they left their small town the only thing keeping them going is the loan that eddie's mother gave them and that they desperately want to pay back eddie becomes re acquainted with kitty lewis costello a girl from his home town who has made good on broadway kitty is worried about hawk miller wheeler who is always hanging around her but eddie innocently thinks she is exaggerating as hawk already has a girlfriend molly gladys but to reassure her he gives her a little handgun to frighten unwanted admirers away hawk who has killed a police officer and has the feds closing in decides to frame eddie meanwhile molly is getting pretty fed up with hawks treatment of her and after a showdown where he tells her he is after a chicken and not an old hen the stage is set for murder br br the fact is it isn't completely awful apart from gangsters and showgirls alike speaking in their best elocution voices and that was still happening in films in 1930 gladys if a trifle melodramatic and eugene palette quite natural were okay and were the most seasoned actors in the cast there was no john or ethel barrymore to be seen cullen landis and costello soon returned to the obscurity from which they had come i also didn't notice much of the hidden mike where people had to be grouped around different objects ie a telephone or sitting on a couch before they could engage in conversation people who saw it at the cinema probably started to think that all policeman talked in that flat monotone as that trend continued in many early talkies ie little caesar 1930 in any case they were probably intrigued by the novelty of a completely all talkie with some singing and dancing film in 1928 br br recommended
<START> after watching this film i thought to myself they really glossed up errol flynn's life the movie is really nice eye candy they really got the 1930s and 1940s atmosphere of hollywood just right the costumes were great all the women looked glamorous and all the men looked handsome and debonair br br is this a serious film about errol flynn's life nah it's a fun movie based on all the scandalous stuff he did in his life br br why am i critiquing this film this is a film that had a lot of promise but failed to deliver duncan was really good as errol flynn he was not as good looking as the original but he made you believe that flynn was not just a handsome playboy who did not take himself seriously but as a man who although gifted with great talent was kind of disturbed and unhappy inside flynn's love life was a disaster considering he had so many failed marriages he also lost a lot of good friends during his life he also suffered from unrequited love for the elegant olivia dehavilland the last scene of the film showed errol kind of begging for olivia to stay with him and instead she walks away he is shown in his tux looking really empty and slowly walking around the pool as he pours his drink into the pool it was a sad way to end the film but kind of fitting because everyone knows by now how he eventually fell apart from his alcoholism and his dissipated lifestyle br br this film could've had much more depth could've been better well written sure they showed all the scandals but they never showed errol flynn's human center surprisingly duncan was able to put some emotional depth into the character of errol flynn even though the film writing didn't put any depth there br br i'll probably never see this film again but i can still remember after viewing this film gosh this could've been so much more i give this film a d
<START> after seeing meredith in beyond the prairie i had to buy another film with her staring i cannot believe how she let herself into this teenage flick it's best to watch this one with the sound off but just concentrate on meredith as she moves across the screen save your money until the tv network comes out with a dvd on beyond the prairie it's worth it at any price this one needs to pay you to see br br this pretty lady needs someone to put her into a script that can use both her talent as an actress and her beauty as a woman perhaps some of her latest might fit but i haven't seen them she has the smile of a cathrine bell and eyes of dana delany with a much younger body br br
<START> pretty lousy made for tv sequel to the roman polanski classic rosemary's son adrian has grown up and is embodied by creepy stephen mchattie after eliminating rosemary here played by patty duke a coven of witches again led by minnie roman preps satan's son for world domination it's not really scary and light years less macabre than its predecessor instead writer anthony wilson and director sam o'steen opt for a satan worshiping thriller full of a lot of chanting plenty of candles and ruth gordon trying to act daffy and nasty at the same time gordon's the sole from the original george replaces john cassavetes as guy and a very hammy ray milland plays roman subbing for the late sidney newcomer mchattie is the film's only real saving grace he's very off kilter and looks really sinister without even doing anything the music by charles bernstein is suitably creepy but so over used it's ends up being intrusive rather than effective o'steen who edited the earlier polanski masterpiece shows no flair or subtlety whatsoever
<START> virginal innocent finds herself at a house of prostitution run by ruthless pimp mg winds up incarcerated in private prison after she refuses to make love to him of course and worldly top con helga join forces and plan to escape maman blah uninspired direction and dull talky script thoroughly undermine any trashy vitality this flick needs in order to qualify as a pleasing piece of babes behind bars exploitation junk the sluggish pace painfully drags throughout there's no gratuitous female nudity whatsoever the girls don't even show any skin during the obligatory group shower scene the expected torture and degradation are both extremely tame and tepid the moderate crummy gore likewise fails to impress and even a ridiculous catfight sequence ain't nothing to get excited about thomas pedestrian cinematography the laughably lousy dubbing the excruciatingly overlong 102 minute running time the sappy theme song and cornball score add further abject insult to already appalling injury only some decent last reel break out action offers a little relief from the otherwise overly abundant stultifying tedium a complete yawn inducing dud
<START> this is an example of a movie that can have great potential and is executed very poorly i am a fan of kids and thumb sucker and many other so called teen angst films but this one bugged me br br why is every white kid made into a thug who loves rap its getting to be one dimensional the acting was awful but simple since it mainly consisted of just dropping f bomb after f bomb just a bad bad movie if you'd like to see better movies like this thumb sucker kids bully all br br those i think are better so i recommend one of those is you'd like to see a good teen movie i hope my comment you found useful and hope you hear future comments from me
<START> return to sender a k a convicted is almost imperfect the one good thing about this particular film was that i was never bored that being said the reviews that hail this movie as a low budget success may not have watched the same movie that i saw br br rather than write a review and tell you what happens and what works and doesn't work i will simply comment that nothing works there are plot holes in this movie that you can drive a semi through the acting in the film is not very good although that may be a result of a script so poorly worded that it could have been ghost written by george lucas there was no need for exceptional sets or costumes for this particular movie and everything seemed appropriate did i mention that there were some plot holes by the end of the movie you are wondering how a blind guy can be such a good shot with a shotgun why kelly preston trusts aidan quinn why she would fall asleep the night before her client is supposed to be killed how aidan quinn can drive 400 miles in such a short time with a car that keeps breaking down during the rest of the movie why aidan quinn didn't by a fifth instead of a bunch of nips etc br br with all that being said this is certainly a b movie and a terrible one at that the unfortunate thing is that it just isn't bad enough to be good if you value your time please let this serve as a public service message to stay away from this one
<START> anyone who has seen the trailer for this film would be forgiven for thinking this film is an out and out comedy in actual fact it's a light hearted though not overly funny romp about a couple of br br there are numerous faults in the film the script and plot are weak and the love aspect of the story is strangely dull yet despite all this it is quite enjoyable thanks largely to the two leads robert carlyle and jonny lee miller these two fine actors carlyle in particular are always good to watch and here there exists a good chemistry between them br br director jake scott is the next generation of the family whose brothers ridley and tony have given us films such as alien blade runner true romance and more recently g i jane and enemy of the state his debut is directed with energy and enthusiasm which keeps the film fizzling along although without the strong cast he assembled the results might not have worked as well br br in short if you're looking for an easy enjoyable film to pass an hour and a half then you could do a lot worse than and if on the other hand you fancy something subtle historically accurate and thought provoking go elsewhere 7 10
<START> this film is terrible and don't blame jesus franco because its not his fault br br this film was shot silent over many years by welles as he got the money to bring a crew and the actors together to do some shooting how much film welles actually shot is not clear although not all of the film or all of the sequences are here since several key sequences such as quixote in a movie theater are in the hands of collectors or backers who wouldn't give them up the film here is just under two hours and i would be hard pressed to imagine it ever really working at any length i'm of the opinion based on several comments that welles made before his death that he never really intended to release the film but was putting it together as a personal toy br br what exists here is for the most part is beautifully shot but dramatically dead very little happens for the first hour other than quixote and sancho wandering around the country side dull would be a kind description of the material in the second hour quixote ends up in modern spain and in a series of not very good sequences deals with everyday life this isn't to say that there isn't a few nice moments the windmill and the chicken sequences are quite good but mostly this is a vast waste of film and time br br completed by jesus franco who was welles' assistant director on the vastly superior chimes at midnight we have a bunch of film fragments that have been put together as best as possible many people have crucified franco as having been the reason the film stinks but frankly one can not make a good movie from crap material one critic has gone on record as having seen a different cut of the film in the 1970's which meant that franco made this version up on his own and ruined it while that maybe true i've run across stories of welles cutting and re cutting the film many many times over the years since he could never get it right br br this film is terrible no matter how you slice it br br ultimately i'm left wondering just how good a film maker welles was aside from citizen kane almost all of his films have been plagued by lack of budget or interfered with so we are left with the excuse that many of his films would have been better if only how do we know how can we know perhaps welles was a man of less talent than we thought and many of his borderline films just aren't that good and never would have been while this is no place to argue the place of welles in film history the surviving material of don quixote assuming it approximates what welles intended i think it does is a good case for rethinking how we view the man and his work br br 4 out of 10 for the good sequences though 2 out of 10 is probably closer to reality
<START> here is a fantastic concept for a film a series of meteors crash into a small town and the resulting alien infection is caught on a deputy's single camera dash cam as the town slowly taken over leave it to albert pyun to screw that up don't get within 100 feet of this flick holy crap what a bomb it might be pyun's worst yet the crazy thing is there is the germ of a creative idea in here an entire of an outbreak told from the pov of a when i heard that a while back i imagined the car smashing into stuff people getting run over and infected types breaking the windshield and surrounding the car in chaos that would be cool right instead we have the lead driving around in circles for the entire time in a wooded area occasionally running into the three infected types who just stand there the last bit is literally a 15 minute shot where nothing happens in front of the camera just noises are heard offscreen stay away on a somewhat relieving note i think i am officially calling an end to my pyun watching only took me 20 crappy movies to realize i have better things to do
