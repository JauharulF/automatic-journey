<START> i would agree with the comments already posted to this site by the previous rater br br i first stumbled across this movie back in the '80s when i was employed at a psychiatric hospital unfortunately many of the barbs aimed at the psychiatric profession do hit home i especially enjoyed the ending where the psychiatrist would speak thru the door to the hospitalized grodin trust me its fairly accurate br br of course doors at most psych hospitals are not locked nor are used much these days and any hospital must be licensed to have a padded room br br but a wonderfully underrated film and certainly one that is quite amusing br br jeff
<START> not the best of the lone star series but it moves along quickly with good performances br br introduced as singin' sandy in the main title john wayne as a cowboy' isn't successful you never even see a front close up of him while he's ' the actual singer is the director's son bill bradley who away sounding like many popular singers of the day such as hutch or joseph br br the film features cecilia parker also seen in the lost jungle serial tombstone canyon and as older sister marian in the andy hardy movies doing her best katherine hepburn really they mustn't really i'm not al st john before he literally became fuzzy filling all his available screen time with his characteristic business of hat flipping head and chin scratching grimacing and gawky physical gestures and movements george pre gabby hayes as a gentle pipe smoking father and forrest taylor minor vet of 395 movies and tv shows playing the oily villain with string bow tie and prop cigar br br fun or odd moments yakima canutt's great 'under the trick the 'gay' scene when singin' sandy ties bert and elmer together face to face drags them roped to his horse and dumps them at office where kincaid says you're a fine pair of lovebirds rapturous comment after an atrocious song and guitar playing performance by ' ummm i could listen to that all night reply we won't go into that after being told by a rancher you've got the soul of a snake and of course he utters the immortal i've made denton an offer he can't refuse br br the plot of the movie is saved by sandy's tricking kincaid and later saying the three magic words in many of these films i'm from washington fdr has saved us from the depression is that why the villains are always either bankers or in real estate br br the shootout sequence is taken from the earlier bradbury film man from hell's edges 1932 all of the lone star westerns are special because of their unique mixture of interesting characters the troupe of actors and stunt people and the spin on the clichÃ©s and repetitive back stories and situations this one ranks a little low marred by the inappropriate and mis used singing cowboy gimmick i'll give it a 4
<START> now we know movies the excellent paper will be blue and boogie but its worth to see again or at last this first furia which shows perfectly clear his initial qualities br br its very interesting to see how his beginners talent developed into confirming him as one of the best romanian contemporary directors br br of course the movie itself is excellent intelligent and professional script sure handed direction stylish photography definitely one of the best in the most serious and competent sense also storytelling sense is compelling and gripping and he actors well they simply rock
<START> i was out of town visiting an old friend after dinner talking he expressed some reservations about his daughter's boy friend she's 15 beautiful smart athletic and the young man is also from an excellent family nice also athletic if not as smart i told him he might just be feeling the normal fatherly concerns however a few minutes later the young man arrived with his dvd of this flick which he had apparently been anxious for some time to share with the others br br these folks have a bona fide home theater set up with a screen something in excess of 4 feet and the two young folks preceded to view it while the young swain proceeded to extol its virtues almost frame by frame br br i saw enough in a few moments and with some fascination in its awfulness to endorse all of the most critical comments i've seen in scanning some here br br i told my friend i wouldn't go so far as to disqualify the young suitor solely on the basis of his liking this opus but it certainly seems to warrant his bearing close watch br br some flicks are so bad they're good the classic plan 9 from outer space and in my opinion the wonderfully awful bruce jenner village people work can't stop the music br br however this one remains firmly simply in the awful category br br second third fourth bananas even the best of these e g tim conway don knotts everybody with seinfeld have great difficulty in carrying a later starring series or as here film and these were great supporting characters in their original situations br br the eddie character really at about the 5th or 6th banana level in the prior movies and never added a whole lot to these in my opinion randy quaid is a capable actor who has delivered some good performances his contribution to the prior vacation was average at best both he and the other cast members many of whom have done some good work in the past accomplished nothing for their efforts here except to derive a few years' house payments or some ira contributions br br this whole presentation story performances from lead to support couldn't be worse
<START> oh my gosh this was the first movie broken lizard made as a group although it just recently came to video and i have never been more disappointed in my entire life i tell you what if i had seen this movie before i saw super troopers which by the way is a kick a movie i never ever would have watched it i had read several reviews online as well as on the cover of the dvd that raved it as being broken lizard's funniest movie ever now if they were referring to super troopers as being their funniest movie ever i would agree nonstop but not this one talk about dry it took the movie a good 45 minutes to even get going and by then i was so out of the mood to watch it that it wasn't even worth it maybe you gotta be high for it to really be funny i dunno i love these guys i really do but that movie is by far the worst one they've made club dread was a pretty good movie but this one just wow i'd highly recommend super troopers if you want a good laugh but if you want more of a romance drama with a few funny spots i'd say go with puddle cruiser just my opinion though everyone is entitled to their own
<START> this gawd awful piece of tripe is all over the place the script is bad the plot is bad the acting is bad there are a couple of decent actors in it charles durning eg but the director got nothing out of them the plot line has santa feeling dejected and thinking no one needs him any more taking a little girl across country to try to get her father back together with her mother it includes a con man in a santa suit with a stuffed parrot on his shoulder played by isaac from the love boat the world's largest elf played by bruce a very funny man but no actor a hardened factory owner who works his employees overtime on christmas eve and a sleigh race where someone cuts one of santa's skis trying to win if the plot sounds bad it's worse on the little screen if you see this movie coming up next run do not walk to your television and unplug it you may want to boil your television to remove any remaining infection if you accidentally watch more than 10 minutes of this you may have to burn your television and have the cable company install entirely new lines
<START> the first 10 minutes of the movie makes fun of sequels and pg 13 movies these are the 2 reasons the movie is so bad they constantly reference a movie called get leo which is the movie in a movie version of get shorty every time they do this you will be really angry travolta isn't very cool neither is keitel however the rock and vince vaughn are hilarious they aren't the kind of funny you would expect to see in an elmore leonard movie though if you haven't seen get shorty you will probably like be cool if you liked get shorty you will leave the theater wanting to kill the director and screenwriter wait for the dvd
<START> i saw grande at its world premiere on the rotterdam film festival i had no idea what i was entering and if i'd had any idea i wouldn't have entered this is the most pretentious film i've seen for a long time it tries to be provocative yet deep with its full frontal homosexual sex scenes it doesn't succeed it's nothing but another bad excuse of showing naked persons on the big screen 4 10
<START> but not too hip and not too wisecracking judas kiss nails the new noir thing just right great pacing and a nuanced score round out a twisty tale filled with sex betrayal and sure fire one liners inspiring work all around kudos in to his best work ever gil bellows ally mc what and carla the best fatale in ages smart funny and ultra hot i give this a 9 out of 10 and that's because 10 should be reserved for like humphrey bogart and coen bros movies
<START> it's the story of three brothers pulling together in the midst of hardship and loss and learning that the really important things in life are family love trust and forgiveness the entire cast manages to pull in a powerful performance despite a few lousy one liners a great film for fans of true to life problems believable families also worth a look for fans of dermot mulroney or sean astin they both do an astounding job often bringing you to tears take my word for it and rent this today
<START> i was so impressed with tim mutant hunt that i gave this one a try it is the near future post apocalypse of course a wandering fighter named neo no not that neo joins a group of similar looking fighters to challenge the dark one and his underling along the way they encounter mutants crazed females sewer worms a big spider leg and some clunky robots oh my br br sadly robot holocaust is hardly up or down to hunt's level clocking in at a painful 79 minutes the box says 90 this is one cheap flick the sets have all the elaborate design of a carnival haunted house and the costumes prove that in the near future everyone will dress like john travolta in the final dance number of staying alive the atomic wasteland is a combination of rubble filled old buildings and central park the dark one's headquarters is ominously named the power station and looks like well a power station the acting is universally bad except for as the evil is a whole 'nother level of bad vit er sick she gives a performance so amazingly bad that it becomes the sole reason to recommend this film she also delivers the film's only nudity in the pleasure chamber section of the film ed french again supplies the robot effects but they aren't nearly as slimy as his work in mutant hunt
<START> like in a circle the movie leads back to its point of departure the image of the cranes that are crossing a sky they represent the freedom to realize your life as you wish in order to aspire the greatest possible fulfilment br br in the beginning veronica and boris experience such a promise of happiness and their eyes follow the path of the cranes in exhilaration it seems as if they might be able to live according to their dreams br br but man is not a bird life draws up its own rules from which no human can escape and which we cannot change not even by making a supreme effort war breaks out and without much hesitation boris signs up for the front in order to fulfil his patriotic duty he cannot even say good bye to veronica for she arrives late at the assembly point from which the soldiers are sent away surrounded by a jubilant crowd all her attempts to attract boris' attention must inevitably fail br br boris eventually gets killed in war without veronica learning about it for the moment his brother mark a vigorous musician who obtained the from military service by corruption is eager to take his place veronica initially resists but in a frightful night of bombing she finally falls victim to his charms a marriage takes place which is never accepted by the family br br soon feelings of guilt seize hold of veronica and she realizes that boris' return is the one and only thing she actually longs for she therefore eases her bad conscience and despair by the self sacrificing work in a field hospital br br when war finally is over once again a crowd of enthusiastic people gathers in order to cheer the victorious soldiers again veronica is among them forcing her way through a wall of bodies in her hand she is carrying a bunch of flowers until she finally has to give it away to complete strangers for one of the has just dashed her hopes by confirming the sad certainty of boris' death br br once again the cranes invade the sky drawing their wayward lines but now veronica is watching them on her own and the look in her eyes is a different one she has had to accept the impossibility to live according to preconceived plans to follow the guidelines of your dreams for all humans are nothing but helpless puppets hanging on the inscrutable strings of fate br br
<START> during the 1990's several attempts have been made to revive old matsumoto's series tried to revive old saga in form of a laughably bad which was completely abandoned after mere two episodes captain harlock suffered a confusing and pointless harlock saga while galaxy express 999 suffered having this hack of a movie stapled to its name br br if you've seen queen millennia you'll recall that it was a wonderful movie in its own way maetel legend tries to tell a sequel to this already concluded chapter also finding a way to suck at doing so br br this movie takes all the annoying aspects of a generic pulp science fiction movie mixes it with badly paced melodrama and to add an insult to an injury tosses in some of the most renowned characters from matsumoto's universe br br the only redeeming aspect of this movie is good artwork but the remainder is so amazingly bad that it can't save this movie from being a total loss br br if you've enjoyed queen millennia or galaxy express do yourself a favor and skip this hack of a movie you'll thank me
<START> this movie is horrible and wonderful at the same time i first saw it when i was about 13 or 14 years old so it has a great deal of nostalgic value for me in this movie cesar romero actually plays the character of the man who discovered santana there are also two other actors monte markham plays sam who is trying to save his daughter and peter mark richman plays the priest who have large filmographies and these are the only performances that are okay the rest of the acting and the movie itself have all of the b film qualities that some of us cherish br br i recently spent 2 years trying to acquire a copy of this movie and it is almost nonexistent i am assuming that it was discontinued very shortly after its release but i did eventually find a copy and paid a pretty penny to acquire it if you happen to come upon judgement day in a video store with a cheesy green satan on the cover count yourself among the blessed who live near one of the few video stores that still has a working copy a must see for those of you who like to laugh at cheesy attempts at a scary movie
<START> i thought it was comedy what a hoot i can't believe forsythe or reynolds would actually appear in this piece of trash and then there's the beautiful erika eleniak or whatever this piece of eye candy is called appears she put on a few pounds since her playboy centerfold like about 50 the story line is ludicrous the acting absolutely horrendous and the tired old clichÃ©'s that are run over and over and over again boy it took a lot of stamina to sit through this dog the only thing worth it was the laughs and there are plenty if you really want to kill say an hour and a half pick this baby up at the rental shop but make sure you have a room full of brain dead people to watch it with you i think that's who it was written for it plays like they were thinking of a real low rent drug induced audience for this one
