<START> broadcast news dir james l brooks 1987 br br br br although it lacks the emotional punch of brooks's debut feature terms of endearment broadcast news is a superlative film with exceptional performances from each of the three leads and a script that feels as genuine and well researched as a hard hitting news report let it be known this is a character film first and foremost and a satire second in my mind it succeeds on both levels on its own terms the film's characters are given surprising depth and dimension while the satire remains sly and never bitter comparisons to network are unnecessary because the films have two completely separate goals and attitudes while also a great film network is a cynical and weary work in other words its mad as hell and fed up with the state of television network's style of satire feels more extreme and guerrilla in contrast the characters the news rooms of broadcast news love and live for their jobs sometimes to the detriment of their love lives they derive pleasure from the stresses and satisfactions of news reporting just as the audience derives pleasure from watching this sweet and romantically realistic masterpiece
<START> i occasionally let my kids watch this garbage so they will understand just how pathetic the show's contestants are they are pathetic not because they are fat but because they whore their dignity for a few minutes of fame and fortune br br for anyone to appear on national tv and blubber sniffle and whine about being fat entirely their own fault is nauseating what does this say about us as a nation does it suggest that your lifestyle choices and the consequences of them aren't our responsibility br br the biggest loser is an appropriate title but it has nothing to do with one's weight br br absolute trash
<START> this was such a terrible film almost a comedy sketch of a noir film the budget was low compared to a blockbuster but still higher than most but its where they've decided to cut costs that is totally weird some actors are at least competent while others look like they just been dragged off the street one of them being the lead actor hes so very bad that i cringed when ever he said anything he talks through the entire movie then there's the weird costume choices at the start of the movie all characters are wearing 1930's clothes they drive a classic car but the background is a modern day thats blatantly state of the art and the costumes and some settings continue to follow this 30's film noir theme then bam in drives a brand new with 24 inch wtf same thing again when a guy has a night scope on his rifle you get a shot down its sight hes aiming at a guy with an mp5 and tactical gear on in a even stranger contrast the locations are brilliant and seem to have cost more than the rest of the entire film the camera shots angles a very good and show these locations brilliantly in the scenes the director has a keen eye for a good looking single shot but no idea how to do much else br br people who should be shot for this br br the writer the director the casting agent the costume designer br br people who should be tortured to death for their monotone monotonous nails on chalk board voice br br anton the lead actor writer producer if you ever seen the movie hostel i wish that would happen to this guy but he doesn't escape
<START> how on earth this film isn't more widely regarded is beyond me br br i picked it up for Â£1 and i'm not exaggerating when i say it's the best pound i've ever spent on a film br br the thing that usually lets films about the club scene down is either the music or the actual scenes filmed in br br here the music and club scenes are completely credible using some big tunes of the time and filmed in real clubs with people actually looking like they want to be there br br the performances from the actors are of a high standard all round although jason donovan in particular for me stands out he was playing frank n in the rocky horror show in london at roughly the time this must have been filming so his drag phase was in full flow and of course tim curry who's eloquent drug land boss is convincing br br simply put if you're a fan of british film you have to see this it matters not a jot if you're into clubbing as the film is strong enough as a story anyway br br highly recommended
<START> certainly the highlight of this film is it's cast br br diana rigg george c scott bernard hughes to mention a few br br i have accumulated more time in hospitals and with doctors over the years than i care to think about br br this comedy attacks the pomp and pretension in all aspects of our society through the setting of one of it's most haughty institutions the medical profession br br the idea that such goings on could be possible might be a shock to some but is a delight to anyone with the perspective of experience br br dr brock scott undergoes a mid life crisis of monumental proportions before our eyes as we and he become enamored with the prospect of his involvement with miss drummond rigg br br the thread of the absurd is woven into this wonderful mix in the form of the irony that the hospital appears to be killing it's own workers as they their affairs in it br br the climax is unpredictable unless you've seen it and made even more hilarious if you happen to guess br br it's not everyone's brand of humor to be sure and has uproariously funny dark moments if you're open to them br br i loved every minute and was delighted to see it out on dvd
<START> well the plot is entertaining but it is full of goof to summarize things up cop dad badly wants to save his son from cancer but the only way is by getting the transplant from the criminal michael keaton br br well criminal agrees but escaped in the hospital while the transplant was going on and the police and the cop dad is not allowed to shoot at the criminal in order to save his son dead criminal no transplant dead son br br well the police in this movie doesn't have a brain in case they never heard of a tazer to knock off the criminal without killing him end of movie as simple as that br br but it when all crazy and stupid including the death of and a few doctor getting burned up pretty badly
<START> i've watched this film a few times and i never really liked it i'm not a fan so termed nu horror so i can't be dismissed on that account i found it a little sleazy i think the thing that irks me about hammers is the sexploitation aspect not sex mind you but sexploitation i'm surprised at how many people have rated this film so highly so i'll have another look at it but for me it wasn't creepy it had no atmosphere just a bit of omigod look at those bad stupid london prostitute women and that little innocent anna about to get raped by yet another nasty man i suppose ultimately for me the film had no depth whatsoever just a bunch of nasty priggish men and women only there for the titillation value this no doubt was to some degree what victorian england was like but the sets are even too clunky and dull impart a sense of victorian menace roger corman's horrors on the other hand now that's style atmosphere and elegant horror for me this was just exploitative flat footed trash
<START> after watching tipping the velvet by sarah waters i decided to watch the characters were just as good in both performances though missing rachael stirling in the adaptation of br br the story line overall was of a good choice the twisting and the of the characters were amazing excellent watch only missing rachael stirling br br if you do enjoy the romance of two girls this isn't one of the best films to watch br br it takes on a different spin from tipping the velvet but just as good br br would recommend it to everyone
<START> i wanted to like this one the situation was rich and the setting unusual and interesting but the story is swamped with childish female gothic romance elements that are hard to swallow the director is unfairly prejudiced against the characters content to let them be grotesque cardboard caricatures and inexplicably indulgent towards the behavior of the heroine the potentially interesting power struggle between the inventor and the governess is not really dealt with br br feminist film makers will get more credibility when they stop manipulating situations to throw all the sympathy to the heroine and start dealing honestly with issues this movie more closely resembles 'the 7 pieces of gold' another earnest failure more than 'the piano' a real tale of passion
<START> this movie has no heart and no soul it's an attempt to up a cult film out of the of other better directors principally david lynch and tim burton rifkin seems to think that if he on a kind of rotted visual style and fills the street with crud and garbage he's making a statement but it's not a statement about anything except the director's shrill shriek of hey look at me i'm an artist too but he doesn't have the imagination of an artist just a good memory for things that worked such as some of the actors trapped in this for other directors all of this would be almost acceptable if this movie was not a turgid boring chore to sit through
<START> not much actually happens in this movie there are a few pivotal moments and everything else is talking about a crucial moment that takes place before the movie began the primary mechanism used in the story is the flashback flashbacks can be used very well but they aren't here there is zero indication when flashing back or forward and there are only weeks separating the events so context as a scene unfolds is the only way to know when something happens perhaps this was intended to add a sense of mystery in places but it was largely annoying br br if you are interested in watching a 100 minute on screen discussion of the why's of things and a lame questioning of good versus evil enjoy if watching close ups of a mostly vacant stare on ryan face for much of the movie appeals to you you're in luck sadly i can find no reason to recommend this movie oh and as another review indicated spacey really is only in a cameo role here and plays with a disinterested detachment that you've probably already seen br br the rest contains spoilers though a few big points are held back br br first the killing of the so called retarded boy happens before the movie opens and we never learn what happened exactly the implication is that he was killed to stop the deep sadness that was communicated through the boy's eyes there aren't many other unanswered questions as the characters beyond the boy and the lead are very one dimensional br br as for what is with the lead character another review suggested he is crazy i agree he isn't 'right' but don't know that i'd call it crazy it seems that the movie tried hard to convey that he was either autistic or retarded in some way because he sure seemed slow and unable to grasp the obvious either that or they were going for a neglected youth with some detachment disorder and or who was heavily medicated as always ryan gosling is good at conveying something to the audience but it seems exactly what was deliberately left up in the air in this case this movie provides no answers just questions but it was a sufficiently bad movie that i really didn't care
<START> i just finished watching today and i'll begin by saying that i found this dvd on the shelves of blockbuster while strolling around looking for something new and good to watch the picture of ali caught my attention br br after drooling over ali i picked up the cover and continued to glance around the cover from the looks of it i thought the costumes were a bit over the top and then i saw the other indians on the cover and figured this was some kind of spoof film or something like that br br when i flipped over the the synopsis part and saw salman khan i did a double take salman khan in an american film with ali in a dvd at blockbuster because salman khan is to bollywood films like mel gibson is to hollywood films i had very high expectations for this film it had to be good i am very pleased to say that is a phenomenal film it far exceeded any and all of my personal expectations br br i suppose a film like this is what happens when you have a decent script a talented experienced knowledgeable and goal oriented director two incredible actors playing the lead roles and just a very hard working supporting cast and crew khan and appear to have really great chemistry together and both shine on the big screen they look really good together the musical numbers weren't bad at all which was surprising considering how cheesy and long indian films' musicals are these days and you'll be happy to know that the indian costumes are very far from being cheesy as you'll get br br the beginning of the film was kind of slow the middle was really good the scenes leading to the climax were pretty dramatic but the ending was just awesome i have a few gripes and complaints about the dvd however while i loved the widescreen aspect ratio of the dvd i didn't like the fact that several other things were left out of the dvd for starters there are no subtitles now english being my first language it's not a problem however when some of the indian actors and actresses spoke it was at times difficult to understand what they were saying captioning would have helped br br another thing that i would have appreciated on the dvd would be a blooper reel or some kind of collection of outtakes and lastly how about a menu feature that would allow us to skip right to the musical numbers man some of those songs were really good on the flip side i throughly enjoyed watching the making of br br i have tons more to say regarding the awesomeness of this film and how much i liked it but i don't have the time nor do i want to keep on writing why i enjoyed it so much i hope that salman khan does more english films in addition to his hindi films and i certainly hope this hindi film will not be ali last bollywood film and i encourage the director to continue making bollywood film hybrids featuring salman khan ali and other big name actors just make sure the scripts are original and good br br 10 10 this is just a great love story film that your entire family can enjoy
<START> i'm not a big fan of musicals although this technically might not qualify as a musical but i thought i would give it a chance as i love war movies it was mediocre at best br br hudson seems totally out of kilter in this role it just didn't work for me julie andrews probably played her part as best as she could but i just find it hard to buy her as a conniving deceptive spy sorry i know that is classic stereotyping on my part but i have to say i think this is julie at her most beautiful and feminine looking i always thought of her as more matronly but then surely that's a result of her roles in sound of music and mary poppins no doubt they were desperately trying to get her out of that typecasting in this role she was quite beguiling in appearance here but i still didn't buy her as a spy br br i couldn't keep my focus through the whole movie and found myself tuning in and out and having conversations with those in my room which i usually never do i'm always everybody so that tells you how little it held my attention don't waste your time
<START> while credited as a tom and jerry cartoon this is not the cat and mouse team but an earlier mutt and jeff rip off featuring them going to africa and disguising themselves in the stereotypical burnt cork makeup to try to blend in while the dialect humor is mostly lame there is a brief musical sequence involving black skeletons that was entertaining i have to ask however how could tom and jerry still have their makeup stay on even after being dumped in the water a couple of times one of many entries produced by the van corporation for distribution by rko radio pictures before rko made a deal with disney only worth seeing if you're an animation buff or is interested in how certain ethnicities were stereotyped as entertainment way back when
<START> this version of the magic flute is not only the worst production of mozart's great opera that i have ever seen it is also the worst video production i have seen of any opera br br i'm a big opera fan and i have more opera on dvd than movies the sets are cheap and cheesy doesn't even have a bird costume he is just dressed like some guy the sound is in mono the color is really bad it is saturated in orange most dvd's from this period have the color digitally restored but they did not bother with this one also the language has been changed to swedish instead of the original german br br this is not a movie version of the magic flute it is a filmed performance and it is not a good performance and it was not filmed very well you can pick any other available dvd of this opera and i guarantee it will be better than this one my preference is for the version conducted by james levine with sets by david
