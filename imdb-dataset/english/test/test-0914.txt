<START> i think this film has to be one of the most moving and heartbreaking films of recent times br br the film basically starts off with a suicide in a school toilet u don't see who it is then from there it goes to the beginning of the day and we get to know 6 characters and they are going through some pretty heavy things anyway eventually one of them will commit suicide br br i've been teaching physical education in schools for 8 years now and never in a film have i seen such an accurate portrayal of what 'really' goes on in school life br br the film is shot beautifully and sounds incredible br br the ending is so shocking and so what one would not expect it is something that will haunt me for days to come br br this is definitely one to watch br br i think the fact that the director writer was in school only a few years ago is a major contributing factor to the raw honesty expressed in the film br br the film is shot in two separate if you will firstly there is the smooth observation style where we get to know the characters in their school environment as they go through their drama but the stunning part of the film is in the interview sections where we get to know the characters back stories and their deepest darkest thoughts br br you keep wondering who is it going to be who commits suicide and as the drama unfolds you keep changing your mind until bam it hits you in the face in the final five minutes i am all over the place in my writing but i've just seen it at a media screening in australia and i am still in a bit of shock br br it's one of the best australian films i have seen in recent years
<START> i saw this with high expectations come on it is akshay kumar govinda and paresh rawal who are all amazing at their comedy i was really hoping for a laugh riot sadly that is not what i got at all br br unfortunately nothing in this movie really made me laugh out loud there were times when i chuckled at one or two things but nothing really made me laugh in short it was badly attempted comedy and in a way a bit of a hera pheri wannabe br br out of the three main guys i think paresh role was the most powerful it wasn't the biggest role but it certainly stood out more than govinda or akshay their performances were okay i guess nothing special just mediocre though govinda stole the limelight from akshay in more than a few scenes lara dutta and tanushree dutta also make appearances in this film and both of them were pretty bad lara's role did not move me or make me laugh and tanushree character just got on my nerves the music seems to be the only good thing about bhagam bhag my favourite song is tere bin followed by which i really liked signal and the title song bhagam bhag are also worth a listen br br you either will like it or you won't and judging by the poor comedy and lack of direction i don't think you will
<START> some films are designed to just entertain you others to make you laugh or cry or uplift others like this aim to provoke to make you think and to make you angry i was angry during this film not at the film but at the fact that it was true that america the free does torture in the illogical view that it is doing it for the greater good the torture scenes in this movie were harrowing the indifference of people was shattering the film was compelling in its argument and showed just how wrong it is to torture people of course now that makes me a bleeding liberal labels shoved on people by others who shut their minds to the facts that this does happen and should not people who don't realise that as the movie said for every person tortured you get ten or one hundred people rise up to perform acts of vengeance you get an ever increasing cycle of violence this film did not make me hate america although i can see how it could do but it made me hate the way that america has reacted in its post 9 11 world there is a significant quote in the film just after we have learned that 19 people have died and seventy five were injured in the bomb scene the quote is one american is dead that makes the difference you cannot kill an american america can kill thousands but you cannot kill a single american or they will do whatever it takes including torture to enact justice this is the american way apparently call me a liberal call me naive although i think the people who think torture is fine are naive call me deluded call me anything you like but this film is a brilliant example of what is wrong in america and the west today i wish this film would be shown to all school students at a minimum this film will stay with me a long time part of me wishes i could forget it because i wish this type of thing never happened but i know it does the other part of me wishes i would never forget because we need to remember these shameful events to prevent them from happening again whatever happens to me this film will be with me for a long time and i will be telling everyone i know to watch it not to be entertained but to be provoked because sometimes we all need to be provoked
<START> i agree with one commentator who says that it's really impossible to review glen or glenda objectively if one does so the film on its merits would have to be rated as fairly terrible given the hilarious convoluted dialog the generally mediocre to poor acting by the cast as well as the zero production values yet such an assessment does not capture the absolutely riveting experience of watching this film as it unfolds it isn't the fact that the subject of the film is transvestitism and that it was a controversial lifestyle choice in the 1950s it's not even the plea for tolerance of people who embrace alternate life choices that fascinates except as an historic relic br br no what makes glen or glenda still a fascinating film after 50 years is that ed wood laid his psyche bare in a way that so called auteur directors like hitchcock or godard despite their vastly superior talents never did in glen or glenda wood isn't afraid to reveal his own deeply conflicted feelings about being a transvestite despite the plea for tolerance for it through out the film indeed the conclusion of the film suggest that ed wood's glen character will be able to kill his glenda female counterpart by transferring the feelings of love and affection glen has for his feminine counterpart to his future wife barbara the psychiatrist even reassures glen and barbara that as glen makes that psychic transference glenda will disappear so while wood could plead for tolerance of transvestites in general he wasn't so sure of desiring it for himself br br moreover wood wasn't afraid of throwing everything else that crossed his mind on the screen he did it with whatever stock footage he could get his hands on if it didn't cohere so what what the viewer saw in glen or glenda especially was ed wood's imaginative world in all of its fundamental strangeness br br the only comment i wish to add to my comment above is that my two star rating is based solely on the objective evaluation criteria cited in the first paragraph the oddly effect the film has despite its technically atrocious qualities i don't think can be rated
<START> contains spoiler information watch this director's other film earth at some point it's a better film but this one isn't bad just different br br a rare feminist point of view from an indian filmmaker tradition rituals duty secrets and the portrayal of strict sex roles make this an engaging and culturally dynamic film viewing experience all of the married characters lack the fire of the marriage bed with their respective spouses one husband is celibate and commits a form of spiritual adultery by giving all of his love honor time and respect to his religious swami guru his wife is lonely and yearns for intimacy and tenderness which she eventually finds with her closeted lesbian sister in law who comes to live in their house with her unfaithful husband this unfaithful husband is openly in love with his chinese mistress but was forced into marriage with a unbeknownest to him lesbian they only have sex once when his closet lesbian wife loses her virginity br br a servant lives in the house and he eventually reveals the secret that the two women are lovers another significant character is the elderly matriarch who is unable to speak or care for herself due to a stroke however she uses a ringing bell to communicate her needs as well as her displeasure with the family members she lets them know through her bell or by pounding her fist that she knows what's going on in the house and how much she disapproves br br in the end the truth about everybody comes out and the two female lovers end up running away together but not before there is an emotional scene between the swami addicted husband and his formerly straight wife her sari catches on fire and at first we think she is going to die however we see the two women united in the very last scene of the movie br br the writer director of this film challenges her culture's traditions but she shows us individual human beings who are trapped by their culture and gender we come to really care about the characters and we don't see them as stereotypes each on surprises us with their humanity vulgarity tenderness anger and spirit
<START> beautifully filmed mind expanding exploration of gypsy culture in the context of their music travel across a continent experiencing the amazing musical styles of various groups of gypsy peoples it is sort of misleading to say this movie is not narrated it is masterfully narrated by the music itself the soaring melodies and lyrics tell a story much better than a narrator would have see this film
<START> i kid you not yes who's that girl has the distinction for being one in a string of madonna's films that bombed but i actually liked this movie more than desperately seeking susan in susan madonna's character is relegated to being second fiddle to rosanna arquette and is not given much to work with no disrespect to rosanna but in madonna plays this zany outrageous character only done in an 80s style while it may seem cheesy today this is actually one of madonna's best and one of her most underrated films br br madonna plays nikki finn an ex con who is sent to the slammer for a crime she didn't commit she's being released from jail after four years of good behavior griffin dunne who is also a very underrated actor plays a lawyer who has the unpleasant task of picking her up from jail to take her to the bus station of course when these two get together that's when the madness happens sir john mills has a small role as the rich businessman who has a huge mansion in the middle of manhattan with a rainforest on his roof br br this movie parodies everything rich people the sleazy characters who live in harlem and totally destroy rolls royce the gay cops who follow madonna and dunne around town and dunne's stuck up fiance wendy who has purportedly slept with every cab driver in new york city played by haviland morris who was jake's girlfriend caroline in sixteen candles hilarious plus dunne is also in charge of a rare breed of leopard reminiscent of bringing up baby plus madonna had a great platinum blonde 80s look back in those days and the movie has a great soundtrack throw this all into the mix and you have the zaniness of br br madonna is the queen of deadpan acting there are times in the movie where she says a line totally straight and surprisingly it turns out to be funny that's how some of the best comedy should be played straight madonna should have done more comedy and it was a shame that she did not choose to do so later on she became much more controversial and got into more of the dark sexually charged roles in the notorious movies body of evidence and dangerous game br br some people say madonna cannot act and that is fine people are entitled to their opinion but i believe the real problem is that people cannot see the difference between madonna playing a character on film instead they still see only madonna and that is main reason why she is given more respect for her music than for her movies it's still a fun screwball comedy of the 80s not for everyone i'm sure some of you will dislike it so i would recommend it mainly for madonna fans but you never know you might be surprised and like it br br interesting note one of madonna's friends from her early 80s new york club days mundi who plays raoul was a member in the bands kid creole and the and savannah band
<START> i just attended a preview screening of this film a masterpiece of documentary film making it was not totally absorbed with its subject the film becomes incapable of leveling any sort of critical commentary with regard to ms faye cloying and sappy the only redeeming quality of the film was its use of puppets in an attempt albeit a failed one to structure some kind of narrative but the creepiest experience occurred as the closing credits rolled the audience rose and applauded like moths to flame americans in the 21st century are still drawn to the narrative of the misunderstood monster is getting rather tired
<START> it is a shame that the gershwin family and goldwyn estate has pulled this great movie from the viewing thereby depriving the public from seeing some of the most wonderful actors and performances ever packed into one motion picture br br it is also true that the singing voices for sidney poitier and dorothy dandridge were dubbed for this movie and that is used as one of the reasons that the gershwin's do not want this movie ever released again br br for in spite the flaws in the movie and the creative differences between the gershwins and the this film has some of the most remarkable performances ever committed to the screen sammy davis jr and pearl bailey are especially deserving praise br br this film was the great independent producer samuel swan song it was also ironically the gershwin's greatest shame br br finally it is a loss to the wonderful black actors who appeared in it for we can no longer see them at their best
<START> i liked this movie many people refer to it as sabrina the teenage feminist they do that with a lot of movies that melissa joan hart is in still she really surprised me in this movie because she was great in the part of mary who fights for justice when her roommate is raped you could tell that hart was extremely determined in this movie and it showed i also liked lisa dean ryan as mary's roommate she was very effective in making me feel sorry for her character after she was raped josh hopkins was good as the cocky and egotistical rapist lochlyn munro convincingly played his character the acting in this movie is better than in most tv movies in my opinion br br the movie was pretty predictable though also i expected more from the ending it was too abrupt the delivery could have been better but the performances and overall plot make up for these problems
<START> i found the story to be just enough of a thriller that the wonderful henry music didn't lull me julie andrews was and i sure don't understand why this movie had problems at the box office when it came out because it just makes me happy at the end to have everybody singing and i do like happy ever after endings which i think you can say this movie has along with some traditional blake edwards humor
<START> the only way to truly understand and relate to the characters in this movie is to have experienced the situations your self to a lot of people this movie is almost mock biographical a sort of snapshot of one weekend in our lives i have done about 85 percent of the things in this movie and witnessed the other 15 percent usually all in the same weekend for me and others i know it is nice to have this movie to look back on because other than a few pictures of people we sort of remember and nights that are patches and blurs this movie is our generations studio 54 a piece to add to our scrap books to look back on and smile personally i'm glad those days are past but it is great to watch this movie and say i remember when thank you justin for making this mock biography of one weekend in my life
<START> this is probably the funniest thing i have ever seen from start to finish it was perfect in timing atmosphere punch lines background music fighting sequences and every other possible aspect you can think of to be absolutely honest i find this movie as funny as their sitcom bottom maybe even funnier i laughed constantly throughout the whole movie and can only recommend seeing this film however if you watch it without knowing or liking the type of comedy and has done before you might not think it's funny at all but i really can't understand those who dislike it this is humour folks people getting hit with frying pans guys running around wearing red rubber lingerie green vomit filling the hallways guys getting kicked in the b s and getting candlesticks in the eyes how can this not be funny 10 10
<START> okay i'll say it this movie made me laugh so hard that it hurt this statement may offend some of you who may think that this movie is nothing more than a waste of film but the thing that most people don't get is that this movie was intended to be bad and cheezy i mean did people actually think that a movie about a killer snowman was intended to be a masterpiece just look at the scary hologram on the jacket of the movie and you'll find your answer instead like the original jack frost which i thought was just as funny this movie turned out to be a side splitting journey into the depths of corny dialogue bad one liners and horrible special effects and it's all made to deliver laughter to us viewers it certainly worked for me br br for example anne to her troubled husband what makes you frown so heavily darling br br if that chunk of dialogue doesn't make you laugh then you have serious issues who in their right mind would utter those words in real life of course no one because it was meant to sound ridiculous just take one viewing of this movie with an open mind and low expectations and hopefully you'll see what's so damn funny about jack frost 2
