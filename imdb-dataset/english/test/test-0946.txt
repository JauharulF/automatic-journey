<START> this is a great horror movie great plot and a person with a fear of midgets will definately love the evil midget this is a must see for any horror fan finally a lower budget movie with decent effects and a great cast highly recommended
<START> an egotistic major league baseball player is forced to continue his career in japan he contends with a culture that is alien to him an apparently humorless manager an attractive japanese woman and his own professional and social insecurities there is a certain subtle charm that flows through tom performances there is humor sometimes softly understated as in this film sometimes slapstick as in folks but always there seems to be some higher purpose involved throw in an individual full of self doubts who struggles to solve his personal difficulties while holding fast to doing the right thing and you end up with a film both funny as well as thought provoking the cast fits together like a championship team and even if neither cast nor film win awards for their efforts they will leave the viewers feeling good and maybe that's the best results after all you'll want to watch this film more than once and each time mr baseball hits a home run
<START> i have to say this is the worst movie that i have ever watched in my life i cannot believe that i wasted 10 at blockbuster this movie should be burned and who ever thought of it has issues who ever actually spent money to make this movie was insane d this movie has terrible actors and some of the scenes make absolutely no sense well the whole movie doesn't make sense also the part where those men come into the diner department of national securities that happened to be the worst part of the film how dare they say frank sinatra's name in vain also what is up with those glasses when the guy and girl are in the car and she drinks water you can totally tell that she isn't even drinking also what is up with the freaky dinner guy and everyone knows that you don't stab tires you slash them
<START> facts i mar relates the well known at least in spain story of ramÃ³n a who killed himself helped by some friends after 28 years by his condition judges had denied several times his of active euthanasia br br facts ii mar becomes the movie of the year in spain everyone talks about it politicians singers ordinary people everyone likes it even the critics' opinions are unanimous the film wins a lot of prizes golden globe oscar goya and annoys catholic community and life lovers a star is born br br facts iii the intensity and the quality of the actors in mar are just amazing and this makes mi wonder how come we have to watch the same bad young actors in the most of spanish latest movies i don't know if javier bardem is a great actor or a great imitator there's quite a difference between one thing or the other anyway his job is just impressive as well as lola belÃ©n or the job of all the guest this is the actors selection the strong point in movie br br facts iv alejandro amenÃ¡bar learned his lesson there at the cinema school there's no doubt about it he's got a privileged brain he takes good control of each and every one of the technical aspects he knows what the audiences want he knows how to touch the right chord even if that turns him into such a demagogue just like spielberg is one of idols br br facts and v if you criticize a movie such as mar it will seem like you have any kind of trouble with the moral issue the story tells about there's a trap in this kind of pictures you have to differentiate between the movie itself and the moral concepts if you don't like schindler's list that does not mean that you agree with hitler's philosophy or do you so for me it is a good film and an extraordinary story since it is a real story that makes it much more extraordinary self kind and everything but neutral no matter what amenÃ¡bar or bardem have said about it those characters that are not in favor of euthanasia come to no good at all 50 hard 50 way too sentimental br br epilogue mar wouldn't be by no mean in my ranking of the best 50's spanish movies of all time nobody has special merits in the story but ramon himself he is the movie now alejandro amenÃ¡bar is gonna become the more international spanish director ever maybe he'll go to live to hollywood but some of us would like to watch him filming a simple story without bit final twists without living dead nor dying alive the others is still his best movie br br my rate 7 10
<START> gamera vs was made lazily and much of it suffers as a result br br space aliens try to take over earth and are stopped by gamera so they send another ship that manages to kidnap two young boys the aliens then take control of gamera and get him to attack mankind br br first of all i must say that i really enjoyed the monster fight at the end between gamera and looks like a big squid with a beak he has no energy and does not shoot any rays out but he can close the on top of his head to make a sharp pointy so overall this is not a bad monster for gamera to fight and is decent really injures gamera badly by stabbing his underside of his shell with his pointy head and i am surprised gamera was able to survive this br br unfortunately gamera vs decided to use footage from previous gamera films to fill time for this film they re show the battles between gamera and and gamera and when the aliens look at past battles however when they show gamera's battles with they show the battle between gamera and in the city first then they show the final battle between the two after they show re used footage of the final battle between gamera and they show the first battle between gamera and talk about showing the battles in non chronological order they did not even need to show the first battle they should have just stopped after they showed the final battle between the two br br another issue is that they decide to re show footage of gamera attacking cities when the aliens order him to attack tokyo so they show the scene from gamera vs where he destroys the dam after the show scenes from gamera the invincible which is a huge issue for me mainly due to the fact that gamera the invincible was in black and white using stock footage from a black and white film in a color film is really lazy and that is not a good thing br br also the dubbing is bad once again the two little kids are not that annoying but it would be nice to see a gamera film that did not involve little kids br br so the over use of footage from other gamera films is a to this film the final fight is awesome so basically i recommend skipping to the final ten minutes and watching this film the rest is something that has already been seen before
<START> a quick funny coming of age matinÃ©e romp appealing to the underdog in us all it functions in effect as a vehicle for justin long who has subsequently erupted onto our screens in the fourth die hard via pc vs mac ads dodgeball and the break up he's funny earnest and young a big career ahead br br a town's worth of college wannabes find a fake website long has set up to delude his judgemental parents and descend on the like it were a short notice facebook party lewis black the anarchic philosophy as a stand in dean long's delinquent friends provide support for the subterfuge and consequent appeal to grander traditions of education and friendship adam deserves special mention for his never flagging slapstick contribution well executed feelgood and instantly forgettable 4 10
<START> at the story it is reality mixed with americana and very original br br emily grace is a young girl tired of her boring life working at a minimum wage job in new england her sleazy boss propositions her she quits and takes a little bit of cash from the register driving from new hampshire to miami florida is not a short trip and her ford escort dies out she then meets a personable older couple portrayed by judith and bill raymond they have an rv and graciously offer to help her out it isn't safe for a girl to be alone on the road especially i 95 br br emily grace is very realistic as alice and initially lets the judith character help her buy her decent clothes cosmetics etc at first it is a nice vacation for alice who hopes to hook up with her girlfriend who attends college in miami there is interesting cinematography as the trio drives the rv down to florida the rest stops bland scenery and eventually beautiful mountains of north carolina br br eventually there is something awry and the character apparently has fabricated stories about her daughter as well as her husband who now seems a bit sinister br br i will not spoil the outcome of this film but it ends positively as the audience waits in suspense this film reminded me a bit of spielberg's duel while it was initially not as menacing the moral of the story is you never know what people are thinking especially if you are driving cross country beware you will enjoy this film
<START> though a fan of shock and gore i found this movie disappointing to say the very least the effects and puppet work were impressive yes and the humor was well timed but something was missing see the first act of the film is spent establishing nuances of jack brooks' character despite the fact that everything we need to know about his aggression is delivered within minutes of the first title cards as for the narration and many of the flashbacks needless br br the pacing during the second act was tedious most of it is focused on freddy krueger eating then vomiting then eating some more then flailing his arms and saying something snappy or rude all the while the schlock is punctuated with brief scenes of jack discussing his rage problems with a therapist definitely the entertaining scenes in the film excellent dialog worth plenty of laughs then without warning jack decides to kill a few monsters and then it's over br br all in all as a throwback to 1980s horror movies jack brooks monster slayer has loads of potential but is purposeless and plods on without conflict or adequate resolution br br hopefully these issues will be addressed before jack brooks vii jack goes to hell or jack vs ash go into production
<START> this film is so wonderful it captures the gaming life i laughed so hard while watching this the movie is about a gaming group that have a hard time with a campaign that their dungeon master came up with the movie switches from the real world and the gaming world as they play the campaign it shows them in the gaming world as their character and then switches back to the real world when they are not playing the campaign is the basis for a module that the dungeon master lodge is writing the problem is lodge can't finish his module because the characters can't finish the campaign they are more for killing and looting instead of role playing lodge wants them to role play through the campaign something they have never done before they decide to bring in some extra help so they bring a wait for it girl in to play lodge also makes a a non player character a who can not witness or do wrong to play the film is how they do all this and more i don't want to spoil any of the film so i won't say any more this movie may not be a big budget film the acting may not be oscar worthy but if you are into gaming or into dungeons and dragons then definitely watch it they had a lot of fun making this film and it shows i am not going to bash on it for any movie problems such as continuity or any thing it was a low budget film that is just fun there is some slap stick comedy which i enjoy and some damn good writing in my opinion so if you want a fun film try it
<START> the great yul brynner who won an and who has starred blockbusters such as 'the ten among lots of others ended his remarkable career with cheap backlot movies such as this one and such indeed one should take pity on seeing him making his very best to make this idiotic thing stand gone were the days when he was surrounded by steve mcqueen james coburn charles bronson eli wallach in 'the magnificent and walked around under the famous elmer bernstein soundtrack it's difficult to make a living out of being an actor sometimes
<START> spoilers within what a dull predictable non scary snore fest the movie had no character development i felt no empathy towards any of the characters except may be the small boy and did not care what happened to any of them the movie had so many clichÃ©d bits or elements stolen from other horror movies br br the movie was so predictable many times i would be saying to myself let me guess fill in guess happens next yup i was right even in the opening scene i predicted that the attack on the family was by some man probably the father because only the wife and children were attacked sure enough that is what happened of course you have to wait 79 minutes to find out for sure and of course another evil man scenario why was he evil and killing his family because he's a man duh br br as someone else stated this movie may be scary for someone under 13 years of age or for a movie from the 1970's but it is far from being a 'scary' movie by todays standards and like so many other crap horror movies a lot of the scares were fakes scary music scary music scary music and a crow suddenly flies at the window wow scary br br how did the old bank guy manage a few times to walk across an open lot without the father seeing him i thought for sure that the old man was a ghost nope just a crappy movie br br i rated this movie a 2 out of 10 because it did keep my attention enough to sit through the whole thing
<START> when i first saw this film it was about 1956 and even though i saw it again recently i have not changed my mind about it i think it was robert best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real life my father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt my mother and brother had to do this when i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed
<START> isabelle huppert is a wonderful actor the director of la pianiste understands this providing the viewer with long takes of huppert's face and these are a pleasure to see huppert is not an animated actor she registers emotion with the smallest lift of an eyebrow or flicker of a smile br br other than the enjoyment of watching an experienced actor excel in her profession there is nothing in this movie that makes me want to recommend it well if you enjoy self mutilation sado masochism and bizarre behavior la pianiste might work for you other than these attributes i could not find any redeeming value in it br br buried in all this strange material there is a kernel of truth people who compete at the very highest level musically athletically whatever begin as strange people and are shaped into stranger people by the competitive environment br br not worth a trip to a movie theater to relearn this life lesson br br
<START> time line of the film laugh laugh laugh smirk smirk yawn look at watch walk out remember funny parts at the beginning smirk br br unfortunately this movie has a good concept that it grinds to the ground
<START> before i begin let me get something off my chest i'm a huge fan of john first film project the film a b grade cross of both the terminator die hard may not be the work of a cinematic genius but is a hugely entertaining action film that became a cult hit spawned two sequels a spin off br br judge and jury begins with joseph meeker a convicted killer who was sent to death row following his capture after the so called bloody shootout which seems like a poor name for a killing spree Â meeker kills three people while trying to rob a convenience store being led to the electric chair there is an amusing scene where meeker talks to the priest about living for sex but meeting his one true love who was killed during the shootout expressing his revenge for the person who killed her Â michael silvano a washed up football star who spends his days watching his son alex practicing football with his high school team and ends up harassing his son's coach but once executed meeker returns as a or as kelly calls a hamburger without the fries whose sole aim is to get his revenge which basically means making life a misery br br let me point out the fact that judge and jury is not a true horror film it is a supernatural action film with meeker chasing silvano using his ability to change form which amounts to david keith dressing up as everything from an elvis impersonator a french chef with an accent as bad as his moustache a drag queen a clown a stand up comedian a shotgun which fires explosive rounds an invulnerability to death although that doesn't stop martin kove from shooting keith with a desert eagle to pay silvano back for killing meeker's wife br br director john does not seem interested in characterisations instead focusing solely on action scenes which the film has plenty of but that is the film's main flaw since there's nothing to connect the action scenes together the acting is surprisingly good with keith delivering the best performance supported ably by kove as well as paul koslo who plays the washed up cop quite well kelly is annoying as the cabbie who tries to help but makes the situation worse
