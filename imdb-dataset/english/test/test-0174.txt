<START> i can't believe i rarely ever see this title mentioned by all you eighties horror freaks and i definitely won't be joining all my fellow reviewers here in saying that 'bloody is awful viewing on the contrary i enjoyed it very much and i was pleasantly surprised by the and surprise twists it offers don't just refer to this film as being 'another 80's slasher' because the victims here are rather unlikely and so are the killers we're introduced to three cherubic looking youngsters who were all born during a solar eclipse at the moment they were delivered planet saturn was blocked by both the sun and the moon and due to this the kids are emotionless and seemly without conscience this really starts to show around their tenth birthday as they go on a merciless killing spree br br granted this stuff is incredibility far fetched and even slightly offensive but seriously who cares unlike many other horror films from this period it at least attempts to bring something original and imaginative for once the kids' acting is good and the entire film has a creepy atmosphere and grizzly music the murders sequences are grim and tense and it's always eerie to see them getting committed by angel faced kids i don't know who hired the 3 kids but they did a good job especially the girl and the kid with glasses are highly memorable the bleak images of the heartless trio remind you of classic highlights such as of the damned' 'the bad and of the damned' this film is nowhere near as memorable as these milestones but great fun and not one horror lover will regret watching this br br bloody birthday was written and directed by ed hunt not particularly the greatest genius in cinema but a pleasantly deranged fella who also brought us immensely entertaining cheesefests like 'the brain' and 'starship if all this isn't enough to convince you yet bloody birthday has a lot of nudity and not just any nudity but a topless dance act by mtv vj julie brown oh and keep your eyes open for a completely redundant cameo by joe penny later the star of tv series 'jake and the check it out
<START> to start off i didn't bother seeing the grudge the previews for that movie didn't make me jump didn't scare me and didn't entertain me but when a group of friends asked me to go see the grudge 2 i accepted the invite a little curious as to how this movie would be i mainly went because of my friends not even 5 minutes into this movie i realized i threw away 7 50 the acting from the get go is horrible the schoolgirls in the beginning look as if they have never acted in their entire lives then the movie plot takes over let me tell you i could not stop laughing this entire movie it is just so stupid i'm pretty sure they tried to not make it scary they don't make anything jump out or anything it shows the kids then shows them attacking it builds up to it it's not an all of a sudden thing and even in the middle of the movie the core of the movie the acting is still horrible it leaves so much time in between the dialog for someone to add in their own comments this movie is honestly one of the funniest horror movies i have ever seen poorly written horrible acting horrible script horrible unable to act cast and a horrible concept the movie blacks out and changes situations more times than you can count each part eventually plays out and then ties up at the end of the movie i would never again pay to see this movie i wouldn't even watch it on cable for free this movie is a joke please do not waste your money on this movie
<START> it actually pains me to say it but this movie was horrible on every level the blame does not lie entirely with van damme as you can see he tried his best but let's face it he's almost fifty how much more can you ask of him i find it so hard to believe that the same people who put together undisputed 2 arguably the best western martial arts movie in years created this everything from the plot to the dialog to the editing to the overall acting was just horribly put together and in many cases outright boring and nonsensical scott adkins who's fight scenes seemed more like a demo reel was also terribly underused and not even the main villain which is such a shame because 1 he is more than capable of playing that role and 2 the actual main villain was not only not intimidating at all but also quite annoying again not blaming van damme i will always be a fan but avoid this one
<START> two things are always signs that you re going to be watching a bad movie br br 1 if you re instantly reminded of other movies like the terminator hardware or blade runner during the title sequence br br 2 if there s a death during a sex scene straight after the title sequence br br there s actually a third warning sign and that s a caption indicating lazy exposition warning the poor ignorant naive audience of the dangers of corporate greed guess what cyborg 2 starts with a caption warning us of corporate greed in the future followed by a title sequence that reminded me of the terminator hardware and blade runner followed by a death during a sex scene hey you don t suppose i ll be watching a bad movie by any chance br br as you can guess this is a bad movie it s basically a series of action scenes written around a thread bare plot of a cyborg on the run from a greedy corporate company it s badly written directed and acted and most especially it s badly lit which means it s very difficult to see what s happening on screen though i m not entirely sure this is actually a bad thing the only interest to be had is that it s the film debut of angelina jolie who plays the cyborg on the run and who says the prophetic line they re lovely i wonder if they re real which is something i ask myself whenever i see one of her movies
<START> this is an engrossing woman's drama that men can enjoy the plot follows a young woman hope lange who goes to work for a publisher after college we can forgive her jump in position from secretary to editor hey it's hollywood and a few other flaws here is one of the few films in which once big time producer robert evans here beautifully depicting a rat with women appears it also features a mature joan crawford and terrific supporting cast check it out
<START> the weakest of the 'old' crew star trek films this film suffers from an awful script and obvious budget constraints particularly in the mishandled finale the bones of a good movie are here and the directing from shatner is not as bad as is commonly made out but the characters end up speaking and acting way out of the style that the previous 3 films had carefully established lawrence is convincing as the renegade vulcan with and mystical powers to influence people and these powers are responsible for some of the best scenes particularly for deforest kelley who shines as mccoy in this his second last movie however as good as those scenes are they ultimately do not advance the plot and end up feeling as more of a distraction a great score from the ever reliable goldsmith and some funny scenes in yosemite between the main three are not enough to cover the gaping chasms in the plot and the frankly embarassing attempts at humour serve only to alienate even die hard trekkies all in all a wealth of possibilities which although it fails to deliver has its moments watch out for the pool table in the bar brawl scene
<START> if like me you enjoyed the first film bruce almighty my advice to you is not to get your hopes up too high in fact disregard any hope you possess for this movie if you are above the age of 12 and have any film sense at all br br without giving too much away the story sees evan bruce's nemesis co anchor from the first film move home with his family to the suburbs to change the world with a new political path what follows is a rather far fetched and quite storyline which is obviously set out to target young children as the main target audience unlike it's predecessor evan almighty is a family orientated film with the ambiguous genre of 'comedy' tagged upon it's misleading position of 'sequel' to which some would regard a modern day comedy classic that can be enjoyed by a slightly more mature upscale audience br br generally speaking evan almighty comprises itself of terrible cinematic values the acting omit steve carell and morgan freeman was rigid and many of the characters were seemingly thrown in to use up the unnecessarily large budget issued for the production additionally the cast includes acting legend john goodman who makes an appearance as a heel and is seen just a few times in the movie's entirety i didn't quite buy the character though and thought the storyline from which he was involved in lacked depth even for a family comedy every other character in the movie especially the wife and kids deserve a mention for their acting so cheesy it could fill a king size be warned though it is the typical americanized associated with many mainstream family orientated films so i'd advise you defend yourself with the nearest grater in sight br br it may seem the movie is worthless thus far however it does have some promising aspects the cgi was outstanding and it was clear that a lot of time went into modelling the ark and producing water effects and animation of the computer generated animals towards the end the particles renders and textures used were aesthetically stellar although part of me couldn't help but think these were undeserving to a movie with such poor ideals and were in my opinion 'too good' for this piece of cinema and carried the movie throughout br br overall i view this film as a disaster in terms of continuing what was a franchise with huge potential but unfortunately it fell short to a bad conclusion in the almighty series and approaching the end of the film i had set my expectations high for an epic and somehow meaningful finale to make up for the mediocre content i had so far witnessed this wasn't the case and i was deeply disappointed and confused come the closing credits as i sat discontent i couldn't help but think the movie wasn't anywhere near as as i hoped for in many ways the film reminded me of a watered down night at the museum as it showed similar styling and characteristics but unfortunately was leagues below even that br br i give this movie 3 out of 10 as it is watchable but it's definitely one to be avoided if you have to see this film be prepared for disappointment as is the best you could hope to obtain in watching the said production
<START> first the positives an excellent job at depicting urban landscapes to suit the mood of the film some of the shots could be paintings by de sophie beautiful br br the negatives the stories are hard to believe unreal uni dimensional characters preen and posture 100 of the time as if they were in some kind of catwalk this is neither the antonioni of his earlier much better movies nor the wenders we've all come to know and appreciate malkovich is excess baggage in this movie
<START> this film is terribly bad kevin spacey is a really great actor he shines in la confidential american beauty usual suspects 7 etc but this is truly rubbish he came nowhere near a decent irish accent maybe he should have practiced it with kate hudson while she was doing about adam to irish people this film is laughable and even worse its quite irritating for several scenes i think the producers made this film hoping the target audience non europe would had never seen or heard of the 'general' or martin cahill and be enthralled in an intriguing and entertaining story total crud
<START> the film itself is absolutely brilliant its that buzz that rush that makes you just want to go out blow your wages and loose yourself it's what the weekend is all about its our sanitation where we can come together as one and be ourselves without a care in the world the film is layered in depth and the dialogue in places is just spot on especially with jip the characters themselves are instantly likable one in particular is obviously character and his views on what star wars is really about genius br br if ever you've got an hour to kill before going out stick on this you'll immediately feel yourself growing in confidence definitely recommend it
<START> on their way to a country house to hear a new play being read a theatrical producer his secretary and the playwright end up stuck in the mud they make their way to a nearby house only to end up at the home of the playwright's fiance if you can't guess that murder and mayhem are about to take place then you haven't been paying attention br br this is a a good entry in the old dark house genre not only does it have a good mystery you also have some very funny one liners wandering through it the cast is across the board excellent and they're more than willing to have a good time with what is good material br br i would love to say that this is one of the best of the genre it should have been but for me something happened on the way that made me down grade the rating to only seven out of ten i can't tell you what it is not for certain anyway perhaps its the sense that i knew where it was going almost from the outset or perhaps its something else i'm not sure what but there was something that i couldn't shake that made me like this film despite wanting to love it it just missed being great and somehow fell short br br that said i do suggest you see it it is after all a very witty film that entertains fully despite just missing being great
<START> apart from the fact that this film was made i suppose it seemed a good idea at the time considering bottom was so popular the one thing that puzzled me about guest house paradiso was what happened to the lighting there is absolutely no artificial lighting used in this film whatsoever and i watched it on network tv so it wasn t a case of watching a dodgy tape in fact the film was shot so darkly it was impossible to see what the hell was going on but if the dialogue was anything to go by that s maybe not a bad thing
<START> there were nice characters in here played by pleasant looking actors and actresses plus it had a famous band and some famous dancers yet the film just didn't work by the time this was almost over i was bored to death the dialog was dumb the humor mainly milton was downright stupid and the music was just not up my alley br br i've never been a big band fan anyway and if i hear in the mood one more time i'll puke br br this was my first look at famous skater actor sonja henie and i have no complaints about her almost part of the problem at least with the humor is that it's so dated it isn't funny anymore berle phil silvers bob hope red skeleton abbot costello etc etc were hilarious to the crowds in the 40s and 50s but humor changes and what was funny back then is not today
<START> a very sweet movie about a young chinese man enamored of western technology and an englishman trying to make his fortune showing movies in china it's a very interesting story that is presumably based on true events although i'm assuming it's more fantasy than real it's got a fairy tale quality you rarely get in real life and it's also got 8 people credited for the script so they must have been making up stuff right and left br br this is a very likable movie that conveys how magical film was to people who had never seen it before it is not an especially deep movie touching briefly on the loss of tradition and the encroachment of western culture but mainly just being a pleasant little movie it's actually a movie i enjoyed very much that is already beginning to disappear from my mind 15 minutes after seeing it light as a soufflÃ© but i enjoyed every minute
<START> that's what me and my friends kept asking each other throughout this entire flick we couldn't believe how stupid it was i think somebody shot this on their camcorder at home and snuck it into the movie store and put it on the shelf as a joke to see if anybody would ever pick it up well i guess the joke is on us br br i guess i should have come to this website first and read all of the reviews it has gotten every single one says this movie is horrible stupid and on and on and boy are they right although it did provide some pretty good laughs me and my friends were pretty drunk because it is so stupid we just can't believe somebody was dumb enough to make such a crappy movie i swear this had to be made in the 70's before they had good technology for movies and stuff because every scene looks really crappy but when i looked on here it said it was made in 2001 what it sure doesn't look like a movie that would be made today but i guess that's what you get when you use a camcorder and shoot home movies using strobe lights and really fake looking lasers and use real life people from your home town instead of actors or even aspiring actors btw some of those chicks or were they drag queens we couldn't tell were so fugly even my drunk horny college buddies wouldn't touch them with a 50 foot pole br br so there's absolutely no appeal to this movie at all bad acting bad writing bad directing bad special effects bad bad bad don't waste your time or money on this one you'll be completely disappointed
