<START> carla literally melts the screen in this crime caper her sex appeal ample assets and sexy southern accent more than make this film but the film has so many other things to make it almost a modern classic simon baker's performance for one thing truly that of a great actor til schweiger is so perfectly cast it makes me wonder why he's not a huge crossover star gil bellows rounds out this crew and literally steals this show other cleavage easily the best performance in the movie emma thompson and alan rickman are so utterly brilliant i cannot even describe it great chemistry br br the music is so powerfully eclectic that it was a character in and of itself wonderous to behold br br people may say it's tarantino influenced i disagree it's clearly unique and clever in it's own right sebastian does a wonderful job at directing this tightly woven film and underplaying a lot of scenes that left me reeling the ending is perfectly sinister and you never see it coming all in all a lovely film that to me is the very definition of what a good movie should be
<START> rock star 2001 out of four br br by blake french br br rock star is the story of a nobody who becomes propelled into fame only to realize living his dream is not the way he imagined it we have seen all this before in better movies but this human story does capture the world of rock and roll with a brutally honest and insightful edge it garners a recommendation because of its visualization of the atmosphere the script by crazy beautiful director john stockwell portrays the hard core universe with memorable images it doesn't explain what it is about it shows us br br rock star originally titled metal god stars mark wahlberg as chris izzy cole a pittsburgh office supplies salesperson who dreams of becoming bobby beers the fiery lead singer for the heavy metal rock group steel dragon although chris already sings for his own tribute rock group called blood pollution instead of writing his own songs he insists on performing only those by steel dragon and only in the exact way they perform them his group becomes irritated with chris' obsessions and gives him the boot br br this devastates chris as well as his supportive parents and faithful girlfriend emily jennifer aniston from tv's friends he then receives a phone call it's the steel dragon band they have seen chris' tapes and want him to replace the recently fired lead singer in an instant chris rockets into the dizzying world of sudden stardom from the biggest rock fan to the biggest rock star unfortunately it's not as rewarding as he expected br br a true story inspired the rock star concept an ohio supply salesman tim ripper owens really did replace rob the lead singer in judas priest after initially singing for a tribute band the rest of the film is probably fiction although most of what happens must represent the experiences of many other bands the film details the various ordeals of being a rock star it explores the aspects of touring personality differences the danger of drug abuse and violence struggling relationships sexual freedom dishonesty and the extreme measures of the producers all to please the fans and keep popularity high br br i have seen all of mark wahlberg's movies and this is the first that has earned my affection wahlberg a former singer model has made movies like fear boogie nights three kings and most recently tim burton's lacking remake planet of the apes i am starting to admire the young actor more and more although he has not performed in many successful films he has taken many chances and done a variety of roles rock star is his best film to date i can't think of many actors who could have convincingly portrayed chris cole's struggles and aspirations wahlberg truly makes rock star rock br br jennifer aniston lights up the screen as well she creates a chemistry rich relationship with chris that induces audience participation it's tragic of what happens to their relationship we care about these characters a great deal br br during the film concert scenes director stephen herek who also directed holy man and the live action version of 101 dalmatians creates a gripping atmosphere he captures the scenes with an intense urgency and a raw unmistakable energy the musical numbers provide the film with the best most involving scenes br br unfortunately herek cannot sustain the energy and zest throughout at the three quarters mark he looses the spark as the movie becomes dull and unpleasant i understand where the story needs to go in order to portray the negative side of fame but this movie loses everything it previously had going for it in almost famous a much better film about rock and roll there is a certain amount of interest and life in even the most sorrowful scenes here it feels as if the filmmakers lose their passion br br the message comes a bit too late and suddenly in the story the film turns into a morality tale that wants to provide us with a sappy destination the filmmakers might as well stop everything appear on screen and say now audience the moral of the story we understand the theme but it's too instantaneous the personal discovery for chris' must be gradual br br fortunately all of this happens in the last twenty five minutes of the film hardly enough to completely destroy an entire eighty five minutes of a reasonably good feature rock star is not a great movie see almost famous if you want a remarkable film about rock and roll but for marky mark it's a turning point in his career br br
<START> the internet is a wondrous thing is it not i am watching a taped episode of one of my all time favorite documentaries vietnam the ten thousand day war from my dvr in florida usa to my laptop in kuwait i'm writing a review about this series and have just read another review from someone who actually lives in vietnam amazing i would like to just say that for nguyen to make the statement that america brought the war to vietnam is one sided i know america was the main player in the west but it takes two sides to wage war the soviets and the chinese were major arms providers to the north so why mr nguyen doesn't mention them as partially to blame is showing an ignorance well i think we all know why he doesn't mention them either ignorance from being raised in a communist system and its political dogma or because he to scared to say the truth for fear of being arrested also mr nguyen i guess the parts about the north being the main aggressor it whole war were not shown in your country so to blame america again shows ignorance regardless its interesting to read a review from vietnam of course that could be made up as well but i'll take that as real at least the communist east is somewhat open as far as the mini series why do i love it it doesn't focus on the american involvement solely this was a war that started 15 years before america got involved and the series covers every facet of the history so thats a real plus the footage used is first rate all the vietnam war programs you see made now will use the same footage so you are not missing anything by watching this older series the date this series was made is another plus it has all the major players being interviewed which you can't do now because they are dead from old age it's a major historical reference third richard adds a very distinctive narrative voice his voice sounds as distinguished as james earl jones voice would and i think thats very steep praise i don't think you could find a better war documentary ever made it's like taking the relatively modern technology of 1980 and transplanting it to the year 1950 and interviewing all the generals and politicians on both sides of world war two it does that for the vietnam war br br ok i do see some bias its subtle a 1970's 80's style subtle bias kind of like npr all things considered bias where it all seems so straight forward but when you blink you end up shaking your head in this shows case the later episodes don't throw a whole lot of light on the role of the media and propaganda in general all useful tools to influence the outcome of a war don't you think br br from an war veteran going through the same thing 30 years later
<START> this film was original in an unoriginal way although many movies have tackled the subject of suicide and mental institutions it was always about treating the patients and making them better because of the doctor's assistance in this film however we follow a depressed guy who falls in love with a suicidal girl and will stop at nothing to make her happy even though she doesn't care for happiness at all she just wants to die this was a very interestingly cute romance comedy that in nothing less than enjoyable this is a fun one to check out if you ever get the chance you just have to be open minded about the material overall i give it a 6 4 i just voted 9 to get the rating higher
<START> ever since i first encountered the divine ms as a sex therapist in spike lee's she's gotta have it i have been sold on the range of this exceedingly gifted yet terribly underrated actress she received an emmy for her portrayal here and to say it is well deserved is a masterpiece of understatement br br here she simply shines as the guiding force and hand in her community this was especially poignant for me for i grew up in this very same time period the production detail was phenomenal and evoked memories of life and times during the 50s 60s and of women like ms portrayed she was thoroughly and ably accompanied by a hot hot cast with performances one would enjoy over and over again i first saw macy gray's name in the credits and went ho hum her performance was so good i didn't even recognize her until about a 3rd of the way through i am especially proud of the obvious care and attention to detail to produce a feel and look of another beautiful era in african american culture that is very tastefully done br br another very interesting aspect is that the project was less concerned with the racial fabric of the times but infinitely more attuned to the richness of the characters and the emotional diversity they provide to exemplify that in the final analysis it is about the choices we make and to what extent we accept responsibility for those choices br br this is a worthy elegant presentation of african american life and is most assuredly destined to become a classic you owe it to yourself to have this as part of your collection br br i highly recommend
<START> i think i was recommended this film by the lady in the shop i was hiring it from for once she was bang on what a superb film first of all i was convinced james mcavoy romola garai were irish so convincing were their accents and by half way through the film i was utterly convinced steven robertson was a disabled actor and pretty sure james mcavoy was also when i watched the special features on the dvd and saw both actors in their 'normal' guise to say i was blown away would be an understatement i can remember all the acclaim dustin hoffmann got back in the 80's for his portrayal of autism in the film man' quite frankly in my opinion of course steven robertson's performance portrayal blows dustin right out of the water and he deserves recognition as such all in all one of the greatest portrayals of human friendship love relationships ever and it was made in britain ireland with home grown actors stick that in yer pipe and smoke it hollywood
<START> i have rated this movie a 1 10 and have done this in good nature this movie is not as it seems and i don t get the point of it take the first joke for instance their's that sign at the beginning to start well that was ok but then they start having some guy talking about the hood and then he dies then theirs the other guys who talks then he dies after the other guy says people don t get to their birthday with out dieing and he gets a cake now then he dies br br the jokes are just stupid they are t that smart and i would have thought they would have been better from some one like the directors of scary movie br br shawn wayans written by marlon wayans written by phil written by br br but it sucked and i hop next time they want to make another comedy they make some good jokes not lame ones
<START> so you've seen the romero movies yes and you've seen jacob's ladder right and the later hellraiser movies okay now let's make a movie out of all three only let's just jam everything together and make a whole big mess of it sounds like a good idea br br this movie is terrible absolutely god awful yeah it's an indie flick who gives a crap is that a pass to make filmic excrement the film attempts to establish credibility by focusing on character interaction that much is evident unfortunately for the writers they're not good at character interaction this isn't night of the living dead the characters are shouting their inane lines at each other in a vain attempt to be caught by the microphones on set the dialogue is never interesting for a movie that focuses so much on character interaction you'd think the characters would have something more to say than what are we going to do i don't know well we've got to do something well what are we going to do i don't know we should leave let's just accept our fate no we've got to leave well let's leave then no maybe we should stay br br this isn't exaggeration there are exchanges in this film that reach that level of redundancy and inanity br br the worst thing about this movie half of it is a dream and it really has zero purpose nothing in the dream has any relevance to anything in the rest of the movie the writers couldn't decide whether to make a zombie movie or a monster movie and so they just made both it's patently ridiculous the cheapest trick in the book and it's maddeningly insulting especially since i'm pretty sure they ripped off the idea from jacob's ladder which handled the concept a hell of a lot more competently than these jokers could ever hope to do br br and then there's the editing years of watching mtv and playing horror themed video games must have inspired the filmmakers but it's surely a sad thing they didn't realize what made the choppy editing and in those pieces of media effective in the first place in this film you will be confused often and not in the good david lynch way but in the bad wait i thought she just got killed no then who the hell was that wait who is that guy where did he come from how did they get here kind of way it's constant and consistently bad br br this movie is a laughable piece of trash and should only be sought out if you want to get trashed with a few friends and laugh at it br br and as a final note as for the comedy people in other reviews are talking about it's all unintentional there isn't a single intentional piece of comedy in this film it's all supposed to be a big serious character study because the filmmakers want to have credibility in their horror concept sadly their pretensions don't match up to their ability
<START> a tender movie that represents how our daily life is a catalyst that causes us to change our thoughts behaviors and emotions into people we're not this story is a love story where true emotions arise i credit malcolm jamal warner win and cates for outstanding performances a movie definitely worth seeing a holiday roadtrip that turns into an emotional turn a round i suggest seeing it
<START> this is still jolly good fun as with most of my friends we had seen this movie on hbo when we were young and then had been searching ever since for a copy of it when they finally rereleased it a few years ago we had a midnight madness party and the movie held up well sure it's pure cheese but it's still a lot of fun if you didn't see mm when you were young you might not appreciate its value today
<START> i don't know about the rest of the viewers of this movie but personally i'm dead sick and tired of steven seagal films when above the law came out it was a great action film wahoo now in the patriot steven seagal plays steven seagal from above the law i get tired of seeing no character changes it's the same character time after time after time he needs change this movie was probably one of the worst action films i have ever seen calling it an action movie is giving it almost too much credit because there's too few action scenes and they're spread far apart throughout the film i guess they wanted to go for some drama but it was a meaningless try as the film portrays nothing but the regular squinty eyed steven seagal we've seen thousands of times over get a new look and lose the pony tail is all i have to say i definitely do not recommend viewing this film in any form go out to eat heck rent barney goes to vegas but do not under any circumstances rent this movie under the precept that seagal will make a great performance
<START> this is an absolutely horrid excuse for a show people say its witty and intelligence i don't see how maybe because the characters use fancy words maybe because they are snooty use dry humor and have 2 dimensional personalities i went to an ivy league school and nobody acted anywhere near as obnoxious as these characters in fact had i met someone like them i would have likely strangled them the men act like little emotional pre teen girls and all the minority characters are based off stereotypes the characters are no at all authentic simply put they sound like a trailer park family trying to be rich and sophisticated this show is just another cookie cutter hit that brain dead prime time viewers eat up on a regular basis
<START> kevin night of the demons is an enjoyable horror film that reminds me a little bit the evil dead on night a group of teens throws a party in hull house an abandoned funeral home on the outskirts of town lead by angela they perform a like ceremony and accidentally awaken the evil spirits that inhabit the place one by one the uninvited evil force possesses the teens turning them into bloodthirsty demons night of the demons is a perfect horror film it is scary gory and pretty atmospheric the characters are well developed and the gore by steve johnson is pretty good there is a gruesome impaling a tongue being bitten off fingers shoved into eye sockets etc the scene where suzanne linnea quigley shoves a tube of lipstick through her nipple is a hoot give this one a look followed by two sequels
<START> ok so it's not great either but only because of how great laurel and hardy have been in the past if this film received a total overhaul with picture quality enhanced add new dubbing to the badly dubbed voices and added a nice unobtrusive background music then this film would truly start to take shape as it is it does have it's problems people do slate it for how old the boys look quel surprise they were in their 60's and had led a 'life' however to me they still came across as having of charm and while this doesn't even come close to tickling the feet of their classics i gave it a 4 it's worth a watch simply because it's them to think otherwise would be
<START> the story as i understand is based on real events that can be either good or bad depending on what sort of license is taken with those real events and how they are rendered br br in this case the results are enough to gag a maggot i wasn't expecting much going in anticipating a story of rich high school kids taking an ocean cruise under a stern skipper that is what i figured was a coming of age movie along the lines of something about boot camp or basic training the kind in which the drill sergeant says my duty is to snap you out of your winsome civilian ways well it is that in a way the kids start out as kids and end up as an organic group but this is far hokier than any boot camp movie i've ever seen outside of a deliberate comedy who wrote this thing the air is filled with slogans that belong not in high school but in the third grade the dialog offends the ear br br jeff bridges usually does a better than average job but in this case his performance is mediocre he brings nothing extra to the part although given his lines it's hard to know how he could do much with them the rest of the cast is undistinguished and a few of the kids are painfully inadequate there's a lot of tearing up and considerable crying the best scene involves a dolphin br br the immature clichÃ©s continue to the very end the coast guard is cast in the role of the hard hearted court at the hearing that follows the disaster the interrogator does nothing but hit bridges over the head with his misinterpretations and of events you let the crew drink alcohol didn't you a couple of harmless drinks and you didn't punish them though you punished them for killing a fish the dolphin business the technical details surrounding the sinking are left murky what is a white anyway and if it's as dangerous as bridges claims why weren't the whole crew alerted and wearing life vests but why go on if the albatross were a it would still be torpedoed and sunk by the ludicrous comic book script
