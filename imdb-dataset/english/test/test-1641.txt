<START> the beginning of the film is promising when jeanne anna hear the story of the incident that happen on the day she was born that raise the possibility that she is the daughter of a famous pianist andrÃ© jacques she set to find out whether it's true or not and giving the fact the she plays also the piano that's not such a remote idea jeanne meet andrÃ© and his wife muller isabelle huppert and their son and on the way uncover the fact that there are some secrets in that family as much in her own br br o k we have seen this before and it has been done in a more interesting way than here the character of muller is left with out us understanding her motives to her action and she is not interesting enough to care for her the piano scenes look fake and the whole piano sub plot doesn't add anything to the character's insight but serve as to make the film longer than it should have been in the first place br br in short a very disappointing outing from chabrol who can do better than this
<START> i have never seen the first killjoy film and i have also never heard a good thing said about it so i see killjoy 2 in the local blockbusters and pick it up and look at the back starring trent haaga and debbie rochon it boasts now being the massive troma fan that i am there is no way i'm not going to rent this film out how can it possibly be bad with these two oh how wrong i was even trent and debbie cant save this excuse of a film from being as bad as it truly is trent quite frankly stinks as killjoy although this probably is more the fault of the writers giving him some of the worst one liners in the history of film debbie does put a solid performance in but it isn't enough the kills are terrible as are the gore effects for example check out when the guy is supposedly impaled on something or other and just to top it all off the ending is just amongst the worst i have ever seen in movie history the film doesn't even work on a so bad it's good level avoid like the clap br br 2 10
<START> the opening scene of this movie is pretty incredible i've seen a number of sci fi movies with great special effects but my roommate and i looked at each other after the opening sequence and he said plainly sensory overload the plot of the movie is pretty simple but the nice thing about this sci fi movie is that it lets the audience figure out most of the technology for themselves instead of wasting time to subtly explain it the creatures in this movie are also very interesting you don't get a really good look at them until about two thirds of the way through overall a very entertaining movie
<START> ugh even the ever popular diane lane could not save this movie and the most exciting thing about the movie was seeing if rourke's face would move one has heard so much gossip about his botched face lift etc so like an accident on the side of the road we just had to slow down and see the wreck the plot was thin here we have a very professional mob hit man who somehow latches on to a wild and uncontrollable punk crook and throughout this movie we're wondering why this guy stays with this idiot let alone gets together with the guy in the first place then the crime that was not even committed has the pro to go after the witnesses he would have popped them right then and there but then we would not have had a movie then would we and why did the realtor even agree to the extortion there were more holes in this flick than in my colander the acting was horrid the entire movie predictable down to the minute and even the ending and so much could have been done to make this a much better movie but if you have about 90 minutes to kill and not have to use any brain cells in the process then this movie is just what the doctor ordered
<START> ok on the whole this three part documentary will bring most interested people up to date with on in the world of physics and the last 300 years of discovery of our universe if you have read stephen brilliant book a brief history of time and understood it then you might benefit from the visual description of certain concepts which i did to a certain extent greene is bearable but obviously for the sake of the masses tends to explain things in a patronising way this is of course deliberate and will be perfect for almost everyone who watches this series br br the guest scientists were good no hawking but i suppose he has his own dvd s i kept waiting for him to appear but they rotate through the same ones for almost 3 parts very american weighted here with a few brits and one i bought the nova 2 disc edition ntsc and there were a few inclusions that really detracted from the overall experience br br 1 the this is brought to you by at the start of each part was a necessary evil for the first part but seeing it 2 more times before it was over was very ordinary br br 2 can't be helped i suppose but there is quite a bit of overlap at the start of 2 and 3 which had me reaching for the button a few times br br 3 this disc set was straight from tv ie ads what happen last show for those that missed it and frequent goto pbs org for more appearing throughout the presentation quite unlike bbc material which is unmatched for presentation planets the blue planet etc my 7 10 is based on content alone the niggles were there but i got over them if this had have been done with that classic british accented presenter you know the one it would be a perfect disc set in my opinion br br if you have seen this and want more then i highly recommend book a brief history of time i wish it was a movie too br br happy viewing
<START> this movie was much better than i expected after a couple of films by will smith that weren't that great like i robot he is back to being likable and fun in this one smith plays hitch a date doctor most of the film centers around him teaching albert how to be himself and get a date with cole a rich famous celebrity whom he works with albert is a klutz and goof and always tripping on his feet or what not all hitch does is teach him how to act more cool and not be so nervous around br br during all this hitch meets sara a gossip columnist whom has sworn off men hitch charms her so of course they go out but hitch may teach other guys how to get the girl to fall for them he doesn't believe in love himself he has never really had a girl since he was dumped in college but he likes sara so keeps going after her sara's friend is hurt by guy whom she thinks went to the date doctor so sara tracks the doctor down only to learn its hitch so of course she thinks he's a pig then it's up to hitch to explain to sara and what he does so they both end up forgiving br br final verdict good has some laughs and is entertaining i recommend it
<START> peter lorre was born to play stephen with lines like mr smith you shouldn't hold my wife like that and i told you not to keep the monkey in the house the poster for this film is an eerie green and peter lorre leers in way that makes you never want to go to his penal colony island this film is not available on dvd although it is a classic and very rarely shown on tv what exactly is the relationship between stephen and the monkey why does the monkey upset him so much we will never know the film should be colorized by someone and excerpts should be made into a kinks video the film was re released in the 1950s and only a few of the peter lorre biographies spend any text on this film casablanca was right around the corner bogart could have been on that island but they surely did not have the budget for him
<START> i do not think i am alone when i say that 2005 has not been particularly kind to the horror genre while cursed hide and seek the ring two and the amityville horror all showed glimpses of interest and potential there have been more misses than hits for proof see white noise boogeyman the jacket mindhunters and alone in the dark imagine my surprise when house of wax tightly written by siblings chad and carey hayes turned out to be well a surprise br br carly jones elisha cuthbert is a young woman traveling with her trouble making brother nick chad michael murray and boyfriend wade jared they are along with paige paris hilton blake robert ri'chard and dalton jon abrahams hoping to score tickets to the final football game of the season along the way they run into some car trouble and are forced to enter a desolate town where nothing is what it appears to be br br upon hearing of this a remake of the classic vincent price b movie i rolled my eyes i did not even want to think about what disaster freshman director serra had cooked up for his audience in a time when most high profile horror films are disappointments latent with bad writing static direction and amateur acting i consider myself lucky that serra and the hayes brothers took it upon themselves to make a good old fashioned spook fest unlike the disappointments that i named before this flick pulls no punches and uses every cinematic trick in the book to give everyone exactly what they came for br br i am happy that the actually took the time and effort to create likable and believable characters thus making the events that much more urgent it also gives the young actors portraying them something grip on as she did in the girl next door elisha cuthbert proves to audiences what a skilled actress she really is in the 2003 remake of the texas chainsaw massacre jessica biel silenced naysayers by delivering a raw and emotional performance one that put the viewer right there with her here cuthbert does the same chad michael murray a cinderella story in one of his first more mature roles is no slacker as nick murray exudes charisma and a hard edge as well as some impressive athleticism on top of it murray and cuthbert gel perfectly and have tangible familial chemistry br br more so than anything else the press and the american public have made a field day about paris hilton's major acting debut as i expected hilton does not embarrass herself in fact she is just as good as anyone else in the movie do with that what you will like cuthbert and murray hilton has screen presence she is sexy and playful i cannot think one of reason why she's gotten the worst of the film's harsh reception other than they are simply picking on her jared tv's girls' memorably manages to overcome his underwritten role robert ri'chard tv's 'cousin and jon abrahams meet the parents do not have much to work with but get the job done with only one scene damon herriman soar makes an unforgettable impression and his presence hangs over the rest of the film finally brian van holt basic is superb and threatening in a dual role br br once more kudos must go to the screenwriters for avoiding clichÃ©s whenever possible despite popular opinion house of wax is quite unpredictable for a majority of its running time take this for example it seems as if the killer is down for the count and carly bends down to retrieve something from his pockets what do you expect to happen see the movie and you will understand what i mean it is also refreshing to see a horror film in which the characters show even a modicum of good sense br br unlike most horror scores john exhilarating work never distracts however as with dark castle's other releases the visual aspects of wax are award worthy and lift the film above its genre trappings the talents of cinematographer stephen f production designer graham walker art director nicholas mccallum and editor joel negron highlight the ghoulish imagery speaking of imagery i believe that the gore hounds will be thrilled with the many makeup effects and tricks in store here each death scene is more stomach churning than the last considering his past in music videos and commercials it is obvious that serra has a great eye for style his in your face approach is a great asset to this film's success just when you think the camera will turn away it does not he is also particularly good a building thick layers of dread and atmosphere one standout shot is our introduction to the killer as he slowly emerges from a trap door br br in a case like this i would usually admit when i am in the minority shut up okay i liked house of 1000 corpses in this case i firmly that the detractors have gotten it wrong i am not sure why people are so hard on this film considering it's much better than recent genre entries maybe they're afraid to admit that a horror flick starring paris hilton could possibly be worth watching who knows this is a horror film and a commendably stylish and effective one at that as a lifelong horror fan all i can say is that i thoroughly enjoyed house of wax in all of its lurid and sadistic glory i safely consider it a great accomplishment in modern horror as well as along with sin city the first completely satisfying release of 2005
<START> 'gross was one of a series of texts released in australia during the early to mid 1990s that explored the supposed of the privileged heterosexual male in the age of feminism this creature only needs look at a pretty young thing and he's accused of sexual harassment and his life is ruined damn those women's grrr br br as my tone might suggest i don't buy any of this anti feminist bs and didn't enjoy this film the issues of sexual harassment and teacher student relations sexual harassment is here the product of a confused young woman's imagination and those professional boundaries that teachers are meant to maintain well when the teacher is a charming and handsome family man and played by jimmy well needn't worry about those br br sexist trash and even by reviewing it i'm giving it more time than it deserves
<START> talk about rubbish i can't think of one good thing in this movie the screenplay was poor the acting was terrible and the effects well there were no effects i can't believe the writer of this movie did identity everything in this movie made me sick to start to finish br br the front cover of the video box shows a showman with shark like teeth and scary eyes i looks like a scary villain but like the old saying never judge a book by it's cover the whole villain looked like a cardboard cut out one part in the film a girl gets killed by a salad tongs terrible the setting was bad enough like they could of set the whole thing in but no a tropical island instead br br i took this movie as a spoof which i think they wanted it to be but the only thing that made me laugh in a bad way was the tacky effects you can argue that i haven't watched the first one but seeing this i would be safe if i wouldn't attempted it br br the biggest joke in this movie is the effects the snowballs looked like they were home made and that carrot was a complete embarrassment if i would of guess the budget of this movie would of probably be between 8 to 9 pounds fifty the producer in a last minute panic must of grabbed the actors for the street gave them the script told them they have 6 minutes to practise these lines and shoot on a island br br lastly the acting in the film was painful it was like the actors forgot their ordinary lines and made them up the way through br br in conclusion i give this film 0 stars out of 5
<START> other reviews have talked about how frank this film is especially in terms of male frontal nudity well those who've seen grande with its frequently naked actors and expect something similar are in for a big disappointment other than a few seconds in the judo team locker room the two leads' side by side shower lasts a grand total of 15 seconds the female lead has comparably brief frontal moments a lot of this film's marketing is geared to the gay male audience but those expecting even a hint of homoeroticism between the two male leads best friends who have a three way with the girlfriend of one of them will be most disappointed there is not even the hint of either one's being interested in the other or even scarcely aware that the other is part of the menage a trois as a film is curiously uninvolving the viewer gets very little sense of who these three young people are of how they are feeling of why they behave as they do about one hour of the original cut was deleted perhaps this is why the finished film seems frustratingly undeveloped stick with grande a french film which more than delivers on its promises
<START> i remember seeing the very first trailer for underdog back last march i also remember at the time smiling to myself ever so slightly sure it was a cheesy idea but i genuinely thought at the time the concept might work hell it couldn't be any worse than the disappointing cats and dogs could it then by december and i suddenly remembered the film i realised how likely the film was to suck the fact it had been delayed in the uk made it seem inevitable it would be terrible but the horrendous reviews just made me realise it was nigh on impossible for the movie to be any good still i swallowed my feelings and went to see the film with a friend today as i entered my screen i was mortified it was the very first time i'd be seeing a movie with a friend and being the only two in the screen little did i know for what i was about to endure underdog to put it blunt is horrendous it really is imagine how bad you could think this movie is and then prepare yourself for a movie even worse that is just how pathetic the movie is while it aims to entertain kids it just seems an embarrassing mess that seems to insult kids rather than allow them to enjoy the movie matters cannot be helped by the fact that the story is beyond lacklustre the acting is generally poor and the movie just feels like an over long tired and downright boring saturday cartoon after a brief five minutes where i thought the movie might be passable the movie just suddenly seems to die and then limp on towards the already sign posted finale i'm just amazed the movie was actually ever released it's an embarrassment to disney hell half their straight to video sequels are better than this what's even more terrifying is the fact the ending leaves room for a sequel br br so lets get onto the acting cracks knuckles okay let me be honest jason lee is decent his voice suits the canine and had he have been given a decent script he might have made the performance work however with such a dodgy script he just seems to flounder in many ways it reminded me of bill murray in garfield murray did what he could with what he had but what he had wasn't enough to make it passable then we get onto the human actors and well the majority of atrocious alex plays the friend of underdog jack my biggest concern is that anybody would even take him seriously in an audition the scene where he gets to fly with underdog is perhaps the most cringe worthy scene in the past few years just because his acting is so poor not once did i believe he was a real person in fact part of me is still convinced he was a robot made specially for the movie james belushi seems half dead in the film he has nothing to work with no decent lines he just seems to wander around the set waiting to become relevant to the plot which the writers try to do towards the end but do it in such a poor way its laughable thankfully peter is the one redeeming factor of the movie he is great as dr and seems to be having a laugh in the role he steals every scene he is in although that's hardly difficult when he shares screen time with the extremely annoying patrick warburton the rest of the cast are even worse especially taylor momsen she just needs to end her acting career right now br br underdog also fails dramatically in terms of delivering anything like a funny scene when the funniest scene involves underdog biting a can and causing dog food to explode everywhere you know there is something drastically wrong this could be easily ignored if the movie had decent action or a good story alas the movie is even worse in both of these terms the effects are so ropey that any scene where underdog flies just seems absurd and the dog uses his powers to such little effect that you frequently forget he has superpowers what's the point in making a film about a super dog if the damned dog never appears super the final fight also verges on embarrassing purely because its ten minutes of nothingness the dog flies other stuff happens some stuff gets chucked about all of this is irrelevant as this stuff is happening for the sake of stuff happening the script as well is dodgy at best and downright pain awful at worst when someone says look its a plane no its a bird no its a frog yes you read that right i just wanted to burst into tears there and then actually i wanted to walk out by remained compelled to see whether it could get any lower than that point this happens near the end so it doesn't thankfully br br overall underdog becomes the worst movie of 2008 at this early period and is actually just as bad as last years epic movie luckily for underdog meet the spartans arrives over here soon and i expect that to be even worse so in case you didn't get the point of my review avoid the film at all costs if you want to see a movie with a dog then watch cats and dogs buy a real dog if necessary just do not see this
<START> i saw this play on showtime some years back in the comfort of my home and when the final note was struck i wanted to jump off the sofa and give the production a standing ovation as it was i shed a tear that it was such a bunch of fantastic performances and songs for my birthday my kids bought me the vhs version as well as the cd of the play with len in the sweeny todd role br br i've shared the play with many some finding the subject a bit sick but none having anything but praise for the songs br br i've always loved the interplay in songs with angela lansbury and george as well as and edmund as judge turpin br br i must own the dvd
<START> smartly written well acted intense and suspenseful this show lives in the real world not as fantastical as is 24 and i am a huge fan of 24 incidentally it has believable characters and in many ways is much smarter than most in this genre it tries to present both sides of islam so far i have watched the first 4 episodes and find the story to be more evenly balanced the terrorists are more complex and not one dimensional and as a result of that balance the terrorists become more frightening than the typical villains being portrayed in film and on television last but not least the hero is truly heroic without being a cartoon i recommend this show for anyone who is a fan of 24 and the like
<START> do people rate this movie highly because it's a foreign war movie br br to me it's nothing more than a bad hollywood war movie in german br br this movie is so bad on so many levels to even mention it along with platoon or full metal jacket is absurd the battle sequences are pathetic the dialog and acting atrocious br br this so called group of storm troopers are regulars in the not ss troops there is so much wrong with this movie it's sad bad editing bad acting it's got it all br br the movie goes on and on and on as though the audience should be made to suffer as much as the soldiers did br br i read in a review that the this film had a 20 million budget br br for real where was it spent in the fake train car sequences in the pathetic special effects ugh br br as a wwii history buff and wwii movie fan i found this movie to be a serious disappointment br br for an excellent alternative war movie check out the beast not a wwii movie but still outstanding br br don't bother with this one
