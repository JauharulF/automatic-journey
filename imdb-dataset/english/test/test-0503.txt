<START> possible minor spoiler br br it's not a terribly objective review but i just found this movie horribly depressing like a lot of russell t davies' br br work it asks more questions than it can answer his best work bob rose doctor who revels in hope against the odds and perseverance even after apparent defeat these uplifting themes seemed strangely absent here i suppose the fact that i'm still thinking about it days after viewing is a testament to the quality of the program but the resolution was just too bleak for my tastes br br i would however disagree with the reviews i've read complaining that the end feels tacked on i think each conclusion follows logically from its premise and the ending represented a sound personal belief that neatly resolved the primary theme of the show while i never really questioned the progression of events i felt like there was much that could have been expanded upon i've also read that it was originally conceived as a four part series instead of two and it's possible that the has done some harm to the completed piece however these flaws appear throughout in sequences and themes that sometimes feel rough or sketched in br br to his credit davies is totally unafraid to write big and you have to admire the sheer audacity and scope of this project the premise he tackles here is the stuff of movies or novels Â it is a brave and ambitious thing to tackle it in the medium of television strong points include christopher eccleston who is positively mesmeric in the lead for me he was and remains the best reason to watch the depiction of the humanity was brilliant thought provoking and engaging and a real credit to both davies' writing and eccleston's acting i also thought the depiction of the modern world's reaction to the second coming rang true br br so two stars simply because i personally want my entertainment to be entertaining i would rather be uplifted or at least distracted by my fiction i have a whole big real world around me Â as filtered through cnn or the newspapers if i choose to be horribly depressed there are definitely less subjective reasons by which to judge this piece but i'm afraid my judgment in this matter is clouded by my emotional response
<START> the opening shot of the consequences of love perfectly sets up this intriguing and absorbing film a slowly carries a solitary out of focus figure towards the camera trailing a huge suitcase behind him like the central character in the film we know nothing of him and our initial interpretation of him his profession the contents of the suitcase could be way off the mark br br consequences of love is that kind of film from the title you might expect a dissection of a relationship what we have instead is a lead character living life in emotional exile seemingly choosing to cut himself off from those around him if the film can be classified in any way i would call it a mystery as we are engaged in working out who is and what he is about what we know from the start is he is cool composed and expensively attired he has lived for the last eight years in a plush looking swiss hotel always paying his room fee on time but seldom showing any interest in the staff or other guests br br his only real companions are a couple who he plays occasional card games with the couple it transpires used to own the hotel but have now gambled everything away and have only the room they live in left their love of money antiques and each other was their undoing and seems to identify with their plight he once had it all but now is now living as a virtual prisoner in the hotel his brother a long haired surf instructor drops in to see him occasionally but he sees his visits as more of an intrusion than a pleasure they talk about the person considers to be his best friend even though he hasn't seen him for 25 years this long lost friend is now a telephone engineer repairing the communication network that brings so many together meanwhile phone calls to his wife and children end quickly when they refuse to speak to him br br midway through the film makes an uncharacteristic move and begins to open up to a young barmaid from the hotel with his judgement clouded by emotion he sets himself on a course of actions that will ultimately seal his fate for good br br the slow unfolding of fall from grace is and beautifully scripted shot and scored the thumping techno soundtrack does much to build up the tension as more and more secrets are revealed the final half hour turning into a taught thriller as lets his mask slip and must once again face the consequences of his actions the ending with a visual nod to is dramatic yet ambiguous and leaves the audience to once more question his motives br br patrick bliss 01 06 06
<START> beauty in trouble v is not a great title all the descriptions of this film fail to capture what it really is Â an adult fairy tale a poor girl is wooed by a prince the girl played by the stunning anna has an isabelle huppert beauty with a red hair face and figure that are beguiling sexual and endlessly fascinating she has a louse of a husband but they have great sex the kids listen to the lovemaking through walls it's rough and passionate as the sex of the working class seems to often be portrayed in film but it's also for us to recognize that this is the thing that binds them together in an otherwise incompatible marriage the husband a professional car thief is eventually caught and thrown in jail how she got into this marriage we don't know but she is not exactly a high class herself but she's beautiful intelligent we assume and loves her gorgeous and resilient kids she deserves more and she may get the life she deserves eventually no spoiler she is forced to move back with mom after her husband is sent to jail mom has a hideous second husband read ugly stepfather he is a real horror show he borders on being a child abuser to the kids he's obsessive about cleanliness but farts at the table all the while demanding manners and decorum from the kids he's real low class socially handicapped wretch mom puts up with him like marcella's husband at least he's lusty hideous but horny the ambivalent confusing layered characterizations are what make the film so powerful and interesting these characters have flaws some seemed driven by class some by innate character these flaws and details of character are charming one minute and contemptible the next the audience really has to negotiate conflicting feeling of class sexuality ambition commitment and the role of a woman as mother and wife through the quickly changing terrain of the story at the bottom line as with many films like the wonderful icelandic movie thicker than water the children can be the victims what's right in the end may be what's best for the children Â who are our salvation and our future it's a theme played out these days in films ranging from pan's labyrinth to children of men foreign cinema is recognizing in intricate morality tales that life is confusing brutal unfair and as adults we must get our act together in order to pass something worthwhile to the next generation if we give in to our baser instincts we may lose ourselves and the world in the process the extraordinary and complex and colorful characters in v speak to the qualities of what makes a man what drives a women what embodies hope what is class is it economic status of the fabric of one's character the film is richly human as embodied by the very last 2 shots which moved me incredibly and unexpectedly the director's choices are so subtle and intelligent that to compare this to an american film seems unfair americans sometimes seem to lack the desire to consider that paradoxes in human nature don't offer set resolutions but here perilously couched in ostensible fairy tale for adults are interesting moral questions don't be fooled by the simple story this is a great movie
<START> this film tries hard but fails perhaps to non australian audiences it may have appeal as a travelogue but to the native it is merely tedious br br anyone who lives here knows broken hill is a rough tough isolated mining town if a couple of fruits turn up in drag well it's all so predictable where have i come across that well worn theme before oh yes town mouse and country mouse spare us br br i kept hoping it would improve but after the broken hill scene i could see where this was heading and so turned off the tv and went to bed
<START> the story told by the cranes are flying is not admittedly all that original young lovers are separated by war bad things happen to both we've seen it many times before br br nonetheless we haven't seen it filmed this well with bold shots that take liberties to emphasize separation or destruction or hopelessness all the more remarkable coming from the soviet union and reason to conclude that tarkovsky is not the last word in modern era soviet cinema br br i was reading chekhov's three sisters the other day and chanced upon what may be the meaning of the title of this film in act 2 objects to the notion that we must live our lives without meaning or understanding br br surely mankind must believe in something or at least seek for the truth otherwise life is just emptiness emptiness to live and not to know why the cranes are flying why children are born why there are stars in the sky either you must know why it is you live or everything is trivial mere pointless nonsense br br likewise veronika has a hard time believing that the war and her and others' sufferings have been pointless better to assign a meaning to live as if one's life is significant and not to give in to despair it is perhaps this thinking that prompts her to her final act in the film br br btw as a minor correction to one other comment here there may be a pattern of in the film though i hadn't noticed them myself but the first letter of name is not a further instance of this in the alphabet her name begins with a letter which looks like an english b
<START> there are some great canadian films there are some crappy ones last night i watched one of the crappy ones it wasn't the typical canadian film where it tried to be so different by being arty this film tried to be some type of hollywood gangster movie it was terrible br br from the beginning i had a sense that it would be a bad movie it had some of the cheesiest dialouge a movie can have there was this voice over for one scene and then it never returned that always bugs me when filmmakers just use voice over when they can't think of another creative way to tell a story br br i know being in the canadian film industry i should support my fellow brothers but this movie is junk the premise is something like a soprano's episode only not realistic some banker's mafia boss dad is on his death bed and orders the son to make the business legit not so original and the workers complain about it but they just take the fact that they will soon be out of jobs like nothing to make it legit they use extortion irony but not the good kind then some freak show girl who had an awful elvis wig and birthmark that covered half of her face robs the main character and kinda rapes him anyways this guy for whatever reason now likes to dress up as girls then this banker hooks up with a hooker when he has a beautiful future wife at home but he falls for the hooker because the hooker dresses like a man and puts make up on him she blackmails him with some photos of him wearing bra and panties yet he still loves her he also has no reason to leave his fiancÃ© but he does in order to be with the hooker br br for a movie about organize crime and sexual fetish there was neither action nor sex it was like a late night cinemax porn movie without the good stuff the would be sex scenes weren't hot or sexy it was all too amateurish the movie had nothing going for it just the lame plot br br i don't think it was the actor's fault i think they had a terrible script to work with what stuck out the most was the ridiculous characters the bad guy's name was uncle bunny or something but the name wasn't important it was they all were clichÃ© the dialouge was laughable throughout the movie and fellow movie goers laughed aloud at some of the movies serious moments then the worst of it all it had to be the cheapest ending if you can ever remember playing shoot out as a kid with either imaginary guns or toy guns that was basically the ending of the movie but i was more than happy it ended and i had to warn my fellow canadians to not waste time or money watching this film
<START> this totally odd ball feature is a typical and prime example of satanically shocking 70's horror the events are thoroughly confusing and it takes up quite a while before you figure out what the hell is going on but the brooding atmosphere sucks you in immediately right from the indescribably bizarre intro showing a couple of eerie children turning toys into real life war machinery you just know this become an uncompromising and gritty shocker brotherhood of satan soon appears to be another installment in the alleged unofficial creepy little town hiding a dark secret sub genre a young widower traveling with his new yummy girlfriend and 8 year old daughter stops in a remote little town to report a car accident they witnessed on a nearby highway the villagers behave very hostile and insist the visitors on leaving right away the town clearly bathes in an ambiance of fear and panic as local children vanish inexplicably vanished and unnatural forces maintain everyone within the boundaries of town is in the grip of a satanic cult apparently ruled by the elderly members of the community i really liked brotherhood of satan a lot the story reminded me of a novel written by john saul but i can't remember the title it also dealt with a cult of elderly people abusing youthful villagers for their own greedy merits the film mainly relies on creepy scenery like dolls and witchcraft relics but a slightly more involving and coherent screenplay would have been nice the subject matter often raises a lot of issues and questions and director bernard can't always provide us with answers the climax is terrific very seventies meaning shocking and unforgettable beautifully shot film too
<START> a plane carrying a rich scientist's daughter goes down in thick wilderness he assembles a group to go and find her and the others but the rescue party soon suspects that something is stalking them then ulterior motives for the expedition are revealed and that only adds to the already existing tension br br the movie is a decent idea and a take on the popular sasquatch legend was bound to wind up on film sooner or later however the film's direction breaks a fundamental rule of horror thriller directing and that is showing too much too soon of course the audience knows there is something stalking the characters just read the title but showing what should have been the film's kicker that early just ruins most of the suspense and as a direct result much of the fun the film also lacks a good atmosphere and there are almost no landscape shots that show the expanse of the wilderness but there are plenty monster point of view shots that add nothing to anything they actually knock off 'predator' quite shamelessly the low budget horror film 'wendigo' did what this film tries to do much better br br some of the character tensions and a non clichÃ© ending manage to make up for this rise above the crap pile but it is still poor and given the premise and potential very disappointing 4 10 br br rated r for some violence and profanity but it's pretty tame compared to most r rated horror
<START> fatal contact bird flu in america 3 out of 10 this movie is both funny and sad the funny part is fairly obvious as this certainly isn't a sober look at a possible impending crisis this is a modern version of the swarm and much like those killer bees and the so called killer bee crisis that prompted them bird flu has joined a pantheon of media inspired end of the world scenarios sars y2k global warming that simply refuse to actually come about br br the sad part is the blatant attempt of the filmmakers to inspire panic disease historically were fairly common after all people didn't all die in their forties from heart disease even recent such as aids mirrors the old fashioned vd crisis think syphilis that used to kill more soldiers than bullets br br the flu pandemic of the early twenties was a nasty business killing millions but honestly life went on i wonder if our over dramatic media and their power hungry government allies would allow life as normal today br br the movie itself swerves wildly from fairly competent scenes triage in grand central station to the ridiculous rednecks try to ambush national in manhattan br br the scenarios themselves are fairly useless as the filmmakers can't seem to decide exactly how contagious the bird flu is or for that matter whether the symptoms are an ebola style crash or simply a long illness indeed one scene will show everyone in bio hazard suits and the next will have nobody even wearing a mask br br the film also patently refuses to actually give any practical advice regarding what to do in a bird flu crisis outside of wash your hands what no duct tape the acting and directing are competent for a tv movie but the script is all over the map last the movie has a strangely non exponential death total running on the bottom of the screen just like the swarm did
<START> i saw this black and white comedy noir yesterday at the london film festival structurally it has been compared to pulp fiction but it is perhaps closer to the structure of amores perros and the slacker mood of kevin smith's clerks four stories intersect at a french motorway diner the first vignette has franck edouard baer bungling a hold up at the diner the waitress suzie anna takes pity and tell him her story the second has two incompetent kidnappers leon and paul serge take a teenage girl from her rich family unfortunately for them she is suicidal and her family don't appear to want her back the third is a dialogue between two ageing rock stars who bump into each other at the diner alain and playing themselves the final part is about four ex criminals who smuggle their old partner out of hospital to visit their old hideout which has since been turned into Â the diner an returns to franck and suzie to complete their story not really an epilogue more a conclusion br br the structure does not really work the stories are not sufficiently intertwined as in pulp fiction nor is the diner crucial to the action to at least two of the stories in the way the car crash was crucial in the four stories of amores perros the quality of the individual stories varies the hideout story is a cute idea with a couple of good gags but does not come off and the rock star reunion is pointless and dull on the other hand the kidnap story is hilarious although its connection to the diner is tenuous the most balanced and successful story is the franck and suzie one br br this film isn't entirely successful but has moments of interest and hilarity i look forward to seeing more of writer director's samuel work
<START> i like the show but come on writers get some action in it quit dragging it on and on you have a great concept and it could be a whole lot more miles jenkins is great and performs as a kid that age should act in the situation he finds himself in hey get creative with the creatures they may have telepathic capabilities or other out worldly powers the kid actors in the series are very good and convincing the parents of miles do appear to be a little too out of sense as to what is going on but develop this come on you have a great seed here and there can be a whole new twist to next season with a lot of new characters and creatures and all kinds of neat sci fi stuff if they could make a series on a witch then you should be able to make one on these creatures and kids
<START> this is a film that everyone who lives in sweden should watch the film shows the political riots who took place in gothenburg in 2001 from a new perspective it features interviews with those who were convicted where those people gets the first chance after the riots to tell their side of the story and why they think the world can be a so much better place to live in and be a part of i react emotionally when i see this since i just feel so mad about how those people were treated both during the riots but also after the riots br br i hope as many as possible gets to see this movie as it really gets your mind thinking is this possible in sweden a democracy in 2001
<START> junior and his dad start a new life in a new town it's the same life because junior hasn't changed one bit he is still the same rotten brat as before only he's gotten bigger this time he has a pal named trixie and she is only slightly worse junior doesn't like his dad dating and messes up every opportunity that he has then grandpa moves in and the dog comes along i thought that the two of them would have made it a good movie but they didn't even become buddies until the end this is a movie for the most immature people it has diapers farts doggy do do and toilet humor in it only someone under the age of twelve would find this to be super hilarious i hope when i have a son he is exactly like junior
<START> i had never heard of before then i saw it on toon disney and instantly loved it i also think that it is not just for kids and that people of all ages would enjoy it it has a great plot great effect and cool characters i will always love the show and i heard it will be coming on on dvd worldwide soon and i'm going to get it i haven't read any of the books but i intend to the show deserves a 10 out of 10 and i hope the books are just as good well that's all i have to say but i still have 2 lines i have to fill up so who do you all think is the coolest character mine is shade and my second favorite is marina
<START> the only good thing about persepolis is the shadows created in the german expressionism style of animation and a hint of history this movie bored me it was about a woman dissatisfied with her culture who tries everything else and then goes back to her roots here she finds great discontentment once again and finally leaves for final to let everyone else in her country figure out the situation and what they will do now that she is not there to support them it comes to no conclusion and leaves us with a feeling that this woman has no loyalties mind you she is torn between cultures and doesn't have enough of a background it seems to figure what is important and real she is listening to ever so many voices and will most likely end up a world citizen of some kind than one with any ties to her native culture of iran the only thing i received from this movie was angst
