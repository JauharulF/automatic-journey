<START> this movie actually almost made me cry br br for starters the fake teeth then you spot a nice plastic or drawn set to make it even more boring all the action is followed by a bright light flash then the talking sound levels are so different sometimes too hard then too soft never exactly good like in good movies also it echoes so much that i think they had one microphone on the entire set and to make matters worse ever heard of stereo if the camera switches the sound always stays centered the actors talk like they are reading from a board staged behind the camera and the zooming into another scene how terrible childish br br the music is so badly chosen that it never adds something it only destroys any accidentally created excitement br br to finish it up the fighting scenes my 3 year old niece would make a better fighting scene br br this movie is not even good for a laugh it's just that bad
<START> i give this film 8 10 overall visually a great deal of it is nothing short of stunning an art director's dream mix of bosch salvador dali frieda and georgia o'keeffe and a valid testament to the power of film as a serious art form beautiful use of color form imagery environment and fabulous set decoration combine with state of the art computer graphics so 10 10 for that wow br br the plot line is well more predictable you know they'll save the girl and get the killer in the end but the story is still interesting and pacy enough to pull you in and keep you there 6 10 for that br br squirm factor i won't give this a rating but the film certainly made me squirm and i was watching it on video on a tv screen it would of course have a great deal more impact on a big screen graphic violence of a twisted erotic nature in a surreal landscape even if beautiful is highly unpredictable the world inside the killer's head is not thank goodness my world because i watched this film on video i was able to replay a couple of sequences and found much to admire the second time around when i wasn't so nervous about where the scene might be going and i suspect the whole film would be worth seeing a second time just for the visual art br br general suggestion don't take the kids or conservative grandparents to this one but if you're keen on the visual look of films like surrealist art don't mind a bit of kinky gore and just want to take a bit of a mind trip this one's a winner oh and if you're keen on babes jennifer lopez is pretty hot br br
<START> family guy when the show first aired it was fresh original and actually quite funny now i have stopped watching it it has become one of the worst shows on television combining unfunny jokes repetitive drawn out jokes and the hope that each joke can become funny with the inclusion of the word bitch seth clearly has issues with himself and he is obviously pandering to the 13 year old boys audience br br i just don't understand how something that started out so funny so different from everything else can devolve into this horrible mess of a comedy show i seriously have heard better one liners from a comic br br it truly is sad to see great shows fail and watch drivel like this continue on either seth has stopped trying or he believes that this show is hilarious the way it is br br either way god help us br br i hate this show and will dance an irish jig when its finally cancelled
<START> i'm so glad i only got this movie for 5 anime is expensive no doubt about that i've had my eye on this one for awhile and finally i saw it on sale i grabbed it immediately and took it home only to hang my head in disappointment this movie sucked i've heard people talk about how gory and violent this movie is it's really not that gory or violent i've watched it three times and i think i've wasted enough of my life on this the demons get a point for being unique and kinda cool at times the sex gets a point since it's almost non stop the horny old man gets half a point for being horny and still having the sex drive and the main character who's name i've erased from my mind gets half a point for the cool design of his gun i saw major connections between this movie and demon city shinjuku both have same style animation that's obvious because of the director both have lame soundtracks which suck like the antichrist and both have terrible endings avoid this movie unless you're into anime sex
<START> i watched this movie by accident on tv and it was so unbelievably awful i could not switch it off every single piece of wit and intelligence has been removed from the oscar wilde story by the inept screenplay writer it barely matters because the dire acting clichÃ©d camera work and cloying music would have ruined anything resembling like a decent script anyway the worst performance comes from patrick stewart who comes across as the most hammy talentless minor mock shakespearean as the ghost get thee out of here he screams at one stage while waving his arms like a pantomime villain a truly terrible film and why wonders why stewart who can act when called upon to do so has soiled his reputation by making worthless pieces of crap like this and the xmen
<START> i believe the reason this movie did not get the recognition it deserves is because of the many misconceptions of darwin pro and con i would say the real man is depicted here without sterility he is what he is although the movie is but a snapshot of the man the technique of storytelling expanded his life far beyond the years touched on in the movie this is deep movie a pondering of modern life and the way we think and can provoke a study into the man whose thoughts and other who used him have certainly affected our lives there are some movies that the historical context is so great that it is the primary job of the actors to stay out of the way the history carried the day and the actors did their job good work to them i say
<START> bad bad and did i mention bad aside from the comical monster terrorizing the workers the funniest part of the movie was when are in the desert and one comments that they have an hour of daylight left but you can clearly see by their shadows and the bright sky that it's probably only 2 or 2 30 in the afternoon talk about consistency read the script director br br the only cool part of this movie besides the rack on clara bryant of course as another reviewer mentioned is the phantom skeleton horse that the bone eater rides on that thing was pretty cool as it chased the on their motorcycles
<START> this movie had so much potential to be hilarious yet moving but fell way short of either it had a great story line it just was not executed as good as it could have been the weird hallucinations during his sleep scenes made absolutely no sense and definitely was not needed they made no impact nor did they enhance or lend any understanding of what was to come or happen br br jon heder's character was ok but could have been expanded upon more he played the crappy part he was given at his best the character was funny but again it fell short of what could have been br br character was perfect and her performance was spot on br br in closing the writing was horrible and more often than not made no sense and his hallucinations did not fit with the movie at all this movie with better scripting and directing could have been a contender to national lampoon's vacation as far as funny bad things happening to a person on a trip across america br br instead it was only worthy of a second flush if i would have seen this at the theater i would have demanded my money back and the film br br the only thing that this film did was waste an hour and a half of my life it also managed to make all those involved in the movie look bad simply because the movie was a stinker br br i do not recommend this movie to anyone ever
<START> i found the first bit of stop motion animation intriguing and the mostly live action short with the girl going about in whatever country it was kept my interest but the other 11 odd shorts really didn't pique my interest or make me think of anything at all the music and 8mm footage all seemed to be so random that it all just seemed random i would not recommend this to any one unless you get to see it free br br as for the music being so in step that didn't come across either i rented the dvd because i thought it was all stop motion animation or mixed with live action and only the first short was the second had a little stop motion mixed with mostly live action there was paper cut out stuff in one and the rest was outdoor shots from an 8mm camera with the music bed just didn't have any meaning to it i could see
<START> i first saw this masterpiece on vhs 10 years ago and the powerful interpretation on angry kid painfully against established society it carried stayed in my heart since then director hector is such a good humanity who finds a delicate angle to tell the story of how kills the childhood of the kids from poverty class even the outcast kids have their innocent beautiful dreams but the corrupt reality never gives a chance br br thanks to the publishers for the recent dvd release i now can keep this great movie to my favorite collection
<START> chen kaige lost his sense of tempo i envy europeans and americans who can watch the film without following the dialog with their ears because it is painful to do slow unnaturally heavy and over deliberate but westerners on the other hand suffer from the poor quality of subtitle translation which manages to lose all the subtlety and double meanings that make a careful study of the film so much fun
<START> a great film in its genre the direction acting most especially the casting of the film makes it even more powerful a must see
<START> the argentinian music poet once said that some folk music repeats similarly at any country of the world they look the same but everybody consider them as their own folk music br br this film as i feel it is about the same music that repeats all over the world at some time of each country's history first a few listen it playing and try to make the others hear it then some believe that they hear it but they don't then nobody says anything and some people appear to listen to it and others recognize that they have heard it but didn't think that others might be hearing it finally everybody listen to the same music and suddenly it doesn't sound any more br br love and poetry as a real nationalism and the legacy of a father to his children br br why would he call the film the dead when nobody dies the spanish translation of the title refused to follow the same rule and we call it dubliners following james joyce's title br br a nice 1900 irish filmed postcard
<START> this has to be one of the biggest misfires ever the script was nice and could have ended a lot better the actors should have played better and maybe then i would have given this movie a slightly better grade maybe hollywood should remake this movie with some little better actors and better director sorry guys for disappointment but the movie is bad br br if i had to re watch it it would be like torture i don't want to spoil everyone's opinion with mine so my advice is watch the movie first see if u like it and after vote do not vote before you watch it and by the way have fun watching it don't just peek watch it 'till the end
<START> kon ichikawa had lived through world war two and saw what its effects it had on his people in japan but so did novelist shohei whose book was the inspiration for film fires on the plain it's a film about the men in this war or perhaps more universally in wars in general who lose their humanity the soldiers trudging along through these fields and jungles of the in this story are almost completely without hope if not already just that it makes stone's platoon look like a picnic at least they had certain things like food after all br br they have little to no reserves or supplies or ammunition no back up no sense of anything going their way in this combat that they've been thrust into they can't even get some proper hospital care unless if they can no longer walk at all or have lost limbs for example say if you have tb you're on your way but its really through the prism of one soldier a private tamura that we get a full sense of the futility of war both in its bleak scenes of nothingness and boredom and decay and those flashes of intense and brutal violence br br in the film tamura just wants to get some medical care this is right at the start and his told by his superior officer already he is with eyes that stare off and an expression that has been drained by years of battle that he will die if he doesn't find a hospital he doesn't really but does end up in with some soldiers at first with a platoon that seems to sort of have their act together but is really led on by a power hungry brute who just wants stash of salt and then later with two other stray soldiers who are part of a group that had previously been ambushed while crossing a road at night br br the story isn't entirely a straight line but it doesn't need to be path in fires on the plain is told in vignettes little stories like when he comes upon a seemingly deserted enemy village two of the populous comes back to get some supplies and tamura sneaks up on them it's an excruciating scene since so far with tamura we haven't seen him do anything outright wrong but he does so in this scene not even so much out of evil but out of fear and desperation this is also without spoiling it how he gets a stash of salt little scenes build up so brilliantly and with devastation like a simple task of finding a pair of shoes which there seem to be none or when tamura later in the film discovers his teeth are becoming torn apart and falling out from lack of total hygiene so much for food so it goes br br it should also be mentioned that this is a hauntingly realized film from ichikawa shot in a stark black and white view of the fields and woods the cinematography filling everything we see in black blacks and white hot white ichikawa also makes sure to get everything authentic from his actors not simply emotionally but with their own emaciated look and looks of desperation right on them it's as if ichikawa has to have them all surviving the film as well as characters surviving out in the wild by wild by the way i mean also cannibalism the shock of this is two fold first is the way that a soldier says half jokingly early on about eating other soldiers to who asks if it was true and only in response getting a don't ask word of caution and the second with the depiction of cannibalism itself from the crazy starving man on the hill who pulls out guts out of his lap and says with a straight face to our hero that you can eat me when i die br br this makes thing especially more brutal when it comes to the director filming the brief 'action' scenes these are i would argue more brutal than 'private ryan' in their depictions of violence in battle the carnage that is completely random a scene i would point to and that contains just a shot that is excruciating to watch is when from a high angle we see a group of about twenty soldiers walking slowly along a hail of gunfire comes that kills only four or five but it just happens so fast and the soldiers just keep walking along at the same crawl this isn't the only shot of horrible carnage that's shown when needing to be bloody its there but splashed across the screen like something completely of the macabre but it drives the point completely br br all of the acting is staggering especially who looks to be both most at peace and most horrified by what he sees in the of looks most of the time all of the major set pieces provide something else to the gruesome experience and it all amounts to the ultimate question with an anti war film how can or why do people fight in wars like these it's almost too depressing to put into words and so ichikawa pushes our noses right up into the muck and filth and blood and demands for us to take it in so maybe some day it will never happen again or one can hope this by the end of such a bleak and great film as this
