<START> george carlin is probably my favorite comedian i have seen so many of his specials and even had the opportunity to see him perform live he had a certain cynicism that always appealed to me his last 2 specials life is worth losing especially and complaints and grievances have lacked a certain spirit and content george appeared overweight old and tired not to mention coming out of rehab i said not to mention it anyway life is worth losing was especially tragic as he was overweight disgruntled coming off of rehab there we go again and extremely unfunny if there was a way to feel sorry for a comedian without heckling him off stage george achieved it with life is worth losing it is as if the new millennium and post 9 11 america was trampling george's spirit the bs had become too large to manage br br the comeback is partially successful with it's bad for ya this special is the transmutation completed george is no longer trying to rekindle his glory days he is in full acceptance of his age being old and dealing with the looming prospects of death he has accepted being a crusty old sob and is relishing in it this is better than his previous specials yet far from jammin' in new york it is a little tragic his observations are not cutting edge anymore and seem more andy rooney than lenny bruce george isn't george anymore he is no longer criticizing us but is the man in the high castle pointing out how things were and how dissimilar modern life is br br this is an improvement over the previous two specials but george does not as of yet recoup his old glory if ever he has been reduced from critical social and political stinging commentary to mostly personal peeves when he goes political he still has something to say it is heavily derived especially if you have seen any of his previous work but it still works somehow as opposed to his random rantings which lack a certain relevance outside of the baby boom generation the last 25 minutes is the best this special has to offer br br for now i will worship the sun and pray to joe pesci that george can recreate himself as a cutting edge septuagenarian it's a 50 50 chance life seems to have become more tedious for george and his art is now his life this is a step in the right direction from his previous 2 specials but is far from his old self where does he go from here he may never recoup but maybe he can further metamorphosing refine this new ornery old man routine heres to hoping for 7 more words you can't say on tv or at least a windmill he can handle
<START> lame lame lame shall i go on there is one i repeat one funny scene in this entire drawn out anti amusing amateur hour special of a film fares fat father knocking someone over with his beer gut that's it the rest of this shockingly mediocre pile of nothingness consists of the usual trademark bored looking swedish actors delivering dialogue which goes into one ear and out of the other a banal story sloppy direction and well little else worth mentioning cast fares fares is as charismatic as a accountant and his nose rivals even that of adrien brody in terms of sheer ridiculous petersson should only work with lasse spang olsen the rest of the cast is luckily easily forgettable whereas humongous titanic nose will forever haunt me in my dreams br br josef fares helps ruin swedish cinema don't support him and his nonsense is to comedies what arnold schwarzenegger is to character acting would have been much more respectable if it had been a no budget youtube video and was simply the most pretentious pseudo touching garbage ever unleashed by a swedish director wake up and smell the roses swedish movies can be so much better than this so stop pretending flicks are worth watching simply because they're good to be swedish please
<START> one of those movies in which there are no big twists whatsoever and you can predict pretty much whats is going to happen matt dillon was awesome once again but the rest didn't played a bigger part as they should have br br it was exciting in the beginning but kinda slow paced and predictable in the end its one of those flicks in which the good guy wins no matter happens if you have absolutely nothing to do you can give it a try i personally found it not worth watching the story could have been more interesting and the director could have made it less of a b movie by engineering a happy ending
<START> if i guess your will you let me go through asks william a tim robbins that keeps on acting like if they told him a fantastic joke and he is attempting not to laugh br br he is trying to get to a forbidden area the woman stopping him continues blabbering your is carrefour br br how did you know the lady asks surprised he answers in the name of wisdom i was hearing when you weren't talking br br yes this defines the movie this precisely it doesn't matter if carrefour is road conjunction in french or if the future is coldly bureaucratic and mixes languages or if samantha morton has nothing nothing of spanish maria gonzalez being her name in the film with her irish scotish whatever tone br br it's boring and dull if you fall in believing there are multiple symbolisms you will buy the most bizarre sickening love relationship ever set in a future that may well be in seven seconds i can guess this movie's it will be painful
<START> days of heaven is one of the most painfully boring and pointless films i have ever seen in no way shape or form would i recommend it to anyone unless you're trying to put your kids to sleep or god forbid give someone an aneurysm if i could go back in time and do one thing i would set fire to the reels before they were sent to theaters why days of heaven's plot is simple but extremely vague long sequences devoid of dialogue compose much of the film the characters are too shallow and ridiculously stupid to relate with the climax of the story does not touch you by this time your brain has worked so hard to figure out the plot and the array of hidden metaphors that your ability to think is gone the only things working are your eyes and unfortunately your ears who must listen to the sound of linda the little girl in the story who talks like a man i am now dumber for seeing this movie don't let it happen to you
<START> why would anyone make a film like this why would anybody invest in a film like this why would anybody in the film business work on a film like this why would any theatre show a film like this why would any tv channel program a film like this why would any critic bother to review a film like this why would anybody watch a film like this why would mental examinations not be made of the writers producers directors of a film like this sometimes there are movies that are so bad they're good this is a movie that is so ghastly that it's horrible imdb really must institute a 0 or even a minus scale to embrace works of this appallingly pretentious awfulness
<START> i have to say that i know the documentaries of mister and so i knew that i will get a very well made piece of movie documentary i was not disappointed as a history nerd i did saw hundreds of documentary and liked the different approach of this work br br the director and his 17 consultants historians veteran families tried to access the reality of the gallipoli through the letters of solders from both sides so the history is followed by british australian and turkish soldiers br br narrated is this docu by jeremy irons and sam neill both boost the intensity and emotionality of this documentary by their great voices br br i saw this film in a cinema in italy in dolby surround i did buy the dvd last year and will wait again 3 7 years for the next work of this talented director and his very good documentaries br br summary well made intense history with emotions wrapped in a war documentary with great narrators
<START> br br since cats have nine lives i'll give you nine reasons to see this movie br br the kittens and toulouse playing the piano together so unbelievably cute the car chasing dogs napoleon and lafayette toulouse jumping like electrified every time he wants to be like a tough alley cat marie sighing romantically while alley cat seduces her mom scat cat and his jazz band singing wants to be a cat stupid but proper and nice english geese amelia and abigail who make the cats walk like geese obtaining the magic carpet which puts the cheshire cat to shame the brave journey to ask help from alley cats edgar the butler chase scenes and transition from a nice guy to an insane cat hater due to cat riddance plan gone bad
<START> from the first 10 seconds of pitch black i was hooked i had walked into this movie thinking that it would be just another cheesy sci fi movie instead i found a highly entertaining on the edge of your seat thought provoking action film the movie goes beyond your basic special effects flick the actors are amazing mitchell high art love and other as fry is truly a joy to watch on screen while vin diesel as is so captivating that you are dying just to hear him speak again br br the look of the movie is breath taking the contrast of blues yellows and oranges due to the three different suns is amazing followed by the complete darkness of nightfall i would truly recommend any lover of the alien movies or radha mitchell which is why i went to see it to check out this film i'm sure by the end you'll look at the dark in a whole new way
<START> that this film has such a low imdb rating is not surprising in our post enron era do we really need any more reminders of america's obsession with the greed creed the topic has become so politically charged that a lot of viewers not only are not going to be entertained by movies of this sort but will respond with barely concealed rage it was all i could do to sit quietly through this cinematic memo of corporate corruption without extracting the dvd and smashing it into a thousand pieces br br what's really irksome with these kinds of films including purpose is their pretense that behind the glitter there's some meaningful message that makes the film worthwhile in purpose i found no such meaningful message what i did find was a story that idolized the materialistic trappings of capitalistic power and wealth the two main characters nauseating in their do very little actual work instead they party they play golf they strut their coolness they sound hip with dialogue straight out of mtv culture speak rock my world and now get back to partying that's an order john is smug self important shallow and smirks a lot robert who wears funky little glasses is even worse br br the film includes two youthful garage geeks who look and sound like they're right out of the film antitrust 2001 stereotypes are played for all they're worth and in this film also include chic looking computer equipment and barbie doll chicks on hand for those occasions when our can do future billionaires need some relaxation after all that heavy duty partying and with the time bound images and dialogue that such a story necessitates can you imagine how dated this film will be in fifteen years br br about the best i can do for this waste of cinematic celluloid is to say that it does have some nice aerial views of san francisco the film would have been a lot more enjoyable a lot more entertaining if they had ditched those odious characters and that repulsive story and simply flown us viewers around in that little plane for the film's duration
<START> robert altman nicolas roeg john luc goddard you were expecting a fun film the entire family could enjoy these and other directors were obviously chosen because they have not followed the mainstream but created it for those that complain that they did not adhere to the original story of the opera how often does the music in a film directly relate to what is going on in the film it is the mood that counts this is what i believe the directors of these movies were doing creating a contemporary mood for old operas for the most part they succeed wonderfully with all these operas who is going to like them all we could have used more beverly br br finally what is art even opera without a few naked women
<START> iron eagle may not be the most believable film plot wise but the characters are well written and very well acted if you cannot believe the characters the film is a flop br br i believe the photography especially the aerial photography is superb i believe it is far superior to top gun to which it is endlessly compared it is one of the best pieces of aerial photography i have seen the soundtrack by basil forgive the spelling is great and juxtaposes well with the rock tunes i wish that portion of the soundtrack were available br br jason does well as the teenager who suddenly has to grow up in a rush and and the realities of life death and responsibilities lou gossett is fab as chappy both hard bitten and yet human as he recalls pilot deaths br br there are lots of movies out there that you watch once and don't care to watch again then there are those movies that get you for one aspect or another and you can watch it again and again iron eagle is that kind of movie
<START> this movie came as a huge disappointment the anime series ended with a relatively stupid plot twist and the rushed introduction of a pretty lame villain but i expected to tie up all the loose ends unfortunately it didn't it added more plot holes than it resolved and confused more than it clarified the animation and voice acting were great but with an idiotic plot dull setting most of the movie doesn't even take place in dull wwii earth rather than the alchemy world and disappointing ending ed is useless for the rest of his days in a world with no alchemy and he ditches it was altogether pretty lackluster do yourself a favor disregard the last half of the anime as well as this movie and read the manga
<START> a Â£3 50 dvd can be a gamble and this was one that sort of paid off br br a decent saturday night type movie that entertains if you gloss over the obvious plot flaws special effects are a bit few and far between with some repetition and why does london always look as if it's in the 60's br br if it had the budget of say armageddon then i'm sure it would have performed better at the box office as the story is quite a good one br br overall is consigned to b movie history but if you see it for Â£3 50 then it's worth buying
<START> k one day my father picked up a movie with a cover got home with my mom and we were like yay lets watch this new movie we never saw before ok so it started interesting start cool robots and disgusting gore eek on a strange planet actually it was pluto wasn't it blablabla i could tell the whole story but i rather not point wtf never ever pick up a movie with a lame ass name and seriously don't ever i mean ever judge a book by its cover err tape it looked like an interesting movie however it was a slap to the face for sci fi movies its disgusting i mean it was so bad i just started laughing i swear it to be serious i cant describe the stupidity it killed more then a million brain cells of mine i can't even write a descent critique its that bad argh and i wana prepare you for something cough cough mechanical cough cough sorry just had to say it its so funny think of it as a or a parody of sorts for sci fi movies its classic batman laughs but in a new packaging what the hell was this director thinking
