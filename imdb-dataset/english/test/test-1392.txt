<START> i just finished up this unofficial adaptation of h p lovecraft's the lurking fear that was shot in louisiana outside of a few changes names setting this follows the short story point by point for the first 70 minutes but then tries to inject its own twist ending that you could see coming from a mile away either way it is a much better adaptation than full moon's the lurking fear too bad it is a terrible film director david mccormick shoots the thing with all the flair of an industrial short i swear i counted maybe two camera movements the creature design is cheap we're talking store bought masks here but shot in a dark manner intentional or not where they are somewhat creepy the most impressive thing in the picture is the abandoned mansion but mccormick fails to exploit that as well file this one under good adaptation poor execution
<START> michael comic book stories particularly his work on madman usually are a great deal of fun no budget indy film is the opposite of fun br br worst acting ever coupled with truly horrible dialog makes for a brutal cinematic experience pretty certain understands going on but he's the only one daring you to watch the entire mess isn't enough defying you to watch the entire mess is more on target br br is some kind of movie tie in to red rocket 7 comic book which ironically is mostly unreadable so if your experience isn't terrible enough definitely track down the over sized comics and continue the fun br br felt sorry for who was totally out of his depth attempting a film also felt sorry for myself what an incredible waste of my time and money please buy my vhs copy which is available right now on ebay hurry up
<START> mr kennedy should stop experimenting with bad movie scripts what was he thinking this is a movie that should not have passed the hey i've got an idea let's make a sequel stage of inception if there was a zero rating i'd give it but i guess i'll settle for a generous 1 it seems these days that if there is a buck to be made movie execs will dig up an old hit and run it by a set of writers and see what turns up hey i said hit and run kinda describes how i felt when this movie ended how this piece of trash ever saw the light of day is beyond me it is filled with unpleasant humor strange animation and jokes that don't quite take you anywhere besides a state of confusion if you are being dragged to this movie and someone is paying for you fine but its still going to be more painful than a brick in the forehead however if you're planning on paying your own hard earned money search out a better alternative
<START> was a great experience many filmmakers tell their stories to a big extent via dialogue emanuele directs his film very visually driven for everything he wants to tell he finds powerful images that are able to stand for themselves thus he understands film as a medium that primarily tells its stories over the pictures on screen particularly european cinema is often very dialogue driven and many of the young us american directors are strongly influenced by that opposite attitude was really the point that made this film special for me it has also a very interesting topic that is wrapped up in a quite unusual story and told with humour vincenzo amato is outstanding as family head salvatore as well as the amazing charlotte gainsbourg who i enjoy watching in every single one of her movies there are many great sequences in this movie just to pick one when the ship leaves italy and the people just quietly stare this scene is great particularly if you consider the pop cultural references that go with it titanic
<START> publicity got me to the theatre br br advice will take you away from this waist of time br br very bad everything br br do you really want to see a monkey talking with a technological device br br x
<START> a refreshing black comedy starring some of australia's finest in the same way that lock stock and 2 smoking barrels captured the funny side of london gangsters two hands rips through the sydney underworld it wouldn't be so funny if it wasn't so close to the bone br br an australian classic if australia could pull more rabbits like this out its hat it might actually have a film industry worth keeping an eye on
<START> this show was not only great human drama but portrayed racism in this country in a raw all too true to life manner when one show can be so witty and entertaining and yet so poignant and educational all at once this is television in its highest form the acting was phenomenal the writing was exceptional not only did the show portray race relations in a straightforward manner that seems unmatched by any other television series but its ability to depict this subject matter as it existed in the 1960's alongside how it exists in the beginning of the twenty first century powerfully demonstrates the ways we have changed and sadly the many more ways we have not
<START> i liked all the lilo and stitch movies the tv series weren't that great but i put my opinions of the series aside when i watched this movie and i must say it was bad br br one thing i found disappointing was the animation yes you heard it the animation i found its quality greatly degraded since the first movie its quality was only as high as the tv series' something which i did not expect at all if you're looking for eye candy don't expect anything much here also the animation failed to portray any serious moods even in the supposed sad scenes i didn't feel anything for the character another downgrade from the first movie br br the next was the absolutely horrible voice acting i found it very very unconvincing and wondered why disney with all its riches and glory couldn't afford voice actors with real talent the voice actors' skill were just as annoying as the one in the series i tolerated the one in the series because hey who wouldn't be tired out when made to voice act for so many episodes heck i don't even know how many episodes there are theoretically there are but i just can't believe that however i thought that the voice acting would improve in the movie and i was put down in the face by the truth that what they could do in the series was already their best br br next was the horrible script it was cheesy beyond redemption and the writers just try too hard they try to put some jokes in but i just found them annoying maybe it wasn't the voice acting but the cheesy dialogues that ruined the sound section on the upside the soundtrack wasn't too bad and matched the mood quite well br br fourthly was the problem with the storyline i predicted everything and the storyline was what made the characters so unoriginal and unlikeable all of a sudden you have the aliens get new positions and responsibilities space after the initial hype they realize that they actually didn't like it and miss their old life br br meanwhile the evil villain gets broken out of jail after a very 'action action scene and breaks in to lab to steal his experiment the experiment was then cloned into 100 others and the hamster wants to conquer earth when the main characters find out they try to stop the evil hamster but gets confronted in some cheesy final showdown against the experiment and owns him in an extremely lame excuse for trying to make the series to look cool the characters then give up their new privileges and return to earth to resume their life seriously how many other movies has used that ending already the that storyline was extremely short and formulaic so don't expect too much from it br br so disney has failed in sound graphics and storyline the only charm of the series was the original characters and how they managed to retain the 'feel' of the characters but even that wasn't able to save the movie i tried to like it i really did but i give it a rating of 4 10 another disney failure
<START> it's too bad these guys the so called judges are such jerks even the nominally sensitive ones it's the self congratulatory tone that really makes me sick though these guys don't have any perspective on their behaviour i think the real problem though is the quality of the contestants not a single smooth or truly charming one in the lot they pick the most pathetic girls out of the crowd because they're the only ones these guys have a chance with let's see some real players trying for a truly unattainable girl and maybe you have a show otherwise you have a revolting half hour of self love and real sexual tension takes two
<START> i'm sorry but i just honestly cannot see why anyone would actually like this it's stereotypical and real are nothing like they were on this show personally i'm glad it got canceled after the first few episodes i mean this kind of show would certainly be alright if everyone knew that weren't really like this and the whole story was just for the show but unfortunately not everyone is aware of this if anyone out there that watched this actually believed this is what goes on in the life of a then i honestly feel sorry for them this reminds me of the kind of portrayal they have of kids in mean girls it's sad really that people think this way this is complete garbage imho
<START> harlan banks is thief at the top of his game but after a successful career he has decided to settle down with his woman and retire however he decides to take one last routine job in las vegas all he has to do is drive the car and it seems simple unfortunately someone tips the police and after a hectic car chase he winds up in the slam only to escape and take revenge on those who betrayed and got him there in the first place a typical action fest ensues br br steven seagal plays himself surprise wearing a trench coat and sporting his beloved colt 1911 along with his usual bone breaking aikido the colt and aikido have always been with him but the first i recall him with the trench coat is in 'the foreigner ' it isn't particularly impressive but it does add a little notch to seagal's lethal arsenal of or it covers up those extra pounds he is packing look at it however way you choose his main buddy throughout the film is played by another new thing a rapper in an action movie and they both uncover a little conspiracy of bad guys on both sides of the law and give each evil doer his due br br the film's main problem is that is it painfully and i truly mean painfully unoriginal seagal just follows a clockwork plot throughout the movie and even that manages to get more and more dull as the film progresses then it goes from dull to utterly ridiculous in the final scene as people who seemed to be dead on killing each other suddenly for no reason start to talk groan inducing in every sense of the word the only real positive thing here is the decent opening a car chase in las vegas complete with flipping police cars and generally entertaining mayhem but after that brief highlight you've seen it all before 3 10 br br rated r constant violence and profanity
<START> this film is not only the last piece of the three colours trilogy but also the best of the three and one of the best movies of the 90s there's hardly another movie that so wisely and consequently asks for humanity and respect for every human being br br valentine irene jacob lives in geneva where she works as a model though she has a boyfriend she seems to be rather lonely one night she has an accident and injures a dog and who leads her to his owner a retired jugde jean louis trintignant who is cynical and spies his neighbors phone calls disgusted by him she cannot go away and they meet again two lonely souls meet each other and they become friends and develop a deep love for each other br br the story itself is too complex to be told completely there is another connection between them in a young man who represents both the judge and valentines real love and there is more to their relationship than only friendship br br the actors are wonderful irene jacob and jean louis trintignant developing a deep and authentic friendship br br the topics are of an endless validity fraternity not only in contact with each other but also in the respect for the right of privacy alarmingly we seem to loose this right more and more which makes movies like this one even more important than it might have been in 1994 br br red is one of the strongest colours that exists representing inner turmoil love anger and passion used here as another protagonist it brings a unmatched depth to the movie a masterpiece
<START> though short lived the amazing spider man was one of the best made for tv versions of a famed comic book hero only wonder woman lynda carter the best of the genre and the incredible hulk bill bixby lou ferrigno were better br br the amazing spider man outclasses the 1966 1968 batman because the high camp elements of the latter often ruin the adventure spider man outclasses all three television interpretations of superman lois and clark smallville and of course the george reeves superman which brings up the rear br br the amazing spider man was an action drama during the late 1970's the pre cgi era when stunts had to be performed by stunt men not in the database of a computer spider man had its own very talented stuntman to perform the death defying daredevil acrobatics his name was fred waugh who donned the suit for the action sequences nicholas hammond better known as one of julie andrew's children on the all time movie classic the sound of music was spider man during the dialogue scenes hammond's spider man also had his own secret identity as peter parker similar to christopher reeve superman clark kent adam west batman bruce wayne and of course lynda carter as wonder woman diana prince br br it's unfortunate that the series only had thirteen episodes because when the first episode hit the airwaves in november of 1977 the entire country was watching it on cbs that wednesday night in all fairness cbs should release this pilot episode as well as the deadly dust the captive tower etc on dvd shortly spider man was short lived but did have a cult following and in my opinion was a heck of a lot better than the movie interpretation of the famed comic book hero starring toby mcguire br br cbs might be hesitant to release these episodes for two reasons a there might not be a broad market for them based on the lack of longevity of the series and a generation of children and young people who weren't born when the series originally aired in the 1970's b one of the early spider man episodes dealt with a terrorist with designs on the world trade center which was attacked twice many years after this show went off the air in 1993 and of course the devastating attack against this country on 9 11 01 in which the towers were destroyed and many innocent lives were lost br br however i don't think that it would be in bad taste to release this spider man episode even if the show was adventure derived from a comic book and camp in nature the live action amazing spider man doesn't have a large following but it has a cult following if and when cbs releases it out on dvd this cult following could be explained along with the episode in which spiderman saved the towers in 1978 but how in september of 2001 real life proved to be different from the movies i like to follow the news but i also like science fiction fantasy therefore i am eagerly awaiting the release of the amazing spider man on dvd
<START> this movie is overrated to say the least it's not good as a comedy and it's not good as a serious film either the pacing is far too plodding for the former and there is too much lame slapstick for the latter the only laughs come from some of bud spencer's reaction shots when he becomes exasperated by his brother's behavior the dubbing is excellent but the full screen framing is appalling 1 2
<START> when i fist watched the movie i said to myself so a film can be made like this wong kar wai's gorgeous poetic love story captured me throughout and even after the film i must admit this is one of the best love movies maybe the best of all i have ever watched the content and the form overlaps perfectly as watching the secret love we see the characters in bounded frames that limits their movements as well as their feelings beautiful camera angles and the lighting makes the feelings and the blues even touchable i want to congratulate christopher doyle and pin bing lee for their fantastic cinematography which creates the mood for love also the music defines the sadness of the love which plays along the beautiful slow motion frames and shows the characters in despairing moods and of course the performances of the actors which makes the love so real eventually all the elements in the film combined in a perfect way under the direction of wkw and give the audience the feeling called love
