<START> i watched this movie a long time ago but i've always loved it the story is about a young girl sally who finds out at a young age that when she prays to st anne her prayers are answered hence her missing lunch pail and a mean neighbor who on her and she prays that someone should give him a black eye for well a minute later something hits him and he has a black eye sally then believes in the power of prayer and decides to use that power for good she is well known and loved around the neighborhood as she has journals filled with all her friends requests to st anne br br meanwhile a local boy returns home from college i believe and sally is awestruck at how much he's grown up sally has a huge crush on him but is so shy should she use her power of prayer to st anne for her own selfish desire or just watch as the most popular girls in school try to snare the man of her dreams this is a fun filled movie with a grandfather who is so charming and irish brother's who are hilariously annoying and a sworn irish neighbor enemy who spars with grand pop on an everyday basis he has his own story of wanting to buy the property which is a little house in the middle of two huge apartment complexes his own in other words the house is an eye sore to his lovely buildings br br this movie is definitely worth a watch and is good enough and rare enough to add to your movie collection i hope you enjoy
<START> i think my summary says it all this mtv ish answer to the classic candid camera tv show features a gen x or is that gen y type putting in false choppers and wearing various hats and wigs and glasses and setting people up in fairly outlandish although often not very interesting situations example kennedy has a guy invite his parents to his wedding kennedy is the bride done up in a full bridal gown and long wig the joke is that the parents immediately understand their son is marrying a man who claims to no longer have his bits and pieces problem is this schtick goes on way too long obviously to fill out time and kennedy is about as funny as a dead cod lying in the sun candid camera would have run three or four scenarios in the time it took kennedy to get through this one running around constantly asking do i look fat i recognize the show was not made for me it was made for 12 year old pinheads who think jackass is the height of comedy today so let them laugh thank god the show was short lived

<START> i enjoyed this film very much it effectively combines humor fantasy and a few moments of horror with a solid film making effort from brilliant visuals and a very original story concerning spirals my only complaints are that it had its dull moments and wasn't as daring as it could have been still i give this a solid 8 out of 10 the u s should take note of this and other fine japanese horror fantasy films that have come along recently and have them available on region 1 dvd actually asian cinema in general have some of the finest films that have been unnoticed by the american public because they're hard to find i strongly recommend people to go look for these treasures they're hard to find but once you find them you'll be glad you did
<START> week after week these women just sweep all the men of their feet get real none of these women are knockouts carrie sarah jessica parker looks like the type of woman men would pick up at 45am before the bar closed after their vision and standards were equally impaired by ten or eleven martinis yet she's the queen bee a super sexy man killer the other three don't fare much better and their constant foul mouthed comments not to mention that they jump in and out of bed with strange men and never catch a disease this show is pathetic and creepy i don't think any man would be terribly attracted to any of these women even if he popped viagra like tic while on shore leave
<START> improvisation was used to a groundbreaking degree in this film but it only functions as a novelty no greater truth about the situation is got by asking the actors to improvise the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether they're delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good so that's why the performances in many robert altman films are often really because the actors aren't really confident saying lines which they've made up and therefore aren't sure are any good br br and quite honestly often its not very good often the dialogue doesn't really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings br br it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly br br nevertheless a fascinating raw piece of film and commendable 100 for taking the power over the green light into the street br br there are some generally great things in it this joke for example br br i'm a dancer what sort of a dancer like a ballet dancer oh no exotic br br and the whole party scene its in the following trip to the park and the scene where the boys go looking at statues br br 2 5 i wouldn't say they're worth 2 hours of your time though
<START> i can't say this show is perfect perhaps all the previous commenters remember the old tuesday 10 30 slot taken up by the childish humour of butch elvira curt there's a space shuttle humping a 747 oh the glory of scrambling to hit any button on the remote to make it change br br face it comedy can't pull a showcase and create the comedic genius of the truly canadian trailer park boys but hey they try br br this show is by far one of the better original shows however none of the following will find themselves laughing at the apparent players who showcase their stupidity in picking up girls br br a dumb girls obviously they can't realise that they are just like the girls on the show oblivious jump on the man meat you can call yourself a whore tomorrow and get his name he looks good he must be popular and nice hahahaha oh but you'd never do that nobody would if they knew it was happening br br b guys who think women like nice guys obviously seeing these guys succeed at what you fail at or don't even get to experience is going to make your primal rages boil watch more closely they get shot down most of the time they say stupid crap br br c girls with respect for one another obviously seeing your separate distinctly female species get caught up in real world situations is wrong wrong wrong nobody gets played women are not objects they can't be played because they are all very faithful angels who are going to clubs to converse politely with one another without fear of guys trying to pick them up br br oh wait hmmmmmmmm br br as much as everybody will say that this show is not funny and that it doesn't teach you anything i have to take the opposite side the show is very good at detailing the way relationships work for both men and women the way they think and the way they think each other think and social hierarchy its funny to see and hear the guys make absolutely idiotic comments to things the women say my grandfather died recently oh well are we having fun tonight br br besides its a club the place people go to have fun and get laid no matter who you are you're going to a club to get or give attention to someone guys go there to test their game and pick up girls girls go there to flirt with guys and find the one that sweeps her off her feet the best lighten up br br if you're a guy learn a thing or two about different approaches and the different effects they have if you're a girl learn what these studly man whores really think like and learn to tell them apart from genuine guys next time you get broken up with by one of those realise its not because of him its because you're dumb and thought he was the greatest guy ever when he was quite clearly a dick to you the whole time
<START> first of all i believe that this movie is much more appreciated by viewers who have actually read joseph conrad's heart of darkness the book that was the literary basis for the movie with that said i believe that this movie is astounding it is an excellent war film that doesn't so much concentrate on the gore and brutality of the vietnam conflict but more the psychological toll that it took on the young inexperienced kids who were sent to fight it coppola showed real genius in the art of film making using many visuals to help tell the story the acting i felt was definitely all around up to par marlon brando's part in the movie is what really got me as far as acting his elucidation to willard at the end of the film reels you in and reveals the hollowness of a man that you've heard about and wanted to see throughout the movie those who would consider this just another war movie need to give a detailed look to all the literary elements that are entwined with this film because there is a great amount of meaning behind it all in my opinion this is one of the most sculptured and best made films of all time
<START> a fine line up of actors and a seemingly nice plot though not original promised me a nice evening in front of the tv i was disappointed the actors delivered up to standard juliette lewis cuddly as ever william hurt solid but in the background shelley duvall convincing as ever but the story was too thin to keep me engaged to the story and the twist to the finale was too obvious and too late there was only one character who was nice to he girl so guess what then the final after twistÂ i do not know what to think of that the boyfriend and the neighbor contract with the devil or just to get her to move in what the film had a nice idea behind it but the idea was not worked out in detail it could have been good but it was not too many loose ends to tie up columbo would say
<START> the quintessential housewife and perfect mother donna reed as donna stone could do it all settle spats between the children or neighbors take care of her hard working pipe smoking pediatrician husband alex and still have a stack of pancakes three types of breakfast meat and a tall glass of milk and oj ready for the kids every morning before breakfast br br over the course of the past fifty years we've lost sight of the idealistic stay at home mom family meals together at the kitchen table and preparing dinner for a hard working husband when he comes home from work br br i wish the show were available on dvd i'd discontinue my cable altogether
<START> this is a perfect example of why many people say the 90's sucked when it comes to horror movies a boring voodoo on campus tale of terror starring the once so promising corey feldman stand by me the lost boys etc there might be just enough stuff happening to keep you from falling asleep and it doesn't look too cheap but this still is horror aimed at an audience that were in their very early teens during the 90's i might have been part of that audience but still i got as good as nothing out of it when watching it now and nowadays teens are used to a lot more and better already and i can't imagine any of them knowing or caring about who corey feldman was or is actually as the dude's still making films but the only thing still linking him to his days of glory is the lost boys 2 the tribe sequel that got made recently and i imagine even that one isn't going to encourage anyone to seek out voodoo just another movie that got lost in 90's horror for obvious reasons
<START> catherine zeta jones and aaron star in a romantic drama about an uptight chef played by zeta jones who ends up carrying for her niece when her sister is killed in a car crash while she's out taking care of family matters she's replaced by br br unfunny maudlin tale with no chemistry between the leads she's a dead fish and he's okay but not much of anything watching this i was wondering why anyone would want to see this since zeta jones' character is so unlikable come on she's so obsessed with cooking and being the best all she does is cook for her therapist or talk about food ugh i won't use any of the numerous puns that come to mind i couldn't finish it
<START> first off if you want to make a good film don't cram all your exposition into the last 10 minutes the viewer is expected to be bewildered for nearly two hours only to have father explain everything to alex very late in the film to make matters worse the scriptwriter decided it wasn't enough to have the basic mystery solved but adds in a completely unnecessary murder that we knew nothing about involving alex's father br br there's some serious motivation issues with characters also father's choices don't seem to make sense once the film is over why didn't he just kill philippe's father and be done with it instead a complicated plot to obscure the truth is concocted but one which ensures that everyone will be in physical jeopardy for years including the completely innocent photographer who gets murdered by philippe's father's thugs although alex is a doctor whom one would think is relatively bright he chooses to flee the police during which he not only his own life but those whom he involves in a nasty pile up on the freeway why was friend so keen on keeping her promise to margo once all the crap hits the fan for alex and are we to think that father would rather kill himself rather than go to prison what about his wife did he consider her wishes those are some of the main problems br br then there are some nasty details like why was her father there the night of her faked death how did he get a hold of the body on such short notice and get it back quickly in order to bury it with the other two alex's friend bruno seems over eager to be part of the mayhem in which he and his friends have to kill for alex notwithstanding the perceived debt he owes alex for saving his son's life what good would the photos of margo do they don't implicate philippe at all and why would margo have the safety deposit box key handy that night for her would be abductors to take did i miss some other things probably minor irritations of mine include the fact that although alex is a doctor he smokes like a fiend which makes his marathon run away from the police even that more impressive also when he is riding in the convertible with his lawyer neither of them is wearing a seat belt how bright could they be
