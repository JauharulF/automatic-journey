<START> i was recently at a sleepover birthday party with five other girls all my age eleven all of us thinking it would be some harmless little movie such as jaws decided to rent it along with rat race we watched rat race after when a stranger calls as to ease our fear we put the movie on at 11 00 at night and lay together in our sleeping bags hiding behind covers for most of it i screamed five times which is unusual for me as i get scared in movies but never scared enough to actually scream br br all of us were terrified to even leave the bedroom as we were all positive the stalker jenkins as we called him for some reason would get us i played a mean trick one everyone was all dozing off once rat race was over i hid under my sleeping bag and said quietly and lowly have you checked the childen they all screamed like nuts and were so scared all in all i would rate this movie a 9 the only thing i didn't like was that 1 there were too many false alarms when jill thinks the stalker is there and 2 the kids never woke up during the whole thing until jenkins kidnapped them and hid them in the cupboard at which time all they did was cry like babies i would highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes thriller but one thing i am so not babysitting past 9 00 pm ever
<START> garbo's first spoken words in this 1930 film electrified audiences and became part of hollywood legend garbo had become a star in her first american film the torrent in 1926 and audiences waited til this film to see if garbo could make the transition to talkies she did and while vilma and renee adoree fell by the wayside because of their accents garbo sailed on for another decade despite the staginess of this film garbo is really excellent especially in the opening scene with the equally great marie dressler as marthy the two great stars trade dirty looks and sharp words as they size each other up while they have a few drinks and set the tone for the remainder of the film garbo was 25 dressler was 60 charles bickford is ok as matt and george f marion is good as old chris marion originated this role on broadway in 1922 and also played it in the 1923 silent version with blanche sweet this eugene o'neill play is a true classic yet oddly was never filmed again anna christie ranks as one of garbo's greatest performances and despite the staginess of the film and the grimness of the story she is truly a marvel see this one for garbo and dressler
<START> guys what can i tell you i'm bulgarian i can't remember how many times i talk to americans and let alone that they don't have a slightest clue where is bulgaria but they say things like there's a war going on there right or i've never imagined that in a place like bulgaria people have internet go watch bruce campbell's the man with the screaming brain i was curious about this movie cause 1 i'm bruce campbell fan evil dead trilogy and the adventures of brisco county jr 2 the movie was shot entirely on location in bulgaria the second after alien apocalypse which is also nearly unwatchable 3 i enjoy nice b movies br br well the movie presents our country like a never ending gypsy town where they raid your car wave around illegal guns and you can get killed any moment and bruce's line bull bulgaria is more than offending br br ted raimi and stacy make a great team bruce does his special beats himself up and that's all nothing more to see here br br give this movie 10 just because of bruce's cult status but it doesn't deserve more than 3 waste of film
<START> worst horror film ever but funniest film ever rolled in one you have got to see this film it is so cheap it is but you have to see it really p s watch the carrot
<START> it has taken several viewings for me to fully appreciate this film initially i was struck by the stylized sets but found the rest slow going and dull i thought that such a sensational subject needed the ken russell treatment to take it way over the top i now find the enforced restraint placed on the production by widow to be an asset some of the more lurid aspects of life are reiterated and dramatized by corresponding themes from his novels i think it helps to be familiar with the novels that's what finally made the difference for me still feel the film overall could be a little tighter and warmer but it's genuinely unique and deserves serious attention love the fact that the japanese characters speak japanese not english the philip glass score is mesmerizing
<START> i walked into heart of gold thinking i was going to watch a documentary about neil young instead i witnessed a self serving tribute to the arrogance of aging baby boomers who have lost their edge and forgotten their roots highly rated by aging baby boomer critics directed and performed by more aging baby boomer artists heart of gold is a bore fest from start to finish that is if you can manage to sit through the entire near 2 hour movie neil young and crew have long lost their edge and want the rest of us to join them on a rocking chair of middle of the road mediocrity what happened to the raunchy guitar of his earlier solo efforts i guess all of his fuzz boxes rusted out and his over driven vacuum tubes exploded in the hot air of his generation as far as demme goes this is the daring director of something wild melvin and howard a student filmmaker could have made a more daring film than this poorly visualized surface performance film don't waste your on heart of gold and go straight to the last waltz and shelter and if you really want to dig deep into the personality of a rock and roll icon scrounge up a copy of chuck berry hail hail rock and roll which is sorely out of print and baby boomers don't bother squawking about how this review is jaded by someone younger i too am one of those baby boomers who listened to cinnamon girl on acid and danced in the streets to the stones' street fighting man go back and watch don't look back or shelter and then come back and tell me that heart of gold has any worth as a document
<START> just got around to seeing monster man yesterday it had been a long wait and after lots of anticipation and build up i'm glad to say that it came through and met my expectations on every level true you really can't expect too much from hearing the plot rundown but after reading some of the reviews for it i was ecstatic i mean what trash fan wouldn't want to see a gore flick about a deranged inbred hick mowing people down with his make shift monster truck i went in expecting a cross between road trip and the hills have eyes and got so much more this was a horror comedy that actually worked the film makers got it right when it came to making you squirm and making you howl with laughter at the same time kudos to michael davis for going all out with the gore and pushing the envelope with the humor let me list just a few reasons why i love this movie so much first off is the story it's been done to death in so many other flicks a college guy gets wind that his childhood crush is getting married he being the 25 year old virgin that he is hops in his vista cruiser and decides to take the road trip to confess his love hoping that she will fall head over hills and all that good jive hidden in the backseat of his station wagon is good buddy harley harley is the loudmouth former friend who laughs and talks just like jack black in high fidelity you can't help but like the guy but if he was your friend in real life you'd have to keep a ball bat handy laugh all you want but have you ever been hit with one to keep him in check so he's a little on the obnoxious side to say the least but you can tell that he's a loyal friend deep down anyway they're on the road and when they stop in a bar they aggravate the locals now they're being stalked by a leatherface clone in a monster truck that's it yeah along the way they pick up a gorgeous hitchhiker but i'm too lazy and hungover to go into that right now so just watch the damn movie br br second thing i love was the humor this one had some of the sickest laughs of any movie since cabin fever just how messed up is it well i won't even go into the whole cat scene and as for the corpse burrito thing i'll leave that to your virgin eyes as well the bar full of amputees was somewhat disturbing and that guy who looked like john turturro bothered me too harley although a totally obnoxious frat boy type can really sling off the one liners love the by the way i need a new pair br br the gore this one pours it on heavy while the first hour plays out as a demented road comedy the last third is all about blood and guts if the movie hadn't kept such a light tone throughout it would have been a little disturbing but seeing how it was all played for laughs there is no way possible that you will be bothered by it if you're still in your seat by the time it comes you'll probably see the humor in it too but seriously there were buckets and buckets of the red stuff there was a big plot turn that i didn't see coming and when the credits rolled i was completely satisfied i had gotten exactly what i came for and i'm really glad that i bought it much like cabin fever it's going to get a lot of replay br br the look of the movie was outstanding there was this deliberately cheap look that made the whole thing scream late 80s and i loved the exaggerated colors it's obvious that monster man was done on a relatively low budget but much like cabin fever sorry i keep comparing the two it actually works in the movie's favor cabin fever was an ode to the 70s greats this was the 80s answer to that so take that for what it's worth no cgi here this is what we all needed i'm not exactly sure why it didn't get a theatrical release because this is everything that jeepers creepers should have been thank god for lions gate
<START> oz was the first original television show that hbo put onto its channel in the 1 hour forma and it remains to this day the very best the story is simple oz is a surreal look into the lives of high maximum security prisoners at oswald primarily focusing on em city now there are many things to compliment this show on from the writing which in my opinion was the best on television when this show aired directing top notch acting best of the best and the characters this show just literally blew my socks off this show was a critically acclaimed gem until the sopranos bowed after that critics were salivating over that epic tale of trust and family to notice this compelling drama oz to me is a better show than sopranos overall and it's a shame that i never won any major emmy's br br kudos to all who were involved in this magnificent gut wrenching show br br kudos
<START> back in 1994 the power rangers had become a huge franchise and t v executives at the usa network were hoping to get in on the action and came up with the tattooed teenage alien fighters from beverly hills in which the evil emporer who looks like he's wearing a home made darth vader costume and his talking bird that looks like a rubber dog chew toy come to earth to invade it using giant monsters that look like rejects from a 1970's godzilla film fortunately an alien that looks like a giant piece of clear jello recruits four teenagers to defend the earth gives them each a tattoo of a different star constellation that allows them to transform into buffed up superheros who look like dancers from an eighties tech no music video they could also combined into a giant knight forty episodes were made the usa network clearly did not have the money to try to adapt a show from japan like power rangers did and made up this show on their own using the budget of a 1950's scifi film the fights scenes are generic the special effects are poor and some of the sets look like they could fall down the actors pretty much realized how ridiculous the show was and pretty much ham it up and overact i can only imagine their shock when the show was cancel led
<START> i neglected this film when i used to go to the movie store but then the curiosity got to me and i decided to check it out i loved it the movie starts off with judy and jay heading for a halloween party at the abandoned funeral parlor hull house then we meet a few more characters angela and the hosts frannie max rodger sal and helen then of course they start to party and when really in the mood they decide to have a sÃ©ance which awakens a demon the demon possesses angela and she starts her gruesome slaughtering will they survive the night of the demons br br the movie was overall great the gore was fine but the nudity provided by linnea quigley trash from rotld once again screws it i never was a fan of hers and never will be
<START> mario van peebles tries to go the jean claude van damme route and play a renegade robotic soldier who goes awol to preserve himself however the government isn't going to take this lying down so among the simplistic plot van peebles protects villagers from the rebel forces and defeats a improved version of himself in this disappointing film this blatant rip off of universal soldier which is far more fun then this simply goes nowhere the main problem is that the movie is so unbelievably inert van peebles just waits around and there just isn't enough ass kicking to justify a viewing on the other hand the movie does sort of resemble a competent version of r o t o r although where as that abysmal bad movie was hilarious this one only yields occasional laughter in its laughably unconvincing action sequences also like r o t o r it makes no sense in its narrative and basically the movie is awesomely boring plus the villains are disappointingly weak and basically the movie needs an actual action scenario to work because the material is too dull in all regards solo is a very weak film br br 1 2 out of 4 poor
<START> steve smith has finally run a fairly weak series right into the ground with this movie poor actors thrashing a horrible script pretty much sums this one up two hours of your life you'll never get back go get a root canal instead you'll enjoy it more
<START> no matter how many times wile coyote tries to get road runner we always know what's going to happen though our sympathy always remains with the highlight in hook line and stinker is a rube goldberg style scheme that hopes will finally finish off rr but of course you know what happens br br so wile e continues hilarious engaging in fanaticism defined by george as your effort after you've forgotten your aim while road runner pretty much never becomes aware of the potential danger or lack thereof in which he could find himself a real classic br br and yes the middle name is i learned that from jeopardy
<START> well i watch tons of movies and this one really sucked big time i am sure we are all sick and tired of the low budget ploy to make vampire movies using some martial arts teacher turn actor type of movies i am also so tired of the guy knowing some form of fighting technique and then able to fight his way through a somewhat boring movie i forced myself to watch it and one of the main reasons were that the lead actress is quite pretty ha ha well i hope this helped a bit and if you have time and want to give your brain a rest watch it well hopefully one day this type of movies will not be released but then hey where will all the low budget actors go br br the movie also contains many but that i will leave to you to find because it adds quite a bit of fun while watching and also if you a bit of a perfectionist it will bother you cheers
<START> this movie tells about the real life story of ramon who lived for 27 years lying in bed after having broken his neck and fights a battle to get legal permission for someone that can assists with his death br br javier bardem is one of best actors of his generation consider this he has to carry this movie with only his face unbelievable that he didn't even got an oscar nomination now we can all see that the academy is a joke the supporting cast was terrific the optimistic rosa his lawyer julia the rest of the family each and everyone has his her own opinion about the fact that ramon wants to die br br whether your for or against euthanasia put your opinions aside because this movie deserves to be seen by people all over the world half way through the movie i started crying and it didn't stop until the credits rolled this movie is so heartbreaking but also wonderful to watch and i can't wait to see it again i give it a 9 10 and in my opinion it is by far the best film of the year so far
