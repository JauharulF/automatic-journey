<START> goodbye mr chips is a superbly written and photographed musical version of the classic 1939 film aside from peter o'toole's wonderfully controlled understated performance as the pedantic schoolmaster who finds love and is changed by it the film contains hundreds of stunning visuals from ruins to london side streets to an extended countryside montage the music and lyrics by leslie have been criticized as being dull or not up to par for film musicals but they are used to enhance the story rather than tell it many songs are used to underscore montages or scenes the few that don't are relegated to show biz numbers in this manner the songs do not intrude upon this delicate story but heighten what the characters are thinking or feeling where did my childhood go walk through the world with me and you and i are especially effective an absorbing brilliantly acted directed and written film
<START> death in venice is a movie i need to see once every ten years it is always different because i am always at a different stage of life br br the movie is about art beauty longing death some scenes are painfully slow others simply annoying to watch especially if you have seem them before yet i would not want to miss a single frame the music is repetitive the main theme of the from fifth is used again and again yet i would not want to miss a single note when the last image fades the last note dies i am left numb and exhausted br br this movie is a monument to film making as with most really good movies the saturday evening crowd should stay away from it and this is simply the best movie ever
<START> is thursday an original film heck no but it is a lot of fun i just caught this buried on the movie channels one night and it was an enjoyable flick i was expecting much but what i got was some interesting scenes i really liked the first seen at the convenience store some amusing stories as told by the characters and a little bit of action thrown in the mix as well some good performances from young actors was good and i was particularly impressed with aaron who has gone on to impress me further in friends and and so if you want 90 minutes of easy going fun go ahead and check out
<START> i know it was supposed to be a long walk but really br br the costumes were a bit yuk but still it was the 1970's i suppose br br it was a bit long and dull so give me the newer version any day
<START> one of alfred hitchcock's three greatest films along with psycho and the 39 steps strangers on a train is as brilliantly out of control as a merry go round in metcalf and almost as deadly it's the kind of film you have so much fun watching you can't even feel properly guilty about it until you have time to catch your breath br br top amateur tennis contender guy haines farley granger meets a singularly weird louche stranger named bruno anthony robert walker on a train thanks to the gossip pages bruno knows all about guy's problems with his no good wife miriam and rather gaily suggests they do each other a favor bruno will kill miriam and guy will kill bruno's father who wants to put bruno in an institution guy laughs it off but bruno ain't kidding as guy finds out to his peril br br it's a great premise for a murder story and hitchcock gives strangers on a train a run for all its worth with the help of walker in perhaps the greatest performance in any hitchcock film including anthony perkins in psycho while perkins makes his mark playing against the grain walker as anthony is one perfectly at home either up old ladies at a swank dinner party or strangling a young woman at an amusement park br br what drives bruno many commentators suggest his apparent homosexuality finds a match in pretty guy yes bruno lights up the old gay dar but guy seems happy enough on love's rebound with socialite anne morton ruth roman bruno's interest for guy could just as easily be envy for someone making a mark in the world while he lives at home letting mommy file his nails br br oh i certainly admire people who do things bruno purrs looking like a cat eyeing a mouse you know it must be pretty exciting to be so important br br later on bruno calls himself a bum accurate enough except for our rooting interest in him even as he wrecks guy's life with his homicidal meddling it's the ultimate perverse tale there's a sense of integrity about bruno in his dogged dedication which commands our respect and which hitchcock plays to so brilliantly when bruno floats away from the scene of his big crime am i the only sick person in this world who's actually happy for him i think not yet hitchcock keeps the story on a right enough path for us to realize how low we have fallen we don't want bruno to win exactly but we enjoy his Ã©lan as he tries br br everything else is so perfect or at least close enough to make every shot memorable hitchcock always managed at least 2 3 good setpiece sequences per movie here you get a score of them at the amusement park alone 20 big shows the neon side at the entrance says and they aren't kidding script camera work a gripping tennis match ruth roman's jaw dropping figure it's all too much greatness for one film to contain even granger does his callow youth thing here with more risible plausibility than gregory peck ever managed br br you can call this a clinic in movie making but clinic sounds too dull strangers on a train is good nasty fun all the way through leaving you with a nifty stinger at the tail as you realize you were rooting for the wrong stranger all along heck i'll take that ride over again in a second
<START> i saw riverdance the new show and loved it from the very first moment it is an energetic tribute to irish dance filled with brilliant dancing music and choreography the leads jean butler and colin dunne had me captivated with their exquisite dancing may they always keep shining and keep dancing their on stage chemistry was amazing and the unity between them on stage was obvious they look like they were made to dance with each other this show is my absolute favourite and probably always will be long live riverdance
<START> this is by far one of the most pretentious films i have ever seen it is a tight slap on the face of some indians who speak in english and were looking at the mirror disgusting the bubble gum version of the 1970s politics of the north indian plains the message the educated english speaking indian tried to save the poor beggars of india in all earnestness it ignores the fact that the poor beggars are also capable of and are saving themselves on their own br br as a love story its okay the problem is that the love story and character development is based upon a completely fraudulent version of politics
<START> imagine an exploitive remake of the defiant ones with a black chick and a white chick attached to each other set the story on some caribbean island where the drug dealers rule and the revolution has arrived and have the black woman be from huggy bear's stable of ladies and the white woman be a watered down patty hearst and you've got black mama white mama br br in those waning days of the drive in theater this item must have been a big old hit all the hot buttons of the seventies are pushed in this one even though they both fill out their clothes better and will get a few whistles from the males in the audience no one is ever going to mistake pam grier and margaret markov for sidney poitier and tony curtis all right halle berry and jamie lee curtis br br margaret and pam are prisoners where the guards and the warden look lasciviously at the new fish arriving margaret is a rich girl from the state who took up 'the whilst pam's your basic high priced call girl who's been the local drug kingpin and grew tired of it and tried to leave the island br br margaret's fellow revolutionaries ambush the bus transporting them from the women's prison to town but they get lost in the escape both have their different agendas but like sid and tony they can't quite agree on whose agenda comes first makes for some interesting times as the police the drug dealers and the revolutionaries are all looking for these two chain buddies br br just so you don't get any wrong ideas the head of the revolutionaries and markov's kanoodling partner is named ernesto played by filipino actor the whole mess was shot in the phillipines who were getting their own film industry started br br nice location photography in the phillipines is all that black mama white has to recommend it but if you're a fan of really bad black exploitation flicks this is one for you
<START> although i'm not crazy about musicals cover girl is a delight for classic movie buffs and especially for fans of rita hayworth and gene kelly the film may be dated by today's standards and the story and songs may be nothing special but the musical numbers are magnificently staged and there's a terrific cast to go with the film plus the film is a worthy introduction for fans of rita hayworth she's simply breathtaking in glorious technicolor br br despite jerome collaboration with the film his music here is nowhere near as special or memorable as his songs in swing time 1936 yet the songs serve the film well the dancing is nothing short of excellent especially coming from gene kelly's solo number and my favorite musical number alter ego dance the amusing phil silvers nearly steals the film as kelly's partner otto kruger eve arden and edward brophy give good performances in their dramatic supporting roles and rita plays a sweet charming girl here a role that's a far cry from her femme fatale babes in films like blood and sand 1941 br br all in all this is a delightful film that's worth watching even if you're not big on musicals yet the film's music could have been more memorable if only my favorite period songwriters irving berlin or cole porter wrote the songs for this film however it's the glorious technicolor cinematography and the imaginative dancing that are the real treats of the film's production br br while i was watching rita hayworth do her stuff i don't think i've ever seen a more beautiful or graceful redhead dance on the screen since i saw moira shearer in michael powell's masterpiece the red shoes 1948 just watch rita in cover girl and fall in love with her
<START> at first it seems the topical romance movie where a girl meets a boy and fall in love but the point is that this movie has a feeling others don't have the first time i saw it i couldn't see it complete because i had to leave but while i was walking along i thought i must see it again but i didn't have any opportunity by then one year went by until i saw this movie in a not free channel and i saw it and i recorded it too i saw it once twice until 200 times and not kidding i did know all the dialogues by hart and i don't know why but i saw it everyday and never got bored and i have to say that i'm not used to see a movie more than twice the act is very good gerard depardieu is a talented actor and katherine heigl too i would like her to be in a good movie because i think she can do it on balance it's a movie i can't take out of my mind
<START> is where i'm assuming this movie came from i mean i've watched plenty of b movies over the course of my young life so far and i wouldn't even classify this as a b movie i remember seeing films in my high school mass media class that surpass this one br br so the premise is a bunch of dancing numbers and goofy crap happens women in bikinis who aren't even that great looking to begin with dance in the beginning and sing guys with hairy chests show up and girls with fangs who are out in the sunlight i mean i can barely put together a cohesive sentence just thinking about this movie according to most people on this site manos the hands of fate and pod people are the worst movies mst3k classics d i used to be one of them then i saw this movie usually i don't try to trash a movie too much but the people who made this really do deserve it it is that bad and that unbearable and i'm assuming the director or an actor in the movie is the only person who rated this a ten
<START> eh this is a popcorn movie nothing more i watched this with a bunch of friends and though that might not be the best way to view a horror movie and most of the dialogue and action was laughable br br it left me yearning for a real film br br the main problem is the lack of tension in the film it keeps flashing back to scenes which dissipates any discernible tension br br and the character relationship 'twists' yeah they suck i won't say what they are but they just don't add anything to the film storyline br br by relationship i mean the two main characters br br eek my recommendation is this watch this movie if you can't think of anything better mediocre at best maybe not even that
<START> i got to watch this movie in my french class as part of lets say french culture i thought the way it was filmed and the editing was real good but mostly it was entertaining especially the guy that played wendy's brother also the story line was really good as well as it was believable and yet adventurous as well br br favorite part when william is making fun of the german guy studying and when he acts out how flies reproduce br br my french isn't that good but with the subtitles i could pretty much get what was going on br br watch it
<START> what a silly movie while it looks nice it doesn't make a lot of sense on the one hand the film suggests that madness was that she was just a woman ahead of her time on the other hand she has an obsession that is right out of the worst victorian novel of the wronged woman and that does seem a sort of mental problem like miss in a castle this movie is what elizabeth would have been if elizabeth had not been able to get past essex's sexual attraction
<START> i saw this movie when it was first released and thoroughly enjoyed it what a movie i am in my 40s now and have 2 teenage kids and i would like them to see this movie i would recommend it to anyone who loves a romance movie or older elton john music br br i have searched most of the stores that sell both new and old movies but have not come across any br br i bought some old movies like melody in hong kong who had quite a collection of old movie but they did not have this br br i am also looking at the sequel paul michelle br br can anyone please tell me how to get a copy of the vhs or dvd or vcd br br really appreciate it br br many thanks
