<START> i'd really have to rate sex is comedy as one of the worst pieces of dreck i have ever seen the film showcases those which are the worst aspects of the french or at least how they are stereotyped narcissism snobbery and pseudo intellectualism i myself am french canadian and feel slightly ashamed that the creators of this film are from the same culture as me that should give you an idea as to how bad this movie really was one doesn't so much watch this film as undergo torture to it there was a total lack of humour and it seemed to me as if the entire film was a documentary interviewing people who were neither famous nor talented as if to celebrate something that has never happened to begin with instead why not watch happenstance or je t'aime a la folie three fantastic modern french films
<START> do you ever wonder what is the worst movie ever made stop wondering i'm telling you michael is it br br it is not heartwarming entertaining or travolta at his best it just sucks if i had kids i would let them watch deep throat before michael br br a sold out john travolta a washed up and balding william hurt and an about to die any time now jean stapleton highlight this turd of a film br br but wait you'll get to hear andie mcdowell sing yeah hollywood really s t all over us with this one
<START> i was peeved that the best make up academy award went to dick tracy a horrible film with horrible make up the based on the better titled cabal novella look terrific the acting is excellent and david makes for a truly creepy and terrific antagonist br br the plot on aaron boone who has recurring nightmares about a society of monsters living under a cemetery is he making it up or are they real and calling to him his convinces him he's a murderer a slayer of families br br troubled and suicidal boone seeks refuge in but the monsters don't want him at first he is also tracked by his girlfriend lori who refuses to give up on him even after he dies and comes back cold and monstrous br br but decker isn't about to let boone continue on he raises the locals on an all out assault on like a holy war in gods name led by the devil br br barkers themes of misunderstood monsters may come from his experiences as a homosexual male but they are always strong and honest turns the genre on it's head the monsters are just trying to survive and want to be left alone but man is hunting them br br a 20 minute longer cut was originally submitted by barker but the studio chopped it into this fractured masterpiece barker is hard at work trying to locate the missing footage for a directors cut release until then this version will have to do
<START> this was such a great series for black folks at the time we loved it so much it was the only show about black middle class families on t v at the time please release this on dvd i know many many people who still talk about the show if it its released i am certain that many black youth will find this enlightening as well as interesting the show addressed many topics from racism race discrimination teen pregnancy sibling rivalry single parenting peer pressure and much more the show ended in such an abrupt way and left it's fans speechless and wondering why it was taken off the air since then we have only seen a few of the actors and actresses please release it on dvd asap
<START> after reading the comment made about this movie and currently watching it i can understand how the person felt about it the decisions made were after listening to common sense when the movie came out i had heard the information as to how it came about the storyline was made from an actual event during an award show an actor thanking the li'l people attributed the award to a former school teacher unexpectedly outing the person br br of course many people come 'out' of the closet most every day each outing is different for each person in real life the outcome of any individual is gonna be different as well and a willingness to accept who they are is the most important thing in life to reach personal happiness for those around them the joy and honest acceptance can make life much more fuller for the movie the outcome of how howard is is a lot more comical than real life and the acceptance of the community showed the others that howard was himself and nothing else br br overall the performances were crazy the memorable quotes and use of music add to the stereo types out there in the world but taken with tongue and cheek humour it's a movie sit down watch with an open mind and laugh your head off
<START> a rather disappointing film the club scenes were ok but over done the plot was thin and boring it's only redeeming features were some of the characters the chemist and the dj were pretty fun characters tim character was just bizarre and stupid
<START> i saw this at the toronto inter film festival in sept 2005 the description seemed intriguing how wrong i was this could easily be the worst movie i have ever seen in 50 years i see the director is my age b 1948 and lived with nico of the velvet underground which leads us to andy warhol which coincidently is the one i thought of while watching this warhol's 24 hour movies of nothing much happening this is not art this is boredom br br specifically black white ok maybe but what is the purpose here surely they had color in 1968 and there is no contrast with the present and yes the subtitles were in white naturally i don't think i missed much but that made about 20 of them br br next it's pure chronological order but with seemingly random events thrown in what's the purpose of the conversation with the old man at the dinner table it adds nothing to the movie there were many similar scenes almost like someone took a camcorder and filmed random people and spliced them together to make a movie br br plot none the riot consists of some figures in the distance occasionally heaving a rock off screen mostly it's an excruciating length of time watching people in the distance stand around the repetitive opium smoking is just as boring when the main character got a cute girlfriend i perked up but no she was boring too this is perhaps the only french film i've seen where no one takes off their clothes probably they were too bored to bother br br romance none the girl seems totally indifferent to everything maybe her sculpture holds some interest but if it does we're not shown that we are completely indifferent to the fate of the characters because they are all unappealing maybe that's the point of all this
<START> someone told me that pink flamingos was in a word insane now i'm doubting whether this guy actually ever saw it because that isn't the way i would summarize it in one word disgusting absurd um more disgusting would do it every time you think it can't get any more filthy it does one of my particular favorites was when divine had her birthday party and when the cops came to bust it up they were butchered and eaten by the guests i admit that it's one of those movies where it's so grotesque you simply can't look away but this is by no means a creative work of art it's pure shock value br br on the upside it makes the jackass guys look like a bunch of pussies
<START> billy wilder created a somewhat conventional biopic about the charles lindberg flight he structures the film using flashbacks extensively to tell the lindberg story leading up to the famous flight across the atlantic which happens in present time in the film flying an airplane for hour after hour is not the stuff of excitement and wilder is not going to deviate from his theme of lindberg as hero of the common man so things are predictable however james stewart is well cast and quite believable as lindberg and the many obstacles he has to overcome just to get his plane in the air keep one watching br br the film comes through most successfully as wilder weaves the parts of the story together in a way that create tension then relief then tension again the cinematography is quite good score by franz waxman enhances the scenes and stewart really seems to make lindberg come alive makes one believe he could be lindberg there is a bit of 1950's religious schmaltz at the end but overall the direction acting and high production values overcome the predictability of the story would anybody really see this picture and not know that lindberg made it across the atlantic to make an enjoyable film that has aged better than most films from that time billy wilder made films of a wide variety of types and this is one that is representative of his craftsman like best
<START> this film has me seriously doubting again whether armando de was a good filmmaker or not his blind dead films are praised by many fans this i can understand but wanna be gothic vampire trite like doesn't show any signs from a gifted filmmaker and that also goes for de mar it features horrible acting a dumb plot stupid events a lot of other things you can expect from a bad monster movie and also veteran actor ray milland who does his best to mumble his way through this film while not having much of a clue about what he's doing in it apparently milland was already very ill while shooting de mar his last theatrical feature and going out with a ridiculous stinker like this makes it all the more sad one last appearance alongside peter cushing in a made for tv film directed by roy ward baker also in 1984 doesn't change much about it br br but the sock puppet sea serpent is a hoot to behold watch it swirl up a lighthouse and crush it see it destroy a harbour with miniature boats look at it demolish bridges and munch on charming miniature trains br br good badness yes 3 10 and 7 10
<START> milo is an overlooked underrated horror flick from the late 90's but the feel and atmosphere is more that of an 80's horror flick seems a bunch of little girls are taken to see things at the office of milo's father a and as a reward for getting to see what's there in jars yes a plus something else one girl plays doctor with milo hmm his first patient and he lost her now milo is a creepy little kid that always wears a yellow rain slicker rain or shine and he talks funny but that's not all that's strange about him fast forward to the present where these girls are adults and there's a wedding planned for one of them but tragedy strikes and leaves one girl that came in from out of town with a choice of whether or not to replace her friend as a school teacher which she does and then strange things begin to happen again which of course involve this little kid in a rain slicker this isn't overly violent or graphic but has a distinct creepiness that you don't find in many modern horror flicks and it's well worth seeing one wonders why it's so hard to find any good horror flicks in this day age but here's one that's criminally overlooked and definitely worth your time if you check it out 8 out of 10
<START> our the grandpa's hour br br more than the gangsters it's a detailed depiction of an american family circa 1930 the father proud of his job who worries about his son who's given up high school the mum everyone would like to have the daughter who forgets dinner time in his arms and the twins who are absolutely lovable don't go to sleep first please br br and there's the grandfather playing the yankee doodle on his flute have you noticed that this tune plays the same role as doris day's que sera sera in hitchcock's the man who knew too much 1956 and there's this grandpa who is finally the most courageous person of the family so old he does not even tell you his age but proud of his country and resisting to the gangster's hateful blackmail br br a good film by wellman
<START> it is by far the most definitive film on the police force which i have seen although not directed by ram gopal varma it has all the elements of an rgv film dead straight dialogues blunt treatment of the subject brilliant direction and superb performances even by those with little job to do in the movie the chemistry between nana and the don even if they are professional rivals is amazing and so are the small events like an insider not giving information to imtiaz even while he is being bashed up in the locker but only to nana when he is out the change in working conditions with the change of the senior is dealt wonderfully the first half keeps one absolutely engrossed moving like a documentary with nana acting like a mentor to explaining to him the intricacies and philosophy of the work br br overall one of the most brilliant films on cops in indian cinema definitely not to be missed
<START> dreadful stupidly inane film dealing with corruption at the louisiana purchase lumber company br br everyone in the state of louisiana seems to be corrupt and inept a member of the college's english department can only sign his name with an x br br when it appears that a straight laced senator victor moore is coming to the state to investigate everyone there tries to blame the innocent but foolish bob hope character br br is it any wonder that vera did not get the part of maria in for whom the bell tolls br br naturally the corrupt officials along with hope try to show pictures of with moore so as to ruin him politically moore marries the head of the restaurant who he had insulted when he asked for a ham sandwich he thought the reason that she was upset was because it was a kosher restaurant this is the extent of humor is this absolute mess of a film br br when hope tries to defend himself in congress he does a take off of james stewart in mr smith goes to washington by then the film is too far gone for any good response br br the music and lyrics are both absolutely terrible that song praising louisiana sung in various ways is absolutely terrible irving berlin had something to do with the music of this utterly terrible film
