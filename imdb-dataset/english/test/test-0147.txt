<START> watched this film with an audience of 5 in total had a choice between lakshya and realized then i should have gone for lakshya a typical plot india v pakistan but just isn't cricket as you have kashmir in the middle an indian super hero goes on a mission to save the president of india from some pakistani rebels who are involved in a mass drug smuggling racket i left the film half way as it was simply boring and the plot was confusing and all over the place the songs were also awful the film tries to hide the flaws with its special effects but unfortunately they are outdated too br br overall avoid it if you can has to be the worst film i've seen this year
<START> this movie has a few good performances going for it and that's all it has going for it the leads especially pauley are appealing although some of the bit players seem to be acting from a teleprompter the material that is the problem i feel as though the screenwriter director watched the entire run of felicity in one sitting then sat down to write a script without catching any sleep it really did remind me of felicity a thoughtful young woman finding herself finding love with a shake them up and see what happens approach to the characters and their relationships except that while i usually enjoyed watching felicity this movie left me cold the writing is just awful it's amazing that the cast could come off as well as they did as the dialogue is dull at best at its worst it becomes trite stilted and amateurish there is nothing original here with plot elements recycled from gimmicks that weren't so brilliant to begin with angels and fortune tellers come on for the first half of the movie i rooted for the actors and hoped to be rewarded for my patience by the second half i just wished for it to end already my sympathies to the cast who deserved a better vehicle for their talents
<START> those wishing to see film noir remakes should not see this as as a remake you will always be disappointed instead enjoy a gripping performance from dennis quaid and visual imagery to commend the colour drains from the film literally not metaphorically as the plot gathers pace and the dialogue is crisp and gritty the opening dialogue is clever and the viewer is carried along by a sharp screenplay and a real original film noir feel
<START> no no no no my entire being is revolting against this dreadful remake of a classic movie i knew we were heading for trouble from the moment meg ryan appeared on screen with her ridiculous hair and clothing literally looking like a scarecrow in that garden she was digging meg ryan playing meg ryan how tiresome is that and it got worse so much worse the horribly clichÃ© lines the stock characters the increasing sense i was watching a spin off of the first wives club and the ultimate hackneyed schtick in the delivery room how many times have i seen this movie only once but it feel like a dozen times nothing original or fresh about it for shame
<START> focus is an engaging story told in urban wwii era setting william macy portrays everyman who is taken out of his personal circumstances and challenged with decisions testing his values affecting the community laura dern macy and david paymer give good performances so also the good supporting ensemble
<START> i have to say this is my favorite movie of all time i have seen it well over 100 times actually had to buy a new copy as a result of it is what the eighties was like and what a romantic story with a few morals thrown in i highly recommend to anyone wanting to relive the high schools days again buy a copy now it is a classic
<START> 1980 is brilliant it's got all these qualities that made the late 70's movies so great it is proud of its directness and not ashamed of being over the top br br what really matters here is the journey not the destination ignorant idiots with soap opera mentality will never realize that is about the struggles anxieties and triumphs of these young people not about their careers br br ironically enough none of the very talented actors of made it in hollywood marked the end of an era the end of artistic freedom and experimentation and the beginning of commercialization and political correctness it's the last statement of a generation that had a voice of its own br br 10 10
<START> this is a perfect movie to watch with a loved one on a cold and snowy night if you like a few laughs with your horror then this is the movie for you the makings of a real cult classic it has everything you would want to see in a horror movie a beautiful girl a hero the buffoon a monster truck and of course a family of mutant satanic killers this one is full of blood guts and gore i strongly recommend watching this one in the wee early morning hours and be careful of who sees you being entertained by the sounds of monster trucks bad but funny one liners and our hero eating eye ball stew not as good as the evil dead but a close second just remember warning do not eat before viewing this film
<START> dolemite is a blaxploitation film about well dolemite and his army of kung fu killer women led by queen bee he fights to get his club the total experience back from willie green by utilizing their kung fu abilities and their devotion to him i liked this movie because of the witty dialogue and also the use of rudy ray moore's ability to preach to his brothers in rhyme
<START> kramer vs kramer is a near heartening drama about shocking drastic of the two subjects of a failed married couple meryl streep in the throes of her trademark maternal sensitivity plays an unhappy stay at home mother who feels confined to such a role and within the first five minutes of the film leaves her inattentive husband in a fantastic performance by dustin hoffman to find another role for herself hoffman is dumbstruck having absolutely no idea what to do with himself having taken so much for granted that he doesn't know the first thing about getting his son to school in the morning br br hoffman seamlessly characterizes this husband as such a juicy load of setbacks he is restless relentless and impatient but even though the positive side to those three adjectives should include just the opposite he is unremittingly fixated on whatever he turns his head to he's been focused on his career in advertising and when he is left to raise his son billy all by himself chaos in immediately he's the one throwing temper tantrums and quitting angrily halfway through an activity after awhile as he befriends his neighbor and former friend played by sexy jane alexander hoffman his jets enough to understand why his wife left in the meantime his boundless energy towards raising billy and he loses his job br br the custody battle of the title is a brilliantly grey circumstance even if the ending is a little unmotivated for the audience the last line and the last shot still have that witty screen writing touch that seemed to diminish after the magical 1970s
<START> for years i've had a distant memory of watching this film i looked on the net to find it somewhere and couldn't find it anywhere so i thought it must have disappeared br br until my gran showed me a box set she sent off for in the daily mail and i though nah there wont be anything decent in there but to my great surprise there amongst other gems was the water babies i hadn't been that excited ina long long time its a great light hearted film the songs aren't memorable probably if i was a child during the time it came out i would have stuck in my mind more sadly it was just a film i watched at my 10 years ago when i was a little spud and watching it back now the animation is terrible and the re recored voices they do to get a richness to the sound in films is totally off but who cares when your a kid you never think of those things even if they lead boy is about 10 and sounds like a boy in the middle of puberty br br great classic kids film
<START> i was in this movie as an extra in the dallas filming in july 1975 some of the things you see today and take for granted in movie making were implemented in this movie the movie premise the costumes the special effects the acting it all was ahead of its time it opened the door for movies such as star wars the terminator the matrix and x men movies now people look at it and they say well this does not add up to this new special effects story it did not have any computer graphics and such as the new movies do these days it did have a story and a wonderful cast and a hell of a director the places it was filmed like the world trade center and the building and the ft worth water gardens were at that time the most modern and futuristic backdrops in which to film the director michael anderson was very creative and he tried to show a perfect future that was flawed by human desires and it was my first film experience the first of six films i have been in just because it was filmed in texas does not make it any less a wonderful piece of filmmaker's art watch it again and appreciate it more this movie was the foundation that set the standard for many great films that we now enjoy well my hand is blinking i got to run awaits
<START> i have been a mario fan for as long as i can remember i have very fond memories of playing super mario world as a kid this game has brought back many of those memories while adding something new super mario galaxy is the latest installment in the amazing mario franchise there is much very different about this game from any other mario before it while still keeping intact the greatest elements of mario the first noticeable difference is that the story takes place in space br br the story begins much like any other mario game mario receives a letter from princess peach inviting him to a celebration at her castle in the mushroom kingdom upon arriving at peach's castle mario finds bowser and his son bowser jr attacking the castle with their airships bowser kidnaps princess peach and then lifts her castle up into space in the midst of the castle being lifted into space mario falls off and lands on an unknown planet mario is found by a talking star named and is taken back to the home a floating space station here mario meets many other and also meets their leader a woman named rosalina rosalina tells mario that bowser has taken away the space station's power stars and scattered them across the universe it is up to mario to help the find them and save peach thus the adventure begins br br the way you play the game is by flying from the space station to other galaxies each galaxy consists of multiple planets that mario travels amongst in levels via these shooting stars to retrieve the power stars mario can at many times walk all the way around planets without losing gravity some planets are small and others are big many planets are similar to classic mario environments the best thing about the game are the controls all of the stuff like jumping and such is still the same but the is used in many unique ways in this game you shake the remote mario will perform a spin that is used as the primary attack in the game and it will as well activate the shooting stars you can also point the remote at the screen and use the pointer to fire star bits at enemies or objects in the environment then there is the graphics these are by far the best graphics on the wii it is just so hard to describe how great this game looks you could probably almost say it looks as good as some 360 games br br my only minor gripes is that the going upside down effect takes some getting used to and also the story is pretty weak the worst part is that you lose all of your lives when you turn off the game no matter how many you had when you last quit you restart at 4 lives still these minor problems aside it's a superb game that is highly entertaining and is very challenging this is the type of game that we've been waiting for on the wii br br a perfect 10 out of 10
<START> this is absolutely the best 80s cartoon ever maybe the best cartoon of all time it had everything action adventure thrill and much more br br i can't imagine how hard it was for ruby spears company to make this great cartoon there has been spent a lot of money for this masterpiece of work and it was worth it for example just the beaming down scenes were hard because i wouldn't call the 1980s for a great technology year with computers like now in the world we live in so the beaming down scenes were excellent br br the cartoons will never be the same as they were before that is why i hope that they all will be released on dvd specially the as it's my favorite i have the whole complete set of 65 episodes on dvd r but it's not the same because if they were released on dvd the people in the world would be able to buy it and see the dvd's in almost every store which means a lot to the fans my good friend ted made this petition to either get the show back on tv or better on dvd that is if we get many requests to get them back on dvd br br so please help us by signing the petition at http www petitiononline com petition html
