<START> this movie was made by daiei studios known for its gamera movies it is about a samurai lord who was murdered by one of his own men he claims his throne forcing his former's two children to flee into the woods where they hide near a huge stone statue for 10 years in those time that passed the new samurai lord has proved to be very brutal and ruthless towards the village people and the valley therefore it seems that the good people's only hope is the stone statue which is where a demon god sleeps they want the god to help them br br this samurai movie brings to us traditional japanese aspects including sword fights geisha and worshipers it is a superb and powerful story of survival and hope with the protagonists attempting to triumph over pure evil it is full of excitement particularly the parts where the children struggles to remain in hiding as the evil warlord is out to get them in addition it has beautiful cinematography with luscious landscapes of the village and countryside instantly reminds you of the ancient times in japan br br as with most samurai movies like the seven samuari and the last this movie is no less than pure sometimes graphic action there are several disturbing scenes in the film therefore it is not the casual sci fi film yet it is strong and powerful and delivers a message that a good natured human can overcome any adversaries as depicted in this film even the young innocent girl can calm the wrath of the demon god the scenes of the demon god known as daimajin trampling on its enemies and anything that stands in his way will instantly remind you of a godzilla or gamera film overall a powerful and serious yet hopeful film br br so be careful with your samurai sword you wouldn't want to rattle cages br br grade a
<START> what a pleasure this is really a parody only french people can do that kind of thing without being coarse and as a result you spend a really good time watching jean playing the dumb most of the movie stands on his shoulders and he has them wide enough to make this movie a good one he has the perfect way of overdoing the james bond kind of guy that he is no match for mike meyers in austin powers for example the dialogs are also good enough to keep up the attention of the spectator with a lot of stupid jokes that's really perfect both of the women having the main parts in the movie bear the comparison with the main character and that was a challenge there is no really plot in this movie but that's not what is expected in this kind of movie you just wish to laugh one hour 40 minutes and that's precisely what the movie manage to do it deserves the success it has in france
<START> exciting action packed and interesting film telling the tale of a group of men stationed at a naval base in italy and their adventures aboard a navy submarine during wwi tommy and brick played by robert montgomery and robert young are two pals and make for a couple of very handsome officers i must say a new captain arrives on board already known by a few as dead pan toler walter huston and he's a real stickler for following the rule book and a code of honor soon tommy and brick are chasing after an attractive blonde at an officer's dance tommy insults the captain and of course the blonde is actually the captain's daughter but tommy wins out anyway as he and the daughter sneak away from the dance to a street carnival outside and soon bond during an air raid unfortunately for him she reveals she is married later tommy gets himself into some real trouble when he disobeys orders in an effort save his buddy br br this film is quite entertaining with an absorbing plot line that held my interest and top notch performances by all a climactic death scene featuring sterling holloway is haunting indeed the most memorable scene in this film i thought eugene palette and jimmy durante add some humor here playing a couple of durante's character is actually studying to be a dentist via mail order and continually has run ins with a british man who makes fun of his nose okay if you're looking for a movie showing a man boxing a kangaroo this would be the one
<START> this was a movie that could have been great if there were not so many unnecessary historical inaccuracies and if the actors had been chosen or made up to look a little more like the real persons not very difficult sissi did not go to mayerling to see her dead son she also did not die in the street they carried her on to the boat and then back to the hotel which was much more dramatic i am not sure about the wedding night but i find it exaggerated that a lady in waiting would undress the empress and leave her completely naked and that in the or that the emperor would announce very proudly yes i finally laid her to the assembled court as far as i know this was done right away on the first night and nobody rewarded her as if she were a streetwalker the saving grace of the movie is really stephane excellent actress and true to character
<START> it's not citizen kane but it does deliver cleavage and lots of it br br badly acted and directed poorly scripted who cares i didn't watch it for the dialog
<START> joseph conrad's novel heart of darkness is a dark profound and lasting novel that portrays the futility and irony taking place in africa if you are looking for a great book to read over the weekend this is not the book for you conrad holds nothing back when describing 19th century imperialism but the novel is meaningless without giving it the reflection and consideration it deserves if i read this novel looking for a great adventure story i would say that i wasted my time but looking at in the perspective of explaining the futility of 19th century civilization i would say this is one of the most significant novels i have ever read because of the fact that i read this novel in my english class and we analyzed every page i think i appreciated the book more than someone would who was just reading it for entertainment i am not going to lie this book was difficult and it challenges the reader to dig deep into this novel to find the true meaning the movie on the other hand i found tiresome and boring the movie heart of darkness comes no where near giving the book justice the movie left out many key parts that i consider important to get the true message of the story if you are having difficulty understanding and visualizing the novel then the movie might be a good recourse but i would not recommend seeing the movie as an alternative to the novel or even a different perspective
<START> this is a great film in many different ways perhaps the most important is that it introduces western audiences to the remarkable tragic story of san and her fight for freedom and democracy wonderful acting gorgeous cinematography breathtaking action and suspense beyond has everything i've seen this movie several times over the last ten years and each time it means more to me not everyone will like it hence the relatively low rating on imdb but that's because it is not conventional hollywood rather it challenges the viewer on several levels i've never watched it without sobbing at the end and promising to live a more meaningful life
<START> as i've said in the title of this review it pains me to say this but hitch reaches the zenith of what hollywood romantic comedies can ever hope to aspire to i've been a critic of both the genre and it's namesake for as long as i can remember myself but on an almost tragic note hitch has caused me to spend somewhere in the neighborhood of two hours of my life with a ridiculous smile plastered across my face br br this movie may be misogynistic and presumptuous at times but it nonetheless possesses a certain humor about it whose subtlety may only be described as british this is a wonderful attempt by hollywood to make or remake as the case may be a film which appeals to all of our wishes for a romantic comedy which can make us both think and laugh simultaneously i grudgingly and most give this movie a 9 out of 10 something you shall hardly see me do for a romantic comedy in the near future or so at least i hope
<START> i watched this movie out of a lack of anything else on at the time quickly the movie grabbed me with the depth of the characters and subtle plot i was quite surprised to see that the rating given by my satellite provider did not show any stars br br i will not give any spoilers to the plot line or outcome but most of the characters had at least some redeeming value until the very last minute i did not know how it would turn out frequently you can pick up the formula and predict a story direction i could not do that with this film br br i would recommend this as one of the finer films of this genre
<START> this film offers one of the greatest experiences available to movie goers it is by no means a pleasant film but offers realities and emotions the human mind may never have meant to touch upon it opens pathways in how an individual thinks and afterwards will change the person forever br br the first time i saw this film was in class and immediately after seeing it i had to skip my next class and walk around campus in order to reset my body and mind i felt devastated and somehow unreal as if i didn't exist it was only a few months later that i was telling one of my friends about shame and she asked oh is that when you were messed up after seeing it and ran into me talking all strange about it i didn't even remember running into or talking to anyone at all while outside that day i was astonished br br in plot terms it is the simple tale of a couple torn apart by war there suffering is greater than that of the dead and by the end there are no words to complete the image that bergman creates its like a horrible dream which causes you to wake altering your own reality forever this film must be seen
<START> mankind's self awakening is the theme of 2001 a space odyssey a process that unfolds along a space time continuum we see our primordial past and we infer a cosmic future the powers of intuition thus become the doors of perception in our ongoing collective journey br br from this transcendental perspective a conventional egocentric plot seems superfluous our frenzied conflicts and self important dialogue are consumed in evolutionary change and are irrelevant in a cosmos that is vast beyond comprehension it's a tough lesson for a vain and aggressive species not surprising then that some of us huff and puff about the film's slowness and minimal story for perceptive viewers the remuneration is an inspirational sense of wonder and awe br br in this film which is mostly visual geometric symbols guide our intuition circles and arcs represent nature right angles represent conscious intelligence some people think the sleek black monolith is a von neumann probe maybe without doubt the monolith is a visual metaphor for an extraterrestrial intelligence whose physical form is never shown mystery is more profound than explanation br br 2001 is unique among films in content and scope the cinematography is out of this world the special and visual effects are breathtaking and the classical music is sublime i rarely use the word masterpiece to describe a movie but stanley kubrick's 2001 a space odyssey is art in the highest sense like leonardo da mona lisa or vincent van gogh's the starry night
<START> rainbow and the star stealer is not for people who were born before 1980 or after 1989 most of those people would not appreciate the great things that are 80's cartoons the fact that rainbow was made into a movie is a guilty pleasure for many of us who remember watching the tv show as a child granted much of the dialogue is quite amusing and silly and the plot is to pointless but it's a very cool movie none the less
<START> luckily for bill murray this is such a light weight project since he pretty much has to carry it meatballs is the story of low rent camp and how its counselors deal with the campers as well as one another then there is much made of their wealthy rivals from across the lake named camp mohawk which culminates in a two day olympiad competition above it all is bill murray clowning around and making a pretty memorable film debut br br the film is sprinkled with medium sized laughs chuckles and more than a few guffaws along the way the biggest laughs come from the pranks played on the nerdy camp director three of them involve the counselors moving his bed outside in various locations while he's sleeping morty or micky as everyone calls him wakes up along the side of a road strung up in some trees several feet above the ground and finally floating on a raft in the middle of the lake there are also some funny moments involving the counselors hitting on one another but this is a pg rated film with little in the way of raunchiness br br the film takes a serious note involving a shy camper named rudy who is played by chris makepeace of course it's up to murray to teach the kid how to open up and give him the confidence he needs to run a marathon during the olympiad the sentimentality of situation seems tacked on to a great degree notice how when murray first sees the kid sitting alone in the grass after getting off the bus he tells him you must be the short depressed kid we ordered makes you wonder if that line was really in the script or murray was just ad libbing while the cameras were rolling in other words murray might as well have said to makepeace you must be that actor we hired to play the stereotypical lonely kid you see in most summer camp films who doesn't fit in but before it's all over murray's performance makes this plot device more than bearable he really seems to have some good chemistry with makepeace br br the film culminates with the games between the two rival camps very little of the events we are shown are even slightly believable but it just doesn't matter this is a pretty good film on many levels don't let the absurd 5 6 rating this film is currently getting scare you off murray will keep you laughing throughout just be warned avoid the sequels especially the one with corey feldman 8 of 10 stars br br the hound
<START> how pointless hideous characters and boring film saved by brief sex scenes mad witch gorgeous desert island and brooks body the plot is tenuous the characters are shallow and unlikeable having said that i did manage to watch it all mainly because i was totally transfixed by the jiggling and kind of hoping that her character would come good in the end the film was well shot well directed but perhaps the casting let it down in some ways disappointing really summed the review up in the first line but this website dictates that you need to write 10 lines minimum it would be better to spend the time watching another film
