<START> eric idle robbie janet it should have been almost impossible to go wrong of course it has some funny moments the scene in the showers when robbie echoes lon chaney jr's ghastly werewolf line i can't help myself is hilarious but ultimately the plot script and direction are flat as a pancake and as tired as a 90 year old nun after 180 hail mary s when i was a child carry on films filled this niche slightly better which is a really sad indictment of a film with such a promising cast
<START> all the people who voted a meager 1 on this movie this is all i have to say you guys have not matured enough to enjoy cinema of this kind it takes a certain amount of dedication to reach that level of appreciation and that is the segment of people this movie was aimed at not you average movie goers by any chance back to the movie this one was a gem all right and definitely an inclusion in the bollywood hall of fame i'd give it an all time rank of no 2 surpassed only by shah's legendary this movie had an impeccable story line and created a beautiful blend between a fantasy and sci fi pan's labyrinth would have in fact been ashamed of the balance created between the parallel stories and now do i really need to mention the stellar cast and even stellar er that is a word from now performances from them a special mention goes to mr for the best debut ever in any movie on this earth every actor in this movie had been very carefully chosen and the role were tailor made for them and for their age too i must add still looks like she's 18 and wow man with that figure i would have raped her too are you wondering where did this rape thing come in suddenly yes a rape is what the premises of this movie is based on and that is so not like your average bollywood type movies if you are an atheist or an agnostic by any chance this movie is again a must for you because this movie can heal your faith i don't think it'd even be going too far saying that this movie can cure cancer only the people who need it the most fail to appreciate its power charm and undying beauty so unfortunate br br only flaw in this movie in your dreams baby this was flawless br br only minor complain the director failed to star mithun da as well br br i won't ruin it for you any further just go and watch it today and if you like it here are some more recommendation from me desh the old ramsay brothers horror movies indra the tiger and sivaji
<START> barbara stanwyck probably didn't think of it but it is a relief to see her in a more becoming dark hairstyle if it wasn't a wig than the one she had to wear in double indemnity the year before that film while the premiere film noir and an all around great film gave her a great role but oh that hair here she is more chic and certainly no femme fatal but she is certainly a 40's woman she has gotten used to life without men since most of them are off at war and as a successful martha stewart like columnist she writes a homey column in which she describes her country home as the camera pans over what it really is we meet her boss sydney greenstreet who has no idea that she is living a lie and when he pushes his way in for a christmas away at her supposed connecticut home she has to come up with a husband reginald gardiner and baby before we can say jingle bells hungarian chef s z steps in to help and ends up in a pie one on one with irish una o'connor it's not it's irish stew simply takes the paprika pours most of it in and says now it's totally changing what she has prepared for lunch then when it comes to the he flips and she scoops for years a few friends of mine and i will use that line every time pancakes come up in a conversation i don't flip i scoop she won't even flip just one for greenstreet saying i've never flipped in me life o'connor can get on the nerves when she screeches over and over in some films but here she is delightfully lovable and her pairing with is very charming br br it is obvious in the romance department that reginald gardiner is not barbara stanwyck's cup of tea especially when she meets handsome dennis morgan who is a bit dimwitted when bathing the baby which eats soap causing stanwyck to get a bit alarmed he should suspect something instantly but doesn't but it doesn't matter the film is so charming with the country setting filled with snow an abundance of rocking chairs and a dog running towards them as the sleigh comes up living in new york city after 25 years in los angeles after growing up in a small town on the western side of new york state made me miss this kind of christmas while central park is beautiful after a first snow and the christmas tree at rockefeller center is too there is something about looking out at a snow covered field of trees and catch an occasional glimpse of deer rabbits or other wild life br br this is a great holiday film that can also bring on the christmas spirit out of season and makes a great pairing with another barbara stanwyck country christmas film remember the night an underrated gem add on the big city christmas of meet john doe and you've found perhaps one of the busiest stars of holiday films around
<START> why lori petty was cast as tank girl i'll never know her acting performance is lack luster her voice is grating it's almost impossible for me to put into words how bad this movie is br br there are several modern pop references in the film which i found to be very strange given that the movie was supposed to take place far in the future it wouldn't have been hard to make this premise interesting either some better writing would have helped loads br br naomi watts makes an appearance in it as a mild mannered techno geek i think they should have probably switched roles br br i'll never know why anyone would like this movie unless they were a petty fan br br try not to see this movie total waste of time
<START> an under appreciated unseen gem estevez does a remarkable job of illustrating in poignant heartbreaking fashion the tension that arises between a son who's been to hell and back and his parents who can't begin to understand the emotional scarring left behind it's not unlike born on the fourth of july in that it deals with a soldiers' emotional and mental breakdown after serving in vietnam but while that one focused more on the politics of post vietnam anti war speeches etc this one deals with a much more personal topic family one man's struggle to return to normalcy after a life altering experience and his parents' failure to see the change that has occurred br br estevez delivers a smoldering performance as jeremy collier you can sense the pain and frustration bubbling beneath surface there to match him inch for inch is his real life father martin sheen it's a trip watching these two act off of each other as you get the sense that they're constantly trying to one up one another it's like the presence of each other inspired the pair to do their best and their performances triumph because of it br br recommended to anyone who appreciates solid acting writing and directing and to any vietnam war buff br br 8 10
<START> i'm writing this note as a chess player as well as as a movie viewer i watched the 1997 kasparov deep blue games on the internet i know something about the issues that were raised other chess players will come along and want to know whether this movie is worth seeing buying and i'm talking largely to them however i'll try not to ignore those who aren't into chess br br this movie is about the 1997 match between garry kasparov and the custom built computer deep blue however the first image you see in the movie is not of kasparov or of the computer but of the this is an automaton which was built in europe at the turn of the 18th 19th century and played winning chess against all comers i put the word automaton in quotes because it was as everyone now knows a fake there was a man inside it br br if you don't like seeing the then you won't be able to stand the movie because the has as much screen time as kasparov maybe more both in modern footage and in b w footage from some old movie the reappearance of the every few seconds underscores charge that deep blue had human assistance that it was to some degree a fake computer that ibm cheated that there was a man inside it working behind the scenes to help it win not only does kasparov believe this but the filmmakers seem to believe it too and so this is not really much of a movie about chess games or about programming chess computers it is a propaganda piece about a big corporation supposedly misusing a helpless grandmaster really it is a lot like a negative campaign ad as it is chock full of ominous music and evocative camera work and spooky sound effects and innuendos we never found out what was behind that locked door and the ever present br br now most people in the chess community are pretty much convinced that ibm did not cheat and that this was paranoia at work to start with in order for a human to help deep blue beat kasparov it would seem that you would need a human who was better than deep blue and better than kasparov since there was no such person the whole idea is a bit suspect from the start furthermore by the time this movie was made there were computer programs that could run on your pc that could beat strong grandmasters today much more than in 1997 we take it for granted that a computer can do things you might not expect and we are less likely to take it as a monumental human tragedy that a computer beat a guy in chess and in fact the bottom line is that kasparov beat himself with two bad mistakes including resigning game 2 in a drawn position br br as for the chess games you actually see very little of them there are a few comments from masters and commentators that tell briefly how they went but really you don't get to see hardly any of the strategy or tactics at all naturally as a chess player i take this as a major shortcoming but i think that non players are being cheated too imagine a baseball movie for example where you don't hardly get to see any of the game just a commentator telling you that in game four the white sox defeated the astros with such and such a score nobody would make a movie like that but here for example we are told that kasparov made a bad blunder in the opening of the decisive game 6 but we aren't shown the position on the screen or told why it was a blunder or what he should have done instead or anything we just see a few seconds of kasparov holding his head in his hands and then more atmospheric sound effects and camera work br br since i saw this on dvd let me warn chess players about the dvd as well the jacket promises you that the extras include the games with analysis is this grandmaster analysis which people like us might find interesting no it is the automated computer voice synthesizer analysis from some version of that tells you when a piece is attacked and a pawn gets isolated and that you are in the caro defense main line br br someone might then come along and say well clearly this movie is meant to dramatize the match for the non player and so it's unfair to be impatient with it but actually it doesn't do a very good job of reaching out to the non player either it skates over some points that a true novice would really want to have explained for example it says that kasparov could have gotten perpetual check in the second game but it doesn't explain what that is or show what it would have looked like on the board which would have been interesting it flashes back to the kasparov matches but doesn't explain why there were two of them or who organized them etc i didn't need this information myself but i'm familiar with it if you don't already have chess experience there are places where you are going to be confused and this is just a defect in the film br br ultimately i can't recommend the movie which like the itself is not what it purports to be a documentary but more of a stage illusion
<START> river's edge was one of the most disturbing films of 1986 and for a year that also saw blue velvet you know thats saying something viewed today its lost little of its power and remains much better than the overrated kids the previews for kids played it up to be an expose of the deterioration of the nation's youth in reality it was little more than an exploitation film based mostly around shock value river's edge was promoted as a teen exploitation flick but was in actuality much better the only times it goes from being disturbing to distasteful is the constant image of the dead nude body outside of that the film is thought provoking and for all its minor flaws quite realistic br br keanu reeves known for being a particularly wooden performer gives his best performance as a burned out teenager ione skye is equally sympathetic and likable dennis hopper on the comeback trail with this blue velvet and hoosiers gives a great performance as the creepy yet pathetic hippie generation leftover crispin glover while always entertaining to watch seems a bit out of place as the manic stoner and leader of the group the best performance however is definitely daniel roebuck as the murderer john roebuck is frighteningly emotionless its a shame he didn't become a bigger star as hes a much better actor than reeves br br the film is overall fantastic and daring don't mistake this for another lame john hughes clichÃ©d high school flick such as the breakfast club this is a shocking piece of nihilism that resonates with the viewer fans of this movie are advised to check out a canadian film from 1981 called out of the blue directed by dennis hopper its another shockingly bleak examination of the generation gap and despite its obscurity may have been an influence on river's edge 7 10
<START> a bunch of medical student yuppies get together in their spare time to hook each other to the electrical cables and die then they stand around counting the time before brain death and then start cpr and heart massage and bring each other back to life the fact that julia roberts was in this movie should say it all is like group ghost everyone wants to see their dead relatives and visit their old dead buddies so what better way to do it than have a bunch of medical students kill you for five minutes and then bring you back to life the rest of the movie has the predictable relationship issues plus the predictable gee maybe if we keep killing each other one of these days one of us will stay dead d'oh this movie should have been called brain dead the fact that the characters were depicted as being medical students made me wonder if they had gone to a foreign correspondence school to get their degrees the only thing that kept this film from being a total laugh was that they did not just stick their fingers into electrical outlets in order to die this film would have been a great three stooges comedy movie
<START> i saw the movie in original italian it must be said that the acting and interpretation is most heavily polluted by the tv generated trend to speak in a severely muffled voice not moving lips straining tones as emerged in the that's real life productions and let's raise our audience with a few tears screen playwriting the late massimo girotti towers upon the other characters for intensity clarity of expression and intellectual honesty the movie has some good hints but as in another comment before mine it lacks a focal point and dribbles away in many plot lets of lesser and lesser relevance another trend dragged in from the tv productions well known to italians a few drops in style could be spared to the public such as the drag charm and aesthetics of cooking plus sensual of sweets see chocolat babette's lunch etc and the fairies are definitely more truthful seems that ozpetek has learned the tune of italy in the early 2000s and is humming along i'll give him a last chance though
<START> as a huge fan of horror i had given up on the vampire sub genre due to the fact that in most vampire flicks the vampire has become feminine and non threatening benign and basically weak this was the attitude i brought to a viewing of midnight and i am happy to say that the vampires in this film at least have the hunger to kill old ladies and sacrifice babies armand assante one of my favorite actors of all time was born to play the charming vampire with savage intensity br br another thing that interested me is that the central location is the hotel that is cool because and i went back to my high school copy to look this up in dracula the pass is where jonathan harker must pass to get to dracula's castle br br finally my hats off to whoever made the decision to make the creature a real effect and not a darn cgi that's the one thing great about many low budget movies they cannot afford the garbage computer effects that plague many hollywood monstrosities br br bottom line this is better than underworld for sure especially if you are a vampire purest cheers ja
<START> two page boys working at a radio network go from trying to solve murders to performing in black face in between work shifts jack moran and sidney miller star in this whodunnit from 1945 lots of fast talking everybody yells at everybody and the two page boys call the police detective marty played by ralph sanford it's a real at 59 minutes and it has the feel of being adapted from a play since it mostly takes place in a radio station soundstage we don't really care about any of the characters which is probably why its hardly ever shown no big deal this was phil second film as director we're not given any clues as to who might be knocking people off so we just kind of follow the police detective and the page boys as they all try to solve the mystery first i'll say no more so as not to give away any spoilers
<START> to the eight people who found the previous fierce people comments by me and helpful as well as to any future site visitors who see them before their authors delete them these negative critique's are not only shorter than the site guidelines mandate but they are entirely bogus incorrect and misinformative for instance dad is in a coma not dead maya and finn even visit him in the hospital furthermore it was estate deer dwayne not blythe who knocked up the maid etc etc so if you have add which makes you incapable of focusing on the simplest details please keep your condition to yourself by not pretending to be siskel or ebert otherwise include a disclaimer with your comments
<START> 'bloody is an odd and at times humorous low budget horror flick along the lines of or a less intelligent version of 'the good son' br br set in a small californian town three babies are born at the height of an eclipse where planetary alignment means they are somehow born without emotions ten years later our three little psychopaths take themselves on a killing spree doing away with parents siblings teachers and anyone else who irritates them only one teenage girl knows the truth to be able to stop them there is no explanation for why babies across the world born at the same time aren't equally as twisted but there you go br br for a slasher film it's very tame in terms of violence and gore which i suppose highlights the problem of casting child characters as the killers as there is only so much you can expose the young actors to instead it's amusing and a little disturbing seeing three ten year olds plotting murders and carrying out their plans using guns knives and crossbows the main reason why it doesn't descend into being totally ridiculous is because the child actors are very convincing in their roles with the way they slyly play the little innocents in front of adults while showing their dark side to the girl who knows the truth br br 'bloody is rather mediocre as a horror flick with few scares and little blood but because it has the shock factor of having kids as the killers it is a bit unique in that way one to watch if there's nothing else on
<START> i saw this film when it was released to the minor cinemas in the uk some 50 years ago and the memory remains of a great musical score and the tragedy of the storyline i saw it again on video recently the sound track was poor and the picture grainy but it is one of two films that i saw again the next day the other being gladiator the music theme is intensely tragic and from the outset one knows that it heralds failure or death certainly one of george sanders best performances as a man working the black market to get pay back for what he lost in the war but nemesis waits patricia roc plays a refugee from eastern europe eaten with despair he is attracted to her selflessly wants to help her and then falls in love with her but she is too proud and hurt to accept help their love destroys him and the girl and the doctor herbert marshall who brought the nemesis the storyline is of complex intertwining destinies where subsidiary characters are not who they appear to be this is as a film which the critics and struggled at the box office but for the adolescent who saw it and the retired gentleman who saw it again it is one of the greatest films taking into account its age whose story is more akin to an opera
<START> ocean's twelve is probably better than ocean's eleven i know most people would disagree but i actually liked it more after three years it was good seeing the gang return the reason behind the heist is a bit more inspired the second time around i see why they stole from benedict andy garcia in the last film this film they have a bit more motivation the second time around ocean's twelve is more entertaining and cooler than ocean's eleven with a funny cameo by topher grace saying i just walked in that new dennis quaid movie and other things i think ocean's twelve is probably the best in the series br br the plot a year or so after ocean's twelve terry benedict the guy they robbed in the last film is back and says that if ocean's eleven doesn't pay him back the money they stole he's going to call the cops so danny ocean and the gang go to europe where rusty meets his old cop girlfriend isabelle after she meets him again she begins to follow them around also the gang learns that they have an enemy who is also a thief who is a little better than they are br br with many funny scenes like when tess julia roberts goes to europe and pretends to be julia roberts ocean's twelve is a pretty clever film it's cooler funnier and more entertaining than ocean's eleven
