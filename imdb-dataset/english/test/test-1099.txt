<START> this is not a movie that i would typically watch at 2 30 in the morning but i got into it and couldn't stop until it was over br br shia labeouf demonstrated that he is not just a young actor here but could handle more demanding roles the fact that he has been handed those roles in the last two years is testament to his ability br br it was really his movie sure there were others involved but they pale in comparison to his role br br this was a time when gold was reserved for the privileged this victory opened it up to the masses much the way that tiger woods has opened golf to all races br br like harry stephen said to lord peter firth if mr shia labeouf wins tomorrow it's because he's the best because of who he is not who his father was not how much money he's got because of who he bloody is and i'll thank you to remember that go get charged up
<START> i thought this film was amazing and i laughed so much that i had to see it twice to catch the bits i missed whilst bending over holding my stomach the critic who reviewed this film for this site challenged anyone with an iq over their shoe size to find this film funny well my iq is approx 135 i challenge this person to question me and then eat his own words this film is brilliant and if the critic above wasn't such a boring idiot he might smile for once in his life and take things as lightly as they're meant br br the musical numbers were so imaginative everyone when watching any film about that period of time will notice men in tights and realise how different it is to today's attire and how funny we would find today's male population if they wore tights day in day out the idea of dedicating a song to butch men dancing in tights was so fresh how can anyone not laugh plus also seeing hip hop rappers doing ballet is always hysterical as a dancer also i've done ballet and hip hop and danced with men who've had to do both it still cracks me up each time br br i love this film if anyone hasn't seen it yet don't listen to the critic above watch it and then decide for yourself
<START> im a die hard dads army fan and nothing will ever change that i got all the tapes dvd's and and every time i watch listen to them its brand new br br the film the film is a re run of certain episodes man and the hour enemy within the gates battle school and numerous others with a different edge introduction of a new general instead of captain square was a brilliant move especially when he wouldn't cash the cheque something that is rarely done now br br it follows through the early years of getting equipment and uniforms starting up and training all in all its a great film for a boring sunday afternoon br br two draw backs one is the germans bogus dodgy accents come one germans cant pronounced the letter w like us and two the casting of liz frazer instead of the familiar janet davis i like liz in other films like the carry ons but she doesn't carry it correctly in this and janet davis would have been the better choice
<START> matthew aldrich this is a name worthy of remembrance this is the individual that took fingers to keyboard and came up with one of the worst scripts of all time clichÃ© predictable an insult to the public's intelligence br br is he the sole of blame of course not renny harlin took this abysmal excuse for a script and made it into a movie sam jackson and ed harris actually read it or not and chose to star in it culpability abounds br br this is the denise richards of film scripts there aren't enough razzies in the universe to give proper recognition to how truly horrible this writing really is br br in all fairness samuel jackson's profession is incredibly novel and the manner in which it's presented is highly creative but at the end of the day it's all just trimmings pretty trimmings br br package it any way you want garbage writing is still garbage writing
<START> when i first heared that there was going to be the world is not enough video game for the nintendo 64 i was so excited when it finally came out i was one of the first ones to rent it i rented it for 7 days and i got through the whole game the game was to easy and gave out too much hints a dissapointing sequel to goldeneye take my advice and do not rent this game br br sure the guns and gadgets are cool but one gets tired of a watch lazer that looks like it was taken right from goldeneye with the exception of being a red color instead of a blue color a poor excuse for a dart gun horrible stunner and a stupid grapple hook that can only attach itself to things that are yellow and black br br i think that rare should of made this game instead of ea who should stick to games there good at making like sport games and should clear of first person shooters and let the masters do the work
<START> this would definitely not have been my kind of movie but my husband saw it on tv and said it was really good so on his recommendation i bought a copy since i didn't know if it would ever be on tv again i had never heard of anybody in it except armand assante at first i had a hard time getting into the story because the first part of the movie is a jumble of images and it doesn't make much sense it is only later in the movie that it all comes together the scene cutting if that's what it's called is a bit jarring it sometimes looks as if a few frames have been cut out of each scene and the scenes are jerky but i guess that was done to add to the if that's a word the story veers here and there and just about the time you have it all figured out everything turns upside down and you have to readjust your thinking as to who is the bad guy and who is not or bad woman the acting is very good i kept thinking how much norman reedus looks like leo decaprio the ending was a real twist totally unexpected which i liked a good show
<START> well not much really to say about this but it is really good very good job from directing and the movie have good cast of acting movies plot is also believable and hehe good so the good is main word in this case i just hope there would be more this kind scifi movies thats why this one s pointed out in the crowd i give it 8 5 of 10
<START> i managed to avoid reading hemingway in college from what i could tell along with his reductivist verbiage he offered reductivist story lines this film of into a simplistic hoary belabored narrative does not disabuse me of my suspicions a guy who barely sees action on the european battlefield hudson falls in with a nurse jones and they conspire to spend time together hemingway's big contribution to narrative was the romantic travelogue who knows what these two lovers have in common they're so utterly generic the movie never even brings up the utter irresponsibility it takes to abandon the front in favor of a lovers' adventure the two have a season on the alps straight out of a j crew catalog a number of better scenes are undermined by corny conventional melodrama elsewhere the movie keeps piling on tiny improbable unspecific details that fight the epic treatment the cavernous hospital that miss barkley works in is virtually empty so that no secondary plot line can possibly distract from the flimsy main story complicated it is not br br the camera work is better than average with some amazing location photography director charles vidor or maybe huston does striking things in the first hour with an on location wide screen camera there are no second unit cop outs vidor shows massive panoramic tableaux pans over a line of hundreds of soldiers through the mountains and then with a 90 degree of his camera catches up with hudson's ambulance barreling down on him br br hudson looks great he's a better actor than he gets credit for but with material like this he can become very mechanical mercedes plays a one dimensional shrew jennifer jones is puffy and miscast in the lackluster female lead the movie is best when she's off screen the love scenes are about as affecting as a coffee commercial
<START> this is one of the best films i've seen in the last years and deneuve shine in their respective roles he as a naive plantation owner and she as an enigmatic trickster words won't do this masterpiece justice suffice it to say that this is a movie that explores the darker side of love and the pain humiliation and capacity for self delusion that go with it although it's dressed as a film noir forget that feeble remake with jolie and banderas see the genuine instead and treat yourselves to some moments of great cinematic beauty
<START> telling the story wouldn't be the point at all would it spelled almost like aww is the title for that brilliant novel of the late seventies that shocked a lot of people including myself br br children's island is the title and what an island in the book raine the main character has the guiness world record book as his own bible and he's keen on breaking new records himself in particular the youngest person under water for three minutes br br the story is as most swedish films and books of the time deep consciously provocative and awe inspiring bergman was beginning his final film and cries and whispers was barely out expectations for any swedish film were pretty high they taught us then that great theatre great actors superb writers and gifted directors made a veritable team of perfection in cinema br br all this said is a story of discovery it is too a story of alienation cities are alienating and living in one of them make us aliens to most of its residents it is a story of revelations and sudden encounters with our own destiny it is a film of overwhelming hope and desperation of feelings buried under layers and layers of isolation and insulation from a world that couldn't care less br br this approach in itself is a pretty difficult way to weave a convincing narrative here the masterful guidance of kay pollak on ola script of p c novel turns it not only in a possibility but in one of those master pieces of cinema br br i may disagree a bit with someone who said that this work was all but forgotten it is not even as i write this in 2009 discussions on p c story are conducted all over the world and the film shown at many film schools and small theatres br br why waxing philosophical on all of it would be difficult and many have already done it scholarly through writing and lectures the reason why was and is a special story is the cosy feeling you get from the start when you discover that everything is told through the eyes of a small child and that's where it ends too maybe it's a clinical view as someone else pointed out but deeply disturbing moving and satisfying the concept is deep as long as we have no pubic hair we still can live one more day as an angel afterwards we'll become what raine reflects as the of his experiences men are pigs he finds his fears when he's fearless he finds love when the world is crumbling around him he discovers a reason not to behave like the grown ups because he refrains from committing crimes he let go his inner purity and confidence in others without reservation just to learn how rotten the soul of a man can be br br where love is expected he finds hatred where compassion is needed he finds suspicion and cold hearts it's a film of metaphors a film to think and to raise questions that are hard to ask but harder to answer br br in the end the satisfaction of witnessing such a superb work that really upped the ante for any other swedish film after is a ride of joy and hope be aware that it is a film full with the dark side of our nature but alas a film of hope and deep joy reine will still be an island in stockholm but there is the big hope of living today in full even when we found our first signs of sexual maturity show
<START> any one who writes that this is any good there kid may have worked on it or put money in to this god awful college experiment it was lousy slow and painful to watch running time of only about 84 minutes it felt like three and half hours the only person to blame is the director who knows nothing on how to direct a scene where to place the camera 95 of this dreadful movie was shoot by long master shots two or three people in the frame talking or yelling forever or what seems like forever no close ups no medium shots there are two so called fight scenes that any filmmaker with a brain would have shoot some close ups or medium shoots for them they looked very amateurish the scenes with the father and son screaming at each other would have worked better if there was a cut away of just the father or just the son acting or reacting tri c must be very mortified to show this any where i have seen a bunch of bad movies in my time some of them are fun because they so bad this is not one of them
<START> this mini series is iconic of the australian spirit while there may be what are perhaps considered glaring inconsistencies the film portrays a spirit that is unique to australia and one that should be cherished if anything this mini series demonstrates the aussie sense of humour the ability to laugh at the supremely ridiculous our willingness to have a laugh in even the most dire of situations while a large part of this series focuses on and how humour can be used as a means of survival it also has elements of drama that are evoke real emotions the main actors who appear are absolutely sensational and very convincing in their different roles capturing the essence of their characters perfectly this mini series should be mandatory viewing for all australians
<START> some people may remember ms russell from films such as black widow which had some appeal and critical acclaim boy she must have really needed a rent check when she signed on to do this dog br br yes there will be those who like the gratuitous violence and nudity but one must sit back and wonder in retrospect what possessed anyone to spend money and time to make this in the first place i just saw this movie on one of the hbo's and i can't believe they picked it up br br in 1996 ms russel didn't have the physical attractiveness she did earlier in her career but come on having her play ma barker her sons all look like they could be her brothers it's also creepy in that you think there are going to be incestuous relationships occurring thank goodness there aren't hope that doesn't count as a spoiler with eric roberts and alyssa milano added into the cast this one is b movie 'straight to video' all the way br br the scenes between purvis and ma barker either in person or on the phone are a primer in terrible terrible acting oh wait i forgot terrible terrible writing as well chalk this one up to experience a bad experience
<START> i loved this movie and i never knew it was this old it came out the day n year i was born in and now i am 19 now i still love this movie especially the songs like my mother and boys and girls of rock n roll and i remember as a kid i believe i was 5 n my sister was 6 and my cousin boy was 6 as well we used to pretend to be the characters in the movie i was and janette and my sister was and my cousin was alvin simon and theodore those were good times and i miss it and having this movie reminds me of the good times since my cousin is old for this stuff and so am i and my sis we are not going to forget about the chipmunk and the chipmunk movie i still even remember the songs and the words off by heart even though i haven't seen this movie for 12 years but now starting to love it again alvin and the chipmunks and 3 3 3 3
<START> let me say first off that i am a huge fan of the original series lonesome dove and the book it was based from i have put off watching this sequel for the better part of 10 years due to the bad reviews i'd heard about it if tommy lee jones wasn't playing capt call i didn't see the point if larry wasn't involved why should i care how wrong i was br br this is in so many ways a worthy sequel to lonesome dove maybe even more so than the dark mood of streets of the story acting production cinematography are all top notch of course the script isn't as colorful as lonesome dove but it has it's moments and much to my surprise there are bits of lonesome done in this series the relationship between july and clara completely dismissed in the prequel is brought up here almost identical to the book a most welcome surprise the story isn't all roses it has it's surprises too by far the biggest surprise is jon voight's interpretation of capt call while not a direct copy of tommy lee jones' his is both faithful and unique to voight's credit the cast is fantastic all across the board and i don't think rick schroeder has done a better job of acting than in this series oliver reed practically steals the show here he is superb in a role that makes you care for his character as equally as you hate him br br it is worth it to watch this if you haven't due to bad criticisms especially that the dvd is so affordable i got the 2 disc set for 10 99 you can probably find it cheaper it is in no way the disappointment that dead man's walk turned out well it was for me and was involved with that one
