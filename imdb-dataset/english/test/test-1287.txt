<START> i saw this film for one reason the tagline is upset the headÂ and you're dead cracking it's not surprising that this silly horror comedy runs out of steam before the tape is out of the box but it wrings a few laughs from its oddball premise and cast of characters an eagle eyed human radar a huge and a big breasted sexual magnet are all mind controlled by a huge head in a chair who's not happy about his family being blackmailed by a murderous scumbag this looks like being a promising mixture of ham and cheese before it becomes clear that the characters are one joke wonders and the plot is pretty ordinary if you erm ignore the giant head
<START> this is a great installment in the child's play series it brought back some bang to the series great comedy boy this movie is funny also there are awesome homages to other horror celebs beautiful cinematography great ending bring on seed of chucky
<START> this is another alien imitation and not a very good one at that replace outer space with the south african desert throw in the same ingredients a group of people stranded in an inhospitable landscape have them hunted down by an alien creature and you have the same old story of a very ordinary film trying to ape a classic film a group of miners and scientists go on a hunt for some missing colleagues and find their bones in the desert stripped clean of flesh their vehicle breaks down and they head for civilisation while being stalked by the monster the african location is pretty enough but that is basically all this film has going for it there is a vain attempt to build up the tension but i found this didn't really work and made the film rather boring the creature didn't appear much and when it did it didn't really install a feeling of horror there is one scene where someone gets the flesh ripped from his arm but that was basically it on the gore front in conclusion i found this film about as exciting as watching paint dry i give this film 4 10 and that is only because of the interesting location which alone isn't enough to save this movie from being a total snooze fest
<START> i a huge fan of when it comes to doctor who series and still am but i was very disappointed when i began to watch this new series br br children under the age of 15 or even better under the age of 10 will probably will enjoy it the best and possibly new fans who haven't seen any of the original series but as far as fans of the original series will find this series missing much of the charm the made the original series so great it took david tennant to get me to appreciate how much better christoper was as a doctor in the 1st season br br i would only recommend this series for people who haven't seen much of the original series people who are under 15 and extremely die hard who fans everyone else will just get a laugh and mumble curse words about russel t davies screwed up one of our favorite tv shows
<START> let me just start out by saying that tourist trap is a better movie then 99 9 of the horror films that have come out of hollywood lately if you don't believe me see darkness falls or they and it is certainly better than any of those crappy direct to video releases like stab bleed the pool and so on one of the big problems with the film tourist trap is that is never really found an audience when the film opened in 1979 it was given a pg rating by the mpaa anyone that knows horror films knows that a pg on a horror film is usually the kiss of death for the film director david schmoeller talks about this problem on the dvd's commentary track there are exceptions though like poltergeist which had also received a pg rating however there are big differences between tourist trap and poltergeist tourist trap was not a big budget hollywood film like poltergeist nor was it produced by steven spielberg that alone was enough to guarantee poltergeist success still for those of you that have seen tourist trap you will even scratch your head as to why the mpaa rated this film pg the 'heart scene alone should be enough for the film to be slapped with and r rating or how about the pipe in the back with the blood running out of it i have to admit though that when i was young i looked at a copy of poltergeist in the video store shelf picked it up saw that it was rated pg and put it back on the shelf in favor of an r rated film instead years later i finally saw poltergeist and realized what a great film i missed out on for not renting a pg horror film from then on i would never judge a film based on it's rating again this is most likely what happened to tourist trap people like me with poltergeist will probably overlook it in favor of the r rated film most likely it would be a teenager too which most of these types of films are targeted at friday the 13th was no masterpiece either but did extremely well at the box office due to the fact it was rated r and was heavily advertised by paramount at the time it found its audience and made enough money to spawn several sequels when you look at it folks tourist trap is just as good as friday the 13th the same thing could've happened to tourist trap we could have seen tourist trap 2 3 4 and so on as far as the film goes tourist trap is an entertaining horror film made on an extremely small budget but it is well acted well directed and well made on many levels chuck connors is a riot as mr and gives the best performance in the film special credit must be give to composer pino donaggio whose score for this film really is what sets it apart from others and gives it its creepiness the music in the scenes involving the mannequins is especially creepy donaggio worked on the horror film carrie and many other film scores since tourist trap he has done exceptionally good work in film and continues to score films to this day the weakness with tourist trap is that there really is never any explanation of powers maybe that is how it's supposed to be he just has them and we should accept that in order for the movie to work we do accept it to a point but then the screenplay has incidents like how makes the phone ring in the store while he's in the basement of the house in that case is limited in using his powers can he make a phone ring in houston detroit los angeles what is his range those are things that people that didn't care for this movie would most likely to point out as flaws others would accept it as a mistake i accept it there is not enough of those type of questions generated by this film to make me hate it this is a horror film we should not be required to read too much into it many people have called this the 'killer movie i assure you that no mannequin kills anyone in this film the mannequins are controlled by the power of who uses them as a weapon this is a common misconception about this film some people have a problem with the mannequins and some have even said they are just downright silly i think they add to the overall creepiness of the film overall tourist trap is a good fun rental out of 5
<START> i absolutely love this film and have seen it many times i taped it in about 1987 when it was shown on channel four but my tape is severely worn now and i would love a new copy of it i have e mailed film four to ask them to show it again as it has never been available on video and as far as i know hasn't been repeated since the 80's i have had no reply and it still hasn't been repeated the performances are superb the film has everything its funny sad disturbing exciting and totally takes you back to school days it is extremely well paced and grips you from start to end the scene in the shower room is particularly horrific i also cannot hear the song badge by cream and not think of this film this film deserves to be seen by a much larger audience as it is superb channel four please show again or release on video or dvd
<START> i'd like to start by saying i would not go see this movie again if they were giving out popcorn made of solid gold and the ticket granted me eternal life this movie was terrible i can't give this it a truly honest rating because there are no negative stars the acting is absolutely terrible this movie is a travesty based on the classic the most dangerous game if you really want to torture yourself for 90 minutes rent something like gigli at least j lo provides some better scenery ben should pacify the ladies viewing it i'm not upset about the 7 i paid to see the move i'd just like the 90 minutes of my life back br br can you give me my time back samuel l jackson changing lanes
<START> critters 4 starts i quote 'somewhere in kansas a replay of the last few minutes of critters 3 1991 as the recurring character of charlie mcfadden don keith is about to shoot the last two remaining critter eggs in the universe which we are informed would mean the extinction of the entire critter race which is against some sort of intergalactic zoological law or something like that charlie's bounty hunter friend ug terrence mann is now known as counsellor is a top ranking official at the intergalactic council orders charlie not to shoot the eggs but instead put them into a pod that will land nearby very soon the pod does indeed land nearby very quickly charlie does indeed put the eggs into it but he is also caught in the pod which i presume ally freezes him as it's never really explained critters 4 then informs us that we are 'somewhere in saturn quadrant where a salvage ship comes across the pod drifting in space the credits have barely finished critters 4 is already stealing entire ideas scenes from aliens 1986 rick anders decides to claim the unidentified to them anyway pod try make a bit of cash out of it with the help of his crew ethan paul fran angela bassett al bert brad dourif bernie eric the pod is successfully recovered they get in touch with the intergalactic council counsellor say to go to an abandoned space station where a trade will be made for the pod it's contents also specifically tells rick not to open the pod so in true horror film tradition rick opens the pod thaws charlie out the critter eggs which hatch kill rick escape into the space station br br co produced directed by rupert harvey i thought critters 4 was a pretty useless film rounds the critter series of films off with a whimper rather than a bang the script by joseph lyle david j is both predictable clichÃ©d the space station with an unstable reactor that will blow up in a few hours the protagonists only means of escape being early on so they are stuck the race against time to save themselves the constant bickering arguing amongst the crew people splitting up the loser who turns into a hero saves the day yawn a lot of plot devices seem to come straight from aliens it rips off star wars 1979 with a tacky waste compactor scene the characters are no better you probably won't give a damn about any of them while the other critter films could be described as comedy horrors part 4 cannot it appears to be deadly serious throughout critters 4 is also incredibly slow uneventful dull it's over 30 minutes before the critter eggs hatch after this brief sequence it's nearly the hour mark before their seen again why make a critter film barely feature them it can't be because of the expensive special effects as they look like glove puppets anyway oh how can a mere hours old critter operate an entire space station set a course for earth how do they even know what earth is why did rick want to open the pod anyway what is all that stuff about with the female scientist a rubber alien thing that is mentioned only once why do the intergalactic council want the critters so badly why only send four men why is this perfectly good looking space station totally deserted again critters 4 looks cheap throughout with bland dark unimaginative sets it even steals footage from android 1983 for it's ships space scenes critters 4 was apparently so low budget that the filmmakers couldn't afford any optical effects the ones it takes from android look seriously dated for the most part only two critters are used although some more start to hatch but it's pretty late in the day when this happens for most of the film they are barely seen the effects for them are the worst of the entire series forget about any blood or gore as the critters only kill two people during the 90 plus minute running time which just wasn't enough to maintain my interest the acting is pretty poor as well with angela over the top melodramatic reaction to seeing a few critter eggs particularly cringe worthy to look at critters 4 it is as cheap unspectacular a production as you could hope to not see the ending of critters 4 has the universe finally being saved form the critter menace lets hope it also saves us our local video stores from the menace of a part 5
<START> this movie is based on the book a many thing by han and tackles issues of race relations between asians and whites a topic that comes from han's personal experiences as an eurasian growing up in china that background and the beautiful hong kong settings gives this love story a unique and rather daring atmosphere for its time br br other than that the story is a stereotypical romance with a memorable song that is perhaps more remembered than the movie itself the beautiful jennifer jones looks the part and gives a wonderful oscar nominated performance as a doctor of mixed breed during the advent of communism in mainland china william holden never looked better playing a romantic lead as a journalist covering war torn regions in the world the acting is top notch and the chemistry between the two lovers provides for some genuine moments of silver screen affection sure to melt the hearts of those who are romantically inclined br br the cinematography really brings out hong kong especially the hilltop overlooking the harbor where the two lovers spend their most intimate moments the ending is a real tear jerker some may consider sentimental romances passÃ© but for those who enjoy classic hollywood love stories this is a shining example
<START> after watching this movie once it quickly became one of my favorites as different events happen in the movie you change your mind about back and forth until the end and even after the movie is very thought provoking and a must watch
<START> i'm racking my brain but i can't seem to think of another movie quite like the valley of the gwangi a western with dinosaurs what could be more natural you gotta wonder why john ford and or john wayne never tried it br br the plot Â while searching for a mythical miniature horse for her circus tj breckenridge gila golan tuck kirby james franciscus and the rest of the cast characters enter a strange lost valley there they find not only the miniature horse but some other more fearsome creatures as well dinosaurs rule this place now wouldn't that be an attraction at circus Â a caged t rex br br it's not that i find the valley of the gwangi a bad movie i just don't seem to have enjoyed it as much as many others who have posted comments on the movie there are some parts that i actually find almost unwatchable for the first half of the movie there just doesn't seem to be much going on i wasn't necessarily bored but i did want something to happen plodding would be an adjective i would use to top it off the movie features a very contrived love story it feels forced as if the writers decided that the male and female leads just had to get together but the valley of the gwangi isn't a total waste there are moments i really enjoyed who doesn't get a kick out of the scenes of the cowboys on horseback trying to lasso a t rex you just don't see stuff like that every day ray creatures are impressive there are some really cool shots of miniatures interacting with people and horses it might not represent the best of his work but the effects are very nice still at least in my mind these good moments aren't enough to overcome the negatives as much as i hate to do it i've got to rate the valley of the gwangi a 4 10
<START> i could not watch more than 10 minutes of this movie it has set the standard i will never again give a movie a 1 unless it was as horrible as this one i fully agree with the other comments about this film but since i'm dutch i watched it with dutch translation apparently they didn't have money for a proper translation so they decided to babelfish it with sometimes hilarious results br br don't smoke don't drink don't do drugs don't watch demon summer br br i was surprised that the actors wow i can't believe i just said that didn't hold the script was there any in their hands while shooting i think they also did a good job on well no they didn't do a good job at all
<START> the real life case of an innocent first nations chief the indian by an winnipeg city officer the cowboy is the basis of this tv movie the actual case caused its fair share of racial tension in canada a small scale martin luther king thing the of first nations people is becoming a staple in the canadian cinema diet what makes this film worth viewing is the focus on the family's reactions the father played by gordon demands forgiveness and the brother played by eric demands justice the stars gordon and adam beach have minor almost cameo appearances soon to be star eric makes his mark in this film with a powerful performance an honourable mention goes to veteran actor gary chalk who has chalked up over 100 movies to his credit his portrayal of the troubled soul inspector was worthy of a award the canadian emmy along with eric the special effects jump cuts dream sequences are occasional and not overbearing couple this with some beautiful northern canadian scenery and recent ongoing events involving police officers and first nations people like the neil case and you have a very rewarding and relevant viewing experience
<START> a brazilian cable television is presenting this month in its cult channel i saw the trailer and listened to the advertisement and decided to see this movie indeed it is an absurd boring pretentious dumb pointless disconnected crap about the conflict in the middle east and together with they certainly are the worst movies i have tried to see i really wasted forty three minutes of my life watching the first half of this crap highly indicated for torturing enemies how can this movie be awarded and nominated to prizes inclusive in cannes my vote is one awful br br title brazil divine intervention
<START> ok normally i am fascinated by z movies some of the actors directors writers etc in those movies have a shred of talent they want to get that talent out so unfortunately for them they have to associate with crappy people to make their films but some z films do have at least one thing that may be noteworthy about them br br not here br br as soon as i saw it i thought 'wow a blade knock off ' believe me if this movie could have lived up to that label that would have made it a better movie br br instead i was subjected to some of the most horrible acting i have ever seen in my life master kao was bad so bad that i believe some of my neurons in my brain exploded trying to comprehend his acting i am still trying to make sense of his enunciation and why he would raise his voice in speaking certain words to add dramatic effect i'm sure but it was for no apparent reason simply mind boggling br br oh and then there is the black guy in the purple cape near the end of the movie purple cape guy fights the hero for about 30 seconds but he is so bad that it actually looked like he was scared of fighting br br the main hero and the main villain did decent jobs the main hero derek washington seemed like he actually knew martial arts
