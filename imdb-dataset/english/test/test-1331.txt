<START> i was fortunate enough to see this movie on pre release last night and though i wasn't expecting to actually really enjoyed the movie for the most part the rescues and sea effects were amazing to watch and definitely provided edge of the seat tense moments probably all the more so knowing that there are guys who do this for a living the weaker parts of the movie revolve largely around using stereotypical set scenes i'm not going to spoil the movie but this really follows along the lines of an officer and a gentleman and those moments give it a little bit of a cheesy aftertaste br br like i said over all this movie is pretty good and worth checking out as long as you can get past the clichÃ©s
<START> this movie was extremely boring i only laughed a few times i decided to rent it when i noticed william shatner's name on the cover it's all about this little kid who gets picked on all the time by his classmates when wandering the streets looking for old ladies to assist he meets a prostitute she takes him to a club called the playground where he befriends several pimps when mayor tony gold shatner decides to take over the pimp business lil' pimp must lay down for his homies br br the animation isn't very good in this it looks like it was made with macromedia which i'm sure it was it doesn't suck it's just the sort of choppy flash animation that people have gotten used to over recent years the humor in this is not very good i didn't think any of it was funny
<START> i'm just filling this comment out because i couldn't stand the fact that a positive comment was featured on the complete information page i really think this to be the worst movie ever made in my country this is not only because of the terrible plot the crappy english and a tension curve that is as flat as our country no it is because this was a serious attempt to make a good action movie conform the hollywood standard it had to be the european action movie of the year for this purpose they even hired van huet actor in the academy award winning picture to do the job i don't mind bad films i can even enjoy them if they are b movies but i can't stand movies that are terrible but supposed to be a type movies
<START> or that's what the filmmakers would like you to believe anyway br br this movie tries sooo hard to be cool it's ridiculous everything from the look of the film the cinematography the editing the dialogue and the acting is geared in super cool mode from the get go just to make sure that no one misses how cool this film is there's a soundtrack of really cool rock n roll tunes and a twangy western surf tex guitar playing constantly throughout the film as a final reminder of how frickin cool this movie is all the actors have been instructed to speak in a hoarse voice because as we all know that's badass br br the plot if there indeed is one seems pretty straightforward but as someone else already pointed out the director and star of the film seems fiercely determined not to tell that story instead focusing on a plethora of naked babes and dialogue that's supposed to be badass but grows tired surprisingly quick did they have an contest to see how many times they could cram the words pussy and f ck and its derivatives in an 80 minute film br br this movie was absolutely horrible
<START> what we're given in this trying to be trendy film is a frat pack of college friends now approaching age 30 which we all know of course their generation thinks of as the new 20 consisting of four guys and a gal we have thrust at us the following types seemingly and frequent drug users along with one individual who is job successful and one who is trying to be they are all in their own way drifting while trying to find both a future and emotional happiness with one possibly two exceptions these are people this reviewer would definitely never care to come close to modeling myself after there is disappointment after disappointment after disappointment in almost all their lives except in the instance of one individual who appears on the way to finding it none appears headed toward emotional satisfaction in his her life and so about the only sincere moment in this film is when a knock at the door brings to the person answering it an unexpected and heartfelt i love you br br with only the exceptions mentioned these people are the kind hardly deserving or worthy of several hundred thousands of dollars being thrown away in presenting their stories br br ps writer director johnson definitely appears to have a problem with showing gay sexual scenes with no such problems in presenting more prolonged and revealing heterosexual ones why might that be br br
<START> i've seen the 1973 movie lost horizons and read many of the reviews for this movie i agree the move had many opportunities for improvement but unlike all those who are looking for the perfect movie with the perfect songs and the best acting i was looking for something a bit different and this movie gave it to me i watched this movie not as a critic but as a person looking for a little hope a little cheer a bit of a release from my everyday life and this is what i got you can be critical of the acting the singing and dialog but not what i look for when i go to a movie i look for a little release from my daily life a little time where i can sit back and imagine a better life where people love another and help another it's a shame we can't we enjoy a movie for what it tells us and quit picking it apart like an english teacher reading a fifth grade essay this may be very simplistic but really wouldn't it be nice
<START> far more sprightly and less stage and set bound than gene saks' previous efforts barefoot in the park 67 and the odd couple 68 cactus flower is not a work of art but compared to most of the tired farces from the 60's like the apartment how to murder your wife goodbye charlie a guide for the man divorce american style any wednesday kiss me stupid boys night out it's a masterpiece director saks and writer i a l diamond have effectively opened up abe burrows' broadway hit and the film benefits greatly from new york city location shooting and excellent performances from ingrid bergman and goldie hawn bergman is charming looks great and demonstrates a flair for comedy hawn in her oscar winning role has never been better or more appealing matthau is ok though it's hard to believe that hawn's character would be so enamored of him and in retrospect hawn's attempted suicide at the start of the film is out of character and unbelievable nonetheless the film has a plausible farcical set up and once it gets going it generates laugh rick lenz jack weston eve bruce and vito provide good support the film is likable and fun and hawn and bergman make you care
<START> inglorious as our local theater decided to display its title on their marquee minus the second word it is terrific cinema br br i don't hesitate to recommend this film to all but the over squeamish let them never know what they're missing br br i did hesitate to give it ten stars because of my experience of tarantino's previous films in every case save reservoir dogs they have improved with additional watching br br so although i gave it ten stars i did so reluctantly it leaves me no up to go to br br yes christoph waltz is the nazi we've all imagined the worst to be he is cultured sophisticated suave and most sadistic the kind of man who can make a glass of milk a threat and who puts out his cigarette abruptly in a strudel grinding it into the whipped cream as if he were grinding his heel into a victim br br to understand tarantino's films you need only have a sense of dialogue color and pacing the colors are as bright as necessary and when necessary brighter yet in the french farmhouse of the opening scene they are muted and dark but excessively so outside a brilliant sun is shining but in the one room of the house everything is bathed in shadows and black br br it is a brilliant setting for an interrogation by waltz as the jew hunter of the ss who dangles his host french farmer over the precipice of revealing what he cannot reveal numerous times then pulls him back with obsequious lines of friendship and understanding br br a second sadistic german well played by august diehl later functions as important actor in the final plot twist diehl's nazi major who has an ear for german accents is almost as good as waltz almost br br film classes will study much from this movie they should look lovingly at the superb pacing tarantino knows just how long to draw out a scene building suspense in the manner of hitchcock then at just the breaking point suddenly coming to a resolution br br for color look for a final shot at a french theater where its secretly jewish proprietor is staging a surprise for the upper reaches of nazi leadership br br we see her played by melanie laurent awaiting the hated german who will arrive for a film preview of the latest deutsch film masterpiece a propaganda piece about a german hero and his dubious accomplishments br br laurent is framed on a balcony reflected in the glass mirrors of the gorgeous theater her red lips and low cut dress reflecting everywhere the intensity of her designs on her guests it is a single shot that would be worth an entire film br br there are thankfully many more such images many more paced scenes of exquisite dialog and suspense br br in short see it i'm sure you'll see it again and again
<START> i know a lot of people would claim certain films as 'the worst of all time' but i think redneck stakes a claim for this prize a combination of quite dreadful acting from both mark lester and telly savales and plot progression that defies belief br br on telly was he drunk when he acted in this he seems to play a slurring laughing lunatic with no sense of conviction maybe he mixed his medication with his whiskey i don't know br br on mark lester a performance more wooden than a carpenter's workshop his clipped british tones don't belong in this film and his transformation from sheltered teenager to gangster's apprentice in 24 hours is mad and the strip scene with mosquito does not have any relevance to the plot at all perhaps the director likes this sort of thing br br plot logic when memphis and mosquito ambush the car at the beginning why doesn't mark lester's mother do or say anything to get her son out of the car before the loonies drive it off she just lets them all go without saying a word on the other hand redneck has to be seen you won't believe how bad it is otherwise
<START> great artists always suffered while they were young i could mention mozart and beethoven but that is not the point br br this movie was made by h g clouzot whose family wanted him to succeed in the law professions br br its main star is louis jouvet who studied and practiced as as pharmacist before becoming the greatest actor and also director of france's theater before and after wwii br br they both had health problems clouzot had tb while young jouvet had cardiac problems and died on a theater br br such events shape the character of men and women of course one might even say that today's artists are so poor because they had never suffered and fought for their lives br br to me this is the greatest of clouzot's movies wages of fear is greater in suspense diabolique also has more suspense and a better plot and is more about female evil br br quai des is more human clouzot was falsely accused by de entourage mostly communists and jews of collaboration with the nazis and banned from making films until until de left france's government in early 1946 de came back in 1958 as president br br the main characters are all good souls jenny l'amour may perform as a putain on stage but she is not a whore make synonyms of those words but they are not the same loves her husband and refuses the slight advances from her presumably lesbian friend dora the photographer br br maurice the husband is jealous and timid but runs away from the scene of the crime he is a coward because he fell in love with a woman and traded an eventually more upscale career for love br br antoine the detective interpreted by the great louis jouvet basically a stage actor performs in this french gray not noir as well as e g robinson in double indemnity shows flair for pseudo criminals tenderness for a negro son and compassion for the true author of the crime because he remembers that is father cleaned the latrines at some chÃ¢teau br br clouzot was capable of slapping an actor's face in order to put him in the right frame of mind but deep inside he was very human br br i have his horoscope in front of me he had venus in which means open heartedness devotion charity and altruism for those who do not believe in my most sincere apologies
<START> i attended the premier last night the movie started out with a bang perhaps due to pre premier excitement the audience laughed for about 15 minutes then most of us spent the rest of the time fighting off sleep this movie can not be compared to spinal tap or any of guest's work unless you want to say sons of provo is a wanna be gone awfully wrong it just fell flat it died it was painful the story went nowhere the jokes were bland even if you were a mormon and could get all of the inside jokes it felt like a waste of time there were two redeeming qualities acting was spot on and the songs were very clever for an lds audience only so my recommendations avoid the movie and if you are mormon buy the music cd
<START> i caught this movie late one night and never knew what hit me this was one of the most disturbing movies i have ever seen yet had me on the edge of my seat waiting to see what would happen next alan rickman is an excellent bad guy but this character beats all others i've never been so affected by a movie it's been 6 years and i still can't forget closet land
<START> again we're getting a melange of themes well covered by so many previous films the good and the bad son story courtesy east of eden the american marine hero story who doesn't consider himself to be one due to what he knows and the grieving wife potentially falling in love with another man story br br the mere fact of those stories being that ubiquitous isn't so much of a problem though because theoretically they could still be better presented and dealt with each time around no luck this time though as all three of those threads ultimately fall flat all the same br br as the bad son never really gets to talk to his father so that conflict is never resolved properly apart from the father kind of starting to appreciate the bad son thanks to the latter renovating the kitchen of the grieving wife now how satisfying is that br br next the surprisingly homecoming marine suspecting his wife of unfaithfulness conflict never gets resolved because he never really talks to the man under suspicion namely his own brother so once more we're handed a loose end here br br and finally the american military heroism hypocrisy theme where the marine is publicly considered a hero when due to the dirtiness of war he went through he shouldn't really be called one as to his own standards that third theme falls flat just the same because the movie ends right when for the first time he's just able to talk to his wife about what he went through where the real story would actually begin at that very point namely his process of recovery how that would look like and how he would finally face the family he'd have some major guilt to admit to all that all the really interesting bits are passed over and getting ignored br br so while story wise this film is a serious and i mean serious disappointment i'd still give it points for the impressive cast although no film should use maguire for a voice over because that belongs to spiderman especially a grown up gyllenhaal seems to fulfill all the expectations he aroused as a young and aspiring actor so much that i'd in fact love to see him entrusted with a really deep and demanding lead role of proper profile br br so while the cast really seems to do what they can i consider this film totally forgettable otherwise a shallow and ultimately pretentious utterly unsatisfying tear indeed message du jour to the writers we know the wounds already see the host of vietnam films you want to earn some credit show us a believable healing
<START> i thought that the interplay between crystal and devito was great the movie is rather off the wall but there are some unforgettable lines ramsey as momma is vulgar and over the top but also very funny and effective the character has to be pretty awful for why else would someone entertain thoughts of killing his mother now crystal's wife she is a slut whom everyone would like to receive her comeuppance thus her role though minor is also effective because it has to justify crystal's ridiculous case of writer's block while there are certainly dark moments the movie is not depressing and despite the murderous urges that the protagonists feel they have redeeming qualities too br br overall this is one of the funniest movies i can remember one that i don't mind watching over several times
<START> i was really excited about seeing cold mountain alas like most movies i'm really excited about seeing it was a letdown were it not for that miraculous invention called a dvd i think i would've put my head through the monitor i was so bored br br i closely watched kidman and law when they meet because their characters are supposedly destined for each other yet law's face showed anything but dumb struck love while kidman seemed to be counting the seconds until she could run back to her trailer character is pure granny clampett as if we don't get it cornball banjos mark her every entrance and so over the top it was all i could do not to laugh ironically her performance serves to highlight just how stiff as a board the leads are br br ada nearly because she freed her slaves we never learn why more perplexing is why didn't any of them stay on as ada and her father were unusually benevolent and as shown in one scene it was a very dangerous time for negroes as they're politely called here why didn't the neighbors teach her how to milk a cow or grow a crop heck why didn't she just sell the farm and go home and for all of ruby's practicality when she dispatches ada's evil rooster that kind of puts the kibosh on them having any more chickens br br by the time her beloved finally returns ada doesn't need him or anyone else which is the big joke indeed she may be physically intimate with but her real intimacy is with ruby who has turned ada into an babe version of herself did anyone else notice how they walked down the hill holding hands happy as two peas in a pod as they left behind br br i doubt that recognized this as he was too busy making an anti bush movie tells us he is like every fool sent out to fight with a flag and a lie and ada's father says i imagine god is weary of being called down on both sides of an argument these observations are historically inaccurate and insulting while slavery was the basis of the economy the reasons for the war were more complex it was incomprehensible for a soldier to think that the cause was a lie in fact most in the rank and file were indifferent to it for filmmakers to stamp their views onto a period where such views were foreign to those who lived in that time is beyond obnoxious br br structurally the film is choppy and episodic law and kidman are miscast and have zero chemistry the script is little more than half baked dialog and an egregious bunch of clichÃ©s and banalities small moments like a bag of diamonds ugh
