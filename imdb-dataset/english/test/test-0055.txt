<START> this is possibly the worst movie i've ever seen it was horribly done it didn't flow it was very choppy because of that many people didn't understand the movie at all i had to watch this movie several times before i got an idea about what was happening ok its like this a kid stole someones car and while running from the police he totals it for some reason the cops let him off and he has to face his parents who sent him to live with his uncle out in the wilderness there he meets a girl who loves to rock climb and he gets into the sport and has to beg his uncle to let him enter a contest for climbing and yeah thats about it like i said horrible movie
<START> i was a huge fan of the original robocop br br but to say i was disappointed by this first sequel would be an understatement br br the problems are many br br glossy though the film may look there are plenty of bloopers on screen for all to see wires cameramen etc something i find wholly unacceptable from someone of irvin pedigree br br robocop has become a robot there is no spark of humanity to be found in the character here a true disappointment when one considers that his soul had returned by the end of the first movie here his attitude shows no human side and makes him hard to sympathise with br br caine is a poor villain ok i know from the first film was better than the average mainly thanks to kurtwood smith's performance but the usually solid tom noonan creates a character who you couldn't care less about one way or the other br br what's happened to the old man i appreciate that he didn't get to where he is by being nice but the change in his character here is nothing short of dumbfounding in the first movie it's made clear he despises dick jone's tactics and attitude and yet here he's no better than jones it makes no sense br br doctor is a poor replacement for bob morton's charismatic if unpleasant resident genius br br the action sequences save the sequence where murphy is stuck to the side of caine's truck are harsh and nasty and repel rather than entertain br br and finally what is with the musical score don't tell me couldn't have done it simply because he was working on total recall at the time a series tv or movie soundtrack is part of its personality part of its character when you remove that it harms the familiarity of the characters we're watching so it's bad enough but shame on leonard rosenman his score here is lurid camp and downright cringe worthy br br the story has its moments to be fair there's a lot of originality in here but it tries too many new things to take in with one film hob is a well realised villain and the only truly dis likable villian in the move thumbs up to gabriel damon there br br the final showdown between robocop and robocop 2 is fun as well br br but for the vast majority of its overlong running time this is a serious disappointment
<START> i usually steer clear of film festivals and don't enjoy slap stick comedy but i must say that this picture was great i immediately recognized david from the tv show numbers and lorraine bracco roseanne arquette and karen black were at their usual best this is comedy at an incredibly high level with visual spoken and satirical interludes that kept the audience and me laughing throughout a rather deep rooted plot br br kudos to mr for dealing with a delicate but real subject in a manner that can be enjoyed but fully absorbed by his audience at every level of intellect the plot stays intact throughout the film and the comedic relief adds to the message without being laid on so thick as to distort the blending of segways is done beautifully and the overall product is wonderfully tasteful br br i can definitely state that this film is one that will go a long way and should be seen by audiences of all ages the problem is real and so is the powerful impact of this production
<START> strangers with candy overacts in all the wrong context the situations are just not funny with the cheesy voices and bad low brow comedy timing the clear attempt at dry black dark humour is obvious and it fails to deliver on all elements of a good joke br br with a high cringe factor and low laugh ratio i was shocked this show went pass the first season i personally like scrubs the office 30 rock trailer park boys pulling peep show simpsons family guy and i know what your thinking these shows aren't weird at all so some other good shows i've seen are jam garth marenghi's darkplace the book group asylum and snuff box which are original with dry black dark humour satire and are all at least 5 10 br br garth marenghi's darkplace especially is cheap looking overacted and weird however the context is thought out and works to make it really out there and entertaining too
<START> this is a textbook example of how hollywood didn't doesn't trust moviegoers and panders to its big name stars the character of christian is completely re written the anti semitism noah faces from his own army unit is virtually eliminated michael's story is changed significantly and the end result is to decimate the power and terrible beauty of the book i almost wish i hadn't even seen it because of the ability of movies sounds and images to resonate so powerfully in your brain i would have much rather just been left with the impression of the book the book could have been written today it is that honest and brave the movie neither my advice skip the movie read the book
<START> an excellent story well told by the film maker the interactions between the man and the leopard brought many questions to the viewers mind about just who was being humane the humans killed for no reason the animals only to survive at the end of the movie you were left wondering just who the real hero of the movie was a well told story the human actor did an excellent job but the leopard stole every scene it was in
<START> this is without a doubt the most poorly thought out movie in history the invention gags by carrot top are some of the most awful attempts to be funny in recorded history i am not familiar with his other work but if it is half as bad as this then i am just going to cry i give this movie 1 out of 30 billion stars and may god have mercy on the souls of those responsible
<START> i have read several reviews that ask the question why was this film made i myself found that question looming in my mind as the hour and twenty minute feature seemed to drag near the middle only to give off the sensation that it was picking up steam at the end when in actuality it was doing nothing of the sort so why was this film made i think that is a great question for those watching og to ask themselves this reviewer is proud of director erik jensen for giving us this powerful image of hope brotherhood and inspiration with this all male choir but i do not think that jensen did enough to bring a gripping story to the table let me pose this question to you do audience members need more in a documentary than just a straight forward story to maintain interest my answer is yes and this is where jensen failed og was a good documentary but it was far from great jensen did a horrible job with the story and dedication of the subjects it was great to hear the songs but over time those songs seemed dull overwhelming and a bit precocious from the opening scene where our men are singing their hearts out in a blinding snow i knew that i was hooked but as the film developed i lost interest why jensen never took us the audience members to the next level he kept the playing field level and ultimately hurt the overall tone of the film was this a movie about the music or about the men in the choir the world may never know br br again i would like to state that jensen did a phenomenal job of finding an interesting story about this group of men who have definitely seen hard times and how they coped with that through music but it was as if the all male choir were a bunch of the most boring men ever created jensen gave us the music superbly but it was the characters the subjects that i knew nothing about by the end of the film in the mix we had a 97 year old man who still had his driver's license we had a large man in a tub singing classic american songs we had old men who were once heartthrobs in their youth we had some tension between the youth of the choir and the veteran singers and we even had an ex drug addict that had only been clean for eleven years did jensen develop these interesting stories at all nope he left them on the table it was obvious that these singers were willing to talk further about it see the political man who missed his political days but jensen seemed to clear away from those heartfelt moments and head straight back into interesting places that he could have the choir sing to me the music was defined at the beginning of the film i wanted to be introduced and hear the stories of these individual men they were all captivating yet jensen seemed to ignore them completely br br by ignoring the major subjects of this documentary jensen became unsuccessful in creating any sort of tension towards the end without giving the ending away i felt like jensen was coloring in the lines instead of being bold outside the lines he chose to create no moment of sympathy emotion nervousness or sadness jensen took our subjects from point a to point b to point c without asking us to become involved in any way shape or form i can see how national sentiment had made this film into a huge success in norway but for everyone else watching i e me more was necessarily needed i wanted to feel for these guys i wanted to know if they were going to do well as they traveled or just find themselves loved in their own city there was no story mostly in part to no development of the subjects when you watch modern documentaries oddly this film was made in 2001 you want it to play out similar to any hollywood feature film you want suspense realism and drama alas with og you get nothing of the sort br br overall i must ask the question again why was this film made my final answer alex is that jensen wanted to show how troubling times and a changing economy can still produce happiness in even the coldest places of earth i think that jensen wanted to show human dedication and how something as simple as singing can unite a population with that said jensen demonstrated that perfectly in this film but he did not create a good documentary when you make a film of this nature i feel that you must look within the group examine the choir participants and hear each one of their stories to bring about an ending that will grip your heart the only thing that this film gripped was my attention span as it attempted to leave the room at rocket speed again i do not want to sound negative about this film because the music was excellent and the men singing did bring about a feeling of honesty but i needed more with documentaries becoming a bigger staple of the film community one expects a bit more than what og handed to us i want to see reality and people not just another song and dance routine br br grade out of
<START> this is an excellent anime movie it is well animated has a good intricate plot and very good music i understand that some may think of it as a little long but i think that it is a good length and the animation is good traditional anime br br three characters br br the way they use is masterly for example the body double showing up at all these locations adds to the ominous tone of the movie the design of is good too the way he looks as a monk and in the end scene the armour he is wearing br br the old man is down to earth and a very likable character when meets him it's a turning point in the movie br br the shinobi who infiltrated clan saves life twice he stays in the background most of the movie though but he is really one of the heroes of the movie br br the plot the plot is good it is traditional without being unoriginal the historical time it is acted out in is interesting the meiji restoration the treasure is sought after by to restore the shogunate while when finds it he uses it to help the anti shogunate forces overthrow the shogunate br br the way tricks is interesting and has sort of a hamlet feel to it there is also a sweet irony to the fact that if had not gotten to become a shinobi i don't think that he had been able to kill him in the end maybe by firearm but not hand to hand combat weapons br br the plot with all the death makes it mostly very dark but there's some light moments when we see some of childhood memories all in all it's a good dark intricate plot br br the music the opening theme for example is very good with the electric guitar and drums they occasionally in that piece use what i believe to be drums but i'm not sure br br there is a lot of good music like the one played while they are traveling to the shinobi i believe the piece is called and has an incredible flute in it the flute might be a pan flute but more probably a br br the end theme no is calm and delicate the vocals are beautiful and so is the song in general br br the animation br br the animation while good is not perfect and the blood that runs down the characters do sometimes appear to be orange the transitions are interesting and i think some transitions are very nice one example of a nice transition is when and the shinobi are running there is the sunset in the background and the music is playing the transition is simple but effective and has a nice feeling too it br br my final words i think that the plot the animation the music and the characters make this into one of the best anime movies i have ever seen
<START> i walked out of this movie and i did this only one time before with the australian movie sweetie close to 20 years ago after about three minutes i felt like killing the camera man and just couldn't believe that this film actually showed anywhere and guess what was nominated for two independent spirit awards what how realistic the dialog might be i will never use the word dude again who wants to listen to these conversations i don't go to the movies to be annoyed but that's all i got the only good thing i came away with was the realization that if this movie can make it to sundance and other festivals anybody can well wait that might not be a good thing after all
<START> i saw this movie the day it opened in nyc at the ziegfield at the time madonna was not quite the cultural icon she is now she had a couple of hits was very good in seeking susan and i had tickets to see her in concert at giants stadium br br who's that girl gives madonna an actual role to play which is not just a variation of her own personality she does the madcap heroine routine better than you might think griffin dunne is very well cast as the man around to witness all the shenanigans br br the story involves a huge cat named murray a bride to be who has slept with every cabbie in nyc a mean father in law and a key there are a lot of car chases and cops trailing their path all the elements of a screwball comedy intact br br sir john mills is seen briefly he shares a glass of champagne with the leads and has the greatest apartment on the upper west side complete with a rain forest and everything br br compared to most madonna movies the ones i've been able to tolerate anyway this is fantastic on its own its not that bad 6 10 br br ps the concert was lousy
<START> afraid of the dark left me with the impression that several different screenplays were written all too short for a feature length film then spliced together clumsily into this frankenstein's monster br br at his best the protagonist lucas is creepy as hard as it is to draw a bead on the secondary characters they're far more sympathetic br br afraid of the dark could have achieved mediocrity had it taken just one approach and seen it through and had it made lucas simply psychotic and confused instead of ghoulish and off putting i wanted to see him packed off into an asylum so the rest of the characters could have a normal life
<START> okay some other people have commented that this isn't an action flick so i don't need to rehash that even though i just did this isn't exactly a let down in fact it's nice on occasion to see an actor try something different but unfortunately this isn't one of those occasions br br now the story non existent this film lacks in storyline almost as much as did sure they throw in a couple environmentalist no not even environmentalist something else tidbits here and there to please seagal being that that's what he's into this doesn't make a story not even close now the ending even those amongst us who actually liked this film the ending you have to admit it was a bit much or a lot stupid br br now from what i understand this was a direct to video film at least in the states but this is even too good for this one this piece of garbage should have been cable only on tbs or starz late night
<START> br br won't be long on this movie the first half an hour was one of the most boring i have had to face since i've started watching movies the story didn't advanced nothing was explained about any of the characters it felt like a non movie a lot of people had already left the audience at this point br br a lot of the scene were totally unjustified and unexplained br br the director should have studied film a bit more to know that each sequence each scene has to make the story go forward he never did that br br the supposedly funny moments were contrived and only a few people laughed people with a weird sense of humor i guess br br prize of the jury in cannes 2002 don't know what the jury was thinking about probably the correct effect br br i would have loved to love it the disappointment was therefore even bigger br br you have to see it to believe it but wait for the video
<START> well i've watched this movie for over 25 years now and it's still almost as interesting as when i first saw it it is definitely one of the most unique films ever made br br i still think martin sheen got dissed big time in the billing too he dominates the film yet gets lesser billing than marlon brando who only appears in the last 30 minutes of this 2 hours 17 minutes film theatrical version how unfair is that br br sheen is fantastic in here especially his narration which runs throughout it's one of the best narrations if not the best i have ever heard in a movie his voice is just haunting as he relates his thoughts on this incredible nightmare like adventure i never fail to appreciate his work in this movie br br the other thing that strikes me about the film over the years are the number of memorable scenes ones i have never forgotten such as br br sheen losing it in his hotel room in the movie's first scene robert duvall and the totally out of place surfing scenes and then the ensuing attack with wagner's dramatic classical music blaring out of the helicopters the playboy bunny entertaining the troops frederic forrest being freaked out seeing a tiger close up in the jungle the weird scenes on the long riverboat ride the appearance of hippie journalist dennis hopper greeting the crew in cambodia and then brando's bizarre character it goes on and on with strange scenes br br that's not to say i enjoyed everything no there are a few very unpleasant scenes such as the one in which an ox is sliced in half can't watch that anymore an innocent family is slaughtered on a small boat by sheen's young stoned out crew and the crew is a little too goofy at times then there is the huge amount of profanity led by way too many f words br br so there is a lot of good and a lot of bad things in this movie for almost anyone who watches this one thing for sure it is a film you will remember
