<START> an interesting movie with jordana brewster as a young woman who travels to europe in an attempt to find out what became of her older sister cameron diaz who mysteriously died years earlier brewster is very good and keeps you involved despite some unrealistic plotting such as having her find and start a romance with her dead sister's much older boyfriend christopher eccleston still mostly good grade b
<START> the movie had no excitement and does not have anything to hold your interest the movie had nothing exiting funny dramatic or romantic about it how can a movie be romantic if the girl never gets a the right guy until the last seen in the movie than the movie ends maybe part ii will be romantic but somebody else will have to risk wasting their money i have nothing else to say other than do not waste your time the movie had nothing exiting funny dramatic or romantic about it the movie had nothing exiting funny dramatic or romantic about it the movie had nothing exiting funny dramatic or romantic about it the movie had nothing exiting funny dramatic or romantic about it
<START> le rouge is a very good film though it does suffer a bit since there have already been similar films in all too many ways the movie is reminiscent of previous heist films such as rififi and grand slam and many others so while director melville and the actors did great jobs it all seems like a case of dÃ©jÃ  vu because of this i had a hard time giving this excellent film a higher score br br the one unusual aspect of the film is how the crooks get together instead of the usual means vogel escapes from prison and just happens to meet up with corey a career criminal just released from prison both are a good match but having them both work in parallel for much of the film until they meet was a clever touch apart from that as expected much of the movie concerns the meticulous details in planning and executing the crime i also appreciated how the film showed the crooks in such a cold and detached manner something relatively common in french crime films but rare among american films until recent years br br overall extremely well crafted and worth seeing if you don't mind that it seems a tad repetitive you'll see some fine acting direction and a lot of great tension
<START> a unique blend of musical film noir and comedy with a few sex scenes thrown in for good measure the only other film i can think of with a fairly similarly wild and madcap mixture of themes and clichÃ©s is the french movie billy ze kick but that has a more surreal and quirky approach br br not that this film would not be surreal or quirky the humour is at times quite subtle at other times blatantly in your face and often crossing the border to offensiveness to give an example in the post coital chit chat with a prostitute our hero max encourages her to reveal who was responsible for a recent murder using the words los literally this phrase means shoot in german and that is exactly what a hidden assassin does in response in other words this beautiful lady was sacrificed for a pun br br is also one of the very rare examples of films with funny sex scenes larry's romance is accompanied by the song ich will i want more while the song perfectly underpins the action the meaning of its words changes a couple of times hinting at the end at larry's inability of providing any further service the film's main love scene between max and bettina kant lacks such subtlety this is jaw dropping stuff especially when singing slowly into moaning of course all in the rhythm of the music br br unmissable unless you are one of the easily offended
<START> this film is one of my childhood memories seeing the muppets at the height of their popularity heading hollywood singing and dancing with miss piggy her beloved kermit fozzie bear doing his best as everyone's manager and a generous cast of extras delivering a film that turned out to be okey br br kermit's melancholy ukulele number rainbow connection was nominated for an oscar that year but was beat out by norma it goes like it goes i'll pick kermit's song any day get the kids and enjoy this timeless fantasy someday they'll find it the rainbow connections the lovers the dreamers and me
<START> wow i picked this off the rental shelf because i loved robert carlyle and jonny lee miller in ' this is a phenomenal movie it has action romance suspense intrigue and wit when i wasn't laughing i was at the edge of my seat this is definitely a film i would recommend to people with an appreciation for intelligent dialogue and a fresh perspective of the 18th century this film has everything to keep me happy
<START> just reading the reviews of this wonderful bbc mini series reminded me how much i enjoyed this when it was first broadcast many years ago at the time i remember waiting with anticipation for the next installment and fell in love with john bowe and janet mcteer two talented actors that we don't see enough of on tv or cinema these days br br i have tried without success to obtain several of the fantastic dramas from the past including the 1973 version of jane eyre and the 1972 version of anne of green gables all wonderful timeless classic stories which sadly the bbc seem to have no intention of releasing on video or dvd if anyone learns otherwise i would love to hear from them br br in the meantime we will have to content ourselves with our recollections of how wonderful they were
<START> that's a bad raunchy predictable tacky salacious soap opera the best of everything is just such a guilty pleasure for me something along the lines of valley of the dolls i mean best has everything somebody gets pregnant out of wedlock when's the last time you heard that phrase there are affairs everywhere drinking backstabbing jealousy and even a tragic but not altogether unexpected death br br caroline bender hope lange and mike rice the delicious stephen boyd are the of the goings on their chemistry is immediate and is the glue that keeps this film from becoming too fragmented br br suzy parker the off the chart gorgeous ex fashion model appears as gregg adams an aspiring stage actress a role that according to any biography i've ever read about her was apparently not much of a stretch but parker does a surprisingly credible job here more than holding her own in a couple of scenes opposite louis who plays david savage probably took this role for the money and the special screen credit because he was clearly headed down the aging star has been road br br diane baker is fine as naive gullible april morrison martha hyer as barbara has a particularly juicy storyline and film legend joan crawford chews her usual serving of scenery as amanda farrow another role like savage that crawford likely took for the paycheck br br there is some obviously dated dialog and plot devices this is 1959 and the predictability of the soap opera genre but if you like a good soap as i do the best of everything will more than satisfy you
<START> it would be so easy to dismiss an alien abduction movie before even seeing it as i did but this is well worth a look if you think about it its not an easy subject matter to handle but this film manages to suspend disbelief which in itself is a feat for such a way out subject casting the main character as a doctor was a sensible move which lends credence to his willingness to believe in the possibility of alien abduction vosloo plays it very sensitively involving us in his pain and confusion at the weird events that befall himself and his wife special effects are used sparingly but to shocking effect and at times the movie is totally gripping but sadly there are a couple of points where the plot wanders and leaves some confusion also after building to a tense climax the ending is something of a let down the supporting characters were unnecessarily weak the alien hunter or menacing the psychiatrist which also served to detract br br but all in all it raised some interesting issues amongst which was a telling line how do think animals feel when we experiment on them br br the concept of lost time was also thought provoking
<START> beyond is simply marvelous from the traumatic opening to the uplifting ending you will be amazed at how well put together this film is patricia arquette amazingly portrays laura bowman who we meet as a shut down and quit despondent young doctor unable to deal with her grief over the loss of her husband and son throughout the course of the film as she is trapped in burma witnesses the democratic and massacres in the capital city of flees for her life and saves her tour u life she is regaining her will to live this may seen contrived or heavy handed it is not john boorman a master at spiritual and emotional conflict paints the film with broad strokes and often uses symbolism to capture laura's emotional state and physical predicament patricia arquette as usual gives a wonderfully convincingly and believable performance as the emotionally wounded laura what arquette does amazingly in any role that she plays is give us a window into her character's heart without words every time she is given a close up in the film the audience is given insight into her character she does not need to speak to convey emotions or be over the top some critics were harsh on arquette's performance in the film when it opened on august 25 1995 that she was flat or dull in the role i found her characterization dead on staying well away from the melodramatics that typically are part of an actor's performance when having a personally tragedy take place she is on shock and is reserved about her feelings that is just as normal as screaming lashing out at those around you i am hoping that warner brothers releases this title on dvd very soon with arquette's hugely successful nbc drama medium bringing her to household name status not to mention an emmy win and now 2007 nomination it would be in the studio's best interest to do so hopefully there will be extras with the alternate ending do not by pass by this film it is one that you will certainly not forget after seeing
<START> not near as well made as the guinea pig flicks it was inspired by flowers of flesh and blood or devil's experiment and not conveying any real philosophy this video feature which is barely feature length adds hardcore sex with mosaic censoring to its inspiration the special make up effects which include stomach slitting and disembowelment are pretty good if overlit the amateur feel of the production is a distraction it all looks cheap and lazy the lighting is harsh and the sound and editing are sloppy the simple story involves a porno actress who ends up starring in a real snuff movie just when she gets tired of being abused the real abuse begins in the film's hero scene an actor cuts the woman's stomach open in graphic close up stuffs his member inside it and proceeds to do his thing i didn't find psycho the snuff reels shocking on the contrary i found it to be a desperate attempt by amateurs to one up guinea pig and its bloody ilk interestingly this was distributed by aroma a leading fetish producer
<START> this is another case of hollywood arrogance presuming to eclipse french style the original mon pere ce heros was one of the most charming films of 1991 so naturally the accountants in hollywood thought they could hire depardieu and phone the rest in they did however take the of hiring francis veber to write an english version albeit one utilising virtually every word of the original depardieu brings his gallic charm and katherine heigl shows all the promise that is now paying off the thing is that when the french make a sort of lolita lite they get away with it because the 'dirty french thinking works in their favour here the hollywood idea of lightweight subtlety is to have depardieu totally unaware that his daughter has let it be known he is actually her lover prevailed upon to play and song 'something launch into a spirited version of thank heaven for little girls see the original
<START> 4 out of 10 br br a somewhat unbelievable storyline with some haunted house type shocks that really don't fit in br br gary performance is very erratic not so much the quality of the performance but the consistency his character does not behave in a consistent manner sometimes calm relaxed methodical thoughtful sometimes violent loud almost crazed it's just not believable br br have many 80s movies dated badly will they be more enjoyable 20 years from now br br
<START> i saw this on cable someone had to lose their job for this one for air just because a movie is made does not mean it has to be shown savage instinct should be shown in all film classes it is the perfect template for how to not make a movie the editing alone is so jumbled you'll think it was assembled by a team of trained poorly monkeys traveling across canyon road in the back of a jeep blindfolded and drunk the audio is often not legible acting i can't call anything i saw here acting reciting hmmm can't call it that either failing that works all that being said it is hilarious i cannot stress enough that there is not one redeemable factor in this film other than the hilarity derived from it's own incredible ineptness fun in a strictly masochistic sort of way watch it if you dare
<START> i've been writing hardboiled crime fiction for a number of years now when a writer develops a story he always has a character actor in mind to bring the story to life last weekend i found a new one in paul playing uncle benny in eddie monroe this was a slick film highlighted by presence both on and off the screen as his voice over narration is also heard i also especially liked the actress playing benny's niece and eddie's ex wife although everyone did a fine job in this exciting movie about playing with bad guys and the double crossing that goes with it a nice job all around and mr shined brightest he's gotta be my tony someday
