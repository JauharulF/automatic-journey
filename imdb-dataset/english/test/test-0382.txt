<START> whoever wrote the screenplay for this movie obviously never consulted any books about lucille ball especially her autobiography i've never seen so many mistakes in a biopic ranging from her early years in celoron and jamestown to her later years with desi i could write a whole list of factual errors but it would go on for pages in all i believe that lucille ball is one of those inimitable people who simply cannot be portrayed by anyone other than themselves if i were lucie arnaz and desi jr i would be irate at how many mistakes were made in this film the filmmakers tried hard but the movie seems awfully sloppy to me
<START> this western musical comedy is not one of the best of the genre i have seen i found it much too slow it just plodded along to the inevitable end i also found it disjointed i couldn't wait for it to be over randolph scott is the headliner here and lloyd bridges also stars but for my money money edgar buchanan is the best of the bunch buchanan appeared in many westerns in his day many times providing comic relief as he does in this picture i also liked ann dvorak as rita otherwise though i can't think of much to recommend this movie the movie is based on a novel by ernest who also wrote the novel stagecoach which was mad into a movie of the same name in 1939 and remade in 1966 and again in 1986 the 1939 version of stagecoach is in my mind one of the best movies ever made anyway as for town my vote is a 3 10
<START> this movie is so dull i spent half of it on imdb while it was open in another tab on netflix trying to find out if anyone thought it was one of the more boring ponderous gimmicky films they've ever seen a warning i actually could not finish it so these are my impressions up to minute 54 br br keira knightly gets loads of screen time as others have mentioned her mother penned the script perhaps during some sort of drug induced stupor wherein utter inanities and emotionless statements about emotions sounded like interesting dialogue and it seems that the film is a showcase for knightly oops although i agree she is lovely with her teeth her barred teeth cause me anxiety and fear i found her reactions forced and poorly timed as in william or dylan does something cute pause hahaha from k with dimples and a playful arm jab like a minute too late what and she cannot match cillian murphy's intensity he somehow manages to really look at her and look as though he is fascinated by her and falling in love with her whereas she seems totally disconnected almost like she is interacting with a mirror that must be torture acting opposite someone who isn't delivering the same level of energy as you know what else is torture this movie br br knightly does look stunning during her cyclical i've got 1940s pin curls and a hot dress watch me sing shots but what's the point is she an altar or an actress when she talks it's bizarre ya going this makes me confused because the accent is so mixed up and yet so thick at times i have no idea what she's saying or maybe fell asleep if no one knows who vera was or cares or few do was it so important to give her this supposed welsh accent it distracts from all the rest of the action just kidding there br br this movie seems like someone dreamed a movie maybe after reading a little dylan thomas before bed but instead of adapting to the waking world was like man that dream was so interesting and tried to replicate it then someone else cautioned your script needs work nothing that happens furthers a story or creates necessity and the writer is all but that's the way i dreamed it it's like the rambling fantasy of a child one of those wild and meandering yarns they spin to get your attention and then william went to a war and then vera had a baby and then some blond chick drank too much and there were so many airplanes and pin curls and everyone had ruby red lips and br br as for the dylan thomas character so bland that's all i can call him why didn't he have any lines in this goofy biopic all he does is drink beer and smoke cigarettes and roll around with sienna miller who is so wild and artistic she'll do a cartwheel in public get outta here you crazy poets i realize she is not a poet but she and thomas are like this one nauseating unit of crazy guys crazy times like a lukewarm sailor and from wild at heart someone asks in the message board if they should buy this film i say do it leave it on your shelf and only utilize it as a weapon to children the elderly or lingering house guests br br p s to murphy's character when someone asks if you were in the sh you can say yes because your war scenes appear to have been shot at a landfill
<START> this really is by far the worst movie i've ever seen in my whole life i'm approaching 47 the description on the back of the cover equaled the scrolling text right at the begin of the movie the further plot was nil and even a bunch of corpses would have shown more life in their acting i viewed the full length of it and was really relieved when the final character's death signalled the end of my suffering the location was either some kind of vaults or a grimy beach i suppose that home video equipment served as camera and the lighting was sub standard the dialogues were uninspired and devoid of meaning as were the actors faces which brings me to the topic make up by the looks of it they got it as gimmicks in some teen magazines my first own make up or similar what made me buy the dvd was the name lovecraft printed on the cover the only connection with this brilliant mind's works was the use of the name necronomicon which was wrongly translated as book of light the 4 70 euro i paid for this dvd were a complete loss for the dvd went into the recycling box without any further ado
<START> they make everything too easy in this film it sort of reminded me of indiana jones where he hides on the outside of a submarine during an ocean crossing everybody knows everything that's going on it's just real easy to get anyplace you want in the white house i don't even know why i watched half of it because i like charlie sheen and donald sutherland i expect the usual ability to dodge bullets from every angle and be able to run faster than a motorcycle usually it's faster than a car in a garage or a it was silly mostly and i didn't even know then had a ten story elevator in the white house anyway anything conspiratorial is always interesting
<START> we were excited to rent this one after reading a few reviews and seeing that it scored so highly here well we got it home and could not believe what we saw its basically comes off as if its written by some hard up perverted old guy who could not help inserting his sexual frustrations and fantasies into an anime film that really lacks in plot and humor the main character is all over the place one moment he is like an immature little kid the next moment he is mature and intelligent then heroic then a perverted stalker br br the worst part is all of the out of place sexual content i have no problem with sex and dig a movie that has some good sexual energy but this is just presented in a way that is creepy nipple slips close ups of a girls crotch many times in white panties or a swimsuit it was totally out of place and it seemed as if the person who wrote it was trying to live out some fantasies through his cartoon characters br br we were expecting something of a mature nature but we just kept looking at each other and asking what the heck the point of this was besides jiggling cartoon boobs and poor dialogue if you want to see some cartoon characters cleavage and this is for you if you are looking for something beyond that this movie was empty the characters and dialogue were just plain irritating br br
<START> in 4 words captain mandolin was completely out of tune with the book the novel provided sufficient character background to understand the relationships and personal challenges the characters needed to overcome the script writer chose to ignore the details in ignoring them e g the priest's role initially as a buffoon but later as a spiritual leader the fiancee's inability to read until taught by a socialist rebel the bomb experts advice to and his eventual ironic demise the story and characters fall flat br br this was the first movie that i've ever walked out of midway through interesting cinematography great actors do not make a film the story does
<START> father hood is an entertaining tale of an unwilling father who is definitely a hood patrick swayze plays jack charles who is a hood always on the look out for the one big score that is going to put him on easy street his wife died while he was is prison and his two kids were put in foster care when he got out he thought they were probably better off in foster care Â besides he still had to score his fortune his daughter kathleen charles played wonderfully by sabrina lloyd breaks out of a foster care institution that is abusing the kids and money that is suppose to be being spent on the kids she hunts down her father tells him about how bad the place was and that her brother eddie charles played by brian bonsall just a little 7 year old kid was being moved to the institution that she had just broken out of and convinces her father to kidnap him the three start off on an adventure across country all the while jack keeps telling himself that he has to get rid of the kids patrick swayze is really good in this comedy playing a hood probably a little understatement for this criminal character who is similar to his johnny castle character of dirty dancing except jack is appropriately funnier in this comedy and more optimistic than johnny castle swayze is funny and rally does comedy pretty well halle berry plays kathleen mercer who is a reporter trying to get at the truth of the foster care system who becomes ally diane ladd plays rita the con artist mother of jack charles
<START> this film truly was poor i went to the theatre expecting something exciting and instead was afforded the opportunity to hone my guess the next plot twist before it happens skills seriously the plot was written with an extra thick crayon so everyone could see nothing was truly shocking in fact even the gore was met with such complete suspension of belief that it really didn't add up to much br br the excessive wise cracking and cops talking shop at the crime scenes made it seem all the more phony and the scene where lambert's character is struggling with the clues and reaches his investigative epiphany goes to great lengths to indicate the level of intellect expected from the audience little br br probably the most annoying aspect of the cinematography was the x files treatment every building in the film whether it's the precinct building or a house at noon or a hospital was suffering from a lack of any discernible lighting not to mention a lack of in the case of the hospital i don't recall a single scene when someone flipped on a light switch it sure would have been nice br br mr lambert really isn't an oscar grade actor so i suppose you have to take this film for what it's worth in the end i've reached the conclusion that the only thing that would make this film seem more entertaining is to watch it after watching the warriors otherwise you're left with an effort that is dull and unoriginal and nowhere near the equal of films of the genre such as silence of the lambs
<START> i haven't seen every single movie that burt reynolds has ever made but this one which i've just finished watching for the third time may very well be his best it suffers only from some slow stretches burt perhaps tried to make it more arty than it should have been on the other hand he managed to avoid many of the usual cliches in the presentation of the tough cop role he plays notice for example the scene in which he attempts to kiss rachel ward for the first time or the fear he expresses just before the final showdown with the indestructible henry silva in fact silva and those two ninja assassins are three of the most memorable villains of cop thrillers of the 80s the film also has some offbeat touches a surprising amount of humor a brutal and gripping fistfight and many well directed shots
<START> it s funny how instinct warns you of something for example as soon as the company credits read nu image i knew instinctively i d seen a really crap film by them somewhere before but couldn t remember where nevertheless i just knew judge and jury was going to be crap and it was maybe i m psychic br br mild spoilers br br the opening is rather violent with several people getting blown away for no more reason than being in the wrong place at the wrong time i don t know about you but i m geting slightly fed up with exploitive violence onscreen nowadays along with bad language especially if it s spouted by actors as bad as the ones in this movie anyway the plot revolves around the bad dude getting executed and coming back to reek revenge on the man who shot his wife oh did i mention the bad dude and his wife murdered a couple of people on their wedding night yeah he s a serious badass mofo in fact he s so bad and i don t mean the acting i ll get to that in a moment that he s impossible to take seriously and this is before he s executed only to return as elton john elvis a french chef etc i wonder if keith david got paid for this because he looks he s having so much fun on screen that s the only reason he s playing the role what a pity this reviewer didn t have any fun whatsoever watching judge and jury hey maybe the producers could send me keith s fee gawd only knows i deserve it br br i disliked this movie a lot as if you t guessed and my main beef isn t with the stupid plot or the cheap production values but with its attitude to violence if like me you ve had a wine bottle cracked over your head or been kicked in the ribs very hard several times you ll know violence is an obscene painful thing but judge and jury will have you believe that if you re thrown through a window crash through some and fall twenty odd feet onto a table not only will you be unhurt but you ll be able to outrun a couple of rabid devil dogs it could of course be argued that any film starring sly arnie or bruce also suffers from this same dishonest showing of violence but with judge and jury it yanked my chain
<START> appalling shallow materialistic nonsense how women and gay men can enjoy this rubbish is beyond me no self respecting man would ever want to be with one of these neurotic gold diggers what is even more concerning is that so many reviewers say they relate to the women on the show if that is the future of women lord help us all showing your independence and being respected as equals with men should not be about spreading your legs every three seconds with a different man i think this demeans women and does not do them justice but this review is no rant against women fans of this show say it is hilarious and but every time i have watched this show i have just struggled to stay awake despite the narrative of the reporter woman at no point in this show is there even anything close to something that could be considered a rational thought so it's not entertaining and it's not informative so why would you bother watching it one out of ten stars
<START> this cosy middle class sitcom became the subject of much hatred by the new breed of talented comedians in the 1980s such as ben elton did it deserve such malice well terry and june was never clever it was never a well written tale with different threads which intersect at the conclusion it was the show your mother and father and probably grandparents watched they chuckled rather than laughed but they were never likely to be offended by the show so the fact that it never challenged them was immaterial br br one foot in the grave suffered initially because it appeared at first sight to be just another terry and june br br a few days after the death of terry scott an episode was broadcast on terrestrial tv and that has been its final outing there have been few repeats of the show on any tv channel br br thankfully tv comedy has advanced since terry and june it's hard to find kind words for it terry scott did make the best of weak scripts
<START> i loved this movie i saw it when i was about 8 years old and almost seven years later this evening i got to see it again i really thought it had an interesting idea they only thing that upset me was the ending which i felt was a cop out 'round here it's hard to find this movie and i was lucky enough to have seen it on bravo i also expected to see more drew barrymore in here too
<START> i finally managed to sit through a whole episode of this show i was very very tired clearly previously i would always have to turn it off because i thought it was that bad watching a full episode convinces me that it really is that bad i couldn't even tell you what happened but i distinctively remember not laughing for people who think this is the new all in the family or married with children have you ever actually watched those shows they are well written and well acted and most importantly funny this show is not funny you might think so if this is the first sitcom you have ever watched i cannot see who else would i echo all previous sentiments about arrested development etc it's probably my own fault for getting frustrated with television and not watching it thereby allowing the stupid people to dictate what actually stays on the air
