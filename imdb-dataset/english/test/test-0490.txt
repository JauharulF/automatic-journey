<START> i can't remember the series i believe it may have been american masters but it was broadcast on pbs around 1980 most people have some knowledge of the development of the a bomb and those that have little or none probably think it is a pretty dry subject anyone who has viewed this 7 part series does not feel that way you get to know the turmoil in mind and how the development changed his life forever you understand the tragic figure he became and why with 7 episodes you get to know the major players and the intrigue and backstabbing i have contacted pbs about the chance of obtaining a video or dvd but have never received a response too bad i would love to see it again
<START> lt claude claudio cassinelli and several prisoners from his sunken ship wash ashore on an island owned by edmond richard johnson following a few random prisoner deaths takes in claude and his two remaining prisoners luckily for everyone barbara bach just happens to be on the island too unluckily there are some crazy who like to kill people br br this italian produced exploiter seems to have it all a touch of creature from the black lagoon mixed with dr moreau with a dash of white zombie voodoo and atlantis stuff despite some wonky looking costumes the film does benefit from some beautiful location photography and a nice twist about halfway through all of the actors are good and joseph cotton even pops up as a old biologist director sergio martino handles himself well enough as there is action ever 10 minutes or so that can't be said for his belated follow up the and their queen 1995 easily one of the and most off base sequels since highlander ii

<START> dr seuss would sure be mad right now if he was alive cat in the hat proves to show how movie productions can take a classic story and turn it into a mindless pile of goop we have mike myers as the infamous cat in the hat big mistake myers proves he can't act in this film he acts like a prissy show girl with a thousand tricks up his sleeve the kids in this movie are all right somewhere in between the lines of dull and annoying the story is just like the original with a couple of tweaks and like most movies based on other stories never tweak with the original story bringing in the evil neighbor quin was a bad idea he is a stupid villain that would never get anywhere in life this movie is like a rejected comic strip from the newspaper if you think about it the film sure does look tacky sure there are a funny adult jokes like where the cat cuts of his tail and the censor goes off before he says a naughty word mildly funny at least the grinch had spunk and the film was actually good this film is a cartoonish piece of snot with bright colors and bad mediocre acting was mike myers even in this movie actually and another thing the fish what is with that stupid fish first time you see him he's an actual fish next time you see him he's all animated and talking but he looks like an animated piece of rubber play dough this film is a total off target wreck good joke bad joke bad bad bad good joke i'm surprised it even had good jokes like the water park ride joke that was good so please if you have the choice watch the grinch instead of this mess
<START> sure most of the slasher films of the 1980's were not worth the br br celluloid they were filmed on but this video nightmare may well be br br the dullest produced br br six horny pot smoking students decide to go camping of course br br and you know this already they begin getting killed one by one by a br br mysterious stranger the climax has a hunky forest ranger trying to br br get to the teens in time before the last cute girl becomes buzzard br br bait br br john carl my least favorite b movie guy did the lousy br br makeup effects here the cast features carel struycken of the br br witches of and the addams family movies sadly he br br does not pop up until the very end of the film and is covered in br br burn makeup rendering him unrecognizable steve bond anyone br br remember him is here in an early role as a victim br br brown's direction and the script he both smell like the br br presents brown bears leave in the woods he pads the film with br br so much stock wilderness footage i thought i accidentally rented a br br special episode of mutual of omaha's wild kingdom much of the br br cast sits around the campfire and eats then walk and sit and eat br br again the forest ranger is involved in the strangest scene ever put br br in a slasher film he tells a joke about a wide mouthed frog to a br br baby deer jackie coogan who must have forgot he once worked br br with the legends of silent cinema has two scenes and is involved br br in the second strangest scene ever put in a slasher film he and br br the hunky forest ranger have a conversation about cucumber and br br cream cheese sandwiches on oatmeal bread yeah br br there is not one minute of suspense here the killer a forest fire br br survivor looking for a mate watches the students from behind br br trees we know it is the killer because the film makers have br br dubbed in a heart beat sound effect that helpfully serves to wake br br the viewer up every few minutes skip this pile of pine sap and rent br br halloween instead br br this is rated r for physical violence mild gun violence gore br br some profanity brief female nudity mild sexual content sexual br br references and drug abuse
<START> guy pearce looks like and acts like a calvin klein underwear model or one of those bimbo guys who wear jeans and stand in front of a herd of stampeding buffalo because they realize that buffalo like too in every scene guy pearce looks like he is saying look at me i am so pretty as a hero his character is a total wimp in every scene that calls for courage pearce gets the short end of the stick spoilers yet at the end of the movie this wimpy book worm character out runs a pack of baboon like who can run and leap along the side of the walls like spiderman around the same time the time machine seems to cause a nuclear explosion of some kind that wipes out an entire valley strangely even though pearce and his gal pal are about a foot away from the last that gets killed seconds later pearce and the tribe are watching the valley blow up from the safety of their mountain now that is fast running jeremy irons as the king of the is great he really makes the movie a lot better than it was the model turned actress is not very cute and she does not do much acting in this movie the scenes which take place in the 1900s lack any real atmosphere even though the period dress and vehicles are shown the characters act like caricatures of how they imagine 1900s people would walk and talk the original version of this movie was a lot better in this respect the period characters were much more realistic and they were much better actors the original version of this movie made the past seem like the real base of the characters this new version lacks substance and feeling the scenes in which pearce deals with the death of emma and then fails to save her from her fate are very good the issue of the being cannibals is not very well explained and it does not make sense that they have some large dark butcher shop filled with knives and cutlery yet they are never seen using any weapons except for a blow dart also silly is the giant pit full of water and bones all through the underground the are all walking around chewing on meaty bones so how can all those skeletons be in the pit it seems like there are some that bar b que their humans and eat them off the grill and other only like filleted flesh and where are the restrooms for all of these creatures as i was watching the dozens of who were gorging themselves on human flesh it occurred to me that they must have a very advanced toilet plumbing system considering that they were tossing in lots of bones all these issues were never addressed at the end of the movie pearce is holding hand but you can see that he is eye balling her friend mandingo one other totally irritating thing about this movie is the non stop lion king music which is in the background once pearce arrives in the future a d the lion king music never stops and every time the natives are around there is that african moaning singer is it peter gabriel or paul simon that starts wailing and moaning over the lion king jungle music i watched the credits at the end of the movie and the jungle music is not specifically identified but i think that elton john should probably look into this matter time machine was a mediocre movie with some good fx see it once then forget it
<START> i thought puppets making crank phone calls was pretty low but i don't believe that carlos mencia's show even qualifies as comedy his main objective is to make the audience incredibly uncomfortable while using the word as many times as he possible can i have never felt compelled to write a review declaring the awfulness of anything on imdb before but i really do hope this show is never renewed or rerun br br mencia is trying to be the next dave chapelle and perhaps he was only hired by the network because they hoped he would fill those shoes it is obvious right down to the rip of intro blues guys vs mariachi band however mencia has absolutely no attitude and does not delve into popular views of the hispanic culture enough to come up with a creative poke at it each time instead he sticks to a small number of hardly shocking nicknames for his fellow latinos and makes jokes about immigration every once in a while he'll take advantage of the slight darkness of his skin to make fun of someone else like middle eastern cultures these jokes mainly consist of reiterating every joke or stereotype made against the culture and perhaps some incredibly old topics such as 9 11 in a watered down stand up style while he laughs at himself to cover up the audience's style i think he's too afraid of really offending anyone so it just makes the viewer feel awkward he also beats jokes to death if you've ever seen why the f is this news you'll know what i'm talking about it's funny at first but he just rambles on and on and becomes captain obvious at some point br br it's a trainwreck that is purely painful to watch
<START> cops logan alexander and debbie rochon escort five black juvenile delinquents cross country and end up stranded out in the sticks when their van breaks down after a deadly run in with a racist white trash bitch with a shotgun played by the director the survivors take refuge in the house of a blind voodoo priestess one of the teens senselessly uses a spell to call up killjoy who finally shows up about midway through this bore in a subpar make up job and bigger 'fro that looks like it could slide off his head at any moment he then proceeds to kill off the stupid characters while spouting some of the worst one liners heard since hee haw was canceled br br the acting from the teens is terrible the dialogue even worse the fx stink and it looks a lot cheaper than the first film although i enjoyed him in his earlier troma films trent haaga trying to imitate jim carrey here is awful and no match for the hyperactive overemoting of angel vargas in killjoy 1 which at least had a few dumb laughs br br yet another nail in the coffin for full moon studios whose reputation as a fun direct to vid franchise has completely vanished since the trancers puppet master days
<START> this really is the worst movie i have ever seen for a while i made a habit of watching lousy movies including battlefield earth delta force commando and starship all of these movies are cinematic gems compared to br br there isn't much point in summarizing this piece of junk i think it's more beneficial to summarize my reaction to the movie which is as follows i become furiously angry and i want to rip the tape out of the vcr and burn it after roughly 80 minutes of play br br i rate this movie a 0 but imdb does not let one rate a movie less than 1 i give it a 0 knowing full well that i am saying any movie that has any score above 0 is infinitely many times better than this one that's really how bad it is
<START> in a very near future world a corrupt government monitors everyone constantly with computers and surveillance one man has managed to evade assimilation and operates outside the system fighting to preserve his freedom an engaging and imaginative story and some very interesting editing and camera work there are some confusing and slow parts but all in all an excellent example of what a small crew with brains and talent can do on a shoestring budget
<START> 6 out of the 8 comments on this subject rated this film as worth watching so let me redress the balance br br if this is the best that british independent film makers have to offer then they need to pack away their cameras right now and find jobs in another industry unfortunately for me that was 82 minutes i'll never see again and hopefully i'll save some of you from wasting 82 minutes of your own br br whilst the idea behind the film is interesting it is not developed enough to keep the viewer attached the student characters are bland and uninteresting and quite frankly you won't care about what happens to them the soldiers are practically caricatures of every baddie ever seen in film i kept waiting for captain to twirl an imaginary moustache some of the effects were quite good and showed some imagination but these were ruined by the shockingly bad acting poor script writing and patchy camera work the budget may have been better spent sending the actors and i use that term loosely to acting classes or the thomas brothers to film making school or maybe on a spell checker because the subtitles were incorrectly spelt the fact that the mis were not picked up on and rectified speaks volumes about the immaturity of the whole production br br i can only assume that the positive comments are staged by the film makers either that or they were watching a completely different film i implore the thomas brothers to never give up their day jobs for if they continue in this field they will surely starve to death
<START> what can you say about a grainy poorly filmed 16mm stag film where the best and most attractive performer is a german shepherd nothing that would be positive avoid this travesty at all costs in any case it would be difficult to find since bestiality remains a taboo and illegal subject in the usa i strongly suggest imdb to re visit their weighting formula for establishing ratings since an 8 8 rating for this piece of fecal matter is absurd i am by no means a prude and have spent many hours enjoying the classic porn movies of the 70's 80's but this is inferior product even by the looser standards of the then illegal stag loop
<START> i first watched kindred in 1987 along with another movie called devouring waves i remember back then i hated them both and i have never really bothered to watch them again br br however i have recently started a crusade to collect as many 80's horror titles in their original boxed form that have been deleted for some time i have got myself quite a proud collection with many more titles on my list br br the kindred although i have not as yet got a copy is high priority as all the old movies i didn't like back then i now own and have now re watched and think they are brilliant and the bits i do remember of the kindred are now driving me to want to get hold of a copy a s a p br br hurray for the 80's and long live horror
<START> i loved this movie and i watch it everyday i think that although the acting isn't all that great it's really just a bunch of guys having fun with a script i had been looking all over for this movie for almost a year and when i found it for thirty dollars i just had to get it it is now by far my favorite movie of all time it deals with relationship failure and at the same time making a joke of it i loved all the parts with don vito especially the one where asks him for a grape when they're sitting on the porch and he tells him to eat the one rolling down the porch it really portrays him as he really is the part in the making of really touched me when they brandon novak's addiction to heroin and how much his friends and family were trying to help him a new movie that's in the making called is in production which is about the story of novak's dreams shattered by his addiction
<START> just about every commentator has mentioned the way that some of the interview footage is over the concert footage in places this is true and is the biggest flaw of this film however it isn't so often or so bad that one shouldn't see this video if you are a black sabbath fan you have to see this aside from having seen black sabbath in the and early eighties i saw them in 2005 or 2006 when they also headlined just like in this video the concert was amazing and very much like this which was why i rented this in the first place it's just about the best geezer rock out there check it out
