<START> the sound is terrible the picture is worse than worse the acting is awful the female leading actress is chubby and the story is wait a minute there is no story the plot is really bad and the title of the movie is misleading if you expect to to see piranhas you might be disappointed this movie has nothing to do with the piranha movies from 1978 and 1981 actually i can only think of one scene involving piranhas br br the only thing that i liked about this movie besides the fact that it runs for only about 85 minutes is the song at the end it's written and sung by jim stein and it's called love all things that love the sun br br i don't recommend this movie it is so bad it's not even funny to watch i fell asleep after the first 20 minutes and i am the kind of person who watches anything
<START> i've never seen a bollywood film before but i caught the first ten minutes of this laughed myself silly and hit the r button on sky i'm glad i did i hope i don't insult anybody because basically the bf and i loved it but we couldn't take it half as seriously as the actors did especially the obsessed one who i understand is a huge bollywood star because we've seen him on the cover of lots of dvds since and i even saw a doll of him today in the bf keeps on about this bloke i am beginning to think he's obsessed he keeps saying that it's strange for the traditionally good looking one to be the anti hero of a film but then we do like films that aren't your stock predictable hollywood fare br br it was completely over the top but really good fun if all bollywood films are like this then we're watching more i have had that bloomin' song in my head all week and i can't speak a word of hindi ps any recommendations would be appreciated
<START> it's always interesting to view a horror movie after hearing so much praise from other fans experience has taught me that you should never generalize fan taste within a genre my expectations of this movie were a great deal higher than my viewed opinion br br children shouldn't play with dead things is a movie with a good intended plot that trips up too many times to carry it out the whole idea of a band of actors staging a of dead corpses had me intrigued however everything degenerated into cinematic chaos the actors who for the most part were competent and amazingly expressive were offered roles that fail to maintain consistent characterization some of these characters go from ambivalence about the whole act of defiling a cemetery to outspoken criticism back to ambivalence it's one thing for characters to have a change heart in the course of the film it's another to produce an overly dynamic circular attitude that loops every ten minutes br br another inconsistent element of this film is the premise does the main protagonist intend for the ceremony to be theatrical prank or does he actually conspire with dark spiritual forces to raise the dead even with the aforementioned flaws i would recommend this movie to other horror fans since i believe that only true horror fans will appreciate the dark atmospheric components and be able to ignore the plot's inconsistency the scene where the dead rise out of the grave is made extremely haunting even to a veteran zombie enthusiast by the excellent combined use of scenery and sound and the great choice of skilled actors chosen to play the reanimated dead current filmmakers should learn from about using the proper video and audio techniques in mood development br br all in all if you are zombie movie like me you should take time to locate and view this movie it's a fun watch
<START> during the war for southern independence general spanky his forces to defend the local women children against a yankee invasion br br in 1936 hal roach decided it was time for his popular our gang kids to branch out into occasional feature length films with the big success of shirley temple in two civil war period movies in 1935 the little colonel the littlest rebel it was only natural that roach would look in that same direction for his gang although given a rather lavish production and distributed by mgm general spanky was not a critical or box office success the little gangsters would henceforth stick to short subjects br br although he's given top billing the title role george mcfarland is rivaled throughout the film's first half by little billie thomas here were two of the finest young actors to ever appear in american movies with all the experience of old seasoned pros these two gamin could steal scenes hearts with equal bravado a constant joy without a false note between them they provide the essential reason for watching the film today br br phillips holmes gives a quiet gentlemanly performance as spanky's adult protector nearly forgotten now holmes was a fine actor who died much too soon during world war two genial ralph morgan is especially good as a sympathetic union general his scenes with spanky are quite amusing br br other our appear midpoint into the movie most notably carl switzer he gets to warble before the battle mother ' even pretty rosina lawrence the gang's shows up to play holmes' beloved br br irving is particularly slimy as a cowardly turned vindictive yankee captain bumbling willie best feisty louise beavers play miss lawrence's slaves br br it should be noted that there is racism in the film not unusual for hollywood of that era but almost completely missing in the original series of our gang shorts br br fans of 19th century music will enjoy paying attention to the soundtrack which is a long succession of ancient tunes
<START> five fingers of death is a classic of 70's kung fu cinema as the film that broke out hk cinema to the west this is a must see for any serious fan of the genre it's also a damn entertaining film with hard hitting non stop action solid and mostly believable fight choreography and great over the top 70's era dubbing oh i see so you want it the hard way br br five fingers is an eye for an eye revenge tale and i mean literally eye for an eye it's great to see lo lieh portraying a hero he played so many great villains later in his career including pai mei in the classic fist of the white lotus which was one of the characters tarantino used in creating the pai mei of kill bill br br my only complaint is that i wish there was a better quality dvd mine looks like it was a vhs transfer overall this is a great film don't miss it br br bart film club hollywood ca
<START> when the spirits within was released all you heard from final fantasy fans was how awful the movie was because it didn't seem like final fantasy this is a different story for better or worse the familiar settings characters music story and over the top action scenes should thrill fans of the original game the problem is that it just isn't a good movie in its own right br br the direction during the fight scenes is often sloppy switching camera angles ridiculously fast in an attempt to make the action seem more frenetic but only serving to make the scenes look jumbled and confusing br br the cg itself is exceptional but i can't say it's the best i've ever seen since spirits within had much more detail on the characters although i must admit that advent children's characters moved much more naturally br br the plot is virtually a black hole it's a giant deus ex machina designed solely to bring back for one last fight old characters reappear but serve no real purpose other than to please fans character development is nonexistent and the film does nothing at all to resolve any of the plot threads left hanging after the game's end but it's packed with neat looking fight scenes with magic summons and limit breaks which is probably what fans wanted anyway br br in the end advent children is a very flashy but totally brainless action flick that serves more as a side story for final fantasy vii than a real sequel br br by the way don't think you're hurting my feelings by voting not useful it just makes me feel superior knowing that fanboys fangirls resent my objectivity so greatly
<START> this is a profound and moving work about the creation of art that which is uniquely human and cannot be produced by nature the cost of genius and the search for transcendence and what in the end constitutes family i e all of us i was very much moved by the family discussion that nathaniel had with his sisters about the shortcomings of their father as it was set in a beautiful home that seemed to radiate warmth that lou had created and although esther seems so cold in her discussion about lou's inability to make money you can appreciate how she at many points in his life must have been a counter weight to his impulses nathaniel did a great job of showing how all of the people in lou's life fit in and completed it and became as much a part of his work as his own genius yes even or maybe especially our failures make us who we are and of course there are the buildings i had only known lou kahn by name and did not really connect his name to his work they are evidence of grace perhaps someday there will be a building where we will all fit and it will certainly resemble a lou kahn building perhaps the temple in jerusalem perhaps there is salvation
<START> 2 deathly unfunny girls stays a their deathly unfunny uncle benny's beach house uncle doesn't like party but guess what the deathly unfunny girls have a yup you guessed it a deathly unfunny beach party if you didn't catch the not so subliminal message that i'm trying to convey first off you're a moron i would rather watch a nude jello tag team watching match between bea and vs rosie o'donnell and jessica tandy this movie and i lose the term loosely is just that bad br br my grade f br br eye candy kristin novak and charity go topless singer shows breasts and buns
<START> although i saw this movie in korea in korean and therefore did not understand the language images sure say more than enough from what i can make of it this is the story two superb sword fighters become friends in their service as the king's guard one of them finds himself opposed to the ways of the king and starts assassinating important men the other has to hunt him down this movie is visually great the is great and the movie has a gripping end i just hope this movie will be marketed for the western cinema goers and be released on dvd of course
<START> webs is a pretty odd movie albeit slightly watchable richard grieco plays an electrician who gets suck into a parallel earth overrun by mutant spiders or something like that the film itself was made with a modest budget which explains the limited locales and the somewhat tedious screenplay that manages to do very little with quite an interesting premise basically a 90 minute episode of the tv show sliders and nothing more br br 4 out of 10 br br go to www nixflix com for a more detailed review and reviews of other films in the genre
<START> this film is so copy cat clichÃ© ridden clumsy and laboured i find it astounding that anyone could not feel cheated by the experience of sitting through it br br here is the range of idiotic clichÃ©s ridiculous and simply storytelling in this hard hitting representation of high school the tough guy jock is really a homosexual the a student is unhappy because his father pushes him and somehow this causes him to commit incest a teacher is mean to a student who wets his pants in class a girl who is going out with the above mentioned jock is really in love with him and just wants a family br br maybe the only saving grace is the student counsellor scenes which are vaguely interesting but most of the devices in this film are so leaden that it beggars belief br br this film shows me no insight into teenagers and i will not be surprised when it bombs especially with teenagers the people who like this film seem to be parents worried about their teenagers and boy are they barking up the wrong tree if they think this film will help with understanding teen issues i mean what is the moral of this film hey guys let's all look out for each other and hug each other give me a break anyone who thinks you can get through to a 14 year old with that kind of message needs to think back in the 1980s we were watching kentucky fried movie xtro porky's evil dead terminator etc this film will fall on deaf ears br br 2 37 is right up there with another australian film 'one perfect day ' which was as bad as this utter turkey of a film thank god no money was spent on this br br avoid
<START> i really love this movie it has a very real feel to it i believe it was never popular because of the subject matter however because of the subject matter it makes the movie all that much more important br br this is an a movie and i recommend it highly if you liked 1984 book or movie i think you will like this one as well br br this is harsh to say the least including mental and physical acts of torture some pretty vile not for the week at heart or stomach no gore but his movie is so great at projecting the mental anticipation it doesn't need blood and guts br br if you are not a realist or a person i don't think you will enjoy it it leaves you with an uneasy feeling about humans what they're capable of and the very real possibility that our government s does not necessarily have our personal best interest in it's heart
<START> the first half of this film held some promise as it seemed like the film was going to be a low key character psychodrama like the minus man but then the whole thing collapses into cliche and the viewer slowly loses all interest there's a decent cast here but the film is lifeless and the talent completely wasted
<START> a proof that it's not necessary for a movie to have a deep many layered story and other sophisticated elements to be a good movie even if the story could be expanded in many directions especially in more sociological way people lust for money it seems that it's perfect just the way it is through many sudden changes it takes the spectator to the end without any unnecessary complications and without letting the spectator taking the eyes of the screen br br but the acting for me isn't so good with the exception of lindsey the others were average or even worst in some scenes they just empty stared in front of themselves for exception of lindsey which was more convincing it's a really simple movie for just laying back and enjoying br br 7 10
<START> forget some the whiny and pointless comments left here by some this series is well acted well shot and makes a refreshing change to most of the pap on tv br br any fool can nitpick anything however in this show the characters are believable the story lines intriguing and compelling but do require some intelligence on the part of the viewer overall it's enjoyable and it's british we do occasionally come up with some gems and this is one of them br br the shows are an hour long each and i think there are four of them all together at least i've only seen four of them the show clearly impressed some u s tv station director who made a longer series which was nowhere near as compelling in spite of the bigger budget br br if like soaps and reality shows you won't like or understand eleventh hour
