<START> 'rise of the follows the unrelentingly cruel journey of gangster carlton leach and his associates through drugs violence sex violence guns violence and did i mention violence br br protagonist carlton leach ricci member of the i c f inner city firm a group of football hooligans turned professional gangsters guides the audience through the events leading to the 1995 rover in which three gang members fell victim to particularly vicious professional 'hits' success as a doorman and talent for locating aptly violent friends to control unruly punters at a local nightclub launches him into the company of notorious drug dealers and gangsters benefiting from the 80s 90s rave scene and drug culture br br opening with brutally realistic shots of the dead men the viewer is left thirsty to understand what happened but left wholly unsatisfied the next 2 hours meander through a series of countless character introductions each of these basically establishes yet another typical man' shows him assaulting usually undeserving victims before probably coming to an even nastier end what little emotional understanding the audience is allowed to form for a few of the characters for example a family man blamed for missing drugs is quickly destroyed when they are either anti killed or their storyline left unresolved the hints of a plot introduced in the beginning are inadequately concluded with vague impressions of how the murders occurred as the events are slotted into place with little reward for persevering with the hazy muddle of previous events br br this film has been made with a standard formula in mind for an audience who prefer violence and nut' slang to an actual storyline 'rise of the borrows too much from factory' leaving out the good bits demonstrating no moral ramifications of hooligan subculture or establishing empathy with the protagonist the violence although brilliantly shot seems excessive and implausible because no one is around long enough for the audience to form an emotional attachment the implication that the gangs are untouchable by the police is fair enough but machete wielding regularly committing blatant murder in public places pushes the imagination of even the most willing viewer the audience are left bewildered as to the relevance of many key events and developed characters that had no knock on effect on the eventual conclusion attempted is further destroyed with a substance called which the turkish mafia use to coax honest answers from unwilling individuals this is not the genre in which to invent psychologically unrealistic drugs and renders the interrogation almost absurd br br the actual scenes of violence before becoming repetitive hold some tension spliced with rapid flashes of colour or the end of a film reel seamlessly choreographed brawls coupled with obligatory but effective shaky hand held camera work saves the film but unfortunately the plot or lack there of limits it to a niche demographic br br in essence the events this film is based on aren't deservedly represented and an adequately sequential storyline is sacrificed for stereotypical characters and an unoriginal plot this film has a place in the market but if you like a bit of brain with your brutality this one isn't for you br br http www com
<START> a surprisingly good documentary my surprise was mainly due to the fact that i was confused by the title i assumed this was about the influence of the drug culture on film making but no it is a much more far reaching and intelligent film than could have been expected demme has done a great job in encapsulating the period from the late 60s to the late 70s from and the collapse of studio influence through all those introspective 'real life' movies where brilliant young directors tried to express themselves politically sexually and artistically through to the beginnings of the blockbuster and the return of the reigns to the money men and their studios as someone who saw the 'real life' movies of britain and the rest of europe through the sixties and then the revolutionary us films of the 70s and is sad that the sequel to the sequel is so much the order of the day this was a most fascinating film the interview clips are measured thanks to dvd the full interviews are available as extras and the film clips well considered also as someone who has only just caught up with 'joe' i am impressed that this important little film gets its well deserved entry here
<START> joseph conrad's novel heart of darkness had a vivid sense of description that made this book astonishing when reading this book i had every scene totally drawn out in my head and i knew what every character looked like this book had many pieces and when i finished reading this book it seemed as the puzzle had been completed after i finished reading heat of darkness i watched the movie which was a mistake the movie cut out so many substantial parts for example in the novel marlow waited a very long time for the rivets to come for him to fix his boat this was a big source of futility in the movie that part was just left out the movie added more parts that were useless and made no sense for example when kurtz was talking to marlow at the end of the book and kurtz snapped the monkey's neck and killed him what purpose did that scene have other than to make the audience feel sorry for the monkey it's as if the script writer didn't even read the whole book and just put the parts that he read in the movie if i had not read the novel before i had watched the movie i would have been thoroughly confused the book was amazing and it is truly a classic in american literature but the movie could have defiantly been nominated for the worst picture in the razzie awards
<START> this film basically try to portray the heroism of firefighters by making the whole movie revolve around a american dad with a good heart that puts others before himself now i know they try to show jack morrison joaquin phoenix as a typical american father that is a firefighter but like there is just nothing interesting in about him what so ever thus when the movie gets to the climax there is just little to no emotion this movie basically tries to make the life of a firefighter exciting but it just comes off as boring as any other jobs except you save lives or property by extinguishing the fire john travolta plays the captain of the fire station but anyone could have played his role and he is a dull character as the rest of the film what could have been a good film is that the firefighter are put way up as heroes because they are firemen and turns the whole scenario into a uninteresting melodrama br br 4 9 10
<START> this movie was so bad i don't know where to begin apparently neither did the filmmakers it starts off with a guy in his mid thirties to late forties watching tv the news tells of a corn maze that's open for halloween he has a vision of god knows what and rushes off the save his kids who are walking into a cornfield maze and are somehow linked to this vision how you ask i don't know and as i said before neither do the filmmakers they're simply visions of people's feet how did he get these visions it's never explained we're just supposed to go along with it he enters the maze to find his two daughters who are lost inside and twice the girls he's looking for walk right past him one time they actually run into him what does he do does he chase after them no he stands there like an idiot calling for them when they just ran past do the girls stop no they run off then ask was that dad then someone dressed as demon jumps on the star the dad character he beats him up in a pathetic fight only to find out he's a worker at the haunted maze the police are called and after finding the star which is a really bad term to use they cuff him they cuff his hands in front of him so that he can find something to pick the lock with which he does first off anybody who's ever been arrested knows that cops cuff your hands behind your back and secondly why does this average guy seem to know how to pick the lock on handcuffs well he eventually gets away from the cops who give up and leave after a the star's wife sets off the siren in the police car as a distraction by the way it's now night time and all the workers running the maze have seem to have left once the sun went down leaving a man who attacked one of their workers and two missing children in the maze considering it was a slow night that these are their only customers why not besides the cops apparently have better things to do as well by the way the star who goes by the name of walker we figure out it's his last name a name in which his wife even calls him by somehow he knows there is something buried in the middle of this cornfield maze and starts digging i say because i couldn't figure out why he started digging in the first place he finds a what does it mean nothing to anyone who watches this but to him it's some sort of clue to a crime somebody killed their kids in his vision and i guess that's what he's going on real detective work and by now he knows there's a killer loose in the corn maze one he somehow knew was there from the start of the film which is why he's looking for his girls every time we see the killer or rather the killer's feet we hear a weird robotic sound like a sci fi reject toy that changes a persons voice to sound mechanical why do we hear this sound is it in anyway related to anything again who knows certainly not the filmmakers the peak of all the bad acting and bad dialog was when walker yells out hey you mr bad man i'm gonna get you another time his wife is attacked by the bad man at the entrance to the corn maze which like i mentioned before is oddly empty of any employees or policemen the bad man calls walker on his cell phone to tell him that he plans on killing his wife and kids and him as well walker can only reply with hey hey before dropping his phone and running off with no one on the other end to talk to the killer drops his phone too he drags the wife a few feet then leaves her alone for the rest of the film losing the first opportunity to hold true to his treats if this script wasn't written by a child i'd be surprised opps it wasn't it was written directed and produced by the same guy and not only that he also did so much of the crappy camera work as well where we get random shots of feet walking through the muddy maze and meaningless shots of the cornfield that waste 90 of the film time in the end walker uses the cuffs to cuff the bad man who also seems to know how to pick locks with the same metal object that walker had picked it with apparently there are lots of small metal objects just laying around this cornfield but after the killer insists he's still going to kill the kids walker kills the bad man and everything is right with the world again now in reality this makes walker a murderer he's killed a man who supposedly murdered his own daughters and was trying to kill his he knows this not because of proof but because of his visions he never found a body nobody else knows this guy was even in the maze and the he gives it back to the ghosts of the two dead girls no proof so he kills a man without any tangible reason i can't imagine what the filmmakers were thinking with this one it must have been a way to cover up a of funds for the production company i would rather watch the blair witch project five times than see this film again the actors should be ashamed the director producer writer cameraman should also be ashamed in fact the entire production company should be ashamed if there is anyone associated with this film please reply what were you thinking
<START> i just can't understand why people are surprised this movie makes no sense it was never supposed to make sense duh the writers were completely wasted on at the time it was just supposed to entertain and mock and it does both wonderfully br br the monkees are good actors they wouldn't have been hired if they weren't good actors mike has a thing for deadpan and darkness micky is the best at sheer psychotic comedy davy is a broadway veteran and peter actually had people believing he was that dumb in real life don't tell me they can't act because they most definitely can br br they can also write sure jack bob get the sole credits but in reality they got a big helping hand on that script from the monkees who were also in that smoke filled room br br it is absolutely impossible to spoil this film head is very highly symbolic among the more memorable elements is the black box which was actually based on 2 things the image that the boys were bound to and the real black box on the screen gems lot where the band was kept between takes there's so much more symbolism in the movie that i'll just let you watch it and figure it out br br the music is awesome circle sky is one of papa best tunes ever and song as we go along will have you enthralled if you'd rather be weirded out then ditty diego can you dig it and long title should be satisfactory great songs that they are and then there's daddy's song without a doubt a homage to broadway days and the editing color scheming for that sequence is superb at least for '68 br br oh for those of you who won't watch a 'pg' film you're missing out especially since head was originally rated r in 1968 the rating was lowered about twenty years later br br now where was i ah yes we were speaking of beliefs beliefs and conditioning
<START> oh dear just what we need another essex cockney garbage effort chronicling the rise of the uk hooligan rave gangster who did of course follow west 'am east essex style didn't anybody tell you that they won the world cap and then of course the inevitable decay into uk rave culture underworld blah blah blah why how and who would want to fund a film like this i do not know but lets pray that it was from private financiers lets see ex drug dealers merchant bankers we all know what to call them and the rest of the rather than publicly funded means hopefully with the recession we will not see the like of this again if we do we will be calling the death knell for british films and of course we will all be able to blame britains number one mockney country gent wannabee gangster guy ritchie
<START> how can you make a joke about mafia it is not the kind of subject to laugh at a near movie cannot make me laugh because i am comparing it to jane austen's mafia mafia wasn't a good movie but hoods is really worse in mafia there were some good jokes but in this one there are maybe two or three that make you smile not too bad actors but very bad scenario we sure prefer something serious like the godfather i give it out of
<START> my expectations were high after seeing the trailer they were even higher when i saw the movie had the same director as independance day and godzilla the special effects in independence day were much better then in this movie the whole movie i was waiting for the spiders to show up the rest of the storyline was really boring and when the spiders came they had a very amateuristic look like the special effects were from a movie made in the 60's i didn't watch the whole movie when it was played for about one hour i switched off my dvd player i watch 3 movies almost every night and i have never walked away from a movie even if it was that boring the only thing good in this movie was the pretty sheriff that's why i voted 2 instead of 1 so don't go see this one instead you should go out and rent starship troopers it's like the same only 10 000 times better
<START> i really wanted to write a title for this review that didn't come off as corny or gushing but still described my feelings for this show i can see now that it is not possible american family is one of the best shows i have ever had the pleasure of watching on television several reviewers here on imdb have mentioned the word beautiful when describing this show never has a word been more fitting the cinematography for this show is stunning every scene and shot looks like a masterpiece the lighting camera moves scene composition and colors i have to keep reminding myself that i'm watching a tv show and not a motion picture masterpiece the score by lee and nathan wang brings tears to my eyes and most importantly the acting by the all around amazing cast is honest and sincere i do not feel like i am watching performances i feel like i'm watching real life if only real life could be this beautiful br br american family has indeed raised the bar for quality entertainment on television i highly recommend this show to anyone who is willing to watch it i could easily chide cbs for passing on this show but i have to say that it doesn't matter to me who airs it i'm just glad it's out there for everyone to see so i do thank pbs for not allowing this show to disappear into nothingness br br i have to give special recognition to the way each season's finale ended the first one was pure creative brilliance and it moved me to tears i was waiting to see if season two would also end in a creative way and sure enough it did again tears br br my thanks to all of those involved you really have made a special piece of art with this show and i sincerely mean that it is a shame that we only got two seasons but a miracle we got anything at all
<START> the violent men is a good western perhaps the story is not an original one big ranch owner dedicated to run out small competitors out of a valley he needs for his increasing cattle but the film has many ingredients that raises its level and makes it worth seeing br br the cast is a highlight there's the reliable glenn ford john parrish as a former army officer and now one of the small ranchers who tries to stay out of troubles until he is pushed to hard edward robinson lew wilkinson is as good as always as the crippled big man and barbara stanwyck martha plays his treacherous wife in one of her usual mean woman roles she deals with easily others were in double indemnity and blowing wild brian keith cole does it perfectly as robinson's gunman brother an ambitious man trying to take over his brother's big ranch no matter what regular 50's westerns villain richard jaeckel wade is there too and ends as usual no surprise there dianne foster judith wilkinson plays robinson's daughter who does not approve his father mother and uncle's way of handling things with their neighbors br br rudolph mate brings a standard but acceptable direction perhaps helped by beautiful and wide open scenery and a fine and appropriate music score helps too br br the inevitable final showdown between ford and keith is one of the best in western movies each man in his own dueling style notice ford's shooting with his straight arm and aiming at its target in the military way settle their differences then and once and for all br br this is for sure one of glenn ford's best western appearances second only to the classic 3 10 to yuma he made two years later it's probably the cast that puts the film as an a rate and as for me it enters the top 10 list of the genre
<START> this pathetic excuse for a movie doesn't have a decent structure or a sensible closure the characters were confusing and the entire plot kept getting off track i'd have to say that perfect was a disgrace this is what happens when you let disney channel make movies
<START> murder over new york is an entertaining entry in the charlie chan series of films but if you're paying attention a lot of plot holes reveal themselves to the observant eye while traveling to new york city for an annual police convention chan sidney toler meets former scotland yard investigator hugh drake frederick on the same flight now employed by military intelligence drake is tracking paul and his hindu servant suspected for acts of sabotage around the world drake believes that by contacting elusive wife he'll be able to pin down the whereabouts of the master criminal br br when drake winds up dead in the library of george kirby president of the metropolitan aircraft corporation charlie that he was killed by a recently discovered poisonous gas called administered via a glass pellet that releases the poison when broken summoning kirby to bring all of his dinner party guests together chan and police inspector vance donald macbride question those in attendance as one of them may be the killer among them are herbert fenton melville cooper a fellow oxford student of drake's actress june preston joan valerie unknown to drake but requested by him to attend ralph percy kane richmond the chief designer at aircraft company and keith jeffrey john sutton stock broker kirby butler is also a suspect especially after number 2 son jimmy victor sen yung catches him steaming open a the contents of which concern himself br br there are some other cleverly planted characters in the proceedings as well mrs turns up as patricia west marjorie weaver and contrary to drake's suspicion that she might lead him to is actually on the run away from her former husband and a disastrous marriage she's involved with david elliott robert lowery principal of a chemical research firm and thereby a suspect in the angle br br as with many chan films racial comments must be taken in stride with the proceedings this one offers two glaring ones when black servant is brought in for questioning he states that he doesn't know anything about drake's murder that he's completely in the dark chan's response condition appear contagious br br later following inspector vance's order to round up all the in new york jimmy chan comments on their arrival with they're all beginning to look alike to me actually the scene provides one of the elements of comic relief in the movie as shemp howard impersonates hindu mystic the great rashid but is actually uncovered by the police to be con artist shorty mccoy br br before the movie's over two more victims fall to the clever his confederate and aircraft magnate kirby himself to uncover the killer chan in concert with elliott arranges for a test flight aboard a newly developed bomber after discovering a poisoned capsule planted by mechanics on the plane the day before before it can release it's deadly poison the brit fenton catches the falling capsule in mid air revealing that he knew about the plant arrested and brought in for questioning chan asserts that fenton is not the real reveals himself when he offers a poisoned cup of water to the nervous fenton anxious to maintain secret but chan was clever enough to be wary of such an attempt and reveals the real murderer now in the guise of stock broker jeffrey having undergone surgery following a car accident br br now for the plot holes when first investigating hugh drake's murder it was maintained by the police that fingerprints found in the library did not match those of any of the dinner guests however jeffrey was present at the dinner party it had already been established that drake had one non party visitor in the library chemist elliott if the fingerprints really did not belong to then making them an issue was pointless br br also at the end of the film when offers fenton the poisoned water how did he think he would get away with it with everyone there as a witness but going even one better than that how would a world traveling saboteur like have the time and wherewithal to establish himself as a new york city stockbroker it just doesn't make sense br br for trivia fans a few more points bear mentioning in the film number 2 son jimmy is a college student studying chemistry as he comes to pop's aid to solve the case in the prior chan film charlie chan at the wax museum jimmy was a law student br br the poison gas formula would get reworked in a later chan film this time by monogram with roland winters in the chan role in docks of new orleans in that story poison gas is released from shattered radio tubes in similar fashion to claim its' victims
<START> as a helpful warning for others i believe skeleton man is actually worse than raptor island i have been using ri as an example of the worst original movie presented on the sci fi channel but sm is the most laughably incoherent and wretchedly designed movie i have yet seen yes i did watch almost the whole thing coming into it about 35 minutes into it it drew me in with its pure ineptitude what was sci fi thinking once skeleton man and the surviving platoon leader or whatever he was i'm not good on military unit terminology reached the chemical plant the movie moved into a zone of impossible nonsense that was almost mesmerizing i had the same idea as another viewer who wondered if more than one movie had someone been edited together to make one terrible whole
