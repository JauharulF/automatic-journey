<START> ok a film about a film that takes a crack at video movie making could be entertaining could be should be funny edgy even controversial or at least interesting and yet this film is the negative version of that hamlin was entertaining as a 'b' film producer shatner played crazy yet likable and had all the best lines the rest of the characters were boring predictable boring underdeveloped boring and boring the production value was lame you'll actually see the boom come down in one scene the sound was awful in some of the scenes hey i'm a big fan of shatner's and of hamlin now but their talents are wasted here at least the story had a clichÃ©d ending
<START> william shakespeare probably didn't envision as a gay doctor antonio as a faithless wife or as a with a but the bard's had worse done to his good work over time and might even enjoy the sumptuous pageant of life that is his tempest as re configured by paul mazursky and co writer leon br br this time prospero is philip john cassevetes a manhattan based architect tired of designing atlantic city casinos for the amiable mafioso alonso vittorio gassman especially after discovering alonso is carrying on an affair with philip's wife antonia gena rowlands along with daughter miranda molly ringwald philip escapes to a remote greek island with miranda and his new mistress aretha susan sarandon a nice catholic girl who struggles with philip's celibate lifestyle will a sudden storm bring all right in the end br br here's a thought on the career of cassevetes how many other actors could make a film so confused into something so riveting a darling of film critics for his earlier work often with his real life wife rowlands he presents a central character who really suffers for his art here but seems to enjoy himself and makes us enjoy him too it's not prospero but something rich and strange that makes for a terrific sea change all his own br br it's all here he tells one of his faithful companions dog nino beauty magic inspiration and serenity that it is tempest transfers london to 1982 manhattan and finds some nice in philip's displaced life show me the magic he calls out to a storm tossed city and version augmented by donald sterling cinematography of purple seascapes and naturally sun greek landscapes does just that br br it's not a perfect movie by any means in fact the big finale which is the only part of the movie that follows shakespeare's storyline to any faithful extent is a mess rowland's character is hard to care much for in this film and after meeting sarandon in all her glory it's hard to understand philip's continuing concern for his wife let alone his left field desire to make an unhappy sacrifice in order to restore the natural order of things br br but there's a lot to love about tempest in addition to cassavetes there's ringwald's film debut as his loyal but restless daughter here as in the play an object of desire for the primitive rustic raul julia ringwald here is very much the same teenaged muse of privileged adolescence that would inspire john hughes but with an emotional depth those later hughes films didn't delve into ringwald and julia never got any oscar attention but they both would win golden globes for their playful work here he tries to woo her in her island isolation with his tv reruns of gunsmoke in greek tempted by her 15 year old body br br i want to you with my bonny johnny declares getting shoved aside but winning our sympathy anyway especially after performing new york new york with a chorus of goats when tempest hit the screens julia was the toast of broadway as the lead in nine br br it's show even if it feels at times that cassavetes is running things with improvisational line readings and emotional breakdowns galore philip introduces himself to aretha by telling her i'm right in the middle of a nervous breakdown he plays his character as an amiable obsessive seeking to his happiness by building an theater in his otherwise uninhabited island br br adding to the enjoyment is rich performance as the other man who is as completely amiable as julia while telling a youth obsessed philip boys don't have half as much fund as we have they're nervous and they make love in the back of an old sports car despite being overlong and pretentious in spots like so many art films tempest is entertaining in its excesses and a trip very much like shakespeare intended even if his dreams didn't involve smoking pot backstage at a go gos concert
<START> seriously folks i was getting ready to actually write the razzie council and recommend this movie as razzie champ for 2007 until i got on imdb com and realized its copyright date was 2006 and not 2007 seriously though this movie could have easily been a razzie champ this movie sucked how in the world this piece of crap was overlooked even for a razzie nomination in 2006 is beyond me because it easily could have competed with basically it stinks too for the 2006 razzie championship br br i rented this movie on the recommendation of a female neighbor of mine who told me oh my god after seeing this movie it's going to be a long long time before i ever stop at a rest stop ever again i couldn't believe how not scary and awful this movie was possible spoilers below not that you'll be missing out on anything br br ok first of all the problem the rest stop itself obviously the director of this piece of crap doesn't know the first thing about women the toilets in that rest stop were on the same level as the one in the movie trainspotting i don't claim to know everything there is to know about women but one thing i do know is that women for the most part are total and complete hygiene neat freaks given the choice between taking a crap on either of those toilets and possibly catching something or squatting in the woods a woman is going to opt for squatting in the woods i know because i've gone camping with them before and they have no problem squatting in the woods so right there major plot hole and br br second of all she comes out of the rest stop and her boyfriend who drove the car is nowhere to be found not him nor his car he just left she starts screaming his name wondering where he is ummm hello you're standing on wet mud did it ever occur to you to look down for some tire tracks i mean his car is gone it didn't just get up and fly away and actually that makes me think i actually was looking down at her feet and there weren't any tread marks in the mud how exactly did that happen br br third the bible thumping mobile home family with the freak midget in the back taking polaroid pictures wtf they made absolutely no sense at all and it's as if the director just threw them in to be weird for the sake of being weird they made no sense at all and had no place even being in the movie br br fourth oh my god this i mean finally near the end of the movie she finally sees the escape hatch on the ceiling inside the rest stop i'm like you dumb bi h you've been locked up in this rest stop for all this time and you just now see the escape hatch on the ceiling i mean it's like they threw that in just because the killer tossed gasoline on the floor through the window and was getting ready to light a match so she needs to get to higher ground to avoid being burned and oh look a perfect reason for her to get to higher ground an escape hatch on the ceiling it's like why didn't she go through that before most people in that situation would have seen that from the moment they were locked in that rest stop and gotten the f k out of dodge when they showed that escape hatch at the end of the movie i was like you have got to be kidding me br br fifth what was the deal with all the of people she encountered continuing to just disappear the girl in the broom closet in the rest stop the dumb cop her at the end of the movie when she ended up in the broom closet herself it was never explained personally when they did this i thought to myself oh christ on a cracker it's her she's the killer wonderful she killed all of those people doesn't remember doing it and the writers of this movie just ripped off a certain french horror flick that i can't mention on imdb com or i'll be blacklisted for giving away the ending that movie sucked by the way too people but it wasn't she wasn't the killer and the whole deal with the dead people disappearing was never ever explained oh for the love of god people stay away from this movie this movie sucked balls and i have now got a serious bone to pick with my neighbor it's on the 2 for 1 rack at family video don't even rent it if someone gives it to you for free
<START> i caught this on hbo under its category of guilty pleasures and i would agree that i felt guilty and pleasured watching it one it's trash and really raunchy trash two the plot is slow and predictable and once you learn who did it you think so what however i must admit to being enough of a male chauvinist pig to want to sit through what is obviously a poor movie if for no other reason than to see peta wilson get completely naked a number of times do i feel dirty for having watched it yes am i sorry i watched it no so there's the contradiction between being a lover of good movies and a lover of the female anatomy even when in a poor movie sigh
<START> i was extremely excited for this movie my expectations were under control because i read the book first sooo i expected differences what i didn't expect were how great the differences were starting off by the characters physical appearances like channing lack of tattoos n amanda not being a brunette lol but i let that go the character developments were not there at all you didn't have time to love amanda character and you couldn't feel for her or for john when they first separated i thought the two weeks were rushed and i hated that she left first then him it took the emotional separation away and why did they change tim from the book why did they make him a dad instead of a brother and why did they make him sooo old looking and the movie lacked that intense moment when they find out what happens at the end didnt want to spoil it lol but for those who watched it u know what i mean and did they change the ending in the book it was heartbreaking and emotional and it emphasized on channing character's decision did they twist it it just made it look like a rushed ending it was terrible thats what disappointed me the most the ending of the book should have been exactly the same
<START> a group of 7 gold prospectors head into a mine that was recently opened back up after an earthquake of course they don't pay attention to local legend that something is down there and killing people this low budget 25 000 horror flick has a slight cult following and i'm not exactly sure why unless it is because it is so obscure i'll admit the last half hour is pretty entertaining but the hour getting there is pure torture lots of walking and talking and our titular strangeness doesn't appear until 45 minutes in even in the extras co writer chris huntley admits it commits the unforgivable sin of being boring i would forgive them if they were strict amateurs but this group graduated from usc so i would hope they know an exploitation film should be exploitive anyway like i said the last half hour is cool as three survivors battle the stop motion monster and there is a cool john carpenter like score i wanted to see more of the monster but it is literally on screen for 45 seconds br br even if the movie isn't the best code red dvd has given this great attention you have interviews and an audio commentary by director melanie anne phillips producer actor mark and co writer huntley the tales about how the film was made are pretty fascinating and inspiring like a cave set being built in a backyard even more interesting are and usc student shorts which are actually all better than the feature production huntley was a pretty talented artist and it is a shame he didn't go on to anything else has worked steadily in hollywood as a visual effects and camera guy the film's vhs is kind of legendary for how dark it was and i'm sure this is much better however you still get scenes where the only image are five helmet lights bouncing around in the blackness safe to say the original my bloody valentine is still horror film set in a mine champ
<START> told in flashback the film opens in 1989 with charlie being given award for his role in the defeat of communism i must admit my heart sank as at the thought of have to endure yet another earnest somewhat boring and overlong life story how wrong was i because that short scene is as close as the film ever gets to boring br br the film is full of entertaining amusing set ups and cracking dialogue in some of the most unexpected places the next scene after the awards ceremony is charlie in a hot tub with some naked women and a guy trying to get him to invest in a tv programme another rather amusing scene is about 3 quarters into the film comprises charlie a group of his rather sexy secretaries phillip seymour cia man and a bottle of whisky as to dialogue what about this for a line the senator says he can teach us to type but can't teach us to grow tits ok school boyish i know but the film is laced with great lines br br as to performances well phillip seymour hoffman as usual steals every scene he's in hanks is ok but surprisingly to me anyway was julia roberts who is very good in the role of a rather eccentric texas oil br br charlie wilson's war is one of the best non musician bio pics in a long while as well as being that rare thing a film that entertains amuses as well as informs all in equal measure
<START> lackawanna blues is a touching story about nanny a woman who gives all of herself to help those in need it's told from the viewpoint of a boy taken in by nanny when his own mother isn't quite up to the task br br i have respect for this movie for three main reasons 1 it is touching but not sappy it's told in a very real fashion without a lot of the aggravating hollywood storytelling baggage and the ending is quite good teary but not over the top br br 2 although it's clearly an african american film being set in the post segregation black community of lackawanna new york it doesn't wear its ethnicity on its sleeve the story stands on the strength of the characters and the dramas and comedies surrounding their lives it's not preachy it's simply good br br 3 it has a great soundtrack can't beat old school r b and chicago blues br br generally the acting is strong but not universally so some of the performances simply don't hold up to the characters the actors are supposed to portray but considering it was a made for tv movie that's to be expected br br 8 out of 10 imperfect but likable good film for a rainy day
<START> ignore the extreme votes about house of wax in no way is it either a 1 or a 10 i will try to be of help to anyone thinking about seeing house of wax or for those who saw it based on the trailer and feel cheated the trailer makes this movie look very promising which is what trailers are supposed to do there is only one thing for sure with trailers if the producers can't together a minute of interesting elements to make a trailer it is a pretty much a sure thing that the movie is a major suck fest but a good trailer only tells you that a few things about the movie are good it does not give you much idea about the total package here a little research can be valuable br br house of wax stars elisha cuthbert whose acting skills are closer to kathy ireland than to either her fellow canadian sarah or her lookalike rose and was directed by a music video artist formerly known as in his feature debut these are not good signs but if you are like me you ignore them and go to see the work of production designer grace walken who was responsible for the look of ghost ship once again walken's work is worth seeing so much so that it looks like 90 of the movie's 30 million budget went to production design the rest went to cuthbert to compensate her for the abuse she has to take throughout the film finger cut off lips glued shut tied up and lots of wading around in assorted gooey stuff by the bye cuthbert looks considerably heavier than she did in the girl next door about one big pig out away from having a major weight problem br br which means they had little left over to pay the rest of the cast and crew and judging from the what was on the screen this might actually be true it looks like everyone else donated their time to get their first acting or crew credit unfortunately whether it was inexperience or jealousy over the pay disparity the contributions of all these inexperienced incompetent volunteers amount to less than zero br br inexperienced steven dp work was about as awful as you are likely to see and working in league with an incompetent editor like joel insert pearl harbor here they manage to take away most of the value added by the production design group rather than linger over and showcase the sets window filmed this stuff with bad lighting and jerky zooming bobbing camera work compounded the problem with an insane number of disorienting cuts poor lighting an add like camera and flurry cutting are what you use to hide cheap and crappy production design not what is needed when the movie's only strength is its expensive and detailed sets br br chan hayes did the screenplay and charles who wrote the original story is credited as the writer although except for the title and the use of wax figures there is absolutely no similarity one saving grace is that the movie does not take itself seriously as a horror film and is mostly parody insert van helsing here the murders are played for laughs too extreme to be scary or even creepy to anyone over age six the audience particularly cracked up when a certain high profile hotel heiress got her homely face run through by an steel bar although her earlier half baked striptease was the only genuinely creepy thing in the film another comedy highlight was when cuthbert sticks her finger through a grate and has it clipped off by the bad guy br br the good scenes take place in house of wax a waxworks that has something to do with a closed sugar mill conjoined twins and a lot of roadkill which cuthbert gets to bathe in all this is supposed to be happening somewhere in rural florida although from the many hills it sure looks like paul hogan's country attention location scouts the gulf coast is not noted for it's rolling terrain the screenplay apparently intended to play up the connection bad pun between the two sets of twins but somewhere during production or post production most of the dialogue concerning this was trimmed since what is left about the twin connection makes no sense and goes nowhere you wonder why it wasn't also cut to reduce the boredom factor br br what is particularly sad is that the producers did not have the brains to recognize in mid production that they had the ingredients for a first rate horror classic even with the existing cast what was staring them in the face was a chance to go somewhere with the illusion of a town of wax because it is a photographic medium modern film is intrinsically naturalistic almost without exception prone to creating an illusion of reality here they had a ready made opportunity to give the photographic medium a theatrical element of extreme stylization like an impressionist painting the town creates the illusion of reality from a distance but reveals itself as a highly stylized wax fabrication up close of course they would have had to find a visionary director and dp to bring the thing off successfully but everything else was already in place for this to happen
<START> this movie was so frustrating everything seemed energetic and i was totally prepared to have a good time i at least thought i'd be able to stand it but i was wrong first the weird looping it was like watching america's funniest home videos the damn parents i hated them so much the stereo typical latino family i need to speak with the person responsible for this we need to have a talk that little girl who was always hanging on someone i just hated her and had to mention it now the final scene transcends i must say it's so gloriously bad and full of badness that it is a movie of its own what crappy dancing horrible and beautiful at once
<START> all the comments so far about this movie are negative but i have to say i found the net engaging few movies can keep me on the edge of my seat but this one did another plus for it is that most action suspense films are full of language but this one had little profanity i found it an enjoyable movie to watch i am slightly biased though being a big sandra bullock fan wink
<START> after reading fool for love in a drama class of mine i was looking forward to seeing how sam shepard's wonderful play would be translated to the screen much to my dismay it was nowhere near as entertaining as the play the film seemed to drag the music was inappropriate for the tone of the movie and all the raw energy of the play seemed to have been sucked out of this film version it's a shame to see this come out this way even with shepard's involvement playing the role of eddie do yourselves a favor see the play next time it's being performed in your area or simply read the book instead
<START> can you capture the moment when first you hear rain on a roof some things are beyond the sum of their parts expressing the poetry of life the things that matter br br poet dylan thomas captured the seemingly inexpressible a good poem helps to extend everyone's knowledge of himself and the world around him bob dylan named himself after him so why has it taken so long to make a film of the great dylan thomas a simple biopic could have missed the point writer sharman macdonald has taken a different better approach br br in the edge of love she creates the world of passions and complexities that fill the poems so we can swim in them the lives of four friends dylan who lusts and loves to the full wife caitlin sienna miller his feisty support war hero william cillian murphy who saves him from a street brawl and then there's his childhood sweetheart vera dear vera take your breath away vera she's caitlin's closest friend william's wife and like a muse the 'star' in dylan's dark sky br br it all kicks off in the 1940 london blitz with bomb shelters in the underground enter vera an impressive keira knightley under makeshift stage spotlights she meets dylan for the first time again in years her heart is flushed their eyes shine through the smoke of the room the purity of their former passion dylan native welsh speaker matthew rhys is no sanctified sanitised poet master of his vices he must experience them all fully he introduces his beloved wife then continues to woo vera br br the edge of love is a visual treat the soundtrack leaves you wanting for more performances are possibly the best by these actors in their careers as a lush love story it's pretty good as an insight into dylan thomas and the reality of poetry in all our lives not bad at all and as a tribute to a great man inspiring br br the production has been at pains to project the spirit of dylan thomas without compromising historical accuracy too much dramatic tension involves a pull between artistic freedom and conventional morality audiences looking for an experience based on the latter may be disappointed and it will play less well to audiences whose boundaries are those of albert square br br sharman macdonald seemed aware of the headstrong nature of artistic freedom and its limits when she spoke to producer granddaughter of the real william and vera think of all the things that you don't want me to write about she said because i have to have carte blanche for macdonald the limits were if she should cause offence to dylan's memory but for many artists especially men the limits are those which wife and family could set on them a woman is not going to let lofty ideals interfere with practical common sense issues and will even put her children's interests before her own this occasionally happens the other way round as when towering genius virginia woolf refused to let loving leonard bring her down to earth in the hours br br in spite of the tension between caitlin and vera these two women become closest buddies it is one of the main and very beautiful themes of the film br br the film's colours tell a story in themselves in a drab wartime britain caitlin and vera are vivid highlights in an ocean of grey shortly after meeting vera's lit up in lights stage persona we encounter caitlin through her searing blue eyes sparkling in a darkened railway carriage her dramatic red coat cuts a dash through streets of colourless triumphing on a beautiful staircase as she reunites with dylan but vera's lipstick red brightness is less enduring for her marriage is second best even when she has become possessed with genuine love for her husband br br outstanding cinematography extends to using montage to juxtapose images in a manner similar to juxtaposition of unrelated words to create further meaning horrific war scenes in are intercut with screams of vera in pregnancy giving birth or is it abortion we are not told immediately pain is universal and goes beyond time and place to our present day br br constant echoes of dylan's poetry throughout the film lead us beyond earthly opposites it reminds me of marlon brando reading ts eliot in apocalypse now a light beyond the horrors of the world a different way of seeing things i'll take you back to a time when no bombs fell from the sky and no one died Â ever says dylan to vera as they walk along the beach elsewhere caitlin recalls childhood with vera we're still innocent in dylan she says br br there's a time to leave your knickers at home or share a universal cigarette not literally perhaps a time to be inspired enjoy what is possibly the best british film of the year
<START> bart the genius whilst not the first simpsons episode bart he genius more or less is the first typical episode there's no gimmickry or theme it's just your typical simpsons episode in set up it always seems to me that it's an episode that grows on you there are certain elements i don't care for largely the animation which can be forgiven but over time i take a liking to this story of it's uniqueness br br for example it'd be very hard for a live action sit com on a standard budget to do this episode due to the various different sets that show in this episode the computer bays in ms class the opera and so on my point is with that the simpsons realises one of the biggest strengths in animation the sheer lack of visual limitations when compared to live action br br on a writing stand point it's also highly intelligent and fresh the concept is pretty unique and particularly the problems faced instead of the ol' fail safe that work was too hard it was simply bart's social isolation from his classmates that failed him although the exploding science experiment may prove otherwise which i also think is one of the best visual gags of the series the ending seems a little unoriginal largely because the bart running naked into his room to avoid homer was already done in the shorts but still funny for marge and lisa's short back and forth if for nothing else br br ultimately it's a very good episode with lots of interesting new point in the series though not exactly perfect br br oh and the now iconic name was of course unleashed onto the world
<START> hooray for title misspellings after reading reviews and contemplating my girlfriend and i confirmed that this movie is an utter piece of trash this movie lost her as one of those rare tarantino fans i wish it were made on nitrate film and all the copies piled neatly underneath a chain smoking tarantino fanboy the literally needless violence the plot holes tarantino's table itis sans drama and absent character development made this a thoroughly painful glorified montage br br what acting was there and how much of that was just because i was too busy reading the subtitles i watch my share of anime and kudos for the attempt at authenticity but it was overdone for an english language movie with the glaring historical inadequacies the constant reading killed what acting there was br br why pay money for a narrator who will have absolutely no tie to any of the characters plot themes setting or anything involved in the movie when the movie needs that sort of off hand explanation it's foreshadowing the utter filth that follows br br historical research while it was sprinkled with interesting used the proper costumes and props for the soldiers this movie stretched the truth beyond belief even for historical fiction kudos on mata hari reference though using it as foreshadowing was a bit much mata hari was executed by a firing squad not choked in an isolated room this ruined any sense that the reference may have had br br other reviews mention more than half a dozen homages to other artists in the first 15 minutes considering the audience all these and other references were completely lost on many who would bother to see this movie and all who would enjoy it br br i'm confused by his choices of when to start a scene end it and what needs to be included in a movie promoted as an action film why did it take nearly 20 minutes to set up any sort of testosterone br br what i believe to be the message was trite the idea of rats and how we act on a primal nature against them and who is the rat were at best clichÃ©d but at worst not realized mention of american camps for the japanese and german americans would have added legitimacy to this question to the moral high ground literally every character in the film that gets a speaking role was caught up in their own legend is that the world in which tarantino lives br br i'm glad i didn't pay to see this one i regret that i bothered to view it at all even with well meaning hosts there was a rich base of ideas to develop but none were realized
