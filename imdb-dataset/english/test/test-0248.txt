<START> inuyasha was awful this show was incredibly over hyped but this is nothing but a tedious bunch of anime clichÃ©s the characters are annoying and lifeless the story line is boring and endless i think that it could have be something interesting if it have a better writing but it seems that the writers of the show have more intentions in show inuyasha and his stupid friends fighting with some monsters and then crying for his tragic love triangle with and and a lot of circles around the same thing again and again the script is cheesy and dumb and the animation is poor the character design it 's very ugly i don't know why everyone love it all have the same face big eyes tiny noses a line as the mouth and the typical anime haircuts i find inuyasha incredibly boring and dumb this have to be one of the most over rated animated shows ever made
<START> sally and saint anne is a very funny movie the first time my mom told me about it i was 7 and saint anne had just been the saint i had for my communion saint my mom knew this so she told me to watch this with her i did and have seen it many times since because it is really funny aunt bea from the andy griffith show was in it and sally's grandfather was the guy who played santa claus in miracle on 34th street so there were lots of actors we seen on tv shows too there is a bad guy who keeps trying to steal the house away and sally keeps trying things with st anne to help raise money so they can keep the house that includes a boxing match with hugh o'brian who plays her older brother this is a good and funny movie that i still love
<START> this film is probably hal hartley's best one the subject of a unusual originality is treated that's usual with hal hartley with great humor this characteristic isn't at all the only quality of this film the fussy frame composition everything is parallel until the smallest details shooting angles lighting giving a more supernatural dimension to these blurred images jesus' coming down couldn't be filmed in a conventional way the falsely poser acting are qualities that make this bible re reading carried out in the form of an apocalyptic delirium essential
<START> this movie is called solomon kane which it isn't the main character wears a hat but that's all he has in common with robert howard's character solomon kane as known from early pulp magazines and lots of publications ever since these days it is a fantasy movie not really that bad and it might easily have passed with a rather good review if it hadn't been called solomon kane the hero is a newly invented character who definitely is not the story is not robert howard neither br br as a fantasy movie it is one more movie following the traditions of the genre simple story poor cgi poor actors poor directing yet it can be fun you know 'the cheaper they are the better they are' but since it is called solomon kane i cannot accept it imagine a lord of the rings movie with a hero bilbo who fights the black sorcerer with the help of his dwarf friend aragorn and the beautiful heroine and with a final fight where the three use a magical ring to kill the evil sorcerer who has transformed into the dragon imagine that this is exactly what this movie has done with robert howard's character solomon kane br br i'd give it a 4 stars review if it was just another horror movie but since it is called solomon kane i can only rate it 3 stars
<START> i watched this years ago on television when i was sick i don't know i tend to be more complacent with my tv viewing when i'm sick too much effort to use the remote control i guess br br from what i can recall every aspect of the movie casting acting writing directing etc was ill advised at best i could have forgiven the historical inaccuracies if this film had created a sense of what it was like to work on trinity but it didn't there were attempts to humanize the scientists but they were insufficient and never transcended caricature br br i didn't know very much about the people involved in the manhattan project at the time but the portrayals in the movie were so cartoonish that i became interested in learning about the real personalities and i did so i guess this horrible film has done a very small amount of good after all br br this is not an in depth review but neither deserves nor requires one you might enjoy it if you're a fan of bad movies
<START> h o t s is proof that at one time the movie industry said f off to the censors and made movies with whatever they wanted in today's world this movie would be too over the top and extreme for it to be anywhere than behind a velvet curtain although had several copies on their 5 99 rack in case anyone wanted to get a copy the movie was brilliant in its own way in that it blended humor into a t a movie loaded with playboy playmates unlike most skin flicks it did have a plot that however is not exactly why you would watch h o t s br br h o t s is a college movie that reminds me of the revenge of the nerds movies in that it takes a group of average people and puts them against the elite rich preppies that most people can't stand the only difference is that the nerds in this movie have a much better shot at getting laid i notice that there are some people who would rate this movie low and to me that is ignorant obviously this is not intended to win oscars or break barriers in film if you are looking for that then go watch what ever the critics pick for you you have to appreciate the fact that this movie actually had a funny plot decent acting for the most part given the genre and plenty of girls getting naked h o t s is one of those movies you watch to get your mind off of modern day problems and daily stress and instead laugh and have a good time if you are looking for a funny college based movie that has enough skin to turn a pink straight then you should really check out h o t s
<START> being a wallace and gromit fan i was looking forward for this full length movie surprisingly i saw it at the world premiere in vlissingen nl at the film by the sea festival a wonderful feeling to be one of the first to see this very amusing and merry movie it's about wallace and gromit whom i believe don't need an introduction having their own pest control company in the city which is hosting a giant vegetable contest in a few days everyone including an eccentric baroness is hoping his or her giant carrot or melon will win the golden carrot unfortunately the town is plagued by lots of hungry rabbits this is where w g come in the have their own cracking contraptions to control these cute creatures in a human way br br it's a very funny and colorful story anyone who liked the three proceeding short movies of w g which are more than great will love this full length movie nick park really delivered a wonderful and original result with a great sense for humor like in chicken run it truly amazes me how he can capture so much story and emotions in just a few frames job well done lad oh yeah the music was fantastic it really completes the ride enjoy
<START> this movie as the 1st movie should be active to their people and show the good thing on them otherwise we see in this as cast want show religion's people in saudi arabia as terrorist and stupid in fact their not they are very peaceful and smart about the director is not even less good the grandfather in movie is very younger than the father everyone notes that and the girls who not saudi by the way show our girls as pitches looking to man to satisfy their needs was just another part of furniture at act he did nothing to imagine only when he said to his lover i love you and yell to his friend don't talk to strange girls really funny or really stupid br br the father was so not moving only set their and he watch this movie as not one of cast and only word he said al the weird thing in this movie is when the girls were set in restaurant in family's part there voice in behind young man talk to his girlfriends kiss me many times is that happened in saudi arabia when the girls and boys grow up good and not bitches and adulterer any saudi have patriot in his heart will not allow to see this stupid movie
<START> for me this is not a good tv show animated or otherwise it is however annoying to the nth degree there are a few reasons for this in no particular order first the intro of one of the most pointless and annoying characters ever batmite this character serves no purpose for the show whatsoever maybe it is intended as comic relief but it doesn't work out that way next up the joker i thought it was really ridiculous to have his character let loose with that ridiculous laugh after almost every sentence talk about repetitive this gets old really fast also don't think the had the right actor to voice the character it just doesn't sound at all like the joker should sound lastly they made robin look like a complete dork other than these problems the show isn't that bad but these are big enough problems to drastically lower the likability factor for me the new adventures of batman is a 3 10 at best
<START> extraordinary rendition is a frightening practice authorized surprisingly under clinton that allows the u s government to seize and hold anyone suspected seemingly for any reason of being a terrorist against the united states this is a touchy issue especially after 9 11 because supporters of the practice will always criticize the opposition as withholding vital power from the u s that it needs to effectively fight terror fanatic supporters will label the opposition as terrorists in themselves br br but like a recent film that lent a similar level of humanity to the death penalty the life of david gale rendition shows us a story of the misuse of extraordinary rendition or at least the ease with which it can be exploited and falsely applied the story involves anwar el an american chemical engineer born in egypt who is seized on his way back to america from giving a lecture in egypt the cause given is that he made phone calls to a known terrorist no proof is ever given or needed that it was anwar that made the calls that his phone was never lost of stolen br br meanwhile extremely pregnant wife isabella is back in the states frantically trying to find her husband who got onto a plane to chicago but apparently never got off the flimsy explanation that he was never there evaporates when she discovers that he made an in flight purchase using his credit card br br lately i have been researching modern chinese history particularly that of the astonishingly selfish and brutal dictatorship set up by mao tse tung and it is more than a little frightening to see the similarities between extraordinary rendition and some of brutal scare tactics including his public executions which the people were forced to watch and extensive use of torture specifically used to extract confessions br br it is pretty disturbing to notice that mao specifically did these things to create an environment of fear in order to achieve obedience from the chinese people to say that the bush administration has not created an environment of fear and continues to milk it for everything it's worth would be naÃ¯ve in the extreme and although extraordinary rendition was not created under bush it is clear that it does more harm than good br br adding to the thickness of the film is douglas freeman jake gyllenhaal who works behind a desk for the cia and has little field experience until his boss is assassinated and he suddenly finds himself supervising the torture of a man that he quickly comes to doubt has anything to reveal freeman's boss daughter also plays a pivotal role as does a aide played by peter sarsgaard who might have the most satisfying role in the movie meryl streep is also suitably cold and clinical as a chilly senator with a dogmatic support of the necessity and practice of rendition br br as a political thriller the movie is remarkably well crafted and paced but the scariest thing about it is that this is all real the movie's goal is to get people to really think about the things done in america's name especially when they claim to be done to prevent those same things conducting terror in the name of preventing terror will win no sympathy for us nor will extracting confessions through brutal torture which is the basest form of criminal investigation br br unfortunately we are gradually heading in that direction of doing these things more rather than less the frightening question is what is the event that is going to take place at some point in the future to convince us to stop and head the other way toward civilization and peace or will we just keep heading toward a military dictatorship until we finally get there
<START> tenacious d in the pick of destiny tells the fictional tale of the formation of the band tenacious d and their quest to find the pick of destiny a guitar pick with supernatural powers made from the tooth of satan himself played by dave jb jack black and kyle gass joined together by fate must travel to the rock n' roll museum and steal the pick of destiny to become the greatest band on earth the movie is hilarious and delivers non stop laughs jack black and kyle gass work perfectly together having been real life friends and co workers for over 20 years the film is in part a musical all or most of the music was written and performed by the d all of the songs are new material and many of them are classic the soundtrack is definitely worth checking out this film will be mostly appreciated by fans of tenacious d but if you are not a fan of the d i still think you will enjoy the movie if you are a fan of the d then you must see this movie the acting isn't as bad as you may think and the laughs and crudeness never stop coming i highly recommend this movie to anyone looking to get their socks rocked off and laugh as hard as they have laughed in a long time look out for cameos by dave ronnie james dio meatloaf ben stiller amy poehler tim robbins john c reilly and neil hamburger also stay tuned for an extra scene after the credits
<START> incident on and off a mountain road is don entry in mick garris' masters of horror series coscarelli is famous for being the man behind such cult gems as the phantasm series and the irresistibly weird bubba ho tep but he brings none of the qualities that made those films great to this tv episode the plot is a run of the mill one that follows the routine idea of an innocent being chased by a madman this time it's a young woman driving down a mountain road after a head on crash she finds herself being stalked by a white faced maniac the whole chase sequence is really ridiculous with the young lady stopping every so often to set traps only for the maniac to show up seconds later and this is cut with scenes showing her with her husband who just happens to have a wealth of information on how escape insane killers with lines such as expect the unexpected the only real highlight for me was the presence of tall man angus scrimm coscarelli tries his best to implement as much horror imagery as possible with things such as a rotted corpse of a dead baby but because it's all so silly on the whole it's difficult to take this piece seriously this is the first episode in the series and the first that i've seen i really hope they get better
<START> the 1994 film production of heart of darkness was in no way capable of living up to the outstanding book the film contained unnecessary scenes that confused the viewer rather than aiding them in understanding what was going on the director was obviously not experienced and if he is then he didn't show it on top of that scenes from the book were left out or changed scenes that were rather important the movie left me feeling rather bored and was a complete waste of my time the characters acted as though they had no idea what was going on and the actors did not portray the emotions that marlow and the rest revealed in the book overall the movie was terrible and completely lacked the suspense that was otherwise necessary to make it even remotely interesting
<START> br br summary not worth the film br br as an avid gone with the wind fan i was disappointed to watch the original movie and see that they had left out many important characters luckily the film on its own was a wonderful piece when the book scarlett came out i read it in hopes of following two of my favorite literary characters farther on their journey together while the book lacks any true quality it remains a good story and as long as i was able to separate it from the original was and still is enjoyable however i consider the six hours i spent watching the scarlett miniseries to be some of the worst spent hours of my life any of the original character traits so well formed in margaret mitchell's book this series also turned the story of the sequel into one of rape mistrust murder and relationships that even the book scarlett stayed away from the casting for many of the characters refused to examine the traits that had been so well formed in both the original novel and film and even carried through in the second book and again leaves out at least one incredibly crucial character in the novel scarlett o'hara butler follows her estranged husband rhett butler to charleston under the guise of visiting extended family after coming to an arrangement with rhett she agrees to leave and proceeds to reconnect with her o'hara relatives in savannah eventually she accompanies her cousin a passionate leader of the brotherhood to ireland to further explore her family's roots that go deep and is eventually named the o'hara the head of the family while her duties as the o'hara keep her engaged in her town of scarlett ventures out into the world of the english landowners and instantly becomes a sought after guest at many of their parties she having been scorned by rhett time and time again eventually agrees to marry luke the earl of fenton until rhett comes along in a clichÃ©d night on white horse type of a rescue the scarlett miniseries fails even to do this justice raped by her fiancÃ© and scorned by her family the series shows scarlett thrown in jail after she is blamed for a murder her cousin committed br br i heartily advise anyone considering spending their day watching this to rethink this decision br br
<START> james l brook is one of those directors who always seems to take a quirky look at life he isn't only the producer for the simpsons he has some classic comedies under his belt broadcast news is one of them br br although it doesn't match his later effort as good as it gets broadcast news is still a very clever funny and witty movie about a television broadcasting station and all the problems they suffer there's a great comedic sequence of physical humor where joan cusack is running around the building trying to rush a news tape to the editing room in a matter of mere minutes before it is to be broadcast live on tv br br this isn't only very truthful in terms of how hectic broadcasting stations are operated but also a skillful and honest portrayal of human beings br br a low key subtle movie with good acting especially from hurt who i don't always like so much and apt direction
