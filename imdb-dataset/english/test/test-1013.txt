<START> this is a serious film about black revolutionaries and not really an action film billy dee plays a young man fed up with racism who decides to take things into his own hands it's fairly gritty and realistic without exploiting the characters but still it's not that interesting either and billy dee's character though by white authority figures doesn't really come off as sympathetic it's also hurt by it's extremely low budget still it's interesting to look at as it's a good of 1970s social issues
<START> wow the curse of michael myers what a great film suspenseful entertaining creative and a clever plot which i love many hate the concept i love it i think that it gives the halloween series some plot marianne hagan is a wonderful actress and turns in a excellent performance especially for her first film and paul rudd and donald pleasence are great also my only complaint is that why wasn't danielle harris in this film as jamie she wanted to return but the producers said no i thought j c brandy was great but i love danielle harris still i love halloween the curse of michael myers i think the mask looks the best in this film and george p wilbur is the best michael myers ever incredibly creepy and suspenseful halloween 6 rules br br i adore this very violent but immensely enjoyable film the halloween horror series by far the best in the genre br br 10 out of 10
<START> this is a perfect example of the 90's mainstream horror crap nothing is scary here and the film is almost bloodless yes there is some violence but everything is politically correct like in a tv movie this is not a completely bad picture i can safely say that i found it quite enjoyable however a lack of the originality really hurts voodoo all in all if you are a part of the mainstream audience and pseudo horror movies like scream are your favourite then you'll love voodoo but if you want something very gruesome avoid this film
<START> i don't expect a lot from ghost stories but i do expect a story to make a bit of sense is that asking too much from the screenwriters and filmmakers when the bad guy all of the sudden becomes a homicidal maniac solely because a bunch of crows start pecking him then i have a problem spending 9 00 for a ticket alfred hitchcock would be spinning in his grave didn't anyone learn anything in their college film 101 class a good movie has at its roots an interesting story br br here are some of the ridiculous messages in this movie if you have desperate financial problems move from chicago to the middle of no where in north dakota to grow i kid you not if your toddler has serious neurological problems from a car accident move away from some of the best hospitals and speech therapists in the country to an isolated small town which at best has a community hospital hire a drifter to live work with you out of the blue without checking any references when you have a teenage vixen daughter a wife and toddler i'm glad they're not my parents br br a town where everyone knows everything would have no problem missing a triple homicide just outside of town and of course blame the man's lunacy on a bad crop of doesn't anything else grow in north dakota a couple of days after you buy your rundown house with huge vines growing everywhere that it reminds you of jack and the a guy from the x files ala smoking man i'm glad to see the cigarettes didn't get him i guess he doesn't inhale will just suddenly sneak up on you while you're working to offer you the sale price of your home plus 15 more for absolutely no reason br br i think you get the picture i have seen so many godforsaken awful movies in the past month it just blows my mind is it that difficult to make a movie that doesn't treat the audience like an idiot i'm glad at least the crows in this sorry film turned out to have the some brains i wish i could say the same for whomever thinks they are going to make money off this celluloid piece of trash
<START> for me it's a case you'll never understand if you didn't live it so read this to know why would i have such unlimited anger br br i heard a lot about bruce lee my father loved him my mother who hates any minor shot of violence loved him and how she talks till now about his the big boss aka fists of fury and the experience of watching it at the egyptian movies 1973 with all the gigantic success further to that i watched a real good movie about him dragon the bruce lee story 1993 so i found myself crying where are your movies bruce br br i went to the video store and it was dumb move you'll know why and waw i found a lot of bruce lee movies i selected one named bruce lee in new guinea br br i did it to myself and watched that one oh god please forgive your servant i harmed myself but with no intended decision i wouldn't do it if i knew its evil damaging its mythical level of hideousness br br after that i didn't understand at all what's the big fuss about bruce lee as a great immortal star why anybody would care whether he is here or there this hero whom i've watched is not that gifted and not that genius and of course is not that sexy br br until my father saw this star and he asked me to pause at any of his close ups and after he examined his face a little he told me in a very definitive way this is not bruce lee so i became too confused to ask who's this silly guy anyway br br it was 2001 2 years after my first entry to the imdb database therefore i tended to it immediately to know who the hell is that man and i discovered the truth he isn't bruce lee no my dear friends he is bruce li br br and what a huge so huge difference i just want to know who can love that bad clone or god forbid love his repulsive movies i watched 2 of them and couldn't bear finishing the third br br after that i ignored all our video stores because its cheap cunning writing on the posters that this is bruce lee and i've got the original the one and only bruce lee who is such a great star indeed and oh boy he certainly had the right to immortality and no less
<START> one of the funniest movies made in recent years good characterization plot and exceptional chemistry make this one a classic
<START> hmmm is it worst film ever well sort of for some of the cast its a shame to see them in such a film but hey if it pays the bills why not as for the film well ok cg effects not to bad for such a cheap film music is just about ok again for a cheap film end credits are ok lol br br bad to many to list but cast acting sets script ending what the hell drac worst drac ever many more but can not be bothered to put them all down br br idea was ok but needed ten times the budget and more thought and much better lighting and style and change all bad points i do say however to see this film so you to can say what the fu was that all about as the credits run also its kind of a must see just to see how bad it is
<START> my friend zac rented this movie free of charge since his mom works at a rental store i still feel ripped off since i won't ever be able to get those 100 minutes of my life back having watched the first dark harvest the night prior to this viewing i expected to at least see a crappy remake of the first film wrong br br there isn't a single scarecrow in the movie unless you count the one of the cover of the box nor are there any real death scenes the movie got its r rating from an 8 year old girl screaming god d n at her father br br there is no amount of tequila that could make this movie bearable believe me we tried
<START> that's all i can really say about this film it's like tree of might and the world's strongest it really doesn't fit into the timeline for the show at all though it is supposedly placed just before the beginning of the tv series the action is pretty nice in general the plot has a nice enough base with a good background establishing why these guys hate each other and all pretty good in general there the problem is there's a lot of really weird stuff i mean really weird stuff like the world's strongest there's a really really odd song in this one that could only have been created in a drug induced haze disturbing is the fact that while singing is pretty much drugged out himself creepy the villains are odd and rather comical moreso than the usual type this seems more like it was made as a dragon ball movie rather than a dragon ball z movie in general its entertaining enough but just strange
<START> this must be one of mgm's and frank sinatras worst films an oddball musical comedy that fails in almost every aspect silly plot has sinatra trying to carry on his fathers reputation as a kissing bandit he's no bandit and doesn't kiss he does play the nerdy character as well as could be expected given the dialog he has to speak the scene are j carroll nash and mildred natwick too bad they didn't have more scenes together i've given the film two stars because the sets and costumes are superior and one of the songs sung by grayson love is where you find it is sensational could have had a of that one also a comic type dance number by cyd charisse and ann miller if fun so for those reasons and those reasons only it is watchable kissing bandit is part of the frank sinatra early years collection
<START> wladyslaw starewicz was a russian born animator living in france who did incredible things using stop motion i've seen a couple of these films before and they feature his favorite subjects insects frogs and various animals they are extremely realistic and lifelike and even today are amazing to watch the quality is simply fantastic br br this one stars lots and lots of frogs they appeal to their god jupiter to give them a king why do they need a king wonders jupiter their lives are perfectly fine now so to teach them a nasty lesson he makes an the king and one by one it starts eating its subjects then the frogs once again appeal to jupiter who states the obvious moral that it's best to be happy with what you have br br while the animation quality is incredible this is a very creepy film for kids i would think this would terrify them both by how real the animals look as well as the story itself which is not for the faint of heart
<START> our family and friends enjoyed this movie very much the theme was well handled by the director with great performances from shabana azmi konkana sen and well supported by good performances from the other cast the climax was built well but for the ending which was a far from being called good we are still trying to understand what was the director trying to convey were they short of ideas or was the ending beyond the understanding of common movie lovers a better ending would have created a lasting impression on the audience and increased the viewer ship this however should not take away credit that is due to konkana and shabana azmi for relating so well with the characters
<START> greetings all br br isn't it amazing the power that films have on you after the 1st viewing br br i was so delighted by the first viewing of this film i couldn't stop talking about to all my friends for weeks mind you i was a very impressionable 18 year old back then and my taste in films have become a little more conservative since then br br then somehow i forgot about this film until i saw the dvd in my local department store and remembering how great it was i thought right i'll pluck you off the shelf when they bring out the special edition br br last week i was overjoyed when my best friend invited me over to watch on dvd the expectation was that i would love this film even more on 2nd viewing how wrong i was br br verdict after 11 years my view on this film had changed from a very scary 1st class movie to total junk which overplays on the religious and supernatural side of things superficially br br i have never been a big fan of julia roberts' acting excepting for erin in which she deserved her oscar i think the problem with this film definitely lies with the director and a so so mediocre script i left this film feeling it had no real substance or potential and just a couple of scarey cheap thrills which weren't very well done at all not even the score by james howard who i rather like as a film composer could captivate and thrill me br br in 1990 i would have given this film 9 5 10 but in 2001 i'd be lucky to give it 2 10 at best br br
<START> the filmmakers neglected to connect the dots that is the sequence of events and choices that led from charlie wilson and the anti soviet to al qaeda and osama bin laden and eventually to 9 11 the filmmakers of course neglect to tell us the back story why were the soviets in afghanistan but that omission pales in comparison to their failure to reveal that support for extremists in afghanistan in the name of rabid anti communism ultimately strengthened the hand of anti western forces and was a big contributing factor to the mess that we find ourselves in today 9 11 terrorist networks a prolonged ground war in afghanistan etc because these consequences are not spelled out the movie leaves the viewer feeling sympathetic to mr wilson hey check out his latest projects on the internet instead of seeing him as an individual whose actions were contrary to the best interests of his country and the west as a whole
<START> recap not entirely familiar with the shakespeare story of macbeth but my wild guess is that this is pretty close to the original only set in present time it tells the story of macbeth a member of a crime syndicate in melbourne he is a valued hit man and in the favor of leader duncan but he and his lady has higher ambitions than that and plan the murder of duncan and any competition of the throne this is a story of betrayal and cold brutal death br br comments very interesting idea i must say to use the story but change the setting to present time but still keep the original dialog it sets a huge contrast between the classical poetic work and the violence promised to be extremely violent it is a promise that it keeps but not in the notion i imagined it is very bloody indeed but the violence is slow not just figuratively speaking that it is calculated which it is too but also literally a lot of action is actually slowed down to slow motion and that is what brings the movie to its knees br br what could have been a unique strength the contrast between the superfluous and poetic dialog and the extreme violence now turns into something else entirely now both slow the move down painfully much so much that it actually becomes dull and boring at times br br also i can't figure out the context the three witches act within set to present time and reality i figure that such magical witchcraft had no place in the movie apparently it does but to me it seems completely out of place not a subplot but a complete sub story with it's own rules completely different than the rest of the movie seems completely out of place surely it must have been possible to convert that part too to something modern drug induced hallucinations perhaps which i suspect that the director hints at but then he has left way too much witchcraft in it to be believable now they only bring stretches of the movie that is clearly beside the story and i just waited for the real movie to begin again br br a clear disappointment but maybe something for shakespearean buffs br br 4 10
