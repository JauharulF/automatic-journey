<START> the book while not particularly great was decent but this movie completely changes it a lot of the elements of the story are consistent between the book and the movie but dr ross' character goes from a creatively written character who lives for money and ends up causing the volcanic eruption with her greed to a heart on her sleeve damsel in distress who won't do anything if she even catches the slightest hint that it might be less than noble when movies change the book that much but keep the same name it should be a crime
<START> thankfully you don't need a lot of book to understand where this thing's going obviously a poverty row cash in on universal's big hit the wolf man which was made just one year earlier this finds the always watchable george zucco in another of his patented mad doctor roles as brilliant vengeance minded scientist lorenzo cameron cameron who has set up shop deep in the swamp lands of what i'm presuming is the louisiana bayou is plotting revenge against four of his former peers who both humiliated him and forced him to resign from his previous job you see they scoffed at his claims of being able to mix man with beast to create an unstoppable army of wolfman creatures that would come in handy during war time thankfully cameron has found the ideal test subject for his wolf blood injections a hulking child like half wit named glenn strange is pretty clueless as to what's going on doesn't ask too many question and lets the doc strap him down to a table and shoot him up with whatever happens to be in his syringe this results in a time lapse change of man turning into a werewolf cameron lets him out of the mansion using a secret passageway so you basically get a big guy strange was dressed in overalls with a bushy beard hairy paws and a set of over sized plastic teeth running around in the woods the majority of the time after an eyewitness sees the beast and a little girl is killed the locals grab their rifles and organize a posse to hunt it down dr cameron who can control the beast with a whip and also has a handy antidote to reverse the effect also drags along to the big city to try to track down the professors who had made a mockery of his original theories and destroyed his reputation in the process also hanging around the house is cameron's daughter anne as well as nosy reporter boyfriend tom johnny downs whose first inclination is that they're dealing with an upright walking prehistoric creature br br though a typically chintzy prc flick in many ways with unimpressive sets cinematography and make ups as well as a fairly bland supporting cast it remains watchable thanks to the histrionics of star george zucco i have no clue why downs received top billing he shows up half an hour in and really doesn't have a whole lot to do nor is he all that impressive doing it this is show all the way and he's great ranting and raving talking to himself while fantasizing that he's talking to his peers i'm not interested in your imbecilic mouthings and temporarily sliding in and out of sanity strange seems to have patterned his performance as the hilariously naive and slow talking semi retarded country bumpkin around the entire oeuvre of lon chaney jr from his turn as lenny in of mice and men to his performance as the aforementioned wolf man in any case strange and zucco do a fairly good job playing off one another my favorite part is when zucco calls him his guinea pig in front of a colleague while just sits there grinning and staring at a doorknob some of the foggy swamp scenes are pretty atmospheric too
<START> this movie has inspired me to be a better person in life you don't know who you will run across and sometimes our prejudice will cause us to a person wrongly i have learned to give a person the benefit of the doubt because of this movie i also learned that tough love can build a stronger person now i want to know where to find the movie soundtrack there are songs in this soundtrack i have been trying to get for years may i comment on the acting for a second jamie fox was outstanding the man has risen to be the actor of actors also the performance of regina king was awesome if i can get a woman to look at me the way she looked at ray i can only dream i plucked down 18 00 for this movie and i don't have a lot of money but i am willing to see this movie again and again this movie touched me
<START> but perhaps you have to have grown up in the 80's to truly appreciate this movie if you love the early 80's this is definitely a must see also one of the best soundtracks ever
<START> yash raj films are so funny whatever works they follow it yet they are called the best production house br br seeing bhatt films working they copied the formula bikini and everything plus casting low actors like and br br the film is so horrible it makes you cringe br br the jokes are so bad and horny it makes you slap them resembles a gay plus a monkey br br resembles an idiot br br the director thinks we all are idiots arjun takes the audience for granted music is saving grace camera work is good br br chopra hams like an idiot looks like kajol in k3g if kajol was annoying der then is worse the rest are okay
<START> i had never paid much attention to this flick until i learned that paddy author of the brilliant network was the scriptwriter his work there had instructed me as to his genius so when appeared on tmc i was anxious to see it i was not disappointed looking at both this film and network it would seem that his big theme is the absurdity inanity and sheer viciousness of large human enterprises e g hospitals networks against the sanctity of individual experience and the human spirit and all of it delivered with a knife edge sense of utterly black humor hospital is as black of a comedy as network is and the excellent cast led by the incomparable scott does his work full justice this is a keeper definitely not to miss
<START> i am very impressed with the acting in comanche moon before i started watching this i wasn't expecting it to be as good as lonesome dove i couldn't believe how well the actors were chosen to represent all the characters it blew my mind how well they played each role this was in my opinion almost as good as lonesome dove its hard to compare any film to lonesome dove if you don't make that comparison i would give this a thumbs up it was very entertaining i don't post many comments on this site but i just felt i had to get my opinion out there amazing i don't want to go off naming every actor who was brilliant because i would probably have to list every single one my favorite was steve he hit the nail on the head playing captain gus his mannerisms were perfect
<START> no the melancholy of might at a first glance make you think that this is just another animated school comedy drama well it's not the setting just happen to be a school environment this is a comedy alright but a very smart one with a lot of sarcasm and the characters does have a psychological which is almost in the same class that can be found in the works of ingmar bergman the episodes is aired as it seems out of order i e the pilot is in fact episode 11 this makes it possible to present small clues to upcoming episodes the show is an adaption of popular novel series about br br what about the story then like in all the episodes does the story revolves who tries to ease her own boredom by embarking in adventures her self has no interest in ordinary humans and actively searches for aliens time travelers and persons with supernatural forces to find this sort of people she has formed a club which she calls the sos brigade save the world by it with fun brigade except for the other members of the sos brigade is he is the real protagonist of the show it's trough his point of view that we follow the story he just happen to sit in front in class when came up with the idea to form the sos brigade he is quite sceptical to most club activities and tags along just to ensure that don't go to much to the extremes and he is the only one in the class that likes to talk with another member is yuki which is the indispensable silent member and is also the only remaining member of the literature club which room the sos brigade has occupied in the quest for a free club room she doesn't mind that the sos brigade uses her as long as she can sit in a corner and read her books she also participate in the brigades activities was voluntarily arrested by because the club needed a lolita like mascot for anything suspicious to happen she often act as the clubs maid the last member is the always smiling who happens to be the mysterious transfer student meaning he transfered two months in to the semester which finds to qualifies as mysterious br br thinks that all members but are some random picked people in school but the do indeed have their own interest in her
<START> i bought this movie because of raquel welch she was gorgeous in this film as she played the role of harry mike wagner girl friend harry a robber down on his luck trying to make one more heist harry goes to a funeral where he meets vittorio de sica and takes him for a ride when things don't work out on the ride they put there mines together to figure out the fastest way to get money harry and his gang decide with the help of vittorio de sica to from there on mob rest a sure that no matter what the gang goes after that the outcome is never the same and will keep you on the edge of your sit the rest of the out come you need to watch for yourself as far as raquel goes if you're a fan of here then you need to watch this movie because she never looked better standing on the beach with a on i give this movie 10 weasel stars on raquel welch body alone it's no wonder why she was the hottest actress back in the sixties she was the sex symbol everyone one wanted and no one could get not only does she look good she can act even better if you like raquel welch then you'll like this movie
<START> i thought the movie was pretty good i really enjoyed myself as i viewed it however the last scene at johnny's birthday party was cut way too short i myself was an extra in that scene and was upset with the results but other than that and the weird casting the movie was superb
<START> i liked this quite a bit but i have friends that hated this there's no sex but there's very little nudity in any of the episodes which is a good thing also has a toilet fixation that's explored in at least half the episodes toilets are way more advanced in japan hmm i'm wondering why i rated this so high myself it certainly isn't that i like naked cartoon girls in some ways oe the main character is analogous to johnny bravo except instead of being an obnoxious musclebound jock is a hyperactive nerd or you can think of him as japan's answer to leisure suit larry he's easier to take if you watch it subtitled rather than dubbed but he grows on you either way if you give him a chance he is the br br the formula is the same for each episode boy meets girl boy tries to win girl's heart despite being a dorky pervert boy somehow succeeds against all odds typically the girl doesn't realize she likes until after he's beaten to a pulp and or pulled off some spectacular stunt like engineering a modern operating system in one week or winning a race against a gasoline powered motorcycle using his bicycle br br episode 1 features a rich software tycoon i think animating her boobs put a major dent in the budget because she's the only female that has this kind of animation she also dresses completely unprofessionally most people who rate this negatively probably never got past the first episode br br episode 2 has the rich young daughter who likes to tease she's only 16 but that's legal age in japan and in some states in the us i might add her father is also a brutal type that has a reputation for killing guys interested in his daughter br br girl 3 is the sweet innocent daughter of a noodle shop owner that's mixed up with a bad boyfriend aside from running interference for the maiden and being kissed by a guy there's almost no ecchi of any kind in this episode a sharp drop from the previous two nevertheless and the evil boyfriend really pound each other br br episode 4 has trying to impress a top notch swimming coach seems more about his intentions with this particular girl than any other and she's pretty direct in return br br girl 5 is the biker babe she's probably the most top heavy of the 6 although not super buoyant like girl 1 and in terms of sexuality and vulgarity this particular episode is easily the most over the top in terms of lack of realism should have broken every bone in his body at least twice during the race against the biker babe but i think the producers and writers said it's just a cartoon we can do anything this lapse in realism makes it a fan favorite br br finally episode 6 introduces a new girl that's works in animation and the previous 5 girls help as he tries to cope with impossible time and resource constraints to get an oav out the door by the deadline in terms of ecchi this one's very tame as well but there's plenty of humor the ending has all 5 extremely pretty girls from the past team up to hunt who slips away unnoticed ostensibly with the intention of gang raping him yeah that almost happens in real life someone crossed ala samurai with steve ala family matters br br all in all there's no middle ground for this you'll either hate it or love it if you're new to anime you probably don't want to start with this at the same time if you can stand characters like happosai from ranma 1 2 or johnny bravo or you like comedies that lean more heavily towards silliness but have very sexual overtones you should give it a shot
<START> i had heard interesting critics on this movie i believed it was a love story but i wasn't sure what was the plot about so when i finally saw it i found myself in the middle of a love relationship between the ex con isabel isabel and the junkie sebastiÃ¡n so a love story but not probably what i was expecting br br the movie is focused on isabel as she struggles to get back into society she doesn't want to return back to her neighborhood and she finds herself without a home or anywhere to go so while she just experiences those first hours of freedom after being released from jail she came across an old of her which while she was in had become a junkie and lives on the streets not having where to go and without money or feasible source of income she decides to join on his residence a covered area on a lonely street br br the story by itself is moving it explains how the impossible relationship between isabel and gets deeper until the the almost final twist of the movie br br definitely the movie is worth watching sebastiÃ¡n is splendid in his role of the junkie a person being able of both being an innocent and tender giving person and a ruthless street scum just depending whom deals him with i believe his role br br on the other hand i don't quite believe the role of isabel although the movie tries to show the bitterness inside her through several scenes she is not capable to make me believe it she is in a way too sweet and too honest for which might be expected of somebody on the same situation br br the movie tries to show a love on a desperate situation it is a enjoyable movie but the feeling i get when the movie ends is that isabel with the way of thinking and acting she has would never have arrived to that situation her role partly because of the script partly because of the acting is difficult to believe br br i specially like the ending and because of it i have raised my rating one or two points i liked its bittersweetness and the fact of showing that sometimes survival instinct is above other more spiritual considerations as love br br summarizing an interesting movie but it lacked some punch to be a total must see
<START> last evening i had the remarkable pleasure of seeing the movie hitch i was stunned and amazed will smith did a phenomenal job in a role that he isn't always associated with he proved once and for all that he does not need to be holding a gun to be a great actor in a movie kevin james was also very impressive i admit that i've always like him on the king of queens but this role really brought him into the light more and i hope to see him on the big screen a lot more in the near future the movie was funny and adorable and i recommend it to any guy as the best date movie you could ever imagine the mix of comedy romance and drama left me feeling complete it's nothing like most chick flicks in the sense of tears and sadness but holds its own and i think can be equally enjoyed by males as well as females i encourage all couples especially to see this movie but even if you aren't involved with someone you may pick up some great ideas from hitch br br two way big thumbs up
<START> i am a firm believer that a film tv serial or any form of art should and would be fully appreciated once the timing factor as to when written produced or conceived should be taken in to account br br yeh jo hai is one such series i remember watching it in the mid 80's on tv and the re runs via the video cassette libraries during early 90's and laughing out loud and being addicted to it that made me buy the full series dvd set and surprise of surprises the comedy and the moments of the good 'ol days simply fell flat for me even the very popular 30 years ka experience and sofa cum bed did not invoke the kind of mirth i thought it would the timing factor for the 80's this was the showstopper the main event the mother of all tv comedies and it worked during the age and time perhaps the same cannot be said right now but nonetheless watching the dvd did bring back pleasant memories br br i wish the seasons with shafi inamdar and were longer satish shah has been un believably good as the heart of the show with equally effective support cast of farida jalal tiku talsania and the neighbours bedi hams throughout br br all in all an experience that will bring back memories for those who saw it during the prime times might not appeal to the younger viewers or first time watchers
<START> i was so excited to finally watch pulse after receiving it from amazon and i have to say i was utterly disappointed i perhaps think i was too hyped up i had expectations set by its fans that simply couldn't be met after loving other asian horrors i thought i knew this would find a place in my heart br br the story was slow painfully so i am a diverse fan of horror i love the brutal bloody craziness of the devil's rejects and i love equally the steady growing macabre of a tale of two sisters pulse offered little from either spectrum sadly br br along with the of the plot it was also very muddled i hadn't a clue why characters were doing what they were doing and how what they were doing would help their problem it seemed as if the director spouted off the plot in a sentence or two and the rest was from our actors unlike a tale of two sisters which also has a rather hard to follow plot line pulse clears up very little at the end and left me feeling frustrated confused and uninterested in the characters' endeavors my closing statement about the plot was its inconsistency at first it seemed as if the story was about the ghost world overflowing and their medium of escaping is the internet that's a damn original idea i like that but as the plot drones on plot holes and unexplained happenings their heads in it seems the director switched to some apocalyptic tale as evident by the ending that just hasn't been clear enough throughout to execute br br i realize the dreariness of the shots and the setting was intentional to make the viewer feel bleak and isolated but the dullness of the movie was only intensified by the grainy shadowy surroundings i will admit there was a certain feel of surrealism with the movie but that may have just been my attention waning in and out br br the actions of some of the characters are a little bit ridiculous as well and perhaps if i was more enthralled by the story i would've been able to suspend more disbelief but as well myself being unmotivated so too were some of the characters like i mentioned previously the logic behind what certain characters did were absent and contributed to the incoherence of the plot perhaps it was a result of the plot's incoherence that the characters do questionable things to be honest i don't really care br br the acting was decent certainly nothing outstanding but nothing terrible either no to mention on either side of brilliant or plain awful br br now i'll stop sounding so sour and mention that there were a handful of creepy moments one towards the end especially that if there were more like it throughout i would've enjoyed this movie almost wholly i thought whenever the website was shown it was pretty unsettling as well as some of the ghostly encounters our two main characters face the things that went on between these ghastly run ins were just too lackluster baffling and wtf for me to truly appreciate br br now for something pertaining to the dvd itself release of pulse comes with subtitles yes but the subtitles are off they aren't said at the correct time of the character's speech it may sound nit picking but it bothered me a little and it may bother some others i think this is the only north american release of the film though so you either have to deal or watch dubbing never watch dubbing i tried to like the film i really did i wanted this film to live up to the hype but sadly it fell flat for me if you're looking for other creepy asian cinema i can recommend you audition shutter a tale of two sisters strange circus and all of which are more my palette
