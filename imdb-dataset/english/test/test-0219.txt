<START> i love these awful 80's summer camp movies the best part about party camp is the fact that it literally has no plot it simply drops a weak batch of characters into a location and then things occasionally happen the cliches here are limitless spoilers the nerds vs the jocks the secret camera in the girls locker room the hikers happening upon a nudist colony the contest at the conclusion the secretly horny camp administrators and the embarrassingly foolish sexual innuendo littered throughout the only cliche missing is the presence of corey feldman this movie will make you laugh but never intentionally i repeat never a final note be prepared to bust a gut watching the nonsense that is the dramatic scene where jerry riviera and d a share a beer late at night spilling their guts to each other the dialogue literally makes no sense and the acting belongs on a high school stage it's a classic
<START> so this starts with at least an interesting and promising basic idea goes on and on with tension carey in a good untypical role but in a less than you expected performance weak direction from joel schumacher match with some plot holes the detective scenes show us the luck of creativity if you don't have great expectations because of the negative reviews maybe you will enjoy this at the end they offer to us a lesson about morality for those who remember falling down and the family joy and cure that ruins every possibility to be kind and find the film watchable p s it's obvious who is the killer i wonder why w sparrow carey didn't resolve the mystery from the beginning of the film
<START> this glorified discovery channel documentary part biblical study part treasure hunt all might have sat well in it's television origins but falls flat as a feature film right from first glance of it's cheesy looking cover art one may cast doubts upon the integrity behind this serious subject shown on front case the search for jesus's tomb to a generic action font that looks more national treasure or tomb raider then any informed debate and examination of the historical burial site should such is the underhanded way in which the entire proceedings revolve br br more curious child then worthy researcher explorations come across as self indulgent while his research comes across as manipulative for all the fascinating revelations this filmmaker tries to impart on his viewers through supposed evidence a flood of repetitious statements reiterating the same research and findings over and over proves the lost tomb of jesus has very little information to back up the bloated albeit entrancing claims what this amounts to is a very frustrating attempt to beat the audience over the head with the same small factual evidence in support of this authenticity which ironically detracts from it while tirelessly linking together many of these mini coffins found together to support the jesus of nazareth theory this research a well rounded approach to continuously pursue this romanticized archeologist's singular obsession there may be some impressive factual data which helps shed some light on many traditional dogmatic christian held beliefs but essentially the shady nature of this project made it come across as merely an exploitation piece financed at a time when the da vinci code was all the rage br br in the end the cheesy cover art was right despite my appreciation for documentary form the lost tomb of jesus takes an always interesting topic and turns it into overlong and geriatric adventure hunt substituting any relevance and sacredness for the uninspired motivations behind this team by the time these tomb raiders have finished their explorations reluctantly having to stop research because of social demands viewers are left with the sense the director was insistent on forging this mystery whether it was there to begin with or not there are a few genuinely potent moments where the halls of history come marching through this documentary in unassuming ways but all the decoding exploring and theorizing in the world still left this misguided vanity piece in an uneasy void of apathetic response
<START> this has to be one of those times you come across a movie with a neat cover my first impression sweet full moon crows a scarecrow holding a scythe ok my impression i had watched scarecrow on tv a weeks ago perfect a nice slasher film to start the evening with wrong absolutely wrong i think 5 mins in i was gonna take it out but thought i wasted 3 on this so ill finish it wheres the scarecrow well im guessing its the legs of the fisher man wearing heavy duty rain boots you see that every so often i was watching this thinking ok when are those brats gonna run into this dude at one point i thought they died but no i mean their still alive i only chuckled at a few parts cause of how badly staged they were one was the zoom in part at the start the director actor writer says remember i had that feeling well i have it again and it was either a zoom in or zoom out to hell i'm checking back but i guess the scene was supposedly shocking i mean whats more shocking is his wife had the same shocked look ok she believed him im sorry but yeah i didn't know he was psychic until i read the movie box to make some sense out of what i witnessed not only that they used pictures to make you think this movie is at least clear br br the other thing that made me laugh a bit was the scream in the camera to make it scary ok filming a girl close up screaming into the camera for 5 mins right i laughed cause of how pathetic it was these kids cannot act like the rest of the people in the movie br br to top things off the scythe must have got lost or something cause seems the bad guy had just a stick not even an ax someone should axe the dam production film br br don't fall for the picture this movie is a piece of sh t i watched the trailer and guess what it has br br girls where are you talk to me and corn
<START> drawn by pain is easily one of the best pieces of cinema i have ever seen here are my reviews of the episodes released so far br br episode one was even better than i expected and from everything i had heard about it i expected quite a lot i am very impressed with the actors already the father was creepy and played perfectly the little girl is so expressive she uses her eyes to convey such emotion the animation was superb the cinematography was amazing each camera angle capturing the feeling of the scene perfectly the editing was done so well each scene blending seamlessly into the next the music captured the emotions quite well and drew you into the story i just can't say enough about how wonderful this episode was it definitely my appetite for more br br episode 2 was even better than the first one everything i said about the first episode carries through only you get to see even more of the character development i can not wait to finally see episode 3 or the rest of the series for that matter what is developing is an intriguing character driven storyline with all the trappings of a big hollywood production but without the pretension so much is said with so few words this series is something like you've never seen and perched to become a real success br br this episode was freaking awesome no other words describe it wow everything that i've said about the previous episodes holds true for this one and yet it was even better i don't know how you manage to take something amazing and make it even better the further character development proves that this is a completely character driven piece the cinematography excels as it always has and draws you into emily's pain fear hate and emotional roller coaster i can't wait to see episode 4 or the rest of the series for that matter you have truly outdone yourself br br as much as i have loved the other episodes episode 4 is the best yet i love the character progression i feel like we are really coming to know emily her pain and her internal struggle the other themes i've stated in past reviews are continued great cinematography the writing is superb the actors are right on with their portrayals and have made the characters their own and the animation is simply amazing another great job from the crew
<START> i keep waiting for peter fonda to start acting for someone who comes from such a talented family it's a mystery to me why peter fonda can only play peter fonda trying to play someone else and that's the good news in this disappointing dog of an adaptation of the tempest a string of loosely connected ideas that only suggest a relationship with the bard's great play is what we're served the setting is the civil war and prospero's here evil brother looks like an 1890's melodrama villain complete with snidely whiplash moustache i kept waiting for him to go uh ha hah which would have been a high point in this dreary presentation none of the supporting cast was and peter fonda's lack of expression and wooden body movements made the lackadaisical story drag on and on br br the tempest is the bard's statement about the rage of man's unjust treatment of man the only believable character was the gator man the counterpart the to the swamp had possibilities but the civil war setting just didn't make it all in all a very disappointing production i saw it on video and would advise if you want a willy shakespeare fix save your money on this one rent something else like branagh's much ado about nothing or kevin kline in night dream
<START> i had actually considered investing in this movie when was out drumming up funding i loved most of the script but did not like the ending insisted the ending was as it had to be br br seeing the completed movie i have to say i am amazed reading the script i had not imagined the acting and directing would be as powerful and moving as it is here the two leads did an amazing job they were very believable and this movie is well worth watching just for the performances of these two amazing stars br br now for the spoiler and if you have not seen the movie please don't read further as you need to see the movie first i actually wish i had never read the script just so i could have experienced the movie ending first hand br br spoiler br br i have two main problems with the movie first off and i'm sure i mentioned this when i read the script the wife should have died if she were dead the ending would be much more believable as it is we have this guy who has been agonizing over a woman who left him ago ' if she left him and he is still in love after so long he'd have to be seriously delusional but he doesn't come across that way in the script there is also the problem of why he did not expend all this energy going after the wife he still loves br br plus if the wife were dead we would actually be able to believe that they had a fulfilling reciprocating love and therefore believe that the guy is devastated enough for the ending to be reasonable br br however i don't buy daphne doing what she does in the ending i'd need a heck of a lot of convincing to believe that this naive girl very naive for a whore but believable due to performance did what she did the character is simply not cold enough and if she did this out of some kind of love or something else then there is a whole piece of the movie story missing br br much of this movie is reminiscent of sex lies and video tape i think it could have been as popular if had chosen to give the movie a more believable ending br br so watch the movie enjoy the performance and make up your own mind
<START> eh oui impossible pas br br well paced highly entertaining film pretty good command of the french language and knowledge of modern france and history are recommended i don't think this film really works in any other language the film is incredibly much better than the previous one in search of apart from great actors and savvy camera handling it's the wit and firework of allusions word plays etc that make for a really great movie the cartoon is recognizable but the film is very emancipated the cost of the film is put to good use indeed all the special effects fit into the movie you never feel choked by them br br oui les un mais Ã  part imhotep br br a neighbour from the other side of the rhine
<START> this is a great german slasher that's often quite suspenseful and creative with a fun story and solid performances all the characters are cool and benno fÃ¼rmann is great as the psycho killer plus franka potente gives a fantastic performance as the main lead it did take a little while to get going but it was never boring and it had some good death scenes as well plus the music is wonderfully creepy i was lucky enough to get the subtitled version instead of the dubbed and i thought all the characters were quite likable plus it's very well made and written as well it has some really good plot twists too and the effects are extremely well done plus the ending is great the finale is especially suspenseful and franka potente was the perfect casting choice in my opinion plus i wish david didn't get killed of so soon because he was a really cool character there were actually a couple of moments where i felt uncomfortable but in a good way and i must say this film deserved all it's praise plus while it does have plot holes it's not enough to hamper the film this is a great german slasher that's often quite suspenseful and creative with a fun story and solid performances i highly recommend this one the direction is great stefan does a great job here with excellent camera work very good angles great close ups see the opening sex scene doing a great job of adding creepy atmosphere and just keeping the film at a very fast pace br br there is quite a bit of blood and gore we get cadavers cut open plenty of very gory surgery scenes lots of bloody stabbings people are dissected while still being conscious severed finger self mutilation bloody slit throat lots of wicked looking frozen corpses plenty of blood and more br br the acting is very solid franka potente is fantastic as the main lead she was very likable remained cool under pressure was vulnerable easy on the eyes and we are able to care for her character the only time she seemed to suffer was when she had to spurt out some bad dialog here and there but that wasn't very often she was wonderful benno fÃ¼rmann is excellent as the psycho killer he was simply chilling and wonderfully ott he really gave me the creeps and was one effective killer anna loos played her role very well as the smart slut i dug her sebastian was great here as caspar he was quite likable and had a mysterious character his chemistry with potente was also on and there was a great twists involving him at the end was good as the idiot phil and did his job well is good as prof was great as david he had a really cool character and i wish he didn't get killed of so soon rest of the cast do fine br br overall i highly recommend this great german slasher 1 2 out of 5
<START> the ascent 1977 br br is a name very few are familiar with her bright career as a director only lasted a single decade ended abruptly by a tragic car accident despite her short career she however managed to create some of the best soviet films of her time her last film the ascent is widely regarded as one of the finest soviet films of the 1970s nevertheless her work remained in obscurity throughout the years that followed usually only available on rare and poor copies on video that has now changed thanks to the folks at criterion they've released two of best works through their eclipse department wings and her penultimate masterpiece the ascent br br set during the darkest days of wwii in snowy rural russia two partisans trudge their way across the land in search of food after their party is attacked by nazi patrols they're originally only to go to a nearby farm but when they arrive they find it razed by the germans not wanting to return empty handed they continue on deeper into enemy territory along the way they must confront not only enemy soldiers but the harsh conditions of the russian plains potential betrayal and their own souls br br the movie does not fall into simplistic plot devices or destinations it addresses difficult questions with painful rationality it never takes the easy road or gives us comforting answers the second half of the film is filled with moral dilemmas shows us the intimate horrors of war through the internal conflict between fellow russians those who collaborated and those who fought back while she does show the collaborators as the clear heels she nevertheless also shows why many turned to such tactics survival br br the film contains a number of religious references particularly to the lead up to the crucifixion this is a spiritual journey into the hearts souls and minds of the two partisans and those they encounter and her cinematographer capture the journey in beautiful black and white photography the camera moves in long shots similar to the camera work of another of russia's greatest filmmakers andrei tarkovsky like many others was clearly influenced by tarkovsky's style and the ascent takes some of its rhythmic notes from childhood it is a stunning film to look at and does a fantastic job of capturing the cold and terrifying atmosphere of occupied russia br br husband would pay homage to her great film a decade later elem made his own war masterpiece with one of the greatest films i've ever seen come and see the story and themes of that film were clearly influenced by the ascent though that film is also a fairly obscure one it received far more attention that any of films that however acted as a bridge to and has been one of the best helps to keeping her work alive br br the ascent is a truly magnificent film and rightly should be considered one of the best films of the 70s it's stunning cinematography is inspiring its mood is frighteningly authentic and its lessons are unforgettable it is in any definition of the word nothing less than a masterpiece how unfortunate that career was cut short just as it was hitting its peak
<START> not much to say other than it is simply a masterpiece this film contains a myriad of messages that all should take to heart especially women do not your man's dreams honor them that's why you loved him in the first place those who plan for death will live in the grave those who diem will awaken those who live in fear even our lord spoke of this when he chastised the the one who buried his talent in fear that he might make a mistake and displease the master take a risk get out of the boat and you will walk on water life is a journey that does not end in the grave but in our minds and souls
<START> well how to make a movie as provocative as possible this cartoonishly straight shocker tries by having two low life paris women one prostitute one recently raped ex porn actress no less lash out and go on a national sex and killing spree of men in particular br br very short running time gives you a hint of the experimental nature of this violently hardcore thelma louise but it's done completely without irony or contemplation for any possible feminist message and since we don't get very close to the protagonists the violence actually feels muted and numbing and maybe that's a good thing br br as a liberal advocate of freedom of expression i always welcome when the serious movie industry dares to contain full on sex scenes but the question is does it work for the movie as a whole is it any good here not very although we're given a new meaning to the phrase a shot in the ass br br 3 out of 10 from ozjeppe
<START> i watched asterix and in operation cleopatra which was my first exposure to the live action version of the classic comic like the comic the whole movie is full of jokes based upon puns anachronistic jokes and slapstick gags which rarely fall flat br br asterix and are who use a strength potion to fight the roman legions in their native here they end up in egypt helping a friend build palace yes its puny in three months to prove the egyptians are just as good as the romans br br the reason i picked this up was because monica is cleopatra she's good but the role is little more than a cameo however even though she's rarely in the film i didn't care since its so clever and the jokes so funny i was in hysterics i loved it i loved it so much that i can't understand why the movies have never been released in the united states br br the import dvd has the film in english dub which is quite good especially when you consider that when you watch it in the longer french version the puns and hence the jokes are not always apparent since they are aural so if you read the names wrong the jokes are lost most of the jokes between the full french version and the shorter english dub seem to be exactly the same though some have been changed sometimes for the better and some times for the worse personally i'm gonna stick with the dub when i watch this again since its easier to pick up the jokes and enjoy the humor br br you really will want to see this if you love puns and low brow but clever humor this is a great comedy
<START> this well meant film falls just a bit short and unfortunately in too many areas br br the scenery is gorgeous with vistas of north central vermont providing the setting for this mid century tale quebec bill endeavors to go back to his whiskey running past in order to save his farm br br going back and forth between scenes of magical realism and straight forward action this film rarely hits its stride br br kris kristofferson as quebec bill seems pretty stilted or else it's his lines or else his cross of yankee and quebecois accents anyway he just comes off as a low key blow hard his dialogs with gary farmer's character do sparkle though william rat is solid charlie mcdermott shows some real potential as young wild bill but his part's not large enough to carry a scene and he never steals one luis guzman shows up on lake with a fine stand in performance by lake willoughby as a monk with a hood accent who knows and then there's an oracle like her namesake she channels yoda as she intones lines like you will marry a quebec woman just too weird and nowhere near enigmatic enough br br the end gets really choppy again a bad mix of magical realism and the concrete and yoda never provides an answer we can understand
<START> 'you're in the navy now' is painfully bad very likely the worst movie gary cooper ever made it's supposedly based on a true story but the incident which inspired this film doesn't seem to have enough plot to sustain a feature length script br br i saw this movie on local television while i was house sitting for my mother in law in long island new york there was a raging blizzard outside and i was literally snowbound if i'd been able to get out the door i definitely would have stopped watching this movie br br there are some interesting names in the supporting cast notably charles bronson under his original name lee marvin harvey lembeck jack webb and jack warden forget it everybody stinks in this movie even the usually reliable millard mitchell is awful lee marvin and jack warden are onscreen so briefly there's no point in your watching for them br br gary cooper plays an obscure naval officer who is assigned to command a ship which is powered by a new experimental steam basically the whole ship is a giant cooper realises that the assignment is not a prestigious one if it were it would have gone to a better officer br br cooper was a good actor in dramatic roles but he simply had no ability for comedy he made several bad comedies and this one is his worst jane greer has always bored me and she bored me more than usual here this ship went down with all hands and sank without a trace have i mentioned that this movie stinks i'll rate 'you're in the navy now' one point out of 10 toot toot
