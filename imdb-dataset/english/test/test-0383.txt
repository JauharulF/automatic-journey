<START> i think that key west might do well as a dvd there probably are a lot of failed star treks that just never had a chance to succeed we will never know if this could have been a great series i would love to know if there is a way to see older shows like this or are they just another hollywood footnote is it possible to find copies of these shows so that we loyal oddballs can enjoy them again the show had a great writing talent and some if not all of the episodes left you with a feel for the characters that is often missing in todays hit shows i often came away with a sense of learning something from the story lines and greatly entertained by the very unique characters thank you
<START> ok this movie was the worst display i have seen in years the actors weren't to bad i figured it was a b movie so they were doing b movie acting anyways i watched this movie thinking oh cool a ufo sci fi movie wrong it was just an excuse for radical christians to push a message onto people the last scene was extremely messed up that is a horrible thing to do to a person to make them believe in something what someone believe in is a matter of opinion this movie just shows how corrupted religion is especially christianity br br if you want to watch a b movie this ain't if you want to watch a movie that is trying to brainwash the masses well this is the pick of the litter go right for it if you are going to convey a message do it don't force it ridiculous that people would abuse the media to such a degree especially christians
<START> david suchet poirot foolproof '03 gave an outstanding performance as a perfectionist in almost everything he did or said if he had a cocktail he always had a napkin to blot the excess on his mouth with unbelievable perfection you could just view the expressions on the detective's face and see that he never missed an item of importance in the suspects behavior the beautiful falls colors through out the english countryside was simply breath taking megan dodds bait 2000 gave an outstanding performance as a very sexy wild woman who was able to keep very important secrets away from mr poirot a very enjoyable film if you really like the acting of david suchet as mr poirot
<START> oh man where to even begin br br dropping your gun to get in hand to hand combat w a zombie while holding a bitten soldier down debating to shoot him b4 he turns then he turns and bites the person holding him down turning your back on a fallen zombie continuously shooting the chest and seeing it doesn't work so they shoot the chest some more having the idea that a kid slumped at a desk w blood coming out of his mouth is still alright walking along a football field like nothing is wrong then all the sudden noticing the zombie football team doing whatever in the middle of the field like they couldn't have been seen up to that point br br i could go one for a few more hours but you get the point childish writing and dialog bad directing horrid special effects truly sad and undeveloped storyline zombie infested campus must get the viral host then lose it twice the only plus i can find is that this one doesn't include clips of the actual game during the action scenes br br id say don't waste your money but id be more upset about the waste of time i saw it on cable and wanted the 2 hours of my life back
<START> an especially delightful film to those of us who saw this when young because after all it was meant for the young to watch when viewing it again as an adult it's better if rose tinted spectacles can kick in it was the first of the 16 jungle jim films and later tv series chunky johnny weismuller went on to do for columbia in the last 3 films he had to use his own name though as they'd lost the rights after getting the sack from playing tarzan for sol lesser johnny sheffield also gave up playing boy to become bomba the jungle boy in a series of 12 films br br jim and party go on perilous safari to hunt down the hidden temple of manned by an obscure tribe of devil doctors who seem to have the secret of a poison that might also be a cure for edgar rice burroughs probably approved after 16 years talking weismuller seemed awkward stringing sentences together not that it mattered on the swift march we meet many of the interesting but generally playful denizens of the jungle barring the sinister crocodile going to eat the leading lady with her leg caught under a twig and the surreal elephant stampede stock footage squeezed into a corner of the frame skipper the dog and caw caw the crow had many adventures none of which turned out essential to the plot in case you were concentrating the biggest problem with the film is the farcical climax which can be exciting but also unfortunately remind you of the end of a serial part Â and the original excellent serial had been made 12 years prior although personally i wouldn't have minded this going on another couple of hours as well br br the only thing heavy about this was weismuller in so many ways an enjoyable kids film from the old days not recommended for serious adults so i love it
<START> anthony quinn is a master at capturing our heart and sympathy he portrays a romanian peasant with a below average iq harassed by his wife to do more it's wwii and the nazis have taken over his country soon he finds himself digging entrenchments hoping to benefit himself in his wife's eyes the nazis have different ideas through the next years we watch events unfold through his naive eyes but all he wants to do is go home his manipulations and ill luck just get him in further hot water finally through no fault of his own we see his picture on the cover of der spiegel as the perfect aryan the war ends and the allies put him on trial for war crimes but all our peasant wants to do is return home to his wife
<START> there's not much anyone can say about this flick the plot is quite simple two police officers who also happen to be lovers are using a brothel as a stakeout in order to catch a criminal with the help of the lady of the house played by hardcore chloe as anyone can guess there's a few plot twists and some blurred alliances but the writing was just horrible even for a softcore movie br br i've read some previous posts about nicole accent she plays the female cop yes it's hard to understand what she's saying at times but i think i've placed it i did some sniffing around i think she's from germany hence her odd sounding accent she makes an impression even without speaking however she's got a great looking body br br there were a couple of from behind sex scenes in this movie that were quite graphic for a softcore film excellent work there the three way scene toward the end wasn't bad either br br spoiler alert br br i kinda knew the female cop was gonna turn into a part time call girl at the end she enjoyed her three way way too much br br end spoiler br br i'm not gonna nitpick about the story too much seeing as this is a low budget direct to video softcore flick however it just seems like i've seen way too many movies in this genre with a similar type of storyline br br women b chloe and were okay as the eye candy sex b scenes were kinda short but good story c a recycled plot but whatever works eh overall b
<START> having been a faithful asterix fan all of my life i have to say that asterix and the vikings is probably the most well done of all the asterix films its got some very funny jokes in it and the animation is superb as many people have pointed out it doesn't really follow the plot of the comic asterix and the very closely but in many ways that's just as well because that book stands out in my mind as one which poked a great deal of fun at the culture of the sixties and much of it is very dated today br br what really rubbed me the wrong way though is how they incorporated a disney style plot into the film which took much of the focus away from asterix and we have a misunderstood boy who doesn't fit in we have a tom boy girl who doesn't fit in because she wants to be treated as equal to men abba they meet and fall in love but their love is threatened because boy is ashamed to be totally honest with girl but in the end their love wins out this has been the plot of so many disney and be fair other studios too films that its not funny and the plot was old twenty years ago i mean they even gave a whimsical animal sidekick br br not only did i find this derivative and clichÃ©d but it really detracted from the story and left me dissatisfied br br i think that it speaks volumes about how superb the rest of the movie was that i still think very highly of it despite the way the plot got hijacked
<START> i've never seen the original house of wax so i really didn't know what to expect when i went to a sneak preview of the new film after a somewhat wobbly start introducing our young characters house of wax shifts gears and becomes an extremely effective horror outing br br the plot really doesn't matter too much here i think most people know upon seeing this that these stranded kids are going to meet up with a nasty killer and find some awful things in the titular house of wax it's all about the special effects here and they are top notch viewers who like their horror movies with lots of blood will be satisfied here but there are other ghoulish effects as well the production design and sets are excellent and the cast makes the most of their under written roles br br of course many people are probably wondering just how paris hilton's performance is to be honest hilton acquits herself quite well and she doesn't portray herself as so many people are predicting her character is sexy and sweet and i think her good work will hopefully change a lot of people's opinions about her elisha cuthbert is also good moving up from her previous movie the atrocious the girl next door her character is put through a lot and cuthbert proves to be a feisty heroine chad michael murray like hilton and cuthbert is pretty to look at but unfortunately is not very convincing as the bad boy of the group br br i predict good things for house of wax as the audience at the screening i attended hollered screamed and clapped through out many parts of the movie congrats to the cast and crew for a job well done br br and a congrats to paris hilton for proving a lot of people wrong like she always says that's hot
<START> john cinematic interpretation of edith ethan falls short of doing justice to a great literary piece while the story is maintained the elements that give the novella its soul are skewered and all in all lost in the film madden fails to convey the innocence and overall tragedy of ethan and relationship instead transforming it into a morality tale the mark is missed and the point lost in added details and poor dialog zenobia in the book is almost completely the antagonist the books least sympathetic figure where in the movie she can be almost pitied though it's a stretch you kind of feel bad for this sick woman who is being cheated on the book more accurately describes tyrannical control of the house and of ethan the movie just ticked me off the addition of the fox was pointless as well as the scene with mattie trying to kill herself it was just poorly interpreted and done film mistakes ethan's elusiveness in the church dance scene interactions with denis addition of love scene fox scene store scene saying his plans allowed lack of displays of ethan's inner emotions and thoughts introduction of the priest instead of nameless engineer let on to much that knows about the growing relationship where in novel reader never knows what is thinking or aware of just too many flaws and poor directing decisions
<START> from the acclaim it got i was expecting more from a korean horror if it's going to be viewed in the same caliber as a tale of two sisters as some other reviews have stated this movie isn't in the same caliber except in budget spent on special effects think horror with a tree and sparse dialogue br br if you're going to have a movie with limited dialogue the plot line and characters have to carry the film this film could have been told quite well in a 30 minute short film concept 2 hours with a lot of staring at trees and terror scenes that make you not only not scared but detract in a what the sort of way does not a good horror movie make br br those people who are stating that this film gave them lasting impressions must literally have heart attacks when decent horror films lay it in
<START> when one watches the animated superman shorts of the 1940s the similarity of the plots can become a bit boring the adversary is most often a mad scientist in a hidden threatening metropolis with some evil invention death rays mechanical monsters electric earthquake magnetic telescope what have you br br this one is refreshingly different the bad ones drive around in a car shooting and bombing but the center of action is the gold train on which lois lane travels as the only press reporter it seems train movies have their own typical ingredients from the 1903 great train robbery on and quite some are featured here cars in motion running on the roofs taking the steam locomotive from the tender in the back fighting with the engineer a switch turned to the train on a side track the fall of people or the whole train from a high bridge it's all in the few minutes of this lovely piece br br but it wouldn't be a superman film if he didn't do some incredible feats involving balancing and high precision placement to ultimately win the day if you're a fan of train movies don't miss this it's in the public domain and can be legally downloaded from archive org
<START> i think this is the worst movie i have seen since mortal kombat 2 the action including the effects is like in a cheap glen a larson tv show the acting is terrible and the dialogs are even more stupid than in mk2 avoid at all cost

<START> this is one of alfred hitchcock's best films and one of his most underrated i believe it certainly exceeds a 'psycho' or 'the for technical artistry and brilliance it is a macabre tense darkly humorous product that will leave you in awe for quite some time br br robert walker creates one of hitchcock's most memorable villains as the father hating mother fixated but aren't most of hitchcock's villains mummy's boys bruno it is a disturbing stunning performance that illuminates the whole film his character is obsessive apparently homosexual look at those deliberately effeminate ties and hear how he is described as strangely charming and dangerous to cross farley granger certainly knows this as he becomes entangled in bruno's sordid web after the pair meet on a train bruno knowing some inside information on guy's affairs proposes the two murders for each other's benefit walker will kill granger's slutty conniving wife who is his marriage to beautiful anne whilst granger will murder bruno's father who he so intensely hates everyone's happy right a win win as bruno asserts wrong granger forgets about the indecent proposal but an obsessed walker doesn't he commits his murder and is determined to hound granger until he completes his side of the bargain too becomes a riveting suspenseful game of cat and mouse in hitch's capable hands br br hitchcock was absolutely amazing at creating intriguing minor characters and building scenes we have the whore miriam granger's estranged wife pregnant to another man she lasciviously a phallic ice cream cone whilst openly eating up bruno with her eyes barbara morton anne's sister is a deceptively sweet yet smart and cunning young girl who comes out with the most crude remarks you'll hear from a bespectacled girl in the pictures in the 50's senator morton is authoritative and self absorbed this is one of the most daring films hitchcock ever made and it is typical to a hitch film subtly sexual in detail br br this fits into the film noir category with it's focus on murder lies and deceit and shadowy cinematography walker's nut is one for the ages and granger makes a convincing troubled protagonist roman is perhaps weaker than the other two and i never believed her relationship with granger still the overwhelming positives cancel out the slight negatives and it can be safely said that this is one of the best american films ever made br br just look at what hitch does here the originality the technical skill we see the murder of miriam reflected in her shattered glasses a game of tennis turns into one of the most thrilling intense scenes you'll ever see a innocent fairground turns into a place of murder and foul occurrences a young boy's balloon is popped callously by walker hitch obviously liked what he saw in 'the third man ' children's delight at riding the carousel turns into screaming fast paced terror hitch subverts normal everyday events like no other br br the camera work here is among the best ever seen in a hitchcock film and the premise is to die for it's slick oozes sophistication and devilish charm the cross cutting between walker and granger's characters is magnificent granger's do or die tennis match is just as vital as villain walker's rescue of an incriminating piece of evidence lost down a drain hitch again build his villain into a nasty repulsive yet sympathetic and oddly charming did anyone else find him strangely attractive more so than granger piece of work we are just as tense as walker in our hope that he can get the lighter out of the drain we need him to anyway he holds the key to the story br br you'll never view an approach from a stranger in the same way again after seeing this film br br amazing br br 10 10
