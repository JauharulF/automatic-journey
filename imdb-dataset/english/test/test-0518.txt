<START> i just had to add my comment to raise the average on this one paul giamatti lets it all hang out in this one and is a hoot he would probably say it was easy but he really does a great job and should have won something for it we've had the dvd for several years and my kids boy now 4 1 2 and girl 9 will watch this one over and over and the humor is adult enough that i don't mind having to hear it in the background and i do run to the tv for the really funny parts simple moral message lots of decent action and slapstick bad grownups acting goofy to take the edge off minimal bad language and minimal potty jokes make it hard to beat for a family standard
<START> avoid this one it is a terrible movie so what if it is very exciting all it is is just pointless murders and the whole thing with thorn and michael's curse that was the absolute worst thing they could possibly do to the series why couldn't they leave michael's story a mystery he's supposed to be the boogeyman not part of some stupid cult ugh thank god for halloween h20 which wiped out halloween 3 6 they all sucked but anyway if you see this movie please expect no more than pointless murders and gore
<START> i purchased this dvd recently and i was totally awed that rush's songs sound the same as they did when i first listened to them in 1980 the lineup of geddy lee alex and neil is so talented that i want to listed to them play again and again br br songs i remember like tom sawyer the big money the trees closer to the heart limelight and the spirit of radio were played and the plus fans there singing along and having a great time and i swear over half the audience was under 25 br br writers who put down rush as far as rush fans like myself are concerned are a bunch of jealous dunderheads who like to taste rancid sour cream mixed with lemonade in a taco br br rush doesn't put on makeup wear spikes lip sync wear lipstick get in trouble with the law and have a band member brag about how long they have been unmarried all they do is entertain br br i give this dvd a 100 out of 100
<START> james the king is a film that mystifies me i can't think what its meant to be for it's a story about a young man called elvis played by gael garcia bernal who gets an honourable discharge after 3 years navy service and then goes off to find his biological father and behaves with him and his family it's all rather sick really elvis worms his way into the family by seducing his 16 year old sister james it's rather impossible to identify with anyone in this film from here in middle england preacher father and bouncy joyful christian congregation i couldn't work out whether the film is meant to be them for their mindless beliefs or is the target the happy family and we are meant to think that's or is it just saying that some people are lost and just hell bent on destruction it's shallow we all know that bad things happen the interesting bit is to learn why but this film just gratuitously depicts a violence without ever the thinking that has led to it the king is such a lost opportunity there are some really interesting questions about honour the warrior code the changing concepts of valour honour killings in indian families and so on honour is a very varied concept but this film just adds nothing to the notion however paul the projectionist did more than his meagre role suggests the dvd projector showed all films in a green only hue and the only way to repair this was to get it sent to belgium he did this through christmas i think those postal workers and and paul went far beyond the call of duty and our reward was this dismal film but you might see it differently
<START> the first twenty five minutes stand out as possibly the worst in modern british film director adapter william has treated wilde's original with such reverence that he seems to have completely ignored the needs of a cinematic audience thankfully the quality of the direction and editing improves significantly after the first half hour but by then the damage has been done of the actors prunella scales and robert hardy wipe the floor with the rest of the cast every time they are on screen the other exceptions are jonathan firth's arthur and karen mabel who are given enough latitude to deliver their lines with the true comic sense which wilde intended the ostensible leads james and trevyn mcdowell are in comparison lacklustre and wooden in an obvious attempt to eke every penny out a meagre budget the play has been nominally updated to the 1990's but in conjunction with the original script the effect is more of a badly script 1970s tv drama true moments of comedy are few and far between but when they arrive are highly amusing a sign maybe that more judicious pruning of the rest of the play might have led to a better paced more even film
<START> the film begins with a dandy gunfight where three bandits are quickly gunned down by a bounty hunter a bounty hunter who bears more than just a superficial to the man with no name from the clint eastwood trilogy fistful of dollars for a few dollars more and the good the bad and the ugly br br immediately after you see this man in a gold train filled with union soldiers naturally the shipment is attacked and the soldiers all fight like blind guys so they are quickly neutralized however in a twist one of the bandits cheats the gang leader gilbert roland and rides away with the gold soon roland catches up and is about to find out where the gold is hidden but just at that moment the army turns up and kills the traitor bummer however the man with no name wannabe thinks roland knows about the treasure and perhaps a medallion given to roland by the traitor holds the key a strange banker also is thrown into the mix all three want the gold and all three seem pretty macho br br overall this is not a particularly distinguished western much of it is the plot some of it is that george hilton a uruguayan despite the american sounding name isn't as interesting as eastwood or some of the other premier spaghetti western stars but most of it is because the soundtrack simply sucks so often the music doesn't even come close to matching the acting and it seems almost randomly added plus it just isn't very good stuff as well this clearly isn't the work of ennio morricone music master of the spaghetti genre br br overall just a time passer and not a particularly good one to boot
<START> de is based on the life of a real dutch gangster in the movie he is called i have my doubts that events presented in the movie have something to do with what really happened but that doesn't really matter because it failed to grab my attention this movie bored the crap out of me it lacks substance and style the substance part could have been forgiven if the acting was any good and if the director tried to do something original without the substance you at least have to bring some style or decent action don't we need to be entertained it would have helped if the director had seen more gangster movies it is obvious that he didn't otherwise he wouldn't have made this the way he did this movie got a lot of publicity because of a little scandal surrounding and a member of the dutch royal family this scandal has nothing to do with the movie what so ever without it de never would have been successful i am sure of it
<START> michael dudikoff stars as joe armstrong a martial artist who fights ninjas who are stealing weapons from the u s army in this entertaining yet admittedly brainless martial arts actioner which is hampered by too many long pauses without action but helped by some high energy action setpieces as well as steve james' performance
<START> well i got and saw this movie based on the rather high score here 7 1 now and some of the good reviews usually imdb is a good guide when it comes to score though in this case i was very much deceived br br the movie is a present day detective story with vinnie jones as the investigator journalist who investigates the death of a construction worker mixed with this is a made up dickens' novel called the riddle set in the 18th or 19th century which also deals with a murder story both story lines are connected through the discovery of an unpublished manuscript br br sounds interesting it could have been however this movie horribly fails in a number of areas 1 acting mediocre at best but it is watchable no worse than your average uk sitcom though for a movie one expects a little better especially with a score of over 7 2 music the music used is simply horrible it distracts and it is annoying especially the pub music and the music which plays in the journalist's apartment 3 storyline this is a big joke there are gaping plot holes everywhere and even the obligatory love story is so unrealistic that it's almost funny furthermore without going into any detail i can safely say that the ending is absurd and one of the worst pieces of acting and storyline of the year 4 camera work at times camera positions and views are distracting and serve absolutely no purpose to the story br br i'm a bit of a movie fanatic and watch on average 1 to 2 movies a day but this is easily the worst movie i've seen in months don't waste your money or your time on this rubbish
<START> being a huge fan of hip hop and to begin with i always knew i would like this film however i wasn't prepared for just how good the documentary actually is it covers almost all the important aspects of the only element of hip hop which has been there from the very start the story begins in the early 70's and follows the evolution of as an art from up until early 2000 aficionados will point this out as significant br br the editing is nigh on perfect throughout the film aside from the excellent visual scratch techniques which they used the rapid cutting between interviews and the stock footage is excellent giving the film pace when it is needed the sound editing is also very good with some nice sweeping sounds being used to help with transitions br br the absence of a narrator was also welcome we aren't taken by the hand through the story and as a result the audience is able to make their own assumptions easier each dj adds another side to the story and it is so interesting to hear about the unknown stars of hip hop especially those who were there when hip hop was being shunned left right and centre by the music business br br although there are many excellent things about this film i do have a few gripes the biggest of these is the absence of several notable djs such as ca and jazzy jeff and also djs from outside america such as scratch perverts and dj noise however if you watch the commentary on the dvd something which i highly recommend producer and director go in to great depth about how they regret not being able to feature them the deleted scenes contain many interviews with ca jazzy jeff and the scratch perverts br br this is definitely the best documentary i've seen on hip hop culture and music it does stop short of showing the true potential of for that i highly recommend checking out the and videos however that is a minor quibble i highly recommend this movie not least for the phat soundtrack with excellent music throughout 9 10
<START> i have to say this movie is absolutely amazing i don't understand why it got such a low rating it has romance music darkness and vampires also stuart townsend did a great job of being lestat the acting was great also normally i am not into that music well sometimes but i have to say in this movie the music fit it perfectly if you like dark movies about vampires this is definitely for you or even if you don't there is a love story to this but all i can say is one word amazing my rating is defiantly 10 out of 10 anyway i seriously suggest you watch it i remember not seeing this for years i watched it again about a year ago and im addicted to it again lol great movie
<START> don't get me wrong i love most of paul schrader's movies so it was with sheer excitement i was able to attend at the rolling thunder screening at the parisian french cinemathÃ¨que with surprise movie on the 17th dec 2004 of course the surprise movie was the exorcist and most people were there for that i was too the film was then finished but the score so p schrader used excerpts from the return of the king and some other movie i forget was it conan anyways apart from that the movie was the happy few there maybe 200 people were told to please not write about the film on the internet or magazines since it may have jeopardized its chance of getting selected to the cannes film festival then came the film then came the realization that the film might not get selected for the festival because of its quality never in my life had i experienced such a feeling of awkwardness in the audience as people went from being skeptical to plainly laughing out loud at the pity full spectacle i couldn't believe how low the author of light sleeper mishima blue collar and affliction had sunk br br forced over the top acting thorough stupid ending black and white moral awful fxs worst take on christianity from schrader ever not even suspenseful just boring as hell no pun intended and unsurprising at all some good locations but sadly miss used or at least not fulfilling the initial hopes in the end i was 100 times more satisfied by the schrader penned rolling thunder and wished my 2 hours back br br don't believe the hype even the john boorman movie is more exciting and original oh and the billy crawford casting the poor guy does his best but what where you expecting he's now part of the small club of worst casting mistakes ever i give the movie a 1 5 just because i didn't leave the room but i should have
<START> if imdb would allow one word reviews that's what mine would be this film was originally intended only for kids and it would seem to be very tough going for adults or older kids to watch the film the singing the story everything is dull and washed out just like this public domain print like other comedy team films with roots in traditional kids stories such as the awful snow white and the three stooges and the overrated babes in toyland this movie has limited appeal and just doesn't age well now that i think about it i seriously doubt that many kids nowadays would even find this film enjoyable so my advice is don't watch this film if you must watch an abbott and costello film almost any other one of their films except for a c go to mars would be an improvement
<START> four young grade school girls witness the murder of one of their classmates during what they thought was just an innocent game the killer is a strange young boy named milo sixteen years later the four survivors of the event re unite under happier circumstances in the same town where it happened they believe that milo drowned in a river shortly after the murder but soon learn that the demonic killer milo has also returned still a young boy unchanged even after almost two decades br br the cover for this movie makes it look really cool yet i still expected a bad movie to come out of it when i pop in the dvd into my player the menu comes up and makes the film still look cool sadly this movie isn't all that it got my excited about the movie is your average attempt at a slasher film and when i say average i mean just like all those other small budget slasher movies that have never been welcomed with open arms into most members of the horror community i'm talking about you the horror fan in other words you could walk up to any horror fan and the majority of responses would be this sucks br br what mistakes did the movie make first of all the dvd cover art makes milo look really dark but they blow it all by showing his face in the movie in many different scenes he had the potential of being a very freaky character secondly the back of the cover art tells freddy jason chucky etc to pack their bags and move on out because milo is so much better why in the hell would you want to say something like that when it comes to a no name low budget slasher film that has obviously failed i mean it just raises your expectations of the movie making it harder to impress itself upon you in a last ditch effort to attract attention it says in very big letters from the creator of anaconda just shows you how low they're going to get as much attention as possible for the movie br br the gore in the movie sucks the director gives you some hideous angles when milo attacks someone the music isn't all that bad and i never once fell asleep during the movie congratulations i'm still trying to figure out what milo actually is my best bet would be that he is a zombie if anyone else knows tell me rest assured i won't be losing any sleep over thinking about it
<START> author 1 from canada the big problem was the china syndrome claim that if the reactor error occurred and radioactive waste leaked out it could burn its way straight through the earth to china a lot of people have made fun of this and if the movie makers meant it seriously then yes it should be made fun of the spill wouldn't make it anywhere near the center of the earth or even the molten rock even if it did make it to the center of the earth how would it come out in china it would have to flow against gravity the rest of the way also china is not the opposite side of the world the indian ocean is br br this point is brought up by the characters of the film saying that of course it could not happen as the core would hit ground water and release a radio active cloud raining down on the population br br before you try to find a weak point in the film you should watch it first don't judge a book by it's title
