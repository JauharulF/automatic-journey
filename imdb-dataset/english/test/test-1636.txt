<START> this film is chock full of little surprises many of them funny the fact that it's written and directed by a 24 year old blows my mind some of the scenes where the high school kids are using ecstasy made me very uncomfortable because i have a kid that age and i could picture her using it as parent of a teen i found the depictions of the parent child interactions to be dead on accurate br br i enjoyed the film's many little jokes and i enjoyed the fact that not everything made perfect sense and not all the issues were resolved by the end to paraphrase mark twain truth is stranger than fiction because fiction is required to stick to that which is possible while truth is not br br this is a film which plays with the viewer allowing us believe that people are what other people think they are only to allow us later to realize that the folks we assumed were right were completely ignorant of the real situation one of the film's strongest scenes a scene about which we feel very relieved and sympathetic about what the character is doing turns out to be based on a completely wrong assumption and the character while admirable is totally wrong it's very subtly done i think very realistic br br i liked the score a lot i thought it really aided the film really helped set the mood the film has a couple of screwball moments and the background music helps establish that br br the valedictorian speech is a hoot and a half got a big laugh the movie is really in my head right now saw it this morning will try to see it again time allowing tens are hard to come by but a solid nine in my book
<START> i went to see this movie with my boyfriend last night i'm 20 years old and this movie was way too much for me i couldn't imagine taking a teenager preteen or especially a child to this movie it was crude and offensive i was totally misled by its pg 13 rating and the previews that i had seen for it i had originally seen previews for it on nickelodeon and i thought that it looked pretty cute maybe i just don't remember the preview correctly plus drake bell the movie's main character stars on a nickelodeon television show that targets preteens and young teenagers i really didn't think that the movie's content would be as risky as it was i should have done more research about it before i went however i'm hoping that parents will read up on this movie before they take their kids to see it just because it has drake bell in it br br seriously do not take your kids or teenagers to see this movie the rating should have been r there are tons of sexual references drug references and disturbing events throughout the movie examples drake bell gets attacked by sexually charged animals several scenes that involve men grabbing women's breasts lots of profanity drake bell uses a bong to smoke vanilla frosting or something like that people get stabbed hit and hurt in the movie and an elderly lady and her dog get shredded there are tons of other offensive and disgusting scenes throughout the movie it was really demeaning to women in general the movie is by the people that made the scary movie series so that should tell you something right there please remember that seeing movies like this can give kids and teenagers all kinds of wrong ideas about sex drugs and violence most children and teenagers can't decipher between spoofs or comedy and reality br br i do have a sense of humor i also know that the humor that was in this film is typical of its genre but i find the possibility of children and teenagers going to see this movie horrifying br br as for the overall quality of the movie i didn't think it was that original or funny it dragged in parts and some of the humor was just forced and painful the acting wasn't too bad considering how bad the script was if you're an adult or older teen looking for a funny movie skip this one or rent it
<START> this is the worst war movie i have ever seen possibly the worst ever made i find it incredible that some people have actually rated it as a 10 it has a stunning lack of even rudimentary traces of realism almost every war movie cliche appears in this film and is done badly on the other hand i wouldn't have watched it to the end if it hadn't been so remarkably bad that it amused me
<START> debut must be one of the best music documentaries of all time and as far as i know it's also the only one that focuses on the l a punk explosion of the early eighties it's all there not just great great bands like black flag fear x the germs whose names may not mean much to you today but whose influence on today's alternative rock music can not be over estimated but also the promoters the media and first of all the audiences the punks all portrayed in a manner that makes you laugh shudder and gasp with astonishment about the energy the anger and the fury these youths put into their music where is that today the eighties may have sucked big time when it to mainstream music but the underground was rocking if you need a proof for that watch performance in decline unmatched great film how come this is not available on vid ld or dvd p s the follow up decline pt ii is hilarious too
<START> this picture's following will only grow as time goes by better than any of the best picture nominees in 97 and it rewards repeated viewings i've seen it three times now so i know anderson was compared to some of the great american directors altman scorcese tarantino and he may have those influences but chances are after a few more films he'll be considered part of that short list himself br br one last note julianne moore's amber waves will resonate in the memory long after other 90's movie characters have faded the best performance of the year in any of the four categories
<START> there must have been a lot of background info that was left out of the movie in fact in the film the girl lizzy didn't even appear depressed she just seemed like a girl that went out of control when she finally got to college mainly from doing drugs and drinking alcohol that seemed to be her problem not mental illness sure she had emotional problems because her dad left and she barely saw him as a child and her mom seemed a little out there but the way she treated noah and ruby was just mean and i don't think caused by depression she was very needed which ran rafe off but she was like that because of her dad br br but i think the main reason this movie never achieved a theater release is that not enough happens with the plot and the story is not written well br br final verdict truthfully i'd only recommend this if you are interested in seeing ricci's first nude scene otherwise it isn't very interesting
<START> i watched this movie only coz it was expected to be yet another entertainer by david dhawan br br bad bad comeback by david dhawan he has made lots of funny movies in past which made no sense but none of them was a crap bag what a waste of talent and beauty it was why actors agree on movie like this br br there was not a whit of practicality in this movie the movie is below par and not at all justifies the standard and potential bollywood has br br the only thing worth watching in this movie was katrina but we don't need to watch a movie like this to see her being a remake of hollywood flick hitch its clear that bollywood directors cant even make a proper remake i consider this to be the worst ever movie i seen awful 1 10
<START> i'm not sure what the point of making this film was it looked as if it was made by some historical society to be shown in your local museum at first it appears that it could be the beginning of a mad tv or snl sketch but then the joke is on you when there is no punchline and you realize that someone was taking this seriously the story wasn't bad but the inclusion of the sass members seemed to be a ploy that worked to get me to see the film i swear the trailer listed every character in the film down to dead cowboy 5 the reason westerns are so fun is the atmosphere and the characters it brings i just had the feeling i was watching civil war actors dressed up as cowboys not even worth the digital video it was recorded on
<START> a lot of people don't think dan aykroyd is funny this movie proves otherwise aykroyd is brilliant delivering his one liners in this comedy the only major problem with this is that it wastes far too much time near the end jumping back and forth from aykroyd's character and the doctor who is pursuing him to prove he's a fraud the doctor goes nuts like doctor leo marvin richard dreyfuss in what about bob the scenes where the doctor is desperately trying to get back to los angeles are silly unbelievable and unfunny other that this aspect the movie really is funny especially the first half
<START> 1st watched 2 25 2002 4 out of 10 dir george p cosmatos predictable action thriller where any frequent movie goer could guess what was coming next charlie sheen is the good old boy to the president who just happens to be not liked by the rest of the presidential staff of course he gets involved in a situation where he's framed over and over again and he has one friend in the white house played by sutherland who naturally doesn't stay that way for very long his other friend is a reporter played by linda hamilton who has very little to do or say in this meaningless role and of course his biggest and bestest friend is the president himself sam waterston who stays his pal till the end despite everyone else being killed around him brainless yet action packed meaningless despite loads and loads of acting talent all pretty much wasted
<START> this movie is trash from the word go first it gives an account of a season that took place 16 years ago who cares this movie had about as much depth as a bottle cap it makes a complex person like bob knight into a cartoon character br br swearing doesn't bother me but i'm still amazed that espn showed a movie with more cursing than a kevin smith movie on a basic cable channel the f word was dropped at least 20 times before the first commercial break br br this movie was terrible and anyone associated with it should be embarrassed i rate this on the same level as jaws iv the revenge and everybody wins 2 movies that are in the crapfest hall of fame
<START> i must say i found this movie very disappointing yes i know maltin gave it 3 1 2 and others think very highly of it but well the opera sequences were god awful i take it macdonald is an acquired taste yes in the short sequences i have seen her with nelson eddy she is immensely preferable to him but on her own god i dislike opera and despise operetta and she is basically intolerable at one point i had to cover my ears gable is just ok and tracy is thrown away the plot is annoying in the jm never simply tells gable she loves him and the opera and why can't she do both instead she suffers silently or not so with the compromises she makes the supporting cast is distinctly unmemorable besides the star three and jack holt and i suppose his mother they all are just background and forgettable the sequence is the only thing that saves the movie and just yes it is fairly spectacular and moving but the oh god is great seems very contrived i immensely prefer in old chicago as far as old time disaster spectaculars go spare yourself on this one
<START> dislike this movie and everyone would understand why the plot is poor so is the acting but in my opinion it is better than halloween 5 although even this does not give many surprising moments a few scenes are really well directed but these few moments do not deliver the reason to rent it i do not despise violence in movies but features extraordinary strong and bloody scenes which do not fit to the tradition of the halloween movies the most sucking aspect about is the lack of tension no comparison to the first masterpiece br br halloween 6 only gets 4 out of 10 stars from me if you want rent it but don't expect a great horror experience br br
<START> in reaction to the dullness of the films of actual combat in that time the wartime public increasingly turned to humor as escape from monotony and br br charlie chaplin feared that his great shoulder arms would offend people but it became his greatest in it charlie by luck courage and devilish ingenuity wins the war and brings a captive kaiser in triumph to br br the chief difference between this hilarious burlesque and some of the serious war dramas was that in charlie's case it all turned out to be a dreamÂ
<START> i happened to have seen this movie this morning on tcm very bad acting low budget and poor plot are the impressions i felt while watching the movie the only highlight of the movie was watching tender young rita moreno 23 years old playing a teenage indian squaw in love with an older man in his 50's she reminded me of a earlier version of sue lyon as lolita 1962 only a more innocent lolita she bounces up and down like a 1950's teeny bopper almost as if you would expect her to be chewing gum falling all over this old man willing to give him anything as he plays it off like she's a hindrance to him any man in his 50's that had a beautiful virgin teenage girl willing to do anything for him and be his bride would be insane not to take advantage of her it's too bad that the censorship board back when this movie was released didn't permit more of an expansion of a character such as rita the only reason why i gave this movie a 3 instead of a 1 is rita appearance in the movie
