<START> chris morris' brass eye tv series had always generated a large number of complaints both from the audience and from the people taking part but nothing he has done has managed to stir up more controversy than this the 2001 brass eye special before the hugely overrated jerry springer opera arrived the brass eye special held the record for the most complaints received about any tv program ever aired br br the sheer volume of complaints that the general public made towards the brass eye special was unbelievable many complaints were voiced by people who never even watched the program the subject that the program handled turned many heads but the message was widely misinterpreted the message was even lost on some who enjoyed the program this was not a show that mocked the subject of paedophilia the show was purely about the media and it's presentation of the subject morris is and always will be a media satirist the notion that the program 'makes fun' of and children who have been abused is completely laughable morris never attempts to do either such thing he merely draws our attention to the overwhelming and very often stupid media hype surrounding the subject br br using many of his established 'brass eye' characters such as ted maul and others morris shows just how much the media over blow every little thing about a subject that they themselves created and built up and the result is as funny if not funnier than anything morris has done previously using his tried and tested formula morris manages to trick several gullible celebrities into believing that they are working on a serious documentary in actuality they are made to look like exactly what they are retards br br all in all the brass eye special needs to be seen to be believed and with one opening line morris manages to sum up the entire media situation as it stood in 2001 welcome to
<START> paul jeffrey addams family values wrote this frothy tale of a mild mannered school teacher kevin kline who is outted on the academy awards by a former student turned actor matt dillon the rest of the film deals with the absurdities revolving around this setup the effect on the town his fiancee joan cusack himself and climaxes with an everybody loves everybody finale br br if you're an angry gay rights activist or a naive youth looking for an accurate portrayal of a man's struggle to come out or a 'true' depiction of gay life then save yourself the trouble and rent something else maybe beautiful thing or read a book giovanni's room if you are able to understand that this film was inspired by the of tom hanks's speech on the academy awards when he won for philadelphia and pokes fun at hollywood culture and small town ignorance and you have a fondness for '30's screwball comedy bringing up baby holiday the palm beach story then enjoy far from being a biting satire the film tries for the exuberance of a preston sturges farce and comes damn close no it's not 'deep' or neither were romy michelle 9 to 5 or young frankenstein and it doesn't pretend to be it keeps it's tongue firmly in cheek it gets too preachy and maudlin for its own good toward the end and sure some of the jokes are a bit stale there's also a locker room scene that could have been cut but after sitting through countless comedies that misfire it's like a breath of fresh air br br kevin kline and tom selleck are wonderfully game while debbie reynolds and wilford brimley add fine support the excellent joan cusack's award winning performance is stellar and the great bob newhart is well bob newhart br br the fact that many have been offended by in out is as absurd as the mentality of the townsfolk it pokes fun at personally i was more offended by philadelphia i'll take harmless fluff over sanctimoniousness anytime
<START> i'm czech and soldiers not only pilots who escaped czechoslovakia after nazi's invasion in 1939 and fought against them abroad are true heroes and bravest men in our history for me this movie from director of academy award winner kolya 1996 is a tribute to these men it's first big screen movie about wwii soldiers since 1968 i think dark blue world is a good movie good acting good special effects nice music etc movie is half in english and some actors are britons but greatest thing about this movie is it's pure existence it's great chance to show people all around the world and to many people in czech republic too that role in wwii was not only as occupied country but as an active member of allied campaign br br leading characters are older and wiser frantisek and young karel they escaped together from czechoslovakia they are flying in the same squadron and they fell in love with the same woman maybe it's a clichÃ© but fortunately this storyline is not so aggressive and is in good balance with other scenes including great dogfights i don't want to compare dark blue world with pearl harbor someone will like ph more and someone will like but if you like happy ends is not for you so i think it's very good movie for everyone who likes this type of stories and very good movie who wants to get to know something about this chapter of history br br btw main theme dark blue world is from czech 30's and 40's composer he wrote this theme when he lost his eyes
<START> spoilers br br i hate this one but it is better than the others after this they just keep getting worse i hope gibson has the smarts to stay out of the next one a lot of the same with humor ie the toilet kids etc how much farther can we watch their relationship evolve drugs bad guys why south africa i found that unbelievable maybe south american some country in the golden triangle would have made the script better it seems the late 80' early 90's had the blond bad guys ie die hard the mighty ducks play ice land gary busey in the last weapon etc hollywood repeats itself over this one with a similar story has to go over the top the attacking the police the beach condo scene and the fight at the end and way over the top gibson's girlfriend killed by the copper attack were too much like many part 2's they get worse and 3 or 4 in this series picks up speed downhill 3 10
<START> this is my favorite love story it has every element that a good love story should have poetry jazz friendships the ups and downs in a relationships finally a movie that shows positive aspects of the black community larenz tate was great i can't picture anyone else playing the role of darius he recited that poem like he had written it himself and meant every word i own this movie and if i had the time i would watch it everyday it always makes me feel better and that's what a good movie should do also the character could not had been any better dealing with the subject of marriage we would all like to find a darius out there but most of us just settle for watching this movie my vote is 10 10
<START> fellowe's drama about a couple's marriage which is threatened by a younger third party which interests the wife of the house watson wilkinson plays the role very well as the troubled husband who cant control his wife's cheating and deals with the issue i also like rupert everett a lot in his role as william the man that watson has the affair with although i think emily watson is a great actress i had a bit of a problem with the way her character was written did not make her too likable i know a cheater is not supposed to be likable but some of her actions and things she did had no reasoning behind them the screenplay was perhaps the weak part of this drama although fellowes' direction was good and the performances were also quite good this film is better than unfaithful but not a masterpiece by any means imdb rating 6 7 my rating 8 10
<START> spoilers spoilers what's going on here br br barbara hershey looking decidedly unsexy as if she'd stolen her granny's spare wig puts in an unconvincing performance as a woman who kills the wife of a man she has had an affair with 'in self defence' after hitting her forty odd times with an axe br br like lizzy borden she is acquitted but after the most unconvincing argument ever presented to a jury by the representative of a supposedly defendant i have ever seen br br lizzy borden took an axe and gave her father forty whacks when she saw what she'd done she pleaded self defence br br i don't think so br br i find the defendants guilty of screening an unconvincing portrayal and have no alternative but to award this film a sentence of 4 out of 10 which would have been lower but for the previous good behaviour of some of those involved br br
<START> this film is just another waste of time the plot is ridiculous forced usa drama the characters were all really weak especially the uncharismatic goya and the bad interpretation of bardem who only was alright in his classic interpretation when acting as french ally br br just another chance lost of have spent the money in a good film i guess it was no a low budget film definitely not recommended maybe the director's should think a bit whether the film has sense or not before wasting so that money maybe they do not bother as they have profits before launching them in the cinema br br no more hope in cinema
<START> i think south park is hilarious and i have no problem w them taking shots at people on the left but you'd think that after taking a whole movie to attack celebrities for risking their careers taking on an illegal war and then being gasp right along they would have the sense to start giving w and the bastards ruining the country a shot or two bush seems to get a pretty free run from these guys for as stupid and messed up as he is br br gore is fair game but please what do the republicans have to do how bad do they have to f k up the country before these guys finally act like maybe they aren't just trying to do the best they can and that they have done some true screwing up or maybe just go after rush limbaugh hes a good target or even just make fun of condoleeza rice's gap teeth
<START> when i watch a short like boy next door i find myself with a kind of bittersweet feeling on the one hand i'm happy i'm watching something that has been well thought out seamlessly executed and just daring enough to be interesting on the other hand i find myself lamenting the level of comedy generally produced tv and films are so consistently packed with easy condescending crap that we find ourselves judging excellence within a scale of mediocrity then you see someone like davis who without the benefit of studio notes or substantial budget can create a really cool little comic gem producers and network suits need to turn to the travis davis' out there for material and stop awarding deals to people simply because their resume or agent may demand they should boy next door has hopefully gained the attention of the right people to facilitate more work from davis it's really fun and very well done
<START> this is yet another gem from the pen of daniele thompson in fact that same year 1999 she wrote and directed la the first of three writer director credits so far belle maman is first of all 'french' whatever that means which is of course different things to different folks the premise is simple at the altar where he is marrying seigner the groom vincent lindon gets his first glimpse of her mother catherine deneuve and suffers what the french call a coup de foudre which we know as love at first sight in theory the story is either 1 over right then and there assuming he called the wedding off or else 2 just the beginning as he goes through with the wedding and thus lives a lie until it is resolved one way or the other thompson veers towards 2 but not without hitting us with the odd subplot along the way like for example deneuve's cigar smoking lesbian mother line in real life if anyone cares is in a long term relationship with stephane who co stars here and throws in a brilliant set piece in a luxuriously appointed men's room at the wedding reception which takes the form of a hilarious song and dance consummate writer that she is thompson also the comedy with drama like the brilliant climactic scene where vincent finally spews out his feelings for deneuve at a family gathering whilst simultaneously wrecking the joint this is one to savour again and again
<START> this movie is great i really enjoyed it br br this movie is about a cat mom named dutchess and her 3 kittens t dutchess and the kittens love music they have to practice the piano everyday but the butler named edgar tries to kidnap dutchess and her kittens he tries to make them sleep but he fails them dutchess meets a cat named thomas o thomas falls in love with dutchess the cats break into song with the song everybody wants to be a cat thomas gets to love music like the other cats thomas and dutchess really like each other br br i loved this movie and i like the cats to
<START> the ealing comedies constitute their own specific sub genre in the history of film they were wry droll reflections on british life in the late forties and early fifties they are always amusing but i feel it is misleading to characterise them as comedies they are breezy and good humoured rather than laugh out loud funny however the best of them are laced with understated satire and shot through with an occasional dark streak kind hearts and coronets and the ladykillers br br i have an affection for all of them but the lavender hill mob is probably the one i have most difficulty with compared to the others it seems somewhat perfunctory to me it is an outline sketch for a movie but one that needed to spend a lot more time in development before it was ready to go before the cameras br br everything about it is a bit undercooked for example nobody is given any real context or background henry is simply a dutiful drudge whose secret dreams and hidden ambitions go unrecognised while albert is a frustrated artist forced to prostitute his talent by making gift shop trash for a living this establishes a motive for their crime but nothing that subsequently happens is a consequence either of their characters or their plan br br other characters are introduced but play no real part in the story the elderly resident in henry's guest house could with her love of detective stories have been made an unwitting thorn in his side but is merely used as background similarly the various policemen who pop in and out of the action are simply there to keep the plot ticking along br br as a result the movie is driven entirely by its contrived plot devices which i find both frustrating and faintly irritating the not very ingenious robbery is accomplished with minimal problems despite albert being prevented from carrying out his part in the plan by sidney clayton the gold is then smuggled to france without mishap everything would have gone smoothly if it wasn't for a minor hitch lamely based on the french pronunciation of the letter 'r' which results in six of the gold eiffel towers being accidentally sold to some english schoolgirls br br this leads to a series of frantic chases as henry and albert seek to retrieve them these scenes are well executed but at each point the conspirators are frustrated in their pursuit of the schoolgirls by a series of wholly accidents it is as if god is deliberately intervening to give them a hard time this kind of plotting always has me grinding my teeth br br when they finally track the last eiffel tower to a police academy exhibition and snatch it from under the nose of john police inspector why is he there anyway all shreds of plot logic are abandoned the final car chases are then simply filling up screen time until we are returned to the framing device with which the picture began br br the movie doesn't even bother to tell us the fate of albert stanley holloway sid james and shorty alfie bass br br this genial little caper has the professionalism of the ealing team behind it so it is far from being a bad movie i suspect most viewers will find it considerably more enjoyable than i do and why shouldn't they but i cannot help thinking there was a much better movie waiting to be made if only more time and effort had been expended on fleshing out both the characters and the story br br by the standards established by ealing lavender hill mob is a missed opportunity br br ps one curious footnote is that audrey hepburn gets a credit for her single line early on but archie duncan remains anonymous despite his much more substantial contribution i guess she just had a better agent
<START> mom should really be given a different title to distinguish it from all the other movies out there called mom or with the word mom in the title br br this is a vastly superior zombie movie to so much of the rubbish that gets churned out time after time and all end up much the same as every other zombie movie out there br br it is so different and refreshing it almost defies br br the kind old lady who takes in a creepy lodger who just happens to be a flesh eater who then infects the old lady who also turns into a flesh eating zombie or ghoul quite which exactly is not defined br br there is pathos in the story as her son realises what she has become and while at first horrified attempts to help her by supplying 'food' i shall say no more about that for fear of inserting a spoiler it is one of those movies as opposed to guns blasting explosions raging car chases etc boring etc that makes so many movies all the same rubbish but still with enough gory moments to satisfy horror fans whilst also inserting sadness into the story along with nice touches of humour as opposed to downright silliness of some so called 'horror' movies br br there is a particularly nice atmospheric shot at the beginning of the film where the old lady is sitting alone in her room with only her christmas tree for company and looks so but what she becomes oh my br br a gem of a movie and even if not your thing should at least be viewed if only once by any true horror fan
<START> this forth film in the angel guts saga which at only a few minutes above an hour it just feels much longer is also the shortest which is perhaps just as well as it's also the most uninvolving of the series nami a department store clerk is interested in another part time job her fellow worker at the department store introduces her to modeling for a porn mag called 'red but when her other employers found out about her naughty pictures they decide to fire her and she gets some unwanted admirer oh yea and she likes to masturbate alot using various household items the wall to wall masks a lack of discernible plot and pushes this one far too much into exploitation territory not unsurprising though given that the director of this one is ikeda evil dead trap beautiful prey perhaps his sensibilities just weren't suited for an angel guts film br br my grade d br br dvd extras commentary by jasper sharp bio filmographies a 36 minute interview with ikeda original sleeve art and trailers for this and 4 other angel guts films high school co ed red classroom red vertigo red porno all available in box set but for some reason the 6th film angel guts red flash is not in the set
