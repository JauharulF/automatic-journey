<START> after having watched darwin's nightmare one must have the impression of being a living hell with its population being quasi slaves delivering the finest fish to the well fed europeans while leaving the fish bones to the starving population in exchange for the fish they get western made weapons which the mainly unemployed population eagerly awaits to use because being a soldier is their only source of income br br so everything is all dark with trade as the incarnation of evil and source of all misery not quite fortunately darwin's nightmare shows the dark sides only and completely spares the positive aspects in fact the documentary hardly tells anything about the economic and ecologic importance the has for the region br br for the countries around lake victoria the is the second to third most important source of income the wages in the fishing industry are way above average has banned huge to secure the jobs of thousands of fishermen the adjacent states have met agreements to keep fishing on a sustainable level cities at the lake are benefiting from the taxes the have to pay for each caught fish and the taxes on the exports and profits furthermore has banned the local traditional fish which still play an important role feeding the local population br br by ignoring those positive signs the documentary deters the badly needed western consumers and investors and thus threatens to aggravate the situation br br for further reading i can recommend two articles the german alternative wing newspaper wrote on the subject http www taz de pt 2006 09 02 1 http www taz de pt 2005 03 17 1 text
<START> with boundless raw energy and an uncompromising vision talk radio brilliantly explores the public's fondness for reducing strangers' private problems into entertainment via the radio br br eric bogosian is sensational as barry a rude in your face talk radio host he's a natural for this kind of role and fine tunes one of the most impressive interesting radio personalities i've ever seen on screen the timing and delivery of his insults to his various callers are strokes of genius br br alec baldwin also shines as barry's boss he demonstrates the same explosive cynicism that he would later display 1992's glengarry glen ross but the supporting role that truly stands out is the stoned seemingly brain dead teen played by michael wincott you have to see it to believe it br br oliver stone and robert richardson do a great job with the photography which is almost entirely confined to a single broadcasting room the claustrophobic feel of the movie perfectly mirrors its tone after all one of the major points of the film is exploiting people's private moments to draw an audience stone demonstrates that these moments are often too private for the whole world to experience br br talk radio is a film with strong emotional and cerebral impact the likes of which are seldom seen today
<START> when the movie first started i thought cheesy the first ten minutes were really boring after the slow beginning and some of the soap opera antics i started liking it the plot was different than anything i had ever seen now was it a horror not really it shouldn't have been as a horror or the producers should have put more money into the movie to make it scary as it was the creatures where only there for a short time i can only assume this was for money reason br br the good side was that the movie was very entertaining it held my interest after the start and did make me wonder about creatures from another dimension br br it was obvious that this was a first time movie for the director but there were a couple of highlights by the end i was hooked too bad hollywood didn't put more money behind this
<START> the plot of this movie is dangerously thin and the only star power if we can call it that consists of joe estevez i don't know what is more shocking the fact that this movie was made or the fact that some people actually gave good comments about it if you ever see the cover of the video you'll be able to read them someone even went as far as saying that the actress writer could be the leading lady of the 90's yeah and joe estevez could have more money than his brother martin if you want to check it out anyways i highly recommend watching the version of it at least you'll laugh a lot without going insane
<START> this 22 minute short short of a precursor to the later much better rock and rule features two folk singer mice who are going nowhere the female mouse jan signs a deal with the devil to become a hit rock star so it's up to daniel mouse to save her soul made in the late '70's this has all the trappings of said decade crap music crap clothing and hair style awful folk tunes this cartoon is featured on the second disc of the 2 disk collector's edition of rock and rule it also comes with a making of that runs almost as long as the show itself br br my grade d
<START> i don't care what anyone says this movie is hilarious it combines the bleak seriousness of threads with an anarchic blend of alternative comedy and the results are a severely dark but outrageously funny satire on the policies of both the western and eastern at the time you gotta give the filmmakers credit for even attempting to top the real life lunacy of duck and cover or protect and survive br br imagine someone made a movie based on the dead kennedys track sex makes the world go round' and you're pretty close to whoops apocalypse add on top form as an insanely ott sas commander and you've got it exactly a worthy companion piece to dr strangelove and that's saying something
<START> this movie was clearly an early attempt for a new director but still succeeded in being original and entertaining as well as in some moments thought provoking however i have to say the story would not have come across as well without the stellar performance of paul anthony as pip he made the well written parts very believable and affecting and the more weakly written parts much more bearable also i have to mention the performance by alan cumming it was refreshing to see him in a part like this he brought a weight to his role that provided a very grounding element to the film as for paul anthony who is this guy why haven't i seen more of him someone give him more roles please
<START> soul calibur has always been my favorite fighting game series of all time and is my favorite one of the series br br the graphics are very well done much bigger improvement over the choppy in soul edge soul blade the characters have facial expressions hair blows in the breeze and they even blink br br soul calibur has always been known for it's interesting plots and characters and is no exception each character has his her background story that is detailed and well done my favorite character is chai she's cute she's funny and she's a strong female character yeah i know she wears pink and has a boyfriend who she ends up saving btw but there seems to be more to her than that like all the other characters have flaws and upsides to their personalities so no character is perfect not even the good guys br br the music is beautifully composed for a fighting game series it doesn't sound kitchy the vampire series nor does it sound like old school porn film soundtrack mortal kombat the characters have their own themes and a lot of the themes are done to match the culture of that certain part of the world i don't think there is a song on this soundtrack i don't like br br another cool thing about this game is to create your own anime like character create a soul you could make him her look as cute or as sexy or even ugly if you like however if you found a character that you like remember to take notes or else you won't remember how you created that character i found myself being very addicted to br br overall i think soul calibur is my number one fighting game series of all time it has everything i asked for what more could i want
<START> being the second last of chaplin's essanay films carmen is a parody of cecil b demille's drama with the same title it stands as quite obvious that demille's acknowledged film didn't impress the comedy king that much which he later admitted in his autobiography br br parodies were not a new experiment for chaplin he had done several of them already namely his prehistoric past and his new job and would continue to do so until the very end of his career in films for instance in a king in new york br br chaplin does a very good portrayal of don josÃ© and edna is very as good as carmen neither act as we are used to charlie is not the lovable tramp and edna is far from an innocent little woman but that was not chaplin's intentions either a burlesque on carmen is a somewhat odd chaplin film very different but includes good material nonetheless br br the main story is although very differently structured as in the original drama don josÃ© is very much in love with carmen but is not alone in that field carmen carmen the beautiful carmen is loved by all men under 96 but he has the big advantage that he is an officer and there we are this is the famous story about rivalry love greed and honor seen from a humorous perspective thanks to chaplin's and performances and to the wonderful wonderful music by george bizet which i highly admire this could actually have been a near comedy masterpiece it's time taken into consideration it could have been but unfortunately although it is a good pretty good comedy i don't feel it's fair to blame people who claim that a burlesque of carmen is far from being a masterpiece but it's important to keep in mind that this has nothing to do with any lack of talent but rather a result of conflicts concerning business when chaplin refused to re sign essanay contract after completing his last film for the company police they took revenge by editing back all the scenes chaplin originally had edited out from carmen thanks to this the film is somewhat confusing and has several pointless scenes which are more annoying than funny and the film turned out to be rather a ben turpin feature turpin played than a chaplin short naturally chaplin was in despair when he discovered what essanay had done and had to stay in bed for several days br br despite its obvious flaws a burlesque of carmen is highly recommended to chaplin fans and to admirers of beautiful music
<START> chucky's back and it's about time this time with the help of jennifer tilly and a little spell from voodoo for dummies well at least with this installment the camp is back this was the more gruesome of this series so far it has some good twists and some good action scenes br br this one was by far the most fun of the series and successfully if unintentionally bridges the gap between pure horror to horror comedy br br i am looking forward to seed of chucky it'll be a hoot br br jesus the music scene's gone to h3ll since i've been dead chucky br br we needed the levity as the doll thing's getting old the added comedic element and the better action scenes brings this one back up to equal the quality of the first when the idea was fresh and new ish br br 6 8 10 from br br the fiend
<START> this hokey movie left me groaning after just about any exchange of dialogue or plot complication patricia arquette though pleasing to look at gives a below par performance from her usual mediocrity my friends and i have coined the phrase beyond to mean anything really bad a lowpoint for boorman
<START> i have been collecting iron man comics since the early 70s and always enjoyed the character who is far far from the average clean cut hero and his many and varied enemies there have been no less than three attempts at an animated series for iron man and only the original and part of the second have ever done the character justice so i was somewhat hopeful that this newest version would be good boy was i wrong the dvd art is very misleading and presents an image that is not the movie fist off the good what little there is the art and animation are well drawn and the writing and dialog are generally good though with notable exceptions character voices are very well selected and each character is distinctive and well acted now for the bad unfortunately the writers opted to totally screw around with both iron man's origin and especially the on top of that they decided to do iron man and his opponents all in cgi bad cgi this makes them stand out almost as badly as live actors would in a cartoon the cg work is often repetitive and glaring shortcuts are taken at times the cg battles are clumsy as well further enhancing the fact that cg and line animation do not mix well the movie would certainly have fared better had they opted to actually draw all the characters another problem is that iron man is in his traditional red and gold suit for all of one battle and its not even the big fight at the end all this drags the movie down and it never picks up br br spoilers or warnings may follow br br the movie starts off with an interestingly unusual stop motion credit sequence of machinery welding and gears then we are introduced to what looks like a chinese temple in the process of being restored and prominent is a statue of what fans will recognize as the mandarin things go strangely impeding progress in restoring the temple overseeing it is james rhodes tony long time friend seems they plan to actually raise the temple up from the earth despite opposition by a group who insist that raising the temple will bring about a terrible disaster rhodes is captured in a raid stark shown in a hot tub with a lovely lady is informed of the problems and sets out to personally oversee the project and rescue his friend while in the background his father deals with board executives who are pushing to have tony removed tony arrives only to have his armored escort ambushed and blown to pieces tony later awakens mortally wounded in the heart and a prisoner of the rebels he is saved only by quick action from rhodes and a scientist eventually stark must build the prototype gray iron armor and makes good an escape but only after some loss of life while with the rebels he meets a troubled girl named li mei and the two fall in love the temple is raised and four elemental beings all done in cg appear and proceed to start collecting hidden rings of power stark and find trouble back home but manage to confront the without success in really stopping them first using the aquatic armor then the more classic red and gold armor and finally everything returns to the temple and stark is back in the bulky gray armor for a final showdown and a run in with what may be fin fang also in cg here the story takes a major twist as it turns out that the mandarin needs a host body to manifest this leads to a somewhat tragic final battle marred by the fact that the mandarin is little more than a ghost and isn't seen till the last 5 minutes of the movie ugh br br if you are an iron man fan then you will likely not enjoy this outing and even non fans may well find the movie somewhat lacking or not
<START> after the opening credits over a black sheet of paper with spots of white paint sprayed onto it oh ok i'll be generous and call it a star field we witness an alien spacecraft crashing into a meteorite and being forced to land on earth a terrible looking model spacecraft lands on a terrible looking model field three nearby campers investigate from the burning spacecraft a reptile like looking alien the emerges ok so i lied it's a guy in a dodgy rubber monster mask and silver spacesuit the campers are quickly killed by the laser gun which shoots awful special effects at people the towns sheriff jack cinder tom griffith is informed he alerts his deputy lisa kent karin and gathers a posse of men together to investigate meanwhile the has killed an unlucky motorist who stopped on the side of the road for a leak his two annoying kids run for help they approach a house inside two young people are kissing the girl says someones running towards the house the guy gets up to take a look and is attacked and gutted by the it kills the girl as well then it manages to kill the two kids with his laser maybe the ain't so bad after all once the sheriff and his men arrive at the scene they have a gun laser battle with the after possibly the most unexciting gun fight in film history only the sheriff his deputy and a local man jamie lambert jamie survive but the is still alive bullets seem to have no effect on it the next day the sheriff visits the towns mayor bert wicker richard and his girlfriend mary jane eleanor herman to get permission to evacuate everyone in the town he refuses saying a party he is holding for the governor richard cannot be cancelled and that he doesn't want to create a panic situation the sheriff evacuates the town anyway two doctors steven price george and ruth sherman anne firth are attacked by the before they can leave however they manage to scare the away and survive together with the sheriff his deputy and jamie they decide to stay behind and fight the alien written and directed by don this has to be an amateur film made with family and friends look at the credits and see how many are involved for that reason i should probably cut it some slack but that still doesn't stop it or excuse it from being a throughly awful film in every department it has no story or purpose things just happen to waste time whats with drago don strangling his ex girlfriend suzie monica neff this and many more scenes add nothing to the film the script has no logic either why does the stick around the town once it's been supposedly evacuated the special effects are embarrassingly bad just look at the effect when the shoots someone with his laser a computer effect an 80's spectrum would be ashamed of there's not really much blood or gore in it a ripped open stomach a severed arm and a decapitation but they all look predictably poor credit where it's due the itself looks alright for the most part there's a sex scene between the sheriff and his deputy which has to be seen to be believed music that even a porno would be embarrassed about and two really ugly naked people make this a difficult sequence to watch less than stellar acting photography music lighting and editing make it a real chore to sit through and the worse thing about this film it commits the mortal sin of being boring and not fun in the slightest sorry don mate but don't give up the day job definitely one to avoid
<START> the ten steps has basically a reasonably good premise for a scary short but the execution is simply appalling the dialogue is terrible and the acting is of the kind so regularly witnessed in irish short films really really embarrassingly bad the girl has to go down the 10 steps of the cellar to change the blown fuse she telephones her father who is entertaining his boss at dinner the mother an actress with very questionable acting skills answers the phone and in a loud scolding voice tells her not to be ringing as dad is 'trying to impress his boss' the actress playing the boss's wife very successfully emulates the mother's poor acting when she tells them that their house is haunted the rest of the film consists of the father coaxing his daughter down the stairs on the telephone the ten steps employs the stock techniques in camera movement lighting and music that one would expect in a below average horror film poor
<START> don't watch this film while or soon after eating br br having said that begotten will stick with you for the rest of your life like it or not based on the nihilistic philosophy that life is nothing more than man above ground to paraphrase the title sequence introduction this will more than likely contain the most intense and grisly imagery you'll ever see in a film br br there is no dialogue only image after image describing the cycle of life the film's combination of stark black and white photography compounded with some truly creepy background sounds work to drive home the maker's message br br the movie begins with god portrayed as a bandaged and obviously insane man slicing open his torso with a straight razor and subsequently dying in his own filth after his death mother nature emerges from his corpse to impregnate herself with his blood and semen and gives birth to man represented by a maggot of a human convulsing on the earth br br the landscape is a barren waste populated by hulking shrouded humanoids who eventually happen upon mother nature and man after a slew of violent scenes depicting the rape of nature and destruction of man these humanoids proceed to pound the remains of the corpses back into the ground and the cycle of life begins anew br br i actually rented this from blockbuster one night based on the cover art and hype content but this is definitely not a blockbuster type film don't expect narrative dialogue or any pulled punches this is intense imagery based on a dark subject br br i give this movie some high marks for the filmwork and audio but i don't think i'll be watching it too often if again i like my movies dark and unique but this one is exponentially more than i expected
