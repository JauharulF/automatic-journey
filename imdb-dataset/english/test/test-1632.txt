<START> since watching the trailer in the little mermaid ii return to the sea dvd i had a feeling that this movie is gonna be great 'cause i am a huge disney fan and guess what i'm right this movie is a very worthy successor to the original classic lady and the tramp br br it tells the story of scamp lady and son scamp who wants to be wild and free instead of living a life though the movie might not be as good as the first one it has a great moral that you couldn't find anywhere else until you watch it br br i admit that the movie isn't for everyone but those of you who hate it all i can say is that you don't have a spirit for this and i suggest that you shouldn't go see it again but hey it's really an awesome story packed with brilliant animation music and star studded voice talents featuring scott wolf party of five and alyssa milano charmed so if you haven't seen the movie why standing there go and grab the copy
<START> it is great to see a new batch of puppets creating havoc in this series i found this chapter a lot of fun in fact it would probably be my second favorite in the series this movie has very little violence and is only rated pg 13 this is notably different from the other r rated puppet master movies which were loaded with gore and violent mayhem the lack of violence does not diminish the fun though this film also has notably better special effects than the last movie in this series good
<START> is one of my favorite books thus i was looking forward to this film unfortunately the film is absolutely horrible the dialog is so bad it sounds like improv half the time the new storyline makes me think they took the book and a couple of newspapers threw them in a blender and used what came out for the screenplay it's a disgrace to the book and independent film making the only reason i even managed to get all the way through the film was my hopes that it'd get better unfortunately it only got worse climaxing in a really retarded ending br br that's not to say everything about the movie is bad the cg is acceptable in a 1990's reboot sort of way which i assume is what they were going for and i suppose you can't go wrong with people getting chopped in half and gushing blood all over the place
<START> miles o'keefe stars as ator a loin clothed hero who resembles a dancer the conan wannabe must do battle with an evil guy in a cher wig and protect the earth from the geometric a sort of primitive atomic bomb watch closely for visible sunglasses and tire tracks mystery science theater 3000 made fun of it under the title cave dwellers
<START> this movie took me by surprise the opening credit sequence features nicely done animation after that we're plunged into a semi cheesy production betraying its low budget the characters typical american teens are introduced slowly with more personal detail than is usually found in movies like this by the time the hits the fan we know each one of the characters and either like or hate them according to their distinct personalities it's a slow uphill set up kind of like the ride up a slope of a really tall roller coaster thankfully once the action kicks in it's full blown old school horror steve johnson's make up effects are awesome equal in quality to much bigger budgeted films and the scares are jolting kevin tenney delivers his best movie ever with heart stopping surprises and creepy suspenseful set ups the tongue in cheek sometimes cheesy humor marks this film as pure 80s horror as opposed to the sullen tone of earlier genre fare like night of the living dead or hills have eyes but for true horror fans this one is worth checking out play it as the first entry on a double bill with the 1999 remake of house on the haunted hill the set up and character dynamics are so similar that you really have to wonder what film they were actually remaking
<START> jamie foxx does a fine job of impersonating the famous blues soul country singer ray charles to the film's credit it shows both the good and the bad regarding charles' character and the choices he made both personally and professionally br br this is a slick looking film that provides you with a rich feel of the periods in which the story takes place not only does it look good it sounds good i only wish there was more music in here when it's inserted it's fabulous but there isn't enough of it br br assuming at least for review purposes that the story was true i was impressed and disappointed with charles meaning the story left some memorable impressions since i'm writing this 16 months after viewing it main impressions include br br good re living ray's immense talent and his foresight to step out and take chances musically such as going country for awhile the man had supreme confidence in himself but didn't come across as arrogant about it also memorable was showing him beating his heroin addiction with no help that's just amazing br br bad i also remember through this film how easily hooked ray got in the first place and disappointed he was so unfaithful to his wife a really sad comment was that his wife was more upset with him for missing his kid's little league games than she was for all the cheating he was doing on her even fathering a child with a member of his singing group br br the only negative i had with the filmmakers was the overemphasis of his problems being blamed on one early childhood event the accidental death of his brother that tragedy was used as cop out for all ray's as an adult which is another example of a culture in which people refuse to take responsibility for their actions br br note there is an extended version with the dvd but word has it that it is so poorly edited that it's not worth watching so stick with the theatrical version
<START> it's not really about wine no real targets are those who would streamline and assimilate the peculiarities of local wine production for business purposes to this end he has made an excellent objective film spirited bumptious emotional and flawed independent wine producers are juxtaposed with media and auld europeans the art of wine making against market driven product manufacture it's an open show that doesn't lead conclusion br br film is occasionally infuriating to watch cameras are neither concealed nor steadicam by any means there are also plenty of captions as well as subtitles to wade through often too short a time on screen br br however it does outdo michael moore at the game moore can't play anyway the characters speak for and therefore condemn themselves well worth a viewing 7 10
<START> paul schrader and his brother leonard wrote mishima and in so doing clearly drew parallels between the life of yukio mishima and his work the film is divided into four sections beauty art action and the fateful day when mishima held an army general hostage and spoke to the garrison only to have it ridicule him and his bushido ideals of the samurai code mishima committed ritual seppuku on november 25 1970 and he planned it as a meshing of beauty art and action schrader edits scenes recreating that day with three different scenarios from novels temple of the golden house and runaway horses the moment of seppuku is perfectly realized in relation to its shocking climax via pulling back the camera while simultaneously zooming in br br black and white sequences are intermingled with the colorful moments depicted in novels the black and white scenes represent memories from childhood and youth schrader correlates some of these autobiographical moments with scenes from the novels that often parallel real life such as his stammer development of his bodybuilding obsession and his fostering of the samurai code each of the three themes of beauty art and action is exemplified in the chosen depictions from the respective novels the color sequences are reminiscent of early stagy technicolor films giving the film perhaps an intended surreal quality considering the subject matter br br ken plays the real mishima with unfailing determination headed to the general's office on that fateful day and resembles the real mishima schrader took tremendous risks with this film in focusing on the novels he did and with tying them thematically to both personal life and his literary ambitions the editing of the film between the three main sections of november 25 1970 the black and white growing up segments and the colorful novel scenes clearly point to the deliberate intersection of these elements of beauty art and action in life at times it is difficult to follow and there may be little to recommend for the uninitiated viewer of 4 stars
<START> if you are like me and you bought the new tenacious d album the day it came out and went into the film knowing all the lyrics to all the songs then you will certainly enjoy this film yes i am biased as a huge tenacious d fan but i really did like this film which made me chuckle quite a lot br br this movie was pretty much everything i expected comedic genius backed up by great songwriting and some great cameos from ben stiller and tim robbins i particularly enjoyed tim robbins' part br br if however you are unfamiliar with tenacious d's hbo series and fantastic debut album then this may not have quite the same comedic impact on you i would still recommend you go and watch that because it still worth every cent of the admission price and will make you smile even if you aren't in stitches the whole time
<START> we start all of our reviews with the following information my wife and i have seen nearly 100 movies per year for the past 15 years recently we were honored by receiving lifetime movie passes to any movie any time at no cost so we can see whatever we want whenever we want the point of this is that critics count for zero your local critics or the national critics like ebert are really no different than you or me the only difference is that they get to write about the movie and are forced to see hundreds of movies whether they want to or not therefore it is our belief that if you get your monies worth for two hours of enjoyment that is good enough for us we never ever listen or read the critics we only care about our friends and those who we know like the same things as us well enough about that br br when meryl streep the head of the in the movie says the united states does not torture it got a big laugh at this movie it is of course a lie that the bush administration has denied time and again it is a very good movie and it is scary in what they can do to us as we lose all of our civil rights they can simply snatch you anywhere and tell know one that they have done it in this case they snatch a man who has a name similar to those who killed thousands on 9 11 he is of course just like you or i and so they take him to a secret location outside of the us to torture and him br br very frightening well acted by jake and reese and the entire cast
<START> this is an utterly forgettable picture a friend of mine picked it up in a bargain bin at a local rental place for 50 he should have demanded a refund or at least a discount br br the plot is something like this a giant monster threatens the earth and aliens decide that the most average human being on the planet must be chosen to save the earth thus a tiny holographic space alien appears before a postal worker and tells him that he's it br br the devil is in the details when it's time to rate a movie and on that count the invader fails miserably the monster only has a few brief moments on the screen totaling maybe 5 minutes tops with a generous estimate the cute alien hologram has even less screen time and might be the most interesting character to look at and only because she's wearing a teeny bopper stereotype outfit complete with a teasingly short skirt the climactic final battle with the monster is over before you can say whiskey tango foxtrot over in the next moment you are left to ponder whether you've just experienced a train wreck or if someone just drained 3 pints of blood out of you br br admittedly though this movie did deliver one line that my friends and i to this day still repeat and laugh at and was about the only bright spot in this otherwise abysmal picture as the cast of protagonists is being interrogated by the fuzz one of them responds to the questions with the statement what are you some kind of a question it is delivered in such a preposterous manner that if you're sitting with a group of friends who won't be your friends long if you actually talked your friend into watching this you may actually experience a howl or two of incredulous laughter br br while this is no manos or it's not even bad enough to be classically bad this movie will still bore you with its awful dialog unimaginative characters and nonexistent special effects and still deserves to inhabit the bottom 100 br br 1 5 10
<START> as a sci fi and casual angelina jolie fan i thought this obviously low budget movie might be worth a look maybe it had a few scenes or a storyline that would make up for all its other faults plus it might be interesting to watch angelina as she was embarking on her star bound career br br oh how wrong i was one thing i learned at 18 angelina jolie couldn't act so to make her comfortable the producers cast this entire movie with people who couldn't act seeing this jack palance who can actually act decided to overact watching 10 minutes of this happen is enough to burn your eyes out br br to the horrible acting and overacting add a nonsensical script insipid dialog bottom of the barrel cinematography in fact add bottom of the barrel everything br br the story features angelina as a cyborg programmed by her corporate overlords as an assassin she escapes the corporate hq with the help of her combat instructor the corporation sends bounty hunters after them stupid stuff happens the end i would tell you more but i didn't want to waste my life watching this dreck br br i implore you this is not worth watching its not even worth thinking about watching save yourself the pain and move on
<START> frank sinatra has one of his best roles as a reformed heroin addict coming back to his chicago neighborhood after an extensive stay in a clinic he plans to stay off the drug and find work as a drummer but he can't avoid running into his old friends he had been arrested originally not for any drug related charge but because he was caught dealing in an illegal poker game his skill at poker has earned him the nickname of the man with the golden arm and the men who run the game one of them being his former heroin connection want him to deal again meanwhile frank has to take care of a woman whom he injured in a car accident eleanor parker and make up with his old girlfriend molly kim novak the film is great at putting us in sinatra's mental state when he feels sure of himself at the beginning of the film i felt good for him but when a promised phone call doesn't come one day he descends into depression and goes back on the smack later when he finally gets to audition he arrives completely strung out his embarrassment when he can't play the correct beat is devastating he had such big dreams and the other musicians don't even pay him a bit of attention as he rushes out of the room the film moves quickly and it shows frank's drug problem in a realistic light without turning into a social message picture the actors are uniformly fine elmer bernstein's score is one of the best of its time the only thing i don't like about the film is the ending br br spoilers br br although i really like the character of and parker is very good in the film they could have done a little more to fill in her backstory the ending is a little too pat while there is surely pathos that will remain with the characters after the film closes death ties up all the loose ends a bit too neatly frank is free to love molly and he won't go to jail also his dealer is dead so at least the immediate threat is gone well i guess in hollywood there's always a desire to tie everything up in a neat little package it harms the film a little but as it stands it's still one of the best and most adult movies about drug addiction i can think of 9 10
<START> this movie is one of the worst i've ever seen even being hangover didn't help the plot is lousy if existent the relatively large number of beautiful girls are unable to help i guess seeing an episode of temptation island with the sound turned of would give the same kind of experience do not see this flick
<START> 1st watched 2 18 2007 4 out of 10 dir leon leonard fair adventure movie based on a novel by the author of moby dick fame herman melville this movie is about the captain of a ship who had stolen the eyes that were extremely rare black pearls from a native tribe's god sculpture and hidden them somewhere that only he knew about before leaving the island of he got very sick and was on a secret voyage to go back to the island to retrieve the pearls for himself while others like his daughter thought that he was going back to be treated by the local medicine man others didn't know the reason for the voyage a stowaway actually knew the real reason for the trip to return the eyes to their god the silly part is that the pearls were hidden very close to the statue and all this time the natives ran their tribe without their god having eyes causing them all kinds of problems along the way we are treated for some reason to a short underwater nature show with an electric eel fighting a local octopus i guess only herman melville knows what this was all about once they get to the island the captain dies but passes the whereabouts of the pearls to his daughter but she also gets the sickness curse as well one of the bad guys finds out where the god is housed and convinces the daughter to go there and steal back the pearls but at this point the good guys find out what's going on and a fight ensues i won't tell you the results of the fight or the ending i'll leave that up to you to find out if you want as i said earlier the movie was ok but some very silly things that i've already mentioned lessened it's impact i wonder if that new pirates of the caribbean got some of it's plot from this one hmmÂ black pearls a curse i well it doesn't matter those elements didn't make for a very good movie in this case or the other it seems they would learn they're lesson but with the money rolling in on that newer movie i'm sure they won't oh well
