<START> i was entertained to see that some of the reviews here were topped with spoilers the joke in my family is that the only part of this movie that isn't given away on the back of the box is given away in the title perhaps i am just a dense american 17 year old who wouldn't know art if it bit me in the leg but i prefer movies that have at least some words this movie makes the second half of 2001 a space odyssey down right chatty this movie is just so slow it isn't even art it is merely boring we follow this creepy guy who is following this boy around venice the end was incomprehensible until i read the end of book a movie shouldn't make you refer back to the book it should be able to stand alone this movie has no way to stand it doesn't even have the bones of a plot to lean on
<START> graduation day br br i bought this movie this past week and waited for some time where i could kick back and relax and watch some good 80's slasher gems i got this and xtro to watch never seen any of them i just watched it and realized my outdoor speakers were on also i only imagine what my neighbors thought when came on to sing their one 10 minute hit i'm sure it was loud and i'm sure they think i'm weird with that and the chainsaw sound and screaming from other movies br br this was a pretty sub par slasher movie no suspense no story some cool deaths almost seemed on the amateur side i usually like movies like that but it just didn't click with me now i will watch xtro for the 1st time and have a margarita br br dj eric austin tx
<START> someone else called this film a fable horror movie and i think that fits pretty well that's the concept at least a group of teenagers each with their own vice catch the eye of a twisted sideshow barker he decides to teach the teens a lesson by making them part of the freak show a cool idea but could have been executed better the fate for some of the teens is shoved in your face too obviously while other characters could have been fleshed out more also the ending was a serious let down no resolution or big twist or anything br br but as a low budget horror movie it's pretty fun to watch if you're into cheesy you should have a laugh watching this one i think one of it's faults though that it takes itself too seriously it's a silly movie and if it was a little more self aware when it comes to that i think it would have been better but at least there's enough neat carnival themes and b movie monster makeup to keep you watching
<START> this is one of the best horror suspense films that hollywood has made in years or maybe even decades even though in my opinion this movie was predictable in parts it has everything that a good film in this genre should had chill thrills and yes a lot of gore house of wax sure delivers in parts it was sort of far fetched the acting was not that great but my overhaul rating for house of wax is an eight out of ten if you enjoy being at the edge of your seats this is just the right movie for you i have to admit it was sort of neat seeing the whole town made out of wax i myself enjoy these museums but after seeing this film i will now look at them in a whole new different way
<START> most people are totally unaware that this movie exists fox which paid judge to make it has kept it in the can for quite awhile and then spent nothing to promote it i guess that made many people think it was one of the garbage movies being flushed in late summer well i am here to tell you that this is a funny and rather frightening look at a future that is not that hard to believe basically judge puts forward the notion that the stupid are the smart by a wide margin then these stupid are getting more stupid by basically spending all of their time watching tv and having sex which produces more stupid people by 2500 a person of average intelligence today will appear to be a genius that talks all seriously is this really that hard to believe oh sure this future is painfully funny and ridiculously stupid but still plausible luke wilson is great as the time traveling army guy hopelessly trying to get back to a more comfortable time where this story will gain its cult status is with the numerous funny one liners like can we family style her and hey man i'm here this is a funny movie and a rather sharp social commentary on an american society that seems to be with self pleasure comfort and stupidity and i guarantee you that i will be buying this on dvd the first day it comes out and watching it over and over
<START> i'm really not going to waste my time with in depth analysis i'm just going to say that i'm extremely disappointed that catherine zeta jones made the mistake of being in the main role in this absurd nonsense in this full of clichÃ©s boring to death thoughtless pathetic try in film making there is no point in trying to find the positive sides of this movie because as a whole it is poor in every single way and the saddest thing is that zeta jones is dragged so uncompromisingly into the clichÃ©s that she has absolutely no chance of showing even 1 of her talent br br avoid this movie even at the opportunity of spending the night at home starring at the wall
<START> i was very impressed with this film from newcomer dir writer jose reyes the cast was excellent jorge executed a powerful br br and shocking performance as the lead character of it's inspiring to see independent films with this level of talent br br it takes talent courage and determination to go out and make a quality film br br i admire anyone who can take an idea from concept to conception and go the mile br br it's easy for people to judge young filmmakers more harshly but i applaud jose reyes br br and the talented cast for their successful efforts
<START> i just saw it at the toronto international film festival director neal impressive starring cast includes william macy seen in the contender at last year's tiff meat loaf aka meat loaf aka michael lee david paymer and laura dern also starring in novocaine also at this year's festival br br based on the arthur miller novel by the same name focus follows christian but jewish looking lawrence newman macy as he struggles among the hatred and anti semitism in his neighbourhood pitted between the jewish store owner down the street paymer and his card carrying anti semite next door neighbour meat loaf newman faces difficulty in dealing with inner conflict and conflict around him guilt over knowing what's right but not doing anything battles with wanting to blend in and keep peace with the neighbours things gets more complex when he meets and marries gertrude dern who everyone thinks is jewish gertrude teaches her husband a few things about judging books by covers br br will newman stick up for the jewish man in the end or will he flee go see it to find out br br the acting was fabulous the writing was incredible the cinematography was excellent the sound was well done technically amazing the movie was disturbing chilling emotionally intense i found myself bringing my knees up into the fetal position a couple of times i have great admiration for everyone who worked on it i have not seen a film this good in a long time it touched me br br wow
<START> hollywood will stop at nothing to make money on a film even if they have to keep dragging out stereotypes and putting them in the most impossible and stupid situations this effort is a clear example of that and i really do believe in my heart that a film like this is racially irresponsible story is about a divorced lawyer named peter sanderson steve martin who has been chatting with a lady on his computer and when he finally meets her she turns out to be the opposite of what he was expecting charlene morton queen latifah is a stocky black woman who has no intentions of dating peter but instead wants him to look at her case where she was convicted of robbery he wants her to leave for good but she keeps popping up at inappropriate times and to save his job he reluctantly agrees to look at the facts involving her case br br spoiler alert br br peter has his kids staying with him and charlene turns out to be helpful in raising them but suddenly a news bulletin announces that an escaped convict named charlene morton has broken out of prison peter tells her to leave when the fbi comes snooping around but he figures out that she is in fact innocent when her old boyfriend shows up and threatens him br br this film is directed by adam who keeps things moving at a nice pace and it is a good looking film technically speaking but the script is just so improbable and every character is a stereotype to the point that a 1970 film called the landlord is clearly more in tune with race relations than this mess i have always been a big fan of martin and i think he's one of the most talented persons around but he loves to work constantly and at times just seems to pick any script handed to him on the other hand i've always had a problem with latifah and the way she into the life of martin is so over the top that she instantly becomes ingratiating basic premise that hollywood loves to use is the hip black person showing uptight whitey to loosen up and then pass on some street logic that will help them with their lives that's basically what the story is here but of course they have to let martin dress black and overact like a retarded eminem because hollywood knows that this is what viewers want well i was pretty much insulted by everything in this film and it's not because i don't have a sense of humor but unfortunately for hollywood anyway i use logic and common sense when i watch a film yes i enjoyed eugene talking jive but are we really suppose to believe that he would be instantly attracted to latifah i guess weirder things have happened and how many times does a main actor get shot only to be saved by something in their pocket wouldn't a cell phone shatter if struck by a bullet even if your the most die hard martin and latifah fan i wouldn't recommend this i know i've said this before but this isn't an attempt to make a good film it's an excuse to try and make money
<START> a teenage film about angst friendship loyalty and growing but this isn't a happy outing on its part due to the circumstances and life changing dilemmas surrounding the premise what eventuates is quite numbing haunting and downright cold however i was expecting something a little more powerful and effective and while engrossing and unforgettable it didn't entirely stir up much in the way of emotions the performances are reasonably a mixed bag but there's a brutal honesty to them all dennis hopper and especially daniel roebuck are crispin glover eccentrically over does it and keanu reeves' dead as wood turn seems to pay off in his custom slacker role joshua john millar is quite good and so is ione skye jim metzler chimes in with a short but highly engaging performance the story is dramatically confronting character laced and harrowing in its eventual breakdown where it infuses a gritty and painful punch jÃ¼rgen swirling music score is simmering with anxiety tension and wonder as the morals and commitments are tested and learnt
<START> this was unusual a modern day film which was ultra nice in fact it was so nice it bordered on being too hard to believe in parts as i watching this based on a real life story i was thinking nobody is this nice this tolerant mainly i was referring to ed harris' role as coach jones i think they went a little overboard on his character but that's better than the reverse showing him worse than what he was in real life odd to see harris playing the role too since he has a long resume of playing nasty profane characters br br anyway i never complain about a nice feel good film and it is nice to see a bunch of well meaning kind people those folks direct their friendship love and compassion to james kennedy better known as radio a mentally slow high school kid played by cuba gooding jr the story takes place in the mid 1970s in south carolina gooding does a nice job with the role too however like sean penn's role of a mentally challenged man in i am sam an hour and a half of a character like this is plenty after that the loudness of those guys gets tiresome to hear br br note it was interesting in one of the documentaries on this dvd to find out that in real life in took years for radio to make his transformation not months as shown in the film
<START> this movie is an almost forgotten gem from 1979 which although in essence a comedy it was based on one of the uk's biggest ever bank heists in fact one of the titles that this film is known by includes caper therefore that in its self is an indication of the type of movie a of a bunch of lovable rouges who are not the violent or psychotic types who with cheek an guile pull off the biggest job of their lives to be honest i don't really know too much about the real crime and can't comment if it accurately depicted the events that unfolded or the characters involved br br richard jordan handles himself very well playing pinky green and is very believable as an easy going small time american born crook who seems very comfortable with himself i have to add that sometimes american actors struggle gel well with english actors in a british made film the chemistry is not always there however this is no problem for who fits right in with his role br br it's worth pointing out that jordan himself was probably one of the most underrated actors of the 70's and 80's and never really got the recognition he deserved he seemed to get stuck in supporting roles and b movies not a fair representation of his acting ability he has played a corrupt cop in the friends of eddy coyle a sadistic killer in the mean season in the secret of my success he played a sort of comical gordon character and also in the 1980's equalizer tv show he played a good guy all of this displays the versatility of his acting skills while mixing with the likes of david niven kurt russell edward woodward and robert br br in this movie he effortlessly plays his part as a small time crook with the eye for the ladies and you immediately take to his character and root for him from the beginning you can't help liking green Â Â you see he really did want to go straight but once blackmailed it all seemed too much of an opportunity to pass up and in the end he relished the thought of all that money br br david niven is the boss and calls the shots the police inspector was brilliantly played by richard johnson who typically portrayed a smarmy but thorough london detective who clearly loves his job the other supporting cast don't say too much but looking at them they were all very well known british character actors who often found themselves playing either villains or coppers isn't that ironic sommers oliver tobias do what they have to do and it's good to see gloria graham in a cameo role br br to some viewers particularly americans it would seem ludicrous that somebody with greens record could land a maintenance job at of all things a bank and come and go when he pleases in addition the stunt he pulled at the crown court after sentencing was not as far fetched as it might seem back in the 1960's and 70's security was not as nearly as tight as it is now br br as for the movie itself there are a couple of interesting observations with small time crooks the haul here was too much there have been other movies where this occurs too i e the mat it's not just the disposal or the hiding of the loot but with so many people involved somebody is going to be careless is going to or just simply break once leaned on in addition the authorities come down on very hard on local rouges when such huge robbery is carried out also they say there is no honor amongst thieves but ivan was adamant that pinky got his whack you only had too look at his stare in the dock if looks could kill a look of total betrayal how could he have dobbed them all in after taking care of him you have to ask yourself a question why is it that crooks can be so stupid did green really think that he could sweet talk his way out of suspicion a second time around inspector was not at all fooled by his innocent looking face as well as a well constructed alibi the whole caper reeked of inside job in addition you have to wonder why they leave so many clues a note pad with the safe numbers jotted down travel brochures for overseas trips still leaving his telescope around as well as unusual behavior on the day of the robbery which was out of character br br with some decent but common sense police work insp quickly had the measure of green picked him up and soon had him singing like a canary it just shows how despite well thought out planning things can unravel very quickly there is never a clean getaway for every body some are always going to get nabbed although it's worth pointing out that a lot of the money was never recovered br br all in all an entertaining movie interesting shots of london and england in the late 70's well paced with a great ending i would highly recommend this particularly if you enjoy capers note i recently purchased a dvd of this but the transfer was obviously taken from a vhs tape and is of poor quality therefore do not pay too much for it
<START> anyone who appreciates fine acting and ringing dialogue will love br br this film taken from ronald 'taking harwood it's a funny br br and ultimately excoriating analysis of a relationship between two br br very types albert finney is sublime as the despotic br br shakespearean actor who barely notices the world war raging br br around him so intent is he on the crumbling fortunes of his theatre br br company and his own psychological and emotional breakdown br br tom is matchless as norman the of the title br br whose apparent devotion turns out to be anything but selfless br br really a must see
<START> with a name like 10 commandments you would expect a film to be representative of the account in the bible specifically exodus not so here this is standard procedure with any biblical hallmark made film remember noah that was utter fiction and one of the worst films ever made at least this film had some truth to the original story however who was a major character in this movie half brother of moses is not in the original story other characters were absent not to mention important events were completely eliminated so what you may ask because this should be representative of the actual story otherwise some might and do believe that is the way it actually happened in today's age people get their religion from movies instead of church and reading the bible also it is a great error see revelation 22 18 19 the script is already written why change it other than the account in exodus itself which should be the main focus you have the cecil b demille film to compare it to which is clearly a far better presentation br br the night it first aired my wife was anxious to see it i told her not to get her hopes up because it was a hallmark film she looked puzzled and said why hallmark makes good movies that might be so but they butcher the bible i'm sorry to say that i was correct not just the story but the acting as well with today's technology you should be able to make a wonderful biblical movie i'm still waiting
<START> if you wish to have a truly traumatic experience than this awful motion picture if you may consider to call it that is for you a film worse than the postman sizzle beach u s a batman and robin kazaam fair game well you get my point this film directed by french television sensation patrick sebastien jerry springer with an i q of 25 can truly be considered the worst film ever made i do hope that troma or someone in america would distribute it so that the u s a can experience the french stench at it's worth
