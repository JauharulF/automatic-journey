<START> br br well known comedians meekly admit they wish they could do real satire like bill hicks inbetween these pitiful testimonies we are treated to what an exceptionally talented comedian can achieve when he could otherwise be chasing fame and fortune he didn't get his own talk show but at least he was no one's puppet
<START> this mess starts off with a real tank running over a car intercut with images of a toy tank this is followed by a family driving home from a birthday party without saying anything the unexplained tank and the family take up i swear over 10 minutes of film finally the family sees a car after it has been in a wreck and decides to report it to the proper authorities only to find that the citizens of the town are all hiding in their houses and the cops are hiding in the police station interesting almost when the town folk come out due to the family's presence we learn that both the writer and editor are conspiring to substitute suspense with incomprehensible storytelling techniques in the hopes that the audience's inability to tell what's going on will somehow bring unease upon the audience and it works but not in the way they thought it would i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense not in a fun david lynch sort of way but a sort of i walked in during the middle of a boring conversation sort of way over the course of the next hour we learn that the movie makers try to bore us into being afraid by showing tediously mundane scenes combined with the above mentioned what's going on type scenes br br the plot involves something along the lines of gentle looking old folks putting children into a trance through the power of satan and then bringing them to a party to play with toys and an even more sinister intention and it's up to a group of white men everybody's white in the movie to grab their guns and save the day and a tag a long eye candy woman who whines at the drop of a hat they look for the kidnapped children by looking in random places and yelling the kids' names br br this is a great horror movie for any person who has never seen a horror movie because that person is frightened by the mere thought of satanism paganism or even catholicism due to a lifetime diet of brainwashing from the trinity broadcast network this represents satanism as elderly folks in halloween costumes with candles while at a party in front of an replete with a priest spouting completely made up nonsense about satanists while calling them witches the message that anything that isn't can be all thrown into the same category for easy condemnation br br about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudo satanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words br br highlights include a guy laughing at the idea of little green men for a solid 3 minutes a family staring out of the windows of their car without talking for 10 minutes while listening to elevator muzak a priest studying satanism for 4 minutes with ooh so scary drawings of demons to scare the church lady crowd random shots of dolls random shots of children paint instead of blood at every chance film school level dream sequences introduces unimportant characters who do nothing before they exit sometimes they act as if the nothing that they're doing is a big deal br br the directing is sloppy at best an example of the directing includes a scene at the beginning where a man and woman are kissing and the man pulls away to look lovingly into her eyes and some dark red paint falls on her cheek looking up they see that it's not blood but from a girl's are ice and colored flavored water and would not have produced of the same texture as paint not to mention the fact that her was a bright reddish orange hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing it then cuts to an alternate shot of the man woman and girl and shows that she's standing about four feet away from them so the wouldn't have dripped on the woman even if she'd held her out over the woman's face way to go editor of course the acting is blah the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and br br the director's most offensive technique is to give the actors no motivation and then go out for lunch as the unblinking eye of the camera leers as the actors make fools of themselves br br and finally after all that we get to an ending that would've been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell
<START> this movie was made on a relatively small budget 10 20 million dollars with almost no promotion at all from its distributors i only knew about it because i am a long time jean claude van damme fan and i always check out his latest films in hope that they will be at least watchable and aside from some real turkeys derailed second in command they are this movie has an easy enough plot to follow and van damme gives a good humorous performance through out but the movie owes all of its credit to the fight scenes involving van damme scott adkins and the final one of them together the editing and camera work for most of the film is pretty terrible but isaac florentine can definitely film a good fight scene i too am happy that van damme has been acting better lately in hell wake of death until death but with the good acting came less martial arts in the shepherd van damme proves that he still has it
<START> this is one of the movies having made significant influence on me as a person the sound tracks are best and the performance is excellent just a great movie for ever to time limit just for the entire live you must have in your collection this is one of the movies having made significant influence on me as a person the sound tracks are best and the performance is excellent just a great movie for ever to time limit just for the entire live you must have in your collection this is one of the movies having made significant influence on me as a person the sound tracks are best and the performance is excellent just a great movie for ever to time limit just for the entire live you must have in your collection
<START> leos carax has made 3 great movies boys meet girls sang les amants du pont in fact those films were not that great but it has the violence of youth the beauty of juvenile wilderness carax in these three movies was well aware of what cinema was but he tried to make his own vision of the art without thinking about about all he have seen but using it and melting it into his times x is a very different movie because carax made les amants du pont a of 20 millions dollars a film that has destroyed everything on its way after such a movie you can't do another one in the same point of view so leos carax has to changed and he did the movie isn't as beautiful as its first it's more reasonable no more studio no more dreamed paris carax has entered at last reality it's not clean anymore it's not poetic characters carax have become a romantic in the german sense of it
<START> one of the myths of the early sound era is that they couldn't make westerns because they had trouble recording sound on location in fact it was the financial restrictions of the depression that temporarily killed off the genre at least in the a budget bracket however in the period 1929 1931 before the economic downturn had really kicked in the a western flourished notable examples including the billy the kid and cimarron the big trail was perhaps the biggest of them all Â a gargantuan pioneer western shot in an early widescreen process appropriately titled grandeur thanks to a recent dvd release we now get to see the widescreen version alongside the fullscreen that was shot simultaneously br br the director was raoul walsh a man for whom the spirit of adventure lay in vast outdoor vistas and thus in many ways a perfect choice he makes great use of the wider frame to show off the western landscape at its most breathtaking very typical of walsh are a number of shots towards the beginning such as the one where a woman is chopping firewood most of the screen is tightly filled by the wagons and other clutter but in one corner we see the wilderness stretching out when the wagon train gets going the open plain is gradually revealed to us with wagons pulling away like stage curtains these shots are not so effective in the fullscreen version yet on the wider canvas walsh's expression of the outdoors was never better br br but there's an unfortunate flipside to this when it comes to dialogue scenes walsh's tendency is to place the actors in the middle of the shot as if they were in an imaginary fullscreen box the extra width becomes just that Â extra it may seem logical at first because it means that height wise we see as much of the actors as we would in a fullscreen picture however it makes the players look small and insignificant within the frame while all the background business dominates the shot Â and there is a lot of background business in the big trail when widescreen formats re emerged in the 1950s many directors would make the same mistake before eventually realising that in talkie scenes it is better to frame actors from around the chest up losing some of their height but allowing them to fill the screen br br it's a pity because the big trail is a particularly well balanced and finely scripted effort the romance and revenge subplots are simple but well defined and do not threaten to each other or the pioneer story it could have been a great intimate epic but it loses dramatic weight because every time characters start talking to each other we get distracted by herds of cattle drifting wagons or whatever else is filling every spare inch of frame still walsh's sensitivity to deeply emotional romantic moments is still on display and he manages to make the final scene effective and memorable there are also some nice comedy touches largely courtesy of comical swede el br br the big trail is also notable for being john wayne's first lead role while wayne is another victim of the distant framing in dialogue scenes we do at least see his strong physical presence and hear his warm but assertive vocal delivery he betrays his lack of experience but the potential is clearly there sadly that potential wasn't widely realised at the time and he spent the rest of the decade slumming it in b pictures before he finally hit stardom also appearing in this picture is wayne's buddy and later prolific character actor ward bond he's not credited but you can spot him in a number of scenes most prominently around the 80 minute mark where he is stood to tyrone power's left br br the big trail is a glorious epic that manages to defeat itself as a drama and it was this stupendous scale that would put the western and widescreen to bed for some time and although the 40s and 50s are now regarded as the golden age of the western it was by then a changed genre with stories of individual adventure and heroism in an established west Â no better or worse but of a different form the early talkie period was the end of an era in which westerns could be truly gigantic
<START> five fingers of death started the american kung fu movie craze but i remember seeing it for the first time as king boxer in chinatown nyc without the bad dubbing and few americans i also was fortunate enough to see the american premiere of five fingers of death on times square nyc what a contrast this turned out to be same film but different audiences br br in chinatown this film took on a more serious tone to the viewers it was because of hearing the real voices of the actors in chinese that made this movie more believable chinatown theaters were showing violent kung fu films for years 1972's boxer from beat them all in gore so the action choreography story were the main attraction rival school plots were not overused yet so the storyline seemed fresh every great kung fu film had wonderful dastardly villains you wanted to see get their comeuppance and had them too the star lieh lo was a known actor in chinese theaters the mostly chinese audience enjoyed this film immensely the audience buzz while leaving this film gives the final satisfaction to me br br on times square this film was an action comedy probably unintentionally i enjoyed it here too but for different reasons the crowd was ethnic and quite energetic from the start the movie made you laugh as soon as the audience heard those strange british accents come from those chinese actors the movie turned into a violent and gory cartoon most american audiences saw this kind of gore in a horror film not in an action film the action sequences blew the audience away unfortunately the movie studios saw that they enjoyed it so much that bad dubbing and unnecessary violence became a kung fu flick formula br br i had fun seeing this movie with an american audience but enjoyed it much more in chinatown some films can pass the test of time but the dubbed version of can't the original king boxer is still enjoyable a classic
<START> many people have the irritating habit of dying before completing a vital message thus confusing the hero not to mention the audience br br dr ben mckenna james stewart and his wife jo a former musical star doris day are vacationing in morocco with their son hank christopher olsen when they meet mr and mrs a british couple brenda de and bernard miles they are also befriended by a charming frenchman louis bernard daniel who invites them to dinner but then cancels at the last minute br br the go to a restaurant and end up having their meal with the when they spot louis bernard br br the next day in the market place they are caught in an assassination intrigue while they are wandering in the local market the crowds suddenly scatter to reveal an arab fleeing from his pursuers dr mckenna stands amazed as the arab falls into his arms a knife sticking out of his back br br gulping his last breath the dying man mutters some words and collapses dr mckenna is completely taken aback when the hood falls from his head and he is revealed as bernard in disguise mckenna is left knowing too little but as far as the assassins are concerned too much br br to prevent dr mckenna from revealing what he knows the conspirators kidnap his son as a hostage the film is primarily concerned with the dilemma of to get the little boy back safely the subplot about the assassination is just the setup br br the film is a breathless escapade the death of bernard comes suddenly and points out that death comes when we least expect it br br stewart is charged with emotion as the midwestern doctor accidentally involved in political intrigue his perceptive facial expressions and indignant delivery made him convincingly person we could easily identify with it is his temperament that actually sets the pace for the entire film br br by 1956 the lovely doris day had won increasing esteem as an actress as well as a singer she had been particularly strong opposite james cagney in the ruth biopic 'love me or leave me ' but she was still unsure of her basic thespian talents br br the casting of character actor reggie as the assassin is brilliant the man looks like a menace and his effusive portrayal radiates evil
<START> yes absolutely dreadful and this coming from someone who loves bad movies but there's a limit i enjoy all sorts of horror suspense films and have seen some wonderful work from european film makers is sadly not among those those wonderful pieces of film making the camera work is worse than amateurish not the fashionable shaky mtv cameraman needs ritalin type of camera work so many film makers use to camouflage their lack of talent this is simply bad frame composition and terrible image composition the acting is farcical when it is not entirely two dimensional the dialogues are stilted and unnatural even more so than your usual run of the mill horror suspense film delving into pseudo mysticism i think that what put me off the most was the horribly choreographed fight scenes at the end of the film these were bad to the point of being ludicrous i've seen what a small budget can do and it can do wonders this was just bad film making very very sad
<START> finding the premise intriguing and reading the reviews and being an angel fan i watched this movie it's sexy and original and quite entertaining david boreanaz is keith he's a hunky married man stay at home dad and he feels a little inadequate in his marriage he makes the mistake of penetrating a close circle of teenage girls who are fascinated with the idea of doing it with an older man they'll do anything to get into his bed including beg lie and blackmail but they mostly try to push his buttons the that ensues sends keith reeling and pushes friendships to the edge david boreanaz shows a little skin in this one and he's looking hot yes he plays a sleazy cheat but he shows enough vulnerability and tenderness toward the goofy teens that you end up cheering for him in the end one more thing when someone moans oh yeah oh oh yeah it's hard to see them as a victim of rape
<START> father hood br br i can understand why a lot of people hate this tale of a father kidnapping his two children and carrying them across america but i've seen much worse and when i saw this years ago i didn't think it was particularly awful patrick swayze is the worried father who takes his kids on the run with him for personal reasons and halle berry is the cop chasing them down br br overall a decent way to spend a couple hours of your life you could certainly do worse ever hear of the film pod people br br 1 2 out of br br rated pg 13 for some traumatic scenes adult content matter violence and language
<START> chicago reporter frank quinlan decided to go to iowa to confirm the existence of a so called angel he was not alone his partner huey driscoll and new colleague dorothy winters also joined him when they arrived at the destination they found that the angel michael was quite different from what they expected however frank still persuaded michael to go to chicago with them so an interesting journey began br br although michael did not look like a saint he was a kind and funny angel in fact michael owned irresistible charming for women even due to jealousy of other men he was involved in a riot the climax appeared in the pizza restaurant dorothy sang lively country songs for frank that was just what michael wanted to see but the next day huey 's dog was crashed to death by a running car michael was asked to save it that would be used to verify whether he was a real angel br br andie macdowell shined in this comedy she also showed her singing ability john travolta proved his comedian talent again of cause pulp fiction still was his typical work br br a comedy that will warm your heart 8 10
<START> if you think it's beautiful to be obsessive about who you are in love with then i can imagine giving it a good rating but i cannot imagine that this theme of obsessiveness and having little respect for others such as the way paulie treats the teachers who try to help her is anything you would want to teach your children yes it's also bad the way victoria treated paulie but guess what that's life isn't it a more important lesson to learn how to get past these disappointments and make the best of your life or is falling off the roof a better lesson to teach our children secondly when mary's father didn't show up for the dinner and paulie helped mary release her anger that mary even said she wished he were dead somehow i don't think this is a good message either that you deal with your disappointments through anger
<START> this movie is of interest to the fans of the famous rock group the band in that singer keyboardist richard manuel appears in several scenes it looks to me like the movie might have been shot some years before 75 judging by richard's looks interestingly jones would later act with the band's levon in a considerably better film coal miner's daughter anyway you really need a special reason to this tough to watch art film alas the famously sensitive manuel would commit suicide i've never heard how he ended up in a movie four of the five members of the band would appear in another bad film man outside
<START> this may just be the worst movie of all time never have i seen such horrible film making before in my life its so bad i think i want to go watch barney instead i advise everyone who reads this to write a petition to get this movie off of our film history so we can never hear from it again i give it 1 out of 10
