<START> i couldn't believe the eye candy from start to finish being a fan of movies directed by music video masterminds i am happy to report that the photography in this motion picture is a splendor for the eye to behold there are so many rich full images that are put before me that each and every time that i see this movie i find something new that i had not seen before as with previous movies that i have seen such as blade and mystery men also by former music video directors the use of color to capture one's attention is utilized extremely well though the characters could have been developed better the action and costuming was well worth the price of admission i recommend you buy this one for your dvd collection even if you haven't seen this on the big screen you won't be disappointed i know i wasn't
<START> being a fan of time travel stories i was surprised that there was no 'device' that sent russell johnson's character through time he just appeared in 1865 it was a disappointing part of the episode i enjoyed the premise of the dangers of the future by changing the past other twilight zone episodes about time travel such as no time like the past once upon a time etc were more to my liking because of the uses of time travel perhaps if russell johnson's character had been the same character he played in execution it would have been more acceptable to fans like myself as sci fi fans know no characters really ever have to in time travel episodes all sorts of plot 'twists' can be applied in these types of stories that was the only flaw i could comment on for this episode
<START> this has to be my guilty pleasure i am a huge fan of 80's movies that were designed to entertain and they didn't care if they offended anyone this move has no meat not substance no deep thought provoking scenes just plain old college kids having fun and if a few breasts have to be shown then so be it this movie is for when you just want to relax and not think viva la nudity
<START> talk about marketing the poster home video cover of 'the new broadcasts a half naked male in a wolfe video for those familiar with the gay themed movies Â this broadcasts a must see i loved reading one reviewer from another site stating they had been tricked into seeing a movie are you serious the tagline itself as the word gay the lord gives you eyes yet you cannot that being said despite the number of gay characters stereotyped no less see the lonely gay the aids victim gay and the closeted gay it's more about long term friendship and characters that grow apart in fact if anything there's more here's one for christians to complain about heterosexual couples having sex outside of gasp marriage not to mention backstabbing drinking to excess and drug usage i see this more of a made for tv logo or showtime movie than big screen effort sure i loved the cinematography some of the actors could act and i always love seeing a big group of friends that actually act like they've known each other for a million years but we've see this all before nothing really new here barely an original idea Â hence bringing back the same i have aids let's deal with that for a good portion of the movie and boy our friend has a serious drug problem but let's not deal with that until it's almost too late that's so us as folk' and 'broken hearts club ' respectfully the film deals with a group of college buddies now grown in size not minds who have to eventually grow up and each trying their best while failing strangely as in most of these independent movies the most interesting to me at least was the heavier set one ben he stole each scene but again there wasn't much to take
<START> a new guard in in the armored truck gig is recruited by his co workers to steal 42 million from the truck no bad guys so no one will get hurt right of course things go wrong and the new guard decides to have a conscience and make things right by saving the life of a dying man br br i'll admit that i didn't really have any interest in this film but i didn't have any interest in fantastic mr fox either and that film made my top ten of the year armored is even more of a disappointment then i thought it would be as a heist film it fails to deliver the goods it's boring and full of plot holes and leaps in logic that one will hurt themselves thinking about it br br despite this the film somehow has a really great cast but the film doesn't even use this to it's advantage everyone seems wasted in wooden characters that make stupid choices columbus short is an uninteresting lead that is never charismatic and never makes the audience want to give a crap matt dillon is the mastermind behind the heist and he plays mr nice guy at first then when things don't go his way he quickly becomes the villain the rest of the impressive cast include lawrence jean reno skeet ulrich fred ward from prison break and milo ventimiglia from heros non of them do much and when they actually do something it's without much reasoning behind it br br the film is relatively short but even with it's running time under 90 minutes it felt dragged out how long can you make a movie about a guy trapped somewhere phonebooth did a decent job and it was even more restricted the leaps of logic concerning the plot here are tragic 42 million and all the security they have are check ins every hour or so the entire plan from my understanding was to drive the trucks into an abandoned warehouse and hide the money pretend to get hit and burn the trucks they would then walk away with the money of course something goes wrong or there would be no movie right through a series of unfortunate events out so called hero has trapped himself inside the truck with an injured officer the rest of the movie is dillion and his crew banging on the doors to get in how very exciting br br the script calls for our hero to have financial problems he might lose his house which would in turn make him lose his brother you see both their parents died and it's just the two of them looking out for each other so now he has a reason to join the heist at first he didn't want in but his money problems is just the right push to throw him in the thick of things how convenient br br whole spin on the heist genre is that it's from an armored truck from the guys who drive it after that basic premise the film falls flat on it's face i found myself wanting it to end sooner and sooner each time someone spoke speaking of the ending it sucks br br skip it
<START> extremely funny more gags in each one of these episodes than in ten years of friends and with a good ie funny not the fab only casted oj simpson in the movies when will these episodes emerge on dvd
<START> this is a gem as a film four production the anticipated quality was indeed delivered shot with great style that reminded me some errol morris films well arranged and simply gripping it's long yet horrifying to the point it's excruciating we know something bad happened one can guess by the lack of participation of a person in the interviews but we are compelled to see it a bit like a car accident in slow motion the story spans most conceivable aspects and unlike some documentaries did not try and refrain from showing the grimmer sides of the stories as also dealing with the guilt of the people don left behind him wondering why they didn't stop him in time it took me a few hours to get out of the melancholy that gripped me after seeing this very well made documentary
<START> this is one of those films that for whatever reason just clicked with me everything about it is right eric roberts laconic nice investigator his voiceover narration the twisting plot dan hedaya and denis given good roles the settings the paintings in the artist studio scenes the end credit sequence and the wonderfully haunting theme music that perfectly encapsulates the mood of the whole film if i have any reservations it is about beverly d'angelo as the femme fatale but she plays her final scenes beautifully i think that director matthew chapman was trying for a sort of feel to the whole thing it didnt work but as a murder mystery its a gem
<START> without doubt this is the worst movie i've ever seen br br poor acting poor script poor direction and poor production br br why did they even bother this entire movie was total nonsense suspension of disbelief can only carry so far but this pushes the limits completely br br for a movie with no humour content the audience laughed disturbingly often
<START> i love this movie br br this beautiful charming love story drew me in immediately with its lovable characters and heart warming romance i became so attached to the characters throughout the film that i felt as if i knew them personally the storyline is very enchanting and it brought me to tears in several touching moments duchovny and driver have a very cute chaste relationship that you can't help getting involved in this one's worth watching more than once and showing to all your friends i'm just curious why wasn't this a big hit br br i give this a 10 out of 10 spectacular film and this is coming from a guy who thinks that 9 out of 10 movies aren't even worth watching
<START> victor was quite the master in this film having starred in it directed it and even wrote the screenplay that's pretty amazing while today few have any idea who was he might be familiar to ingmar bergman fans as the star one of bergman's most acclaimed films wild strawberries br br as far as this film goes it's a very mixed bag on one hand you have to respect it because for 1921 it's a very good film the idea of the grim reaper sitting down with a dead man to discuss his wasted life is pretty imaginative plus the special effect of the phantom carriage is pretty convincing and technically speaking this is a well crafted film on the other hand it's an amazingly dated and preachy film more like something you'd expect to be shown in sunday school instead of in an honest to goodness theater plus some of the story elements just don't make sense instead of coming off as dedicated or good the dying salvation army worker seems like a sap a very sad and confusing sap why is she in love with this man am i missing something br br so my recommendation is that if you are insanely in love with silents like me then by all means watch it but if you aren't a silent fan this film might do nothing to convince you that this style film is brilliant because the story is so overly melodramatic and dated
<START> there is nothing at all redeeming about this film it is very bad and not in such a way that it is even remotely funny horrible plot acting and writing and incredibly cheap production values to boot this film makes the look like a work of art
<START> this was a movie that at the end i thought now that was an enjoyable 2 hours i hate spending around 20 not including baby sitting for my husband and myself to have that it was ok feeling br br i think i like will smith better as a comedic actor than an action hero he was well cast in this his character was very likable as was kevin james' br br there were several laugh out loud scenes it's also a romantic movie so guys if you want to impress the lady in your life take her to this women will like it as much as any chick flick but i wouldn't categorize this as one there is plenty of guy humor in it for men to enjoy i think that's one of the reasons why this movie is so perfect as a date movie it has romance and slapstick i don't usually like slapstick that much but it wasn't overdone and i can't think of any those scenes that didn't deliver laughs br br i definitely recommend this movie the first thing my husband said to me after it was over was i want to see it again
<START> i just saw this movie in a sneak preview and before reading my comment you have to know that it is very subjective because i love techno trance club house and music like that br br the movie deals with carl whose brother jason or whatever his name was died in an accident he fell off a rooftop drunk carl meets his brother's girlfriend sunny and the two of them quite unmotivated some kind of private investigation about jason's death and carl gets involved in jason's ex life that was filled with clubs and drugs the movie itself seen from an artistic point of view is nothing more than a big pile of s t the plot is predictable all of the characters are extremely cliched and two dimensional stupid boy from a small town young good looking innocent girl big bad drug king the list is endless and most of the acting such as the plot are just not credible matthew rhys' performance of the stupid boy coming to big london and sudden taking drugs from people he does not even know does not seem very credible unlike his female counterpart sunny performed by sienna whose behaviour seems more realistic to the spectator nothing more than a joke was tim performance of the drug king damian a phony caricature too eeeevil and just too ridiculous to be true br br but if you like club music the club scenes such as the selected tracks are simply brilliant if you enjoy a simple with a sweet girl like sunny yes i confess i lost my heart that makes my comment even more subjective i guess with some predictable twists and turns you will definetely enjoy this movie br br anybody else f o r g e t i t br br 3 out of 10 objective view br br 7 out of 10 my personal view and also my final vote
<START> the video box for says starring second generation superstars and one can't help but feel sad granted melanie griffith has gone on to bigger and better things but who cares about the rest of the cast so with that being the pathetic attention grabber on the box i was foolish enough to purchase the film for a dollar thinking i would be in the land of 'so bad they're good 70's films' eh not so much while so many aimless 70's youth films or plain ol' 70's films for that matter tried so hard to say something deep and meaningful doesn't even try it's just aimless it is devoid of any interest whatsoever each character is so poorly conceived that it's no wonder these actors look so listless br br in a nutshell the movie is about three 20 somethings who go to alaska to start a business but instead get robbed and then have to find work they get beat up eat dog food steal cars rob banks it's all very typical but on top of that it's executed in the most mundane way possible there are no surprises and the flow is so bad and the actions of the characters so ambiguous that you can miss several scenes and not mind at all br br but if you're a fan of melanie griffith's breasts then this is a must see that's still not enough to get this above the lowest rating i can give br br best line jesus everything is biology with you out of
