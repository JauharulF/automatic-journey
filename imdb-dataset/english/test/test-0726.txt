<START> i agree that this film is too pretentious and it is not easy to know where it is going i have been teaching literature and film for many years and i find this film to be one of the most over rated according to some of the previous reviews here br br however let me remind you that this is the same director who has di il di mia madre my mother's smile to his credit a gem of a film br br was he trying to outdo fellini's 81 2 here the scene with the dogs which has also been pointed out is absurd and excessive Â just one example others would take too much space and some reviewers have already noted them br br overall a most frustrating and annoying experience
<START> yes it's flipper but writer director alan shapiro has put together a gem of a version spectacular above and underwater photography from jaws veteran bill butler and haunting music by joel and crosby stills nash make this truly memorable family entertainment shapiro whose last film was improbably the crush shows himself once again to be an extremely talented and versatile filmmaker rent it
<START> are you kidding me this is quite possibly the worst amateur movie i've ever seen the casting was horrible the acting was worse than horrible and i'm sorry the guy at the picnic speed loading his plate full of food was somewhere near pointless and the demonic turd and chamber pot chasing drew around was nothing more than comical when i herd about the bell witch i wanted to believe i read some literature on it and thought it sounded like it was possible a plausible story but this movie just destroyed that ric white director writer lead actor etc takes himself a bit too seriously and i think he gives himself a little more credit than he deserves do yourself a favor skip this one
<START> it's not hard to imagine what the main problem for a screenwriter is who wants to have 18 equally well written characters with about the same amount of screen time in a movie that last around 90 minutes it's almost impossible not to fall back on stereotypes and that is also what writer director ralf does here very few of the characters can be recognized as people that you and me know in real life many of them are just characterized with two or three attributes and stay vague i am aware of that but still think that is successful namely that it accomplishes just what it wants to it is a film with very well written dialogue extremely good acting and a film that made me laugh out loud really often i don't think that this film wants to make a deep going analysis of loneliness in our modern society or that it wants to be moral commentary on speed dating it's a movie about something that exists and people and their motivation to use it funny and entertaining
<START> this movie really left me thinking but not about the plot the direction the characters an underlying message or a clever script far from it i was left wondering what in sam hill went wrong behind the scenes clearly something was badly amiss from the beginning br br i'm amazed at the positive comments for the movie and for jodie foster's performance from the get go it was clear that foster had phoned this one in one earlier comment even made a favorable mention of her facial expressions i must have been watching a different movie since ms foster usually a personal favorite seemed to be totally disinterested br br in one of his first scenes with foster fred ward looks as though he also is distracted by her lack of energy and he struggles to deliver his own lines with any enthusiasm by the time he's called upon to take part in a supposedly desperate search for runaway foster ward also seems to have become embarrassingly half hearted about the project br br in my opinion dennis hopper has always been a uni dimensional performer so i wasn't expecting much from him and he delivered br br yes this one left me thinking long after it ended the fact that joe pesci and charlie sheen refused to have their names attached to the project suggests that this was a real stinker for everyone involved but to then learn that the director preferred to hide behind a pseudonym speaks volumes br br but why listen to me i always think foster looks ridiculous in a dress yet she's sensational in lacy underwear
<START> mighty like a moose is one of many short films director leo mccarey did starring charley chase what a dandy it is charlie and his wife both undergo plastic surgery to improve their hideous appearances unbeknown est to each other they then meet at a party and become smitten with each other now they can't allow each other to find out they're cheating that's the preposterous premise of this frantic farce vivien oakland one of the few comic short leads to have a flourishing career long after the silents is perfect as long of nose wife charley has an awful case of buck teeth which are quickly dispatched at the dentist's after a party is raided by police for no other reason then to practice raids charley and his wife frantically try avoiding each other at home for fear the alterations in appearances become known both have been photographed with their new features at the party the hilarity back home culminates in charley trying to teach the no good nick cheating with his wife a lesson the no good nick of course is the new charley which his wife comes to realize long before charley teaches a lesson in faithfulness this is one of charley chase's better efforts of 4 stars
<START> just saw the film tonight in a preview and it's a film for kids only it does not improve or add to the original disney film in any way there is a corny scottish pastiche style throughout not helped by weak writing where motives are lumped in by the and acting that is uneven and often unengaging despite what reads like a decent cast i have no problem with the wee dog although there is a certain skippy the bush kangaroo see below quality about his shots br br for those that don't know skippy was an australian kids' tv series from the 1960s where the kangaroo would be an essential part of all the stories it is said that to get poor old skippy to act they stuck an elastic band round his muzzle that he then tried to get off with his paws sort of appearing to be communicating with the human actors bobby has a similar range and you just don't buy his series of heroic rescues at all br br advice would be to take kids aged 8 12 below that they might be scared above that if they or you love it good luck to you but this is strictly cardboard cut out film making for the undemanding it's a missed opportunity since there is real pathos and cuteness in the story of bobby and this film fails to deliver it
<START> this movie is a gem it is the story of juliette a perfectly ordinary cleaning woman who works in the large corporate office of a yogurt company and the president of same he takes no notice of her he takes no notice of anyone until several plots to wrest his company away from him all hit at the same time he is lost no one to turn to and no one to trust when he discovers juliette as the cleaning woman no one pays any attention to her so they say and do incriminating things in front of her that she is smart enough to catch on to and use to help her helpless and hapless boss br br i have been keeping an eye out for years for the dvd of this and to see a previous comment about it being released in sep 2007 raised my hopes alas i cannot find a dvd does anyone know if there is was one
<START> when me and my gf went to see this film we didn't know what to expect however she assured me that it had good reviews so i went along with it we got into the cinema and bought tickets and went into the screen after a while of sitting there waiting for the film to start no one else walked through the door i was very suspicious as you usually get at least a couple of more people in any film screening the film began eventually and we sat there after a while of very little dialogue and very arty type moody scenes i was starting to realise why we were the only people there it was disjointed with random cuts from the main story to kids in a skate park the story it's self made no sense the kid was meant to have committed a crime when he didn't and if he did writing a letter to no one is not an answer and you shouldn't feel not guilty just because you wrote that letter he should have been punished there was no point to this film at all i have no idea why we didn't go and get our money back part of the way through the film i tried to give it a chance i guess there was little concept to this film and the execution was disgraceful the writer and director and just about everyone else who made this film should have realised what they were doing and stopped it is an hour plus that i will never ever ever get back i'm sorry to anyone who liked this film but it's just so so awful i mean really really really bad oh well at least i never have to be subjected to it again
<START> would a different translation have made it or scarier are the subtitles too compact to convey the nuances of the original language does it even matter you may have heard that great actors can make reading a phone book exciting well this is an opportunity to judge for yourself br br if this isn't about homosexuality murder dismemberment psychopaths insanity deviant psychology then it is about acting acting helped along with lots of dialog so enjoy the acting or muse about how titillating the dialog actually is br br for english speakers twelve angry men might be a better choice there's a bit more interaction and you can judge if the acting is consistent with the dialog you don't have to wonder if you're missing something br br i would recommend andy warhol's empire to those who like this film
<START> a good x evil film with tastes of james bond romeo and juliet and maybe even star wars br br the evil count von bruno receives an english gentleman as a guest for a very dangerous hunt elga the beautiful simple and well intentioned lady that was forced to marry the count provides the love triangle the count missing eye points to a terrible past the englishman is not what the count thinks and is a terrible treat to him there is also the terrible hunchback crocodiles and even the side appearance of some torture instruments br br boris here in a support role makes an strong but somewhat stiff presence the other actors and direction are the symbol of an era the strong representations of black and white movies since the beginning there is no doubt of who is the evil guy who is the good one even traitors and stiffs can be identified somewhat easily
<START> lame is really the best way to describe this movie it has a real poor script uninteresting dialog and characters and it's lacking in basically everything else as well br br there are too many characters and problem is that you don't care about any of them what the movie is lacking is one good and clear main character instead now the movie has a bit of everything it has a bit of an hero it has a bit of a love interest and it has a bit of villain i wish it only had a bit less ghoulies though fore they are just mostly very annoying in this movie br br ghoulies are supposed to be devilish creatures who murder for pleasure in this movie however all they want to do is drink beer and watch naked college girls besides someone had the idea to let the ghoulies be able to talk this time this works out really poorly and annoying the ghoulie puppets had been definitely upgraded for this movie and they are more detailed looking and are able to do more however at the same time they are way more fake looking than the ones from the previous ghoulies movies br br it's obvious that the aim for this movie was more comedy than horror this time the movie is like a lame '80's high school comedy even though this movie got released in 1991 it's humor is really the worst and most lame thing about the entire movie it's so incredibly annoying and simply not funny at all br br the story is not going anywhere with its story and the movie is just basically one big mess that never seems to end the ghoulies plot line seems basically to have nothing to do at all with the other plot lines of the movie involving the human characters the movie is not at all about the ghoulies terrorizing a college with the humans trying to hunt them down and stop their rampage no big surprise that this is brent only written movie as of yet he simply has no talent for it and i think that he has discovered this as well and has gone back to college himself instead br br even when compared to the previous ghoulies movies this movie is just simply terrible br br 2 10
<START> i don't dislike cary grant but i've found his performances annoying in enough films to notice this arsenic old lace and bringing up baby i don't dislike him in north by northwest but i really find that movie unbearably silly on top of that i find the endless raving about grant's class tiresome i don't have a clue what his class does for the viewers who herald it it doesn't do a thing for me br br in the behind the scenes feature included with this dvd hitchcock says that grant was her fathers favorite leading man i think he was wrong jimmy stewart was a better leading man in a string of better hitchcock movies br br with it's ruined ending this is really half a movie and doesn't bear discussion and can't support the high ratings it's getting even if the movie had it's ending intact there's not much to it fontaine is a completely unsympathetic sucker she has to remain numb and unwilling to contact anyone but johnny for the whole movie in either ending for his ploys to work that's not much to work with cary grant begins every line with until i wanted to strangle him he says it about sixty times it's positively grating hitch's technique here is shockingly shallow an endless succession of rooms sets have a phony skylight projected on the rear wall as a effect and a light bulb in a glass of milk may make fans excited but it can't save a movie this poorly made br br peter bogdanovich should retire if he does one more hitchcock cary grant imitation on a dvd i think that's his whole career now as soon as i saw him i thought oh crap here comes an imitation that only he's impressed with instead there were two oh joy
<START> don't waste your time the plot drags the characters are wooden and uninteresting the motivations of their actions are completely indecipherable kept waiting for the romantic or comedy to occur and nothing happened worse yet the love letter isn't even romantic but sounds like it was written by someone desperate to make a deadline did i mention that the plot twist which we saw coming from 15 mins into the movie was hollywood clever meaning it is intended to shock but given the hollywood mentality does nothing of the sort and instead is vaguely offensive br br it's not even worth the 2 to rent don't bother seeing it
<START> hi i have to say you got some wrong information about the series here the main author was richard carpenter he created the series later on there were some other authors but they only did a few episodes br br the first director who did most of the series i think complete series 1 was ian sharp who created the distinct look of robin of sherwood br br did indeed see some of the material and they read the i know this for sure because richard carpenter told it on a con in england last year br br i think this is a masterpiece of television entertainment because it has great characters and cast good costumes and great story lines for me still one of the best tv series ever
