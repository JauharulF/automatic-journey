<START> was unlucky enough to see this while travelling by coach across africa it was far and away the worst film i have ever come across deserves to be the 1 all time worst no acting no plot very little speaking lots of ape like grunting though in this hopelessly unlikely film an unwitting self satire you'll either laugh at it or cry
<START> for all its wonderful images for all of its good intentions this just comes off as yet another disgustingly one sided over glorified self promoting propaganda br br the message is simple all japanese fighting on the track were sadistic malicious f sticks who enjoyed gutting every last aussie troop cutting their throats before beheading them not only does pick up on gallipoli 's only flaw that the enemy are faceless nameless and apparently inhumane but manages to prove quite the opposite to weir's masterpiece instead of giving us a perfect film with one flaw we have a horrible mess with one redeeming feature br br let's start off with this we're without any comfortable adapting to the characters introduced to these apparently quite laid back two dimensional people who we never ever get to sympathize with we're kept at such a distance that even when we could so easily relate to the characters they find a way to keep us away that alone is a sickening feature as it drives us from the very plot helps the horrible pacing to leave us with a lasting impression and makes it so much easier to see the contrast between an overtly sentimental ending and an otherwise lackluster body of a film br br in other words it drags us through a painful journey not just for us but apparently for them and just as it should end we're thrown into another eye roller of a skirmish that ends faster than it began so for the as yet still uninformed when it should end it starts up again only to end when we expect more s it's just a confusing and agonizing pace br br which brings me to the ultimatum this is meant to educate us on the events of the track it doesn't come close not only does it detail a very small insignificant part of the campaign sprinkling a little on top in an attempt to make it relevant but it succeeds in doing the one thing a film as important as this should be does it makes us not care br br honestly my eyes were constantly glued to my watch the entire time the audience around me all proudly australian bickering as they came in about how great the film is going to be groaned moaned and whined in disappointment as every one of the painful ninety five minutes droned on for a short running time it felt like apocalypse now difference being that apocalypse now was a good film and deserved the three hours it got and on to the point where suicide could wholeheartedly be an alternative should it be mandatory for this film to be watched br br though considering how much the tv has been advertising this trash i'd say it is mandatory in a subliminal sense of the word br br watch if you like pretty images though you'd do better watching the constant gardener or gallipoli anyway since they have superior cinematography and actual plots br br overall
<START> i loved this show i used to actually leave the pub ten minutes before closing and run down the road to catch it i remember daniel sketch about gandhi in the as a masterpiece the set design and lighting were out of this world creating an atmosphere that you felt you were actually living in v unusual for a comedy br br unfortunately i have only encountered one other person apart from the other reviewer here who ever knew that this programme existed in fact i have to thank the imdb for coming into existence and proving to me that i hadn't in fact imagined the whole series in a drunken haze which i was seriously starting to believe
<START> oh my god i am lost now i know everything this guy does is pointless r j a wrote at august 13th 2006 posting no what an awful experience it looked like a bunch of 3rd graders stole a video camera borrowed some old editing software from 1995 and played a joke on each other trash wrote at august 1st 2006 posting no 747 this movie is a piece of it sucks calling this a movie would be misleading this was a group of friends having a good time and videotaping one another the storyline was very hard to follow the attempted artistic camera angles detracted from the story and in to themselves made the entire time a dizzying experience the acting although comical was very amateurish the concept is ok i guess perhaps next time the producers should raise some capital and hire actual professionals and try again i must say that i'm sick and tired of so many thinking that making a good movie is easy it is not easy this fact seems to be lost or ignored by many that believe that without any training experience and talent that they can make a good product i guess in the end they will learn just how difficult it is i am so disgusted i have no comment wrote at august 5th 2006 posting no
<START> i love this movie br br yes the main character lies but that's why it's called big fat liar even though this kid runs away to hollywood it doesn't give kids the idea that they can besides he doesn't just do it for fun or to get away from anything he does it to regain trust br br i don't think it was just one big ad for universal studios because i liked how it gave an inside view of what it's like for kids who don't know how cool movie making is br br it has good music and fun characters this family comedy is totally fun for kids and parents alike it has humour excitement and real life difficulties like lying br br in the end big fat liar sends out a moral don't expect lying to be easy
<START> i'm not going to ramble on about it but i'm just going to make it brief basically for those who don't know how actually died the first time round the demonic assassin comes hit piper and with an energy ball they fly through the wall blood everywhere phoebe the third sister comes down the stairs says the spell which send him away but not vanquished needs the power of three leo comes heals them both and so on they get exposed along the line and the only way the can be saved is for a demon named to turn back time the only way he can do that is is phoebe stays in the underworld she agrees turns back time it now around 7 00 in the morning again demon comes piper and with energy ball they fly through wall again but this time phoebe isn't there to say the spell to fend demon off demon kills doctor doctor flies through window he is dead demon goes in a whirl wing type thing and glass on the doors shatter which is a great effect bye the way and there is and airy sound thats where it ends now what the whole world doesn't know if they didn't pay attention to the next episode although what i'm about to say wasn't shown its what happens trust me because this time there was no phoebe to call for leo this time he arrives later piper survives because her injuries wern't as fatal as and leo heals her first before so by that time is already dead there mystery solved ps calling for with a spell should have worked and she should have made a surprise appearance in the last ever episode ok i did ramble on
<START> i have never really been interested in cannibal movies before and up until a couple of months ago i had avoided this genre of movie br br i recently had to undergo knee surgery and found i had a lot of time on my hands as i was unable to work so i decided after seeing almost every horror movie our local video shop had to offer i would take a chance on this br br christ was it a mistake i have never seen a movie this bad in all my years of being a movie addict this is just a pile of s t pasted to a d v d disc and sold as a horror movie br br i have a lot of respect to other horror fans who can switch their brains off long enough to enjoy this crap they are more brain dead than i ever will be and that is some achievement 0 10 and thats generous
<START> when the first trailer for this film was viewed by myself i was curious as to what angle the storyline would take after all the plot of having one's childhood self return to the present leaves open many options bruce willis however does a superb job in the role he was given i was surprised to see just how well he could act in this part this is also a good career move as many others have said but after seeing it i now agree this film is mainly about remembering the kid you used to be and coming to the realization that you aren't the adult you planned to be this is a wonderful story and a gripping tale that makes us all think usually we scorn at what if movies for example waterworld attempted to answer the question what if the world were to be covered with water and but truthfully nobody cared this movie however effects everyone in the theatre true young children may not fully grasp the idea of growing up and having all your dreams fizzle away but it leaves a great impact on the adults and parents of those children this movie is definitely worth seeing although it will be better the second time around because you won't be thinking so much about how the kid got there and why and all that stuff just relax and have fun and take something with you when you leave that cinema take that piece of your childhood you've forgotten and enjoy it
<START> i've only seen about a half dozen films starring lino ventura but this one seems very much like the others he plays a laconic criminal one who is short on words and subdued yet occasionally explosive given his quiet persona in such films as army of shadows and second breath i've noticed that his minimalist style of acting is extremely effective in other words because he is so quiet and mannered when he does bad things you tend to notice and like these other films he also has a very strong though twisted moral code br br abel ventura and his partner are both living in italy and are career criminals both grew up in france and eventually had to flea due to their criminal activities now in italy as the film begins they continue to live the life of thugs and the heat is on to catch them oddly instead of running to yet a third country they decide to go back to france even though has been tried and convicted in and if he's caught it could mean a life in prison or the death penalty much of the first third of the film concerns their covert return br br unfortunately for the return doesn't go perfectly and now it seems as if every cop in france is looking for him additionally the reaction of his old compatriots in crime is not at all what he'd expect in fact their tepid response to his return ends up unleashing a series of terrible events towards the end of the film br br along the way meets and is taken in my a stranger eric stark jean paul belmondo despite seemingly having no friends stark and his lady friend try their best to make his return successful what throws another monkey wrench into this though is two very young sons what is to do with them keep them with him in his hiding place br br overall this is a very good crime film sort of like french film noir unlike american noir the many french versions i have seen have a more realistic as well as bleak outlook to them fatalism reigns supreme that's for sure the acting is first rate especially from ventura and belmondo the direction very sure and the writing very nice though i am sure many won't like the ending it just seems to be tacked on like an afterthought i understood why they did it this way but can also see how it might leave many unsatisfied as for me it did leave me a tad flat otherwise an exceptional film
<START> this film brought back a lot of good memories and really works to give a good buzz there was no pc message and the film is all about having a good time which is all there really is to it when people go out clubbing
<START> terribly disappointed with city of men after being swept away by city of god lost is the exciting and unpredictable storyline and instead in its place is bland predictability with the obvious attempts at audience manipulation by a superficial pretentious production and distribution team this story ended up feeling like a sappy soap opera rather than a gritty indie feature which is what is should have been this is what happens when distributors try to seek a wider audience ridiculous sweeping shots of the rio coastline etc at the expense of a gripping story and characters i really couldn't care what happened to any of the characters in this film they were all so 2 dimensional in short sad waste of potential that should have been a slam dunk following the exceptionally inspired city of god boo
<START> skilled professionals live it up in an exotic and dangerous location they get drunk every night they smuggle opium they drop pigs in they fly under impossibly hazardous conditions they dress weird and act weirder they're iconoclastic outrageous they violate every rule of command and have contempt for their employers at the cia they're irreplaceable br br nope it's not only angels have wings and it's not m a s h it's an uneasy mixture of the two that unfortunately comes across as more silly than funny br br it aims at shock amusement and education but doesn't really achieve its goals br br as far as its shock value is concerned well we're by now aren't we does it really shock anyone that a bunch of hard living pilots flew secret missions in in the 1970s no it's not shocking it's not even educational now under our current circumstances when it would be interesting to learn that some paramilitary excursion was not buried in a file labeled national interest defense de that's okay so we've been wised up a little and are no longer neither so nor so dumb br br the problem in this case is that the film depends on those very qualities for its power to amuse without that the film implodes a group of shaggy drunken cia pilots are sitting around in a cat house the girls shooting out the lights with a silenced pistol killing lizards with same asks newbie pilot robert downey jr when you guys act like this does it mean there's something to celebrate replies another guffawing no it means it's night time that might be funny if we expected renegade pilots to be as upright as the rest of us if we don't the gag like the movie falls flat br br there are action scenes naturally everything that can possibly happen in or to an airplane in flight happens in or to an airplane in flight people fall out of them baggage is thrown haphazardly out of their hatches engines fail they sustain damage from aaa the are torn apart during crash landings but we've seen most of this elsewhere often done better br br some might find this funnier than i did and the acting is pretty good robert downey jr is especially effective as the straight man check out the other comments and if they describe a film that you might find appealing then by all means watch it there might be some laughs in it that escaped me
<START> i'm sorry but i cannot understand what people were smoking when they wrote how great they thought ethan mao was i have seen better acting character and plot development in pornos warning i am going to give away a key element to the plot after holding his family hostage overnight ethan lets his vile evil hated step mom go to the bank alone to retrieve the piece of his late mom's jewellery which he so desperately wants guess what she calls the cops wow what a twist i couldn't see that coming at all br br the only good thing about this movie was that it was less than 90 minutes br br pure unadulterated rubbish
<START> to have to actually own up to making such a horrible movie actually i'm more embarrassed that i sat through the whole thing it looks like an old 80's sci fi movie complete with super fake looking special effects queer imagery and very cheesy dialogue maybe that's the way they wanted it to look maybe they think it's cool to do movies in 80's fashion like it will come back in style who knows br br if you think the promised eye candy will save the film you're in for a disappointment the so called babes are manish and downright ugly they can't act at all i don't understand why they couldn't at least get good looking chicks if they want babes with no talent but i guess when you're making a film this stupid you don't get very good choices hot chicks aren't just lining up to do this kind of pitiful crap
<START> the story starts out with a soldier being transported to a desert town then goes back in time to tell the tale of how he came to this place he started out as an officer in napoleon's army fighting in egypt but became separated from his unit after nearly starving and or dying of thirst he came upon a leopard which somehow became his bosom buddy it brought him food and before long the soldier became almost totally wild so acute was his bonding with the animal all things do end however and the man decided it was necessary for him to leave the critter a very strange film well written and portrayed beautiful scenery from jordan and utah which didn't always blend perfectly but who cares
