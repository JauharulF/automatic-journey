<START> the movie started off o k a couple of tourists on vacation in mexico having a good time decide they should go on a hike they uncover some hidden trails and end up and this huge temple like fortress angry villagers show up and try to deter them from climbing it but because of the language barrier people get shot and the tourists end up climbing the stupid thing turns out the plants are evil blood thirsty things that the villagers won't go near so they guard the temple so the tourists can't get off there are a couple of scares in this movie but nothing really makes sense i mean they're plants don't bother buying or renting the d v d wait till it comes out on cable
<START> this movie packs a punch there are a few every now and then that make me think deeply and disturb me a lot i could see myself in this same predicament passively allowing things to happen around me not standing up for the right and decent thing just trying to avoid trouble how often do we avoid making waves or sticking our necks out how often does our inaction condone the evil actions of others we would never join them we tell ourselves we recognize that what they are doing is bad but do we do anything about it br br lawrence newman william h is a low key nerdy office worker who has paid off his home in brooklyn ny in the waning days of world war ii he rarely gets engaged in what is going on around him has never married rarely just goes to work and cares for his invalid mother then a series of events in his very white little neighborhood pull him out of his complacent shell into a maelstrom of events it starts as he witness from his bedroom window the rape of a puerto rican girl by the son of his neighbor soon after he gets glasses because of poor vision as he is now better able to see he becomes less able to deal with the circumstances of his life the one bright spot is a new love in his life and he marries hoping to continue on in his normalcy then the virulent anti semitism on that street catches him despite his credentials as a presbyterian wasp as things spiral further out of control he discovers he must make an important decision does he take a stand or does he simply go away br br i cannot how anybody can view this movie without being affected and having to think very much about themselves and what they really stand for post war anti semitism is the setting here but there is injustice at all times and in all places it is for the individual to decide where he or she stands
<START> dario argento is a filmmaker i'm slowly getting into following the iconoclastic efforts of deep red and suspiria he's not a filmmaker to always care directly about silly things like plot that might be his one minor but for me apparent liability he won't let a little thing like common sense screw up his plan for his elaborate killing sequences as his killer s can go through any kind of elaborate set up of being invisible until revealing past the point of the pov tracking shots of said psychopathic killer but it's thrilling to see a filmmaker take chances like this anyway of a pure italian aesthetic making its way into the soul of a hitchcockian warp in fact as a note of interest if one has recently seen the scorsese short film where he took three pages of an un filmed hitchcock film which also took place in an opera argento had it beat by almost twenty years probably with no knowledge of the text it's also unabashedly 80s cd players and heavy metal and the hair oh my and with an absurdity that makes it all the more palatable to swallow br br the story is simple an opera of macbeth is being produced with high stylized pyrotechnics and trained ravens there's even a talented up and coming star replaced at the last minute betty played by but a murder occurs during the premiere interrupted not by that but by a falling light and now the killer is after betty she can't go to the police how can she let out that the opera is really cursed but will that matter in the face of a killer who won't let up one has probably seen premises like this played out in other argento films girl being chased by a killer but it's how argento like de palma constructs and executes his sequences and adds a distinctive flavor of his own to add touches of bizarre humor the breakout of the ravens to attack the killer and the subsequent version of pointing out in the lineup a kind of over stylization ala leone the bullet through the peephole through the door probably inspired a similar shot in kill bill 1 and even sado masochistic inspiration with the pins taped to betty's eyes more than once br br argento puts his actress through the wringer and she's all game for it even when things seem to just go into 'what the hell' territory i was throwing up my hands almost saying i give up when she is led down the secret passage by the little girl as if suddenly we're in aliens now and through such dark genre material argento keeps the violence thick and fresh the suspense about as much as that with opera music coming right out of a speaker of a stereo system and a cinematographer who may have had a few drinks and rightfully so during some scenes the way they're shot and vibrate to a heart beat it should be considered trash but it's elevated past any limitations of the genre by the ballsy attitude of the director this in spite of a silly ending sillier than anything that preceded what came before it thanks little lizard and an attempt to break the macbeth curse which unfortunately didn't seem to happen in real life on the set of opera 8 5 10
<START> i've seen this movie times now and still can't get sick of it it's like a frickin' drug i know a lot of people don't like it but there's something about it that just draws me in every single performance is spectacular but aaliyah is the one who steals the show she not only played the role of she became it her body movement and beauty was captured exceptionally well it's also nice to see that a black girl was chosen for the role of an egyptian queen no i'm not against white people i am one true it's not known what color the ancient egyptians really were but this was a nice change stuart townsend completely made me forget about tom cruise's of lestat and marguerite was striking once again all in all it was a good time at the movies for those who haven't seen it be sure to watch it with an open mind and not take it too seriously i mean it's a movie about a vampire who becomes a rock star take it as that
<START> it's strange what fate does to some people while looking in the discount bin at a dvd retailer i came across a copy of deadly instincts being a collector of any film that is either sci fi horror or featuring alien monsters i decided to buy it not to mention the fact that it cost five dollars Â a bargain believe me after viewing it i came to the opinion that it was nothing special but after doing some research on the internet i discovered that the film was actually called was a remake of the tim kincaid horror flick that menaced video stores in the mid 1980s which i've already seen my appreciation of deadly instincts grew following that discovery br br a meteorite crashes on the lawn next to a private girls' college the sole teacher there ashley played by todd jensen Â that's right the guy who gets turned into a cyborg in the cult flick cyborg cop four years earlier notices that some of the students are beginning to disappear while encountering a black haired woman with a scarred face wearing a kinky leather outfit his investigation reveals that an alien creature had hitched a ride on the meteorite had come to earth to breed using the local womenfolk along with a local detective who believes him to be responsible for the disappearances ashley tries to stop the monster br br the original directed by tim kincaid who would leave the genre to make gay porn was a sci fi horror film which was actually a thinly veiled soft core porn film designed to take skin flicks to genre fans it is in my belief one of the worst films made in the 1980s why anyone would want to remake it is quite a mystery br br this remake is actually a better effort than its low budget source the film which takes the basic concept of an alien monster trying to interbreed with human women eliminates any pornographic elements in fact the film is actually very tame there are no sex scenes no nudity even during the shower scene swearing violence are kept to a minimal level there is no gore which may cheat gorehounds this makes the remake a film safe for the whole family that is if the kids aren't scared by alien monsters which brings me to the film's m 15 rating which seems a bit much br br of subject matter aside the film does have some faults the script while featuring some good characterizations has a number of holes so big you can crash a meteor through br br what you're mad at me for that come on this review needed a bad pun so it will remain interesting br br anyway the film's setting is one problem the script failed to fix Â the film is set in boston but the buildings don't look like they belong in boston something about the architecture ain't right another thing is the college itself with a rather large building housing about twenty students all female of course only having one class Â art the only teacher there has a relationship with a student so does the janitor which somehow escapes the attention of the principal not to mention the cops who are so one dimensional stupid that the real boston pd would have a good case if they ever decided to sue oh the well the chance that a meteor which is sent from saturn check the opening credits reaches earth with no onboard propulsion is astronomical that doesn't include the chances that any passengers in the meteor will survive the landing br br as far as the acting goes todd jensen gives a dependable performance as the heroic teacher while the late simmons who was murdered by her boyfriend shortly before the film came out cuts a striking figure in that leather outfit as well as proving she can act the visual effects are run of the mill with credits due to the filmmakers for bringing us a cool looking monster
<START> i had the dubious opportunity to view this movie on tv it's the perfect example of how to take a terrible script and turn it into one of the worst films ever made not only is the acting bad and the effects terrible the movie has more logical holes than ten pounds of imported swiss cheese br br i would highly recommend this film as an example of how not to make a movie and what director not to use in one of yours br br i turned off the tv during the last ten hideous minutes of the show calling it pathetic is a gross understatement
<START> the bad dreams always come back again like unwanted friends says marion who with her half sister laura lives in a vast mid victorian country estate and last night i found myself in normally people who are dead stay dead just as normally it is the criminals who are locked up rather than the victims but then there was nothing normal about what happened to us and we're off on a first class gothic story of madness deception and villainy based on wilkie collins' great novel of victorian mystery it's a good idea to pay close attention because there are plots within plots yet they all center on a cunning and ruthless scheme which involves what else money lots of money br br marion tara fitzgerald and her sister laura justine are devoted to each other marion is fierce and protective laura is softer and much more romantic marion has no money of her own laura will inherit riches when she comes of age marion has no marriage prospects that we know of laura has been pledged sometime ago to sir percival james an altogether too charming aristocrat they are the wards of their uncle a fussy condescending immensely self centered hypochondriac ian richardson all seems to be quite routine but then a young artist walter andrew lincoln is engaged to teach them drawing and artistic appreciation and when he arrives at night to the local train station there is no carriage so off he sets out on foot to the estate in the dark woods he encounters a strange woman dressed all in white wandering about and speaking of things he does not understand who then disappears are we uneasy yes and so is he and the sisters when they come to realize the strange woman looks much like laura later does love emerge between walter and laura does a bud bloom is there a misunderstanding that sends walter away and results in laura marrying sir percival does a gnaw and do secrets slowly come to light about the relationships among laura marian and the woman in white do we learn to be deeply suspicious of sir intentions do we come to enjoy the style and manners of sir close friend count simon callow and do we eventually realize the foul depths of depravity as well as the power of honor and true love that humanity is capable of do we visit victorian insane asylums see falls from high towers dig open graves in the middle of the night and watch retribution arrive amidst the roaring flames of a locked church br br well of course and it's a grand journey for us br br this bbc masterpiece theater program features fine acting and outstanding production values to fit collins' 500 plus page novel into a television show of less than 120 minutes means a good deal had to be cut or abridged and some changes were made most likely to achieve greater impact in the little time available still taken on its own terms the production of the woman in white in my opinion works very well as a moody romantic dark television tale tara fitzgerald as marion gives a commanding performance as a woman determined to protect and then save her sister james as sir percival manages the clever feat of slowly letting us see the depraved slime beneath the skin who still has charm amidst the villainy ian richardson as the young women's uncle almost steals the show he gives such a bossy and pungent performance it almost unbalances the story every time he appears perhaps the weakest of the main parts is simon callow as count the count is simply a monster yet a supremely civilized and charming one collins described him as being of immense girth callow does a fine mannered job of it but to me he lacks a little of the monstrosity of evil br br at one point marian tells us my sister and i are so fond of gothic novels we sometimes act as if we were in them little did she know what was in store for herself and laura
<START> the film is excellent one of the most noteworthy things about it is that flynn's performance is superb this is worth stressing as he was often derided as an actor by bette davis et al br br i remember the scene where flynn gets arthur kennedy drunk in order to take him to his doom at the battle of the little big horn the cold calculating look on flynn's face as he does so is extraordinary much better than the much vaunted spencer tracy or many other stars could have done br br the other thing to note is the excellent performance by george p huntley jr as lt queen's own butler it is baffling why he stopped making films shortly afterwards one would have thought that he would have been set up for years after as a character actor
<START> randolph scott and glenn ford were once outlaw pals together but now scott's a sheriff and young ford is still hiring his gun out he gets hired to pull a bank job but is delayed getting to town and those that hired him get someone else that leads to all kinds of complications a lot for a film that's not even 90 minutes long br br randy and glenn both got girls here claire trevor plays her usual good time gal with a heart of gold and evelyn keyes is the daughter of edgar buchanan who falls for ford big time without realizing who he is or why he came to the town that scott is the sheriff in br br it's b western but unusual for the time and for columbia pictures it was given the full technicolor treatment the desperadoes marked glenn ford's first film in technicolor a process reserved only for some of the more expensive films from bigger studios harry cohn was certainly not one to shell out for it and definitely not during war time br br the plot gets a bit convoluted as both ford and scott are put to the test of friendship versus expediency duty the plot also involves some high class hypocritical skunks in randy's town who are the real outlaws as far as the film is concerned br br the four leads do a fine job and the best supporting performance is guinn williams as ford's lovable explosive lunkhead of a sidekick the climax involves a cattle stampede and a shootout in the town saloon and is one of the best ever done in a western film br br fans of the four leads and westerns in general will enjoy this one
<START> by dane youssef br br i was kind of looking forward to this one i enjoy eddie murphy and i love it when a star hand makes a vehicle for themselves or when someone who writes decides to mark their own directorial debut but when the star's head gets too big for the rest of his body there's always a danger of a big budgeted hollywood vanity production br br will the filmmaker keep it realÂ or will he just waste amounts of money the studio's ours and time the studio's ours his own patting himself on the back for an hour in a half sadly it's the latter here br br another thing i really like is when someone breathes new and fresh life into an exhausted and dried out genre none of that here the warring nightclub movies have become so worn through that even the parodies of it are dreary and done to death br br murphy does neither he does the most clichÃ©d he plugs into a routine conventional formula gangster picture and plays it as seriously as if it were the godfather it's like a script where the next draft they put in the jokes and the new ideas but it seems like someone with clout just looked at it and went noÂ this is fine br br probably murphy he is credited all over this in the opening shot of beautiful white satin sheets his name headlines across the credits about five times br br the plot a young orphan saves pryor's life and pryor adopts the little br br 20 years later pryor's dump has become a first class hot spot they're pulling down big money and a gangster wants their action he's even got a dirty cop in his employ but pryor comes up with a scheme a la the sting br br murphy's screenplay plays like an unfinished first draft that nobody had the pair to call him on the actors aren't really allowed to stand out much if at all even the almighty murphy seems to be on auto pilot br br pryor shows class and gentlemanly manners as sugar ray perhaps it would have been better to name his character brown sugar evidence that this one needed a polish but everyone here is basically just on vacation br br the oscar nomination the movie received is richly deserved joe i best costume design but the production values are the only part that makes the '30's feel authentic br br some sets look somewhat fake but this is supposed to be a comedy of sorts it's rare one movie gets nominated for both a razzie and an oscar unless it's one of lucas' new star wars chapters br br it's 1938 and everyone is talking like it's 1988 particularly the comedians this is a prehistoric white man's formula and with all these black comedians and you expect them to skewer the genre or at least bring new life to it nope murphy is pretty much just coasting here br br the great roger ebert summed it up perfectly when he remarked in his review murphy approaches his story more as a costume party in which everybody gets to look great while fumbling through a plot that has not been fresh since at least 1938 br br jasmine guy is perfectly cast and seems to be indulging herself in her role and michael lerner has all the looks evil and mannerisms of the prototypical mob boss down pat and there are moments where pryor gives you an idea of what a more interesting leader and authority figure would sound like he gives every scene he's in a feeling of dignity br br would it have been too much to ask that della resse sing or at least quit embarrassing herself with all her kiss my ass talk br br and the late redd foxx doesn't get to leave much of a swan song here he has some back and forth with resse which could have been some great stuff nope murphy wastes another opportunity again here br br murphy's quick is charismatic and likable but those moments are few and far between for sure murphy has never looked better and never been duller his character made me laugh twice throughout the whole movie br br stan shaw's boxer with a horrible speech impediment isn't just painful and embarrassing it's annoying there's more to comedy than simply showing something unpleasant you have to incorporate some kind of light touch and funny situation watching him strain even the some of the easiest words just makes us feel sorry for him and annoyed with murphy br br can murphy write a screenplay wellÂ there was raw but that was really stand up material he wrote the outline for boomerang and coming to america for sure but her didn't have the last word there maybe a team of er like script doctors could've revived this one br br murphy's direction is so slow and quiet you'd swear he was asleep at the wheel some of the time he has too many static shots and doesn't seem to know how to build and release suspense on some level i think quick is the real eddie murphy angry young hot headed and ambitious but occasionally charming now if he were only funny sometime br br there's a scene in which murphy has a femme fa tale in bed who plans to make love with him and kill him you can probably guess how it turns out like everything else in the movie this could have been better br br surprisingly murphy has not directed another movie since he got a razzie nomination and he no longer writes the finished draft for his films either he won the razzie for writing this br br it's great to look at and the music is beautiful and there are a few really nice scenes but that just falls under the category of gems among all the junk not enough of them br br been been wasn't oh well br br by dane youssef
<START> first off i have been a fan of the show back when my pbs station started showing it back in 1981 i learned many things about the show and the people who were in or contributed to the show br br this latest installment of doctor who made a great impression on me the original series aka classic series was made fun of by the bad special effects and or wobbly sets well this is no more true the special effects are awesome but what is even better is the writing you get a chance to learn more about our beloved doctor and maybe a bit of a reason why he loves the planet earth so much without giving too much away it is a very worthwhile series to watch christopher eccelston brought a side of the doctor that we never get to see a bitter and angry one but yet lovable at the same time br br a must see
<START> when las vegas came out one review described this show as quote a harmless bit of fluff needless to say that after seeing a dozen or so episodes i think this description is right on the money an assortment of pretty boys and strutting model types play out an assortment of paper thin stories while all the time trying to pretend they are serious business people one dimensional characters in a one dimensional setting pursuing one dimensional stories that pretty much sums up vegas i still watch from time to time to see if the show is trying to evolve and take itself a little serious but alas to no avail so far
<START> this is a fabulous film br br the plot is a good yarn and is imaginatively told in a series of flashbacks and alternative points of view what was deliberate and what was coincidence who is in love with who br br you get the chance to put yourselves in the shoes of each of the characters in turn sometimes literally and this helps define each character to a satisfying depth br br with a bit of effort following the twists and turns you can understand each of the characters and key events in the film are reshot from the point of view of different people br br take the opportunity if it comes again to your arthouse cinema it looks good on the big screen br br more than keeping you guessing the plot twists to such an extent that you just sit and watch what unfolds i defy anyone to predict br br but more likely you will need more than one viewing i saw this at the pictures on its original release three times and it got better each time br br the acting was very good with a standout performance by as alice torn in three directions by the three other characters in the ensemble br br a classic the second best film of the 1990s
<START> in today's world of advertising and teenage horror and sensationalism it is very rare that one gets to see a movie and no nothing about it movies like psycho and blair witch while being great in suspense both with great build ups are spoiled by the fact that we know all about the best scenes and at least the plot before we see them with mute witness a rare treat i stumbled upon this film and watched it scared witless in the middle of the night i was scared by the menacing russian ambience the 'snuff' theme and the claustrophobic plight of the mute and the fact that the amusing which always leads to likeable characters could meet the end at any second since this is a low budget and rare film we watch it without any expectations it also has fay ripley in a rare movie role watch and prepare to be excited scared and thrilled in totally unexpected ways
<START> i saw this movie tonight in a preview showing and it was fantastic it does well in portraying issues that the average high school student is subjected to br br i left the movie feeling stunned and saddened and yet grateful that this movie will have a chance to raise awareness through its audiences regarding these issues bullying rape suicide and depression br br its a fantastic aussie film br br go see it br br support it br br learn from it
