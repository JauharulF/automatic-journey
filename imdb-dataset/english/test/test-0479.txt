<START> when nathaniel kahn embarked into this voyage he hardly knew who his father really was by the end of the film he found him and comes to terms with the strange life he lived as a child br br louis kahn was the father he was an architect his designs were perhaps too complex as he tried to create buildings that didn't conform with trends popular at that time it is ironic that he never achieved the fame that came so easy to some of his contemporaries he had a vision and he never strayed from it we can see characteristics of his unique style in the buildings he left behind as a legacy to humanity every one of his creations are unique in that they don't imitate works from other architects br br louis kahn's life was rather complicated he was married yet he had affairs with two of his assistants that produced a girl and a boy besides the legitimate daughter he had with his wife br br as a boy nathaniel kahn's life was lived in a secluded area away from his father who only visited late at night louis kahn never recognized these children although it is very clear they all knew about the others existence br br it is tragic that louis kahn died alone in grand central station when he was returning from a trip without making peace with the women and children he never acknowledged as his own by his side he probably cared a great deal about all his children but he remains an aloof figure throughout the film we never get to know the man although at the end nathaniel in his quest to discover his father's life finds most of the missing pieces of the puzzle br br this is a personal account on the life of an artist thanks to that son who has the courage to tell the story we are almost prying into the lives of louis kahn and his extended family
<START> last night i saw a peck on the cheek with english subtitles oddly it was 137 minutes long slightly longer than the time listed on imdb br br at first i found myself losing interest in this film because the rather confusing style of filming really lost me the context for what was occurring was missing and i am glad i stuck with it at the beginning a young couple is married and shortly after the wedding war breaks out in their native sri lanka and the lovers are separated months later the wife is very pregnant and on board a refugee vessel heading to india at a refugee center you see the lady about to give birth after which the titles to the film finally are revealed br br the entire focus of the film then changes completely to a young girl who is about to turn 9 in madras india you see her in her home and she talks to the camera about her life and family none of this seems that interesting or important and you wonder what is missing what about the lady who was about to give birth my wife and i debated this and we finally guessed that this little girl was actually the child of the lady in the first part of the film somehow or another she had been adopted and was talking about her life with mom and dad 2 though she did not realize these people were not her biological parents br br soon after this the parents revealed themselves to be total idiots one of the complaints i had about the film as they decided to tell this very young girl the truth about her parentage and tell it in a way that left the girl emotionally screwed up and confused despite a stupid decision and telling her in the worst way the parents made up for this by agreeing to help her find her biological mother seeing the impact all this had on the girl and parents particularly the adoptive mother was impressive to watch and sure sparked my interest br br unfortunately sri lanka has been involved in a very very long and brutal civil war with militants off and on for three decades the family's decision to look for the mom back in sri lanka was indeed noble but also a bit stupid at times as they took so many risks and nearly got killed again and again by just blindly jumping into the middle of a war this was all exciting and captivating but also left me wondering about the sanity of the adoptive parents first you tell her she isn't your biological child and now you take her in the middle of a war zone sure the kid really wanted to meet her biological mother but this really was stupid in hind sight if it were me i might have been tempted to pay an unemployed actress to play the part and fool the kid thus avoiding being in the middle of a war br br despite my complaints the film was lovely to watch and was very rewarding far from perfect it sure hits an emotional home run also while i expected this because i have seen several indian films many westerners will be a bit surprised by the vivid songs that seem to come out of no where this is standard in most films from india including those made in bollywood bombay and madras
<START> having read all of sarah waters books i was eagerly looking forward to a bbc adaptation of especially since tipping the velvet had been done so well by old familiar andrew davies br br i was not disappointed with the results in fact i think this might be on a par with both romantic and entertaining and not as so many ignorant people would have you believe a pointless lesbian romp having been a fan of elaine cassidy's since seeing her guileless turn in journey i thought she embodied both hard deception and a growing fragility as maud her transformation was believable and impressive to watch i recognised sally hawkins as zena blake from tipping the velvet a small role primarily so i didn't have as many expectations but she was astounding in the role of sue trinder her eyes were mesmerising conveying everything from rage to absolute despair the two of them acting together combining these talents made this drama unmissable of course imelda staunton was amazing as usual she is unmistakably a national treasure and the supporting cast were all of a high standard even the direction from the fairly unknown aisling walsh used contrasting yet beautiful shades of blue for briar and brown for london br br however as much praise must be given to the script writer to turn a 600 page book where every line is of the highest quality into a three hour extravaganza is a huge feat he illuminated the main revelations at a steady pace whilst giving us plenty of back story and character development at the same time he has my full admiration br br in conclusion a brilliant adaptation where all involved gave 100 and making this one of the best bbc dramas i've seen
<START> while all of the fleischer famous studios superman cartoons are excellent billion dollar limited the third in the series is probably the best of the lot in terms of overall animation plot and pacing why it wasn't even nominated for an oscar as best animated short for 1942 incredibly enough only the first one was in inexplicable br br here lois lane is assigned to cover the transfer of one billion dollars in gold to the u s mint masked gangsters in their super powered for 1942 car take off after the train determined to get that gold without giving too much away what ensues is a thrill ride for both the characters and the audience with truth justice and superman triumphant at the end br br as they did in all the fleischer famous superman cartoons clayton bud collyer and joan alexander who played clark kent superman and lois lane on radio have the voice work honors here and fleischer perennial jack mercer gets a little to do as one of the bad guys as well
<START> this was a bold movie to hit indian cinemas when it was released the first movie to perhaps openly depict lesbian tendencies amongst indian women the leading actress of indian cinema shabana azmi added substance to the movie with her hot passionate scenes with nandita das br br the movie oozed with sexuality and the director used sex in the best way possible the sex was not for erotic purposes but was in the context of the movie the scene where nandita das loses her virginity to her husband certainly was the first of its kind in indian cinemas br br good acting by all the actors especially nandita das amidst criticism from the indian public
<START> there are many things to admire about this film but the thing that got me above all others was the part of an eccentric recluse the sort of role that hollywood loves but which here is absolutely convincing unlike any character i've in film or in life also a very convincing disturbing depiction of syndrome
<START> this film should be called adventures in cinemascope it is like the screenwriter and director the cliff's notes page 3 outline and decided that this would be a great vehicle for a film about the italian alps rock hudson is pretty good here but the dialogue bears no resemblance to hemingway at all this is a made up version of hemingway hecht the screenwriter is a hack watch the 1932 version with gary cooper and helen hayes that is great cinema and was made by someone who understood hemingway and the war in northern italy gary cooper is very very good compared to his performance in for whom the bell tolls where he is stiff as a board and thinks he is in a western br br anyway if you are a hemingway fan do yourself a favor and do not watch this film your best bet is to get the unabridged audio cd and just listen to one of the greatest novels ever written
<START> this one just isn't worth the cost of a movie ticket what these filmmakers have done cannot properly be called filmmaking rather they just chose sixteen students of some diversity though not quite as much diversity as the reviews have suggested and set them loose the results are to be brutally frank far more often boring self indulgent overwrought and off puttingly grainy than truly insightful br br there are of course moments of recognition and identification of the sort only possible in documentary film but overall there's not much more truth here than in bully or for that matter a decent tv documentary of the same sort though full of talk about sex and sexual diversity and racism the film brings nothing to the table that will be of use to anyone who has thought about any of these issues with any seriousness and while certain segments serve absolutely no purpose other than to inject a bit of admittedly welcome comic relief most often the five minute limit keeps up from becoming emotionally involved with any of the students an interesting idea but thumbs down for chain camera
<START> two l a cops track down a serial killer nicknamed the family man who has wiped out whole families and when one of the police officer's wife takes the deep six questions are raised and it turns out that a serial killer isn't responsible but rather mobsters the idea of seagal in a serial killer movie is an interesting concept indeed one could see seagal play a good serial killer however making him a cop who has a ridiculous penchant for prayer beads and razor sharp credit cards comes off more stupid than ridiculous also a running joke involves enjoyment of eating powdered deer penis and well this raunchy material is utterly out of place not to mention the beginning of a school being taken hostage due to a boy's breakup with his girlfriend after seagal him the girlfriend tells the young lad that she loves him now there is a lesson to be learned from all of this if you want your girlfriend back taking the school hostage may get you back on her good side i myself would think flowers or the old fashioned phone call might work then again though i'm old fashioned besides who am i to put a damper on somebody else's brilliant reconciliation plan br br out of 4 bad
<START> first i gotta say that this film is way less pretentious than the da vinci code sure you have the religion vs science problem but it doesn't try to make a big statement about it its basically an action thriller that moves from one scene to another very well one scene particularly that involves fire i found extremely well done br br second the changes from book to film although when i was following the development of the film i complained about the change of some characters and the complete removal of others i gotta admit i was wrong it was refreshing that the film didn't follow the book in exactly the same way like it was done in da vinci if you are a purist of the book some of them may upset you though however the big twist is still there so don't worry about that finally i'm glad they removed some silly sub plots and didn't even try to hint at the possibility of langdon and getting together br br the performances are really good but nothing out of the ordinary that's okay for a film like this br br i'd give it a 9 10 mainly because it delivers what it promises entertainment pure entertainment
<START> valeria an elegant and pretty young lady lives in a world surrounded by the walls of her shyness and depression although she may have a one night lover or if someone lives with her it makes no difference of being completely alone valeria is also a passionate woman who can take actions to approach that special man massimo and at the same time the fear that allows her to answer his questions only with a yes no or i don't know the way to accent the loneliness of the character is magnificent an example would be the distance of both massimo and valeria taking a coffee in the same room separated by subtle divisions and not seeing each other i could mention several sequences however it is better to see the movie it is impressive to watch that not a single detail is out of control by the director although all actions are performed in slow movements no shouts are necessary not special effects but only great acting and a touching well written story i loved it
<START> look at the all the positive user comments of this movie then check to see how often each one posts user comments they post once it seems companies are probably paying for services which post junk pro movie comments on imdb br br this movie was awful the plot was stupid the acting was poor the jokes weren't even funny the movie included minor nudity from what looked like porn actresses but none of the other characters br br it was clear from the first 15 minutes that movie wasn't funny there was some slapstick here and there but most of humor was supposed to be derived from the characters talking behind each other's back and spreading rumors this isn't even done well every joke is obvious and you see it coming br br the movie is worthy of fast forwarding or better yet not watching br br i regret watching this movie and if i could charge the studio and distributor for 1 5 hrs they stole from me i would
<START> i first heard of this movie at the flashback weekend in chicago 2007 for the nightmare on elm street robert englund was really talking the movie up and he was great in his part of hatchet the same can be said for tony todd knowing this is a low budget first time director writer it delivers every bit as much as the big budget and also cameo laden 2007 remake re imagining br br technically it falls short in a couple of places the alligator attack seen was shoot too dark when it happened the dark head of the alligator against the swamp on to the black pants became almost invisible the mood music in the swamp scenes was too loud in volume and canned like a bad sitcom and just like 2007 someone is smart enough to have a gun but of course shooting the killer is only a pause button for the killer the ending well as soon as i saw where it was going i knew what was going to happen not very original br br the highlights of the movie are the characters and their interactions unlike 2007 we got to meet the people and care what happened to them ben joel moore who is also the lead of spiral the sulking lead and marcus not another teen movie as the best friend and funny man to root for during the movie shapiro joel murry dharma greg jenna and misty mercedes mcnab of buffy the vampire slayer the series angel the series and the addams family movies give a convoluted reason for topless women mr and mrs played by television regulars richard grounded for life step by step as the older couple that you know don't stand a chance even the tour guide shawn parry shen is a fleshed out character i hope to see more from all involved in this film but i think it will play better on home video than in the theater sorry
<START> this sequel is brilliant and is the last film donald pleasance dr loomis worked on before his death i loved the new direction the film took with the story instead of just michael myers wanting to kill his family i love this whole series and apart from the first and second movies this is by far the best
<START> at my local video rental store they have a special place for two girls and a guy it's a long running joke really the clerk lets people rent it for free they value their customers too much to let them waste their hard earned money on it br br i was extremely surprised to see that people gave this movie a good review maybe someone can explain it to me or maybe the positive comments were jokes did people involved with the movie write them perhaps the mother of the director writer br br maybe i've just seen so many good movies that this one fails in comparison
