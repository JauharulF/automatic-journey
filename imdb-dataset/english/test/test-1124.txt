<START> i discovered the patriot in a dvd store and thought it could be a real action thriller no itÂ´s instead a low budget movie with a ridiculous story itÂ´s no doubt a cable movie and not one for the theatre fortunately after 90 minutes the movie stops otherwise the audience should have taken an anti virus against sleep one thing came over it was the nice country the film has been shot you can really feel the american air but thatÂ´s all i hope for steven seagal that he finally succeeds in a big hit it is not a must see because i and my wife voted average 4 10
<START> this movie was boring very much like underworld only even less interesting it's not much of a werewolf movie and no where near a horror film the lead couple were boring i totally didn't care about vivian and aiden and there was so little character development that i didn't care about any character in the film the plot was paper thin the transformations were basically nil i did like the wolves themselves might as well have have done a wolf documentary i would have liked that better i wouldn't recommend this movie i didn't find it fun or interesting it just drags and everyone in it is a boring drag this movie could win an award for how not to make a werewolf film
<START> lacks the spielberg touch it's an all out assault on the senses featuring in your face dinosaurs watching this film was a bit like a roller coaster ride from hell br br the script is lame it simultaneously asks and then leaves too many questions unanswered also we don't really get to appreciate the humans in the film for all they're worth for example william h macy is too great a talent to have to compete with dino thugs for our attention and laura dern was especially sympathetic in in this film she's barely a blip on the radar screen br br the whole experience was t o o m u c h too much noise too many surprises too many characters dying off too much predictable gratuitous violence br br word to the wise vote yourself off this island br br i rated it a 3 for special effects i took off the other 7 points for having absolutely no originality
<START> to truly appreciate this film you had to be there acting or have been a crew member br br yes i am selena and at the ripe old age of 42 have serious doubts about what we were doing did br br it all started out to be like a john waters type thing friends acting badly in bad films somewhere along the line the fun discontinued people who were supposed to be friends didn't speak anymore and bad became worse br br i regret the bad image i might have projected try to fit in size one gold spandex pants br br other than that the film sucks so badly i would not even make my mama watch it br br to my director cast and crew i say br br why can't we just all get along br br it's been over twenty years people
<START> like in so many movies of the past you would think hollywood would learn this by now makes for a very disappointing movie not to mention make sure the kidnapped victim is alive first before paying the ransom br br maybe this film wants to remind of these basic facts in case it should ever happen to one of us why the long walk in the woods and can a city guy really go through the woods without getting lost just an opportunity for some sentimental dialog that was meaningless in the end br br i had to listen to part of the director's comments in the special features section from the great moves that redford has made in the past sneakers for one surprised he agreed to star in such a film the director's comments and reasons were weak br br the best parts of this movie was the scenery can't wait for spring to come
<START> i'm a big fan of sleaze and horror movies when you put them together that's my sweet spot horrible sleaze you're not going to get it in this film though br br there is certainly sleaze in the form of girls being kidnapped and tortured tied naked to various things the sleaze isn't very sleazy though it didn't register very high on my sleaze meter mainly because none of the girls were in the least attractive nor did they attempt to act as if they were even threatened they seemed to be thinking more about what was for lunch or maybe when they could score some crack br br forget the effects they were lame in the extreme the lameness was contributed to by the bad acting effects are harder to believe when even the actors and actresses aren't buying into them br br cinematography was pretty bad they could have hired a couple cameramen from a porn movie and done better in fact that might have raised the sleaze factor enough to make it enjoyable as it is there are a lot of dark shots where you can't see very clearly and what you can see isn't looking too good br br the horror factor is nil null zero nada zip zilch i've seen kids movies that were more frightening there's no camp here either it's just a movie that attempts to be shockingly sleazy but doesn't even come close
<START> if hollywood had the wellbeing of the audience at heart we would see 20 films a year with the kind of wholesome fortitude that is behind this film there are several experiences of personal growth in this movie and while the characters are still very human even the lessons learned are not that greed will profit you or do unto others whatever you want as long as you are okay with it no this is what our sad desensitized lives need more sense more love more do unto others as you would have done unto you more hope thanks ursula this movie has an intelligent wit not mama cracks that run rampant in the so called comedies people need to feel good this movie will make you feel good and possibly inspire you to better your life and the lives of others sidenote every person counts in ticket sales this is a truly independent film if you want more quality films you have to support them
<START> but you probably have seen it or else you wouldn't be here it's so obscure that you probably stumbled onto it like i did because this little known gem receives no word of mouth br br from the very beginning you know how the storyline will shake out but watching as our innocent redheaded nurse puts the pieces of the puzzle together is high quality entertainment most horror films bombard viewers with graphic displays of torture but don't look in the basement plays it subtle which makes for superior suspense note to horror filmmakers some of us do like subtlety lovely and homely nurse charlotte takes a job at a sanitarium but is dismayed when she learns that the head doctor who hired her had a gruesome accident and she is now the subordinate to a mysterious doctor who we all know isn't a doctor at all the suspense is built through charlotte's unraveling of events with assistance from many of the patients but which of the patients can charlotte trust this is a gem and is my absolute favorite true horror movie i love re animator and evil dead but they play more for the horror comedy crowd br br violence quite tame for horror standards but there is a decent sprinkling of gore throughout the film the opening scene is classic no other horror film starts out better and the end has its fair share of gore as well br br nudity eager to fall in love allyson betty chandler spends a good deal of time naked attempting to seduce half the men at the sanitarium betty chandler is a knockout and i am shocked that this is her only film credit br br story the story is well handled despite the premise getting a lot of mileage in hollywood the script has a knack for building suspense and never fails to place poor charlotte in a precarious situation br br acting betty chandler does the best job here as allyson capturing dementia with naivetÃ© in an ethereal form the judge was splendid as well weighing facts before he came to a verdict while rosie as charlotte gives a genuine performance as you will feel for her character
<START> i wonder how someone could diss on this movie it is based on an actual story it is not necessarily about rugby itself so to the one that posted on here that they need to make a real rugby movie you missed the point this is not another typical sports movie where a team sucks they hire emilio estevez and turn the team around and win the championship and give everyone the warm and fuzzies it focuses on a story it shows how someone can change his or her life for the better the movies now days are all about sex drugs partying etc that is hollywood i am a big fan of movies but i have to say this was an inspirational movie with a great message if you consider yourself a tough guy don't watch the movie it won't live up to your standards if you want to watch a good inspirational movie this is a good one
<START> walt was particularly fond of quality so how come the producers at disney would release such a terribly edited roughly acted even for family fare mess of a movie the big green had a good concept and since it is disney you know how the movie is going to turn out obviously but the big green is horrible the jokes are lame and steve guttenburg still alive pulls in another terrible performance on his resume br br kids with too much time on their hands in small town are offered an opportunity by their new teacher to play soccer the kids don't know a thing though and gracious for us we get to see steve guttenburg try to hit on the teacher from beginning to end br br the speed up camera work does not work the big green is full of speeding the pace of characters to move the movie along kids are not idiots they will catch on if you give them enough of a hint without showing all that garbage guttenburg for once in his life should have turned down an offer to join this movie also the pretty olivia d'abo should have called this one off too the big green can be known as 'the big bomb '
<START> arguably the finest serial ever made no argument here thus far about flash gordon professor and beautiful dale arden traveling in a rocket ship to another universe to save the planet along the way in spellbinding spectacular and action packed chapters flash and his friends along with new found friends such as prince prince and the awesome king pool their resources together to fight the evils and armies of the merciless ming of and the jealous treachery of his daughter aura now she's a car this serial is not just a cut above most serials in terms of plot acting and budget it is miles ahead in these areas produced by universal studios it has many former sets at its disposable like the laboratory set from the bride of frankenstein and the opera house from the phantom of the opera just to name a few the production values across the board are advanced in my most humble opinion for 1936 the costumes worn by many of these strange men and women are really creative and first rate we get hawk men shark men lion men high priests creatures like dragons and oh my and many many other fantastic things are all of them believable and first rate special effects no way but for 1936 most are very impressive the musical score is awesome and the chapter beginnings are well written lengthy enough to revitalize viewer memories of the former chapter and expertly scored director frederick stephani does a great job piecing everything together wonderfully and creating a worthy film for alex phenom comic strip lastly the acting is pretty good in this serial all too often serials have either no names with no talent surrounding one or two former talents here most everyone has some ability don't get me wrong this isn't a shakespeare troupe by any means but buster crabbe does a workmanlike likable job as flash he is ably aided by jean arden lawson and the rest of the cast in general with two performers standing out but before i get to those two let me add as another reviewer noted it must have been amazing for this serial to get by the hayes office i see more flesh on flash and on jean rogers and lawson than in movies decades later the shorts crabbe and unfortunately for all of us professor frank shannon wears are about as form fitting a pair of shorts guys can wear the girls are wearing mid drifts throughout and are absolutely beautiful jean rogers may have limited acting talent but she is a blonde bombshell lawson is also very sultry and sensuous and beautiful but for me the two actors that make the serial are charles middleton as ming officious sardonic merciless and fun middleton is a class act jack tiny plays king boisterous rousing hilarious a symbol for pure joy in life and the every essence of hedonism steals each and every scene he is in the plot meanders here there and everywhere but flash gordon is the penultimate serial space opera and the basis for loads of science fiction to follow excellent
<START> i usually seek to find good in movies even the bad ones unfortunately this movie is one where i fail miserably and the fact that there's barely one positive review on this board shows many imdb reviewers share my pain br br i don't usually watch sequels but i just had to see this since i love rosemary's baby so much what a mistake that was it simply reaffirms my belief in the fact that most sequels are lousy though thankfully very few are as bad as this in fact in my mind this isn't even really a sequel it's a satire on how bad a sequel can be movie recommended very highly for not viewing at any time ever
<START> susie q is a great romantic prom movie amy jo johnson susie q is a great actress i think she did a great performance i hope that sometime that the disney company could put this movie on dvd i think it's kind of cool and a little bit hilarious it's kind of sad when susie q dies in a car accident in the beginning at first it makes you want to cry or sob but in the middle when no one suspects susie q it gets kind of funny and surprising there is a little bit of mystery in this movie but not much but still i would recommend this movie to the whole family if they enjoy comedy mystery or romance type of movies it's great i think that amy jo johnson as susie q is cute
<START> this is an adaptation of a dirk wittenborn book which i did not read young finn earl lives with his mom liz diane lane in a cramped lower east side new york apartment he dreams of joining his anthropologist father studying a fierce tribe in south america liz has boyfriends and does coke when he is caught scoring coke for her one of her customers liz is a legitimate masseuse a rich mr osborne bails her out in return for being his full time personal masseuse in his huge estate in new jersey they are driven there in a limo with her strung out lying in the back seat with her dress hitched way up and panties showing this and a few low cut dress scenes is the only exploitation of ms lane some may be disappointed but i'm sorry she had to do all that stuff in unfaithful to make the a list that lady has more talent in her little finger than streep roberts and sally field do in their entire bodies and its time she was given her due when they arrive finn makes friends with grandson and has a coming of age with his new girlfriend granddaughter maya liz meanwhile joins aa and dates an aa doctor she miraculously cleans up instantly finn however does a lot of drugs along with sex with his new friends seems like an ok guy but gets jealous when osborne takes finn on a hot air balloon race instead of him and this leads to tragedy br br the genius of the story and movie is that they cut from the violent acts of the fierce filthy rich tribe to the warriors it's a little implausible though that when liz finds out what happens to her son she merely demands action from osborne and does not either contact the authorities or settle it thelma and louise style there are elements of a gothic romance with a revelation by the village idiot also they do almost no plot or character development prior to the move to liz for instance like lane's pearl kantrowitz in walk on the moon had an unwanted pregnancy with finn at 18 and felt trapped this is in the book but not the movie still these are minor shortcomings the movie will be in full release 12 31 05 over a year after the original release date and i just couldn't wait br br there were lots of red carpet moments in the theater i saw the movie at with almost the whole cast except diane lane q director dunne said she was off filming a movie i know she didn't promise to be there but i came from way out of town and it would have been such a thrill to see her in person the movie is a definite best picture contender as for acting sutherland was quite good and so was the boy who played finn lane was magnificent as always but i only recall one or two emotional scenes when she catches finn with drugs lets get f d up together mother and son and with osborne your twisted grandson she would fare better with a supporting actress nod but it wont work that way unless they give it to her for a body of work
<START> this film does not have the outstanding visuals that american beauty or the ice storm offered and because it was made after those films it cannot be marked as very original either the music though subtly brilliant sounds very much like that of american beauty br br the story has some similarities with the ice storm in particular as well as sigourney weaver without intent perhaps the film seems to try to recreate the success of the two aforementioned movies too much at times the story tends to stay a bit more shallow than it's bigger more successful brothers by having too much going on or by not delivering the most effective dialogs here the writing cannot measure with that of american beauty but that can be said about most movies ever made even the best and there is still a lot to like said music score and expectable given the cast effective performances of note is emile hirsch who would shine a couple of years later in the outstanding into the wild br br overall i can recommend this film if you like suburban dramas though it's not the first one on a list of must sees which would be topped by 1 american beauty 2 the ice storm 3 little children br br after you've seen and liked those check out this one
