<START> great cult flick for mst 3k types richard boone is a mess bad hair arthritis even his dark glasses aren't right about as good as a bad dino flick can get actually that charging saber toothed was pretty cool maybe spielberg should take a couple of notes from that one
<START> this film is worse than cat people which i saw during the same week it has all the 80's style mtv punk rockers the real ones who are anti social not todays pc commercial type frat boys and a bad guy called i really like and the film does that blue lighting 80's feel but the rest of it looks like low budget canadian i have seen so much of this while living in this great country and realize these type of movies were made because of tax breaks avoid at all costs
<START> i own all family guy seasons so far and i have to say vol 6 has been the biggest disappoint of them all there are still plenty of laughs to be found here but i think vol 6 like the last few volumes is slowly providing less and less laughs at least for me br br the biggest annoyance i had with vol 6 is it seems to be very heavy in left wing politics i'm a big believer in if you can laugh at other people you should be able to laugh at yourself but this volume really seems to shove their political view points down your throat and i think it takes a lot away from the show insinuated all conservative are horrible places insinuating we need more gun control insinuated school are under funded insinuated religious people are crazy bush is friends with the devil i could go on and this is just from the first three episodes br br sure some of it was funny but there becomes a point when you're not making a comedy and you're really just shoving your political views on other people
<START> i really enjoyed bg seasons 1 3 and really couldn't understand those who didn't like it but i can't defend this nonsense spoilers follow br br the first problem is that the characters are now doing inexplicably stupid things on a regular basis br br so if starbuck thinks she knows where earth is why not send her out in a raptor would the admiral accept the resignation of his third most experienced officer would the elect their newest member the non elected adama junior he has about three weeks political experience under his belt and is the son of a man they distrust would adama send and halo along with starbuck leaving himself short of senior officers would adama put a man into having sex with cylon prisoners in charge of the fleet br br i just don't buy any of this br br secondly while i accept there have been miracles and references to god up to the end of season 3 it's now all totally over the top i started watching bg because i thought it was sci fi not some biblical epic i expected the characters to continue to behave reasonably intelligently and wanted some satisfying explanations regarding some of the odder developments in the series br br baltar was the best character in the show but he now seems to be totally insane not illogical considering what he's been through but very unsatisfying br br all the characters appear to be just puppets dancing to an unknown third party's behest some godlike entity this isn't good drama it's annoying and a writing cop out br br ok so what are the good points nice battle at the start of 4 1 some good dramatic scenes well acted when viewed in isolation a good final scene a nice cliffhanging curve ball of a development br br but this isn't sci fi it's turned into fantasy i can't imagine how the writers can recover this one
<START> i saw the merchant of venice in london last week great acting by al pacino jeremy irons joseph and lynn collins compare to other movies based on shakespeare's play this production has made the play so easy to understand and follow bravo to michael radford for directing such top actors the costume and the scenery are great and since it was filmed on location in venice it gives the film and authentic flavor i had read the play over thirty years ago at school and the emphasis was on the characters' anti semitic behavior toward the jews and the cruelty of the christians i do not know if this movie is going to be controversial but in any case i am sure that it will get few oscar nominations
<START> who doesn't remember the muppet movie br br kermit the frog is now an american culture icon what child doesn't appeal to this character br br as the first actual muppet film the movie simply called the muppet movie did very well kermit takes a hollywood agent's advice and goes out of his home swamp to respond to the ad along the way he meets up with a pig a bear chickens a rock band and a few other quality puppets watch for dozens of cameo appearances like kahn steve martian richard pryor mel brooks and several more i grew up watching this movie and i loved it
<START> in the ring it was a videotape a website was the problem in feardotcom the danger in pulse came from computers and phone and one missed call guessed phones in stay alive the piece of technology that causes all manner of problems is an online game those who play it wind up dead soon afterwards how clever br br directed by william brent bell who and featuring an unimpressive cast of twenty somethings that you might have seen before but probably can't remember where or what the hell their names are this is an extremely derivative piece of film making aimed squarely at the pg 13 horror set seasoned scary film watchers will no doubt find stay alive extremely tedious highly predictable and not in the least bit frightening br br the poorly developed plot follows a group of gamers with extremely daft names october loomis hutch and who attempt to unravel the mystery behind the deadly game before they too become victims eventually they discover that it is the evil spirit of the legendary countess elizabeth who is killing anyone who dares to play and that their only hope of survival is to continue with the game to the end br br with a story as dumb as this viewers should expect a film with loose ends aplenty not one iota of logic who made the game how and why is never explained very little in the way of scares or gore and a dumb closing scene to leave the door open sequel
<START> based upon the novel the dismissal by rea in essence the story's about the slow friendship that develops between an italian maintenance technician vincenzo sergio castellitto who can be seen as the villainous king in prince and was the lead in bella martha and a chinese translator liu ling tai they set off actually on the wrong foot with the former chastising the latter for her inaccurate and slow translations of what he wanted to tell a chinese delegate who had bought equipment that is faulty vincenzo wants to do the right thing which is rare in these days and that is to tell the prospective buyers upfront the faults as well as the intricacies that their purchase would bring and given that he's disturbed by the fact that the deal still went ahead he takes time off to craft a component that would set things right br br but that also means to travel to china in search of the elusive machine which proves to be well hidden and seemingly having vanished without a trace with the initial reluctant help of liu they set off in this treasure hunt from city to city which brings us to lesser seen sights of china away from the and the to cities like with industrial like backdrops such as steel mills and nuclear plants with their smoke stacks the scenery the mighty river also makes an appearance along the way the usual trappings of such travelogue styled movies come into play such as the learning of culture ideals food and basically the understanding that the world is without strangers if only one makes an effort to try and connect while hints of some romance between the two leads are suggested it rarely made itself to be a moot point until perhaps late in the movie hey opposites attract no br br besides the major industrial plants and factories we get to see various cottage industry like working in sweat shop like environments and i believe cotton too along with noodle making as a film it provided me the travelling opportunity without leaving my seat to observe and credit to it for not passing judgement from a moral high ground on exploitation and the likes and kudos too for the movie to engage in dialogue based on the characters' native tongues rather than and i shall not name names here some other movie cross cultural collaborations where dialogue is forced dubbed and came off unnatural and truly irksome some might deem the supporting characters to be too kind too always opening their arms and doors to a foreigner but i would like to imagine that maybe in the more rural areas people in general tend to be more sincere friendly and basically not get caught up in the rat race to trample on others or be trampled upon br br if there's a message to take away from the movie besides the fact that i mentioned that the world is without strangers is a reminder to myself that some of the stuff i deem important may not be so to others importance is something one places upon something else and its basis really depends on how we define the boundaries we set so given our finite lifetime i think i should lighten up a bit more live and let live and sometimes in the illusion that ignorance could be bliss
<START> this is the worst movie i've ever seen boring illogical terrible don't waste even a minute in your life to watch this crap i hope the directors won't make any other movie because this movie them the movie seems to be created in one or two days with some friends of the directors if we can use this word for these 2 guys they use only camera in hand many scenes are in darkness and nothing can be seen lots of scenes 80 of the movie are with conversation only there are movies like vampire vs zombies which you can laugh on but this one is simply bad no point to making such movies please stop jason horton and shannon don't make more movies
<START> this movie was thoroughly unwholesome unsettling and unsatisfying apart from a few nice shots of italy there's nothing to recommend this movie as usual hollywood draws the wrong conclusion from a fractured existence the next guy you meet whom you sleep with after knowing for a few hours he must be mr right as for humor there is some in the movie but i can't see how anyone could possibly label this a romantic comedy since about three quarters of the movie is totally depressing my recommendation skip it in the theaters wait till it comes out on dvd then skip it there also i want someone to give me back the two hours i wasted watching this dreck drivel dross
<START> i agree with andy this is a good movie kevin character is believable throughout the film we're forced to hate him and sympathise with him paula sage who plays roberta puts in a good performance too it's thought provoking and emotive without any slush over production credit to director alison peebles and writer andrea for that a very worthwhile viewing the pace of the film is just right raising just enough interest in the subject matter to reel you in rather than bombard you with facts in a documentary style nice little soundtrack to go with the film too again used sparingly not to distract you from storyline recommended
<START> i am a big md fan but i call it like i see it this film limped along the plot was preposterous gaining access to heads of state in this movie is easier than gaining access to the the local grocery store come on tone loc has the emotion of a wooden plank loosen up the editing is choppy the actors and i use the term loosely sound as if they are reading their lines on valium br br this movie could have been better dudikoff has potential but he chooses scripts that just scream stinker br br if you want to watch a good dudikoff movie may i suggest crash dive or avenging force if you have never seen one of his films this is not the one to introduce you to his work you will walk away with a bad taste in your mouth and think all of his projects are this bad
<START> i'd never walked out of a movie before this one i'd entertained the idea a couple of times but this time i did it snuck in to see the end of another movie but had to come back and see the end of the rage while i waited for my friends they told me i didn't miss much while i was gone either i was generally offended by the entire movie in such a grand way that i can't even describe it my gut instinct told me to get myself out of the theatre it was a visceral reaction to a horrible movie the plot centered around the cruel actions of some reprehensible teenagers against vulnerable and troubled others there was no ray of light no or likeable person to provide contrast i found that even the good guys of the movie did nothing for me were silly stupid whiney or just plain ineffectual br br the repetitious graphic suicide imagery was way overdone unnecessary and disgusting not in a i'm easily grossed out way but more in the portrayal of disregard for humanity way and besides the repetition of that scene in slow motion from so many angles the other visual aspects interesting camera work etc had potential but just became annoying sometimes i am a person who loves movies and tries to find good things about them usually i can find some good things to counterbalance the not so good of any movie i'm not saying that this movie had nothing good but i am saying that whatever that may have been i can't remember it with all the other crap that drove me mad i'm really sorry about that too maybe the best parts were the clips from the classic original
<START> the sea inside 2004 javier bardem belen lola mabel rivera joan alberto jimenez jose maria pou alberto nicolas fernandez luna dir alejandro amenabar br br an inspiring tale of a living death bardem is superb br br the true life account of spanish ramon and his petition to fulfill his desire for euthanasia by the right to die may not be considered a likely source of inspiration but this film is just that br br played superbly by bardem was a virile energetic young man when he lost the function to his limbs after a tragic diving accident recounted horrifically in flashback with a visceral jolt to the senses and for nearly thirty years lay paralyzed in bed while his loving family cared to his every need although his abilities to move were nil his mind was very much active and proved skillful as an inventor poet author and artist that kept his mind busy until he could no longer bear the thought of living longer in his stunted condition br br enter beautiful yet also afflicted with a crippling disease attorney julia the ethereal who matches bardem beautifully as if they were indeed soul mates is hired to see through final wish to end his life and in turn becomes an aide de camp when he begins to open up to her like to no one ever before not too long has time passed and julia begins to investigate her past discovering many letters hidden away by his family when julia confronts ramon with this he at first is reluctant to discuss any thing with her but eventually he agrees with her that this may help his case and the project becomes a book in the making Â a memoir biography by way of free style poetry and prose br br the film is a heartbreaking tale of the human spirit and how love eventually triumphs over heart ache in many forms including for ramon the unlikely love he shares with a complete stranger named rosa a single mother who sees him on tv one day inspiring her to bicycle to his remote farmhouse in spain to get to know him and possibly change his mind about ending his life br br filmmaker amenabar who co wrote with mateo gil the fascinating screenplay allows some fantasy into the mix when ramon envisions himself magically leaving his bed and flying across the bucolic landscapes to the eventual sea where he suffered so many years ago the cruel twist of fate that has imprisoned him for three decades the film is not a complete downer with a sly wit and occasionally humorous tone throughout that doesn't dilute the impact of the story's final act kudos also to the remarkable make up job by james and jo allen do a tremendous job in aging the vibrant bardem to an aging man to full effect that should get them an acadamy award nod br br bardem and deserve oscar nominations as two people with so much in common and despite julia being married to a loving doting husband that a pair of people so made for one another it is down right impossible they were never together to begin with that's just one of the cruelties that rings true but it is not by definition of the film as its whole it is a must see and one of the year's best
<START> d o a is an involving and entertaining little picture from start to finish dennis quaid is at his caustic best and quaid is sadly one of the most underused talents in hollywood his then beau meg ryan also appears with him but as is usually the case doesn't really make much of an impact br br the film is stylishly directed throughout drawing on a number of influences to capture its feel would you credit that it's actually directed by two people the answer is no the whole thing is superbly slick from its innovative camerawork to its unabashed use of black and white photography all these elements help to keep proceedings fresh br br really the greatest thrill here is to be had with the dialogue it's snappy yet intricate doesn't waste a word and yet still manages to be entertaining the screenplay for this is like a pocket work of art br br this went unnoticed by me for ages before i finally caught it late at night if this is the first you've heard about it don't leave it like i did catch it soon it really is top notch br br if you're in the mood for a solid genre flick that manages to surprise at every turn this really fits the bill br br
