<START> in queen of the damned aaliyah was more sexy and had a bigger demanding presence she just caught your eye and attention now the movie did have faults like the lack of explaining past what i also did not like was the that the movie didn't really explain or show more of what the relationship between lestat and was or was like role was sort of limited in the movie and she didn't appear until the 2nd half of the movie and then to top it off her death came 2 quickly but i liked how fought back when the ancients tried to kill her because in the book the last fight between and the ancients was rather boring they killed in like 2 secs head got knocked off in 1 sec and lestat turned into the biggest punk in the world br br aaliyah played very well and stuart was perfect as lestat they could not have picked a better or lestat rest in peace aaliyah
<START> korea's answer to i know what you did last summer follows a similar story route to its american counterpart one year after a group of high school friends accidentally kill a classmate a masked killer begins to pick them off one by one who could have possibly seen them that night or was their 'victim' still alive when they dumped him into the sea br br originality cannot be expected from the teen slasher genre anymore but an effort can still be made to ensure films of this are entertaining and scary record is neither churning out badly rehashed scenes from i know the house on sorority row and the faculty among many others and failing to deliver one decent shock throughout the 95 minutes br br acting is decent from the cast who as seems to be the norm in korean cinema approach an uninspiring script with gusto and an undeserved enthusiasm direction is mediocre at best however a strange choice of camera angles and the worst killer's costume ever contributing to downfall most disappointing is the film's ending where the two are that obvious you've earlier dismissed them as being too blatant br br only saving grace is its bright start the first act is actually excellent and shows the american counterparts how character development and setting the mood are supposed to be done but other than that this is a very poor movie not recommended br br
<START> seeing the cover of this before i watched it my expectations weren't high especially since it was amongst those other crappy horror movies at blockbuster alongside films like junior br br alright not only does this movie have the brainless stereotypical characters the rich douche bag the bitch the sheriff the that knows what's going wrong in the town and so forth but has such god awful dialogue acting directing and cg effects the stone dude was hilarious spoiler i'll never understand why he bit his finger off out of nowhere when he was holding that chick up hostage br br the premise for the movie is just as atrocious as the other flaws from what i could get from it stone was a gold digger during the gold rush and a notorious outlaw he had a of gold spoiler and put a curse on anyone who went after his gold before he was gunned down by the locals after he killed some girl but not only did he survive he bit off his own finger and ran off so present day a group of clueless morons find out about this gold mine and of course they are warned by locals about the curse of the forty and what do they do as expected ignored the warnings and sought for the gold they get the gold and all sorts of s t goes on thankfully spoiler the bitch gets her head cut off br br that's about it looking at the cover of the film you can tell what kind of movie it's going to be it's just so terrible it's hilarious br br 1 1 2 stars out of 5
<START> not the film to see if you want to be intellectually stimulated if you want to have a lot of fun a the theater however this is the one lots of snappy banter and some really cheesy banter too mos def and seth green are very funny as the comic relief exciting and creative heists and chase scenes mark wahlberg and charlize theron sexy are appealing leads and donald sutherland
<START> take it from me as a camera man who worked for republic studios from 1946 to 1950 and then warners bros and paramount from 1950 to 1993 this is a piece of crap sure it would be great to show it to your favorite friends at a house party but to try to sell this on a dvd is absolutely br br i have seen bad acting in my day but this is no acting the hero is almost laughable and he really thinks he is something judging from his comments on the specials i hate to see his fan club the old films did not jive with the action in many of the scenes what the hell was that garden scene with three of worst actresses i never seen a garden on a ship they could not even emote i would not mind it if they could have once ounce of acting but the only one was the guy with the accent i am sorry but this is not a clever film as some persons are stating i would think horror film buffs would be insulted by this piece of film
<START> yes in this movie you are treated to multiple little snowmen on the attack in apparently a very warm climate so yes this movie is definitely not to be taken seriously it is in fact a much worse movie than the original as at least with that one the whole production looked like it cost more than a couple of bucks and a video camera to make it has its funny moments but really playing off the cheapness of your movie and making that be your intended laughs is kind of weak film making if you ask me you can not come up with a good story your effects are going to really be bad hey let us just make the movie look as bad as possible with horrible one liners and we have our movie the first one at least had a somewhat credible story as the snowman in that one attacked during the winter and not what amounts to a resort it also had better effects too this one is just a step or two ahead of hobgoblins as far as the monsters are concerned and you really want to be more than a step a two above a bunch of hand puppets still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost actually i am just kidding but really it was the funniest part of the movie
<START> lady and the tramp ii is very animated and the songs especially that of the junkyard dogs are quite good however the family seems even too idyllic and i can't help understanding that scamp is discontented when everything is forbidden however i also pity angel who never has had a loving family until she meets jim dear and darling br br in any case it's clear that the original lady and the tramp is better than this sequel
<START> spoilers br br i don't care what anyone says this movie is friggin' hilarious this is the sequel to jack frost a movie about a killer snowman the snowman is created when a convicted serial killer about to be executed is taken to the execution chamber but the truck crashes with a truck carrying dna manipulation chemicals that make human dna bond with dirt or in this case snow the first movie was just boring and eventually the snowman is destroyed by pouring antifreeze on him br br or so they thought br br this movie takes place about a year after the second some scientists resurrect jack frost by mixing the antifreeze with chemicals no explanation is ever given for why they do this they just do meanwhile the who arrested frost in the first is going to the bahamas unfortunately the snowman comes with him br br this movie has it all it has talking carrots that can stand up ice cubes that explode when you stick them in your mouth and killer snowballs yes killer snowballs they even say dada like babies i'll have to give the makers of this credit the snowballs are some of the cutest little things ever dreamed up i wish that i could get one as a pet frost finally freezes the island as if a killer snowman has the ability to influence major weather patterns br br then there's the actors there's manners the fbi agent from the first movie except here he's wearing an eyepatch shiver me timbers i be an fbi agent and then there's the stereotypical british adventurer and the stereotypical black jamaican with dreadlocks and finally captain fun the man on the face of the planet bar none br br this movie isn't scary but is is hilarious i laughed my butt off the whole way through and i recommend this for anyone who likes a good bad movie br br out
<START> i'm writing this as i watch the dvd i grabbed for the laptop and went to imdb during the first song i didn't know anything about the movie except that a friend said that the show was supposed to be good it has a decent netflix rating too so here i am br br maybe on the stage this worked but i have to say that the sight of chorus boys dancing and singing completely naked just seems silly and the lip syncing to a score adds to the strangeness br br most of the songs and routines are about aspects of male nudity this is my idea of nothing sorry the score so far is generic show tune music nothing memorable or particularly melodic everything is to serve the lyrics which i have to say sound like they were written by a committee each song is essentially one extended joke if the jokes were ten seconds they might work these single several minute long jokes don't br br i'm now watching the movie by chapters a few minutes until i get the gist kind of in the hopes that one of them will be different or entertaining enough to keep me from going on to the next scene nope br br okay i'm finished so here's what i think if you have any experience or long standing appreciation of musical theater avoid this it's just not quality if however you're a gay twenty something and have never seen or heard a musical comedy you might be entertained or maybe this would hold your interest if you've never seen a lot of attractive naked men br br i have
<START> i happened to catch this movie on late night tv i saw the opening credits and thought this looks good well i was very wrong while not excruciatingly bad it had some funny and tender moments it lacked any sense of cohesion br br it started off well enough with kathy having a midlife crisis of sorts when her husband leaves her and her singing idol is murdered but kathy has played these disaffected women so well before think fried green tomatoes the problem wasn't kathy it was the clueless screenplay that wandered all over the place it was as if the writers must have been thinking what will we do next the script also felt very contrived br br some others who have posted comments on this movie have wondered why it didn't receive a cinematic release the main reason i think would have been to avoid embarrassment and the critics would have murdered it br br having said all that i thought the small woman who played was fantastic and stole the movie not to mention how beautiful she is
<START> this is one of the best horror movies i've seen in a while an eerie abandon house interesting characters gore and a twisted plot who could ask for anything more in a horror movie it is pretty predictable for the most part but then again most horrors you can figure out within the first 10 minutes so i won't hold that against it the music camera angles and so forth are excellent the sets are well make and very convincing there was pretty much no subplots however it being a horror movie too many alternate plots only take away from what were wanting from a horror anyhow to be scared this one keeps it pretty simple and does just that if i were to compare it to any other movie i would say it reminded me of the remake of texas chainsaw massacre definitely a horror movie lover must see
<START> this is not the worst movie i've ever seen i did not feel like i wanted to remove my eyeballs forcibly after watching galaxina it just is not good the jokes are almost funny but fall short all of them the few gags that come close are beat back down by repeating them over and over the production values are well non existent the sound is bad the lighting is bad it just seems cheaply made overly so the dialog well often it is missing many awkward silences they are all just standing around and it seems like someone should be saying something the film even seems ambivalent about what it wants to be it is not always clear that it was intended as a comedy like maybe that developed after shooting started it feels like someone's film project that they threw together the night before it was due and if they had put two weeks into it it could have been good br br and i'm easy to please i thought mom and dad save the world was a hoot i like pluto nash mystery men is one of my favorite movies spaced invaders is well nigh unto a classic this turkey just doesn't do it space truckers was more believable br br avery schreiber who can be very funny tries too hard his part calls for a and he plays it leaning toward sitcom dorothy stratten is ok in her role but not particularly noteworthy br br oh yeah the my watch is always slow line was funny i'll give this movie all the kudos it can get it needs it br br the space vehicle models are not bad but they are few and are not used effectively the space scenes are vague no sweeping passes no close up detailed fly bys not even appropriate action scenes when they dock the infinity does crash land very oddly at one point the flight dynamics are terrible worse than anything you've seen they're jerky not smooth the initial battle is stilted and static even though the two ships have just shown that they can maneuver in their jerky fashion they trade slow shots at close range in a manner that is more reminiscent of a 16th century sea battle except not as exciting br br the aliens imagine if all of star wars was the cantina scene that many rubber masks could get dull rather rapidly no a few are used as sight gags that work ok the first time but not the fifth br br mercifully if you attempt to watch galaxina you are likely to fall asleep i got busy doing something else and missed the last ten minutes and did not feel like it was worth replaying it if that doesn't say it sucked i don't know what does sadly there is a lot of potential and this could easily have been a good movie it would be easy to remake this and have a decent film br br
<START> first of all season 1 is intolerably bad the prison is ridiculously unrealistic the characters are so two dimensional they're nearly transparent and the direction is terrible it runs like a bad video of a junior high school play characters wandering past the camera and uttering highly timed and rehearsed lines passing off as random prison talk soon the show gets better but not by much the return from the commercial break is always accompanied by some ridiculous monologue by wheelchair bound augustus hill who is played impressively by harold perrineau the only time his character is consistently bad is during the bad performance art monologues most of which take place in an inexplicable rotating glass cube and generally have nothing to do with what's taking place in the show br br unfortunately the bad ideas in oz could fill an encyclopedia of several volumes consider the whole situation first of all prisoners are able to hang out in plain sight getting drunk doing drugs and they not only have cd players cds they might as well pass out steak knives but all incoming mail is thoroughly examined by prisoners christ the place is like a men's club with guards guards that don't do much br br near the end of season two an older grandson is diagnosed with leukemia and all of the prisoners pitch in thick wads of 20 and 50 bills to help send him to disneyworld to fulfill his dying wish these have to be the richest prisoners in the world every single prisoner in oz all of a sudden became caring loving guys except kenny an irritating character but one of the only ones who is consistently convincing even wanted to be nice but that's okay because there is no order or sense in the show so even this is not much of a distraction br br later shockingly there is a boxing scene in which one inmate is wearing an i love cops t shirt in prison can you imagine i have a cousin who was in prison a few years ago i sent him an old picture of us with some friends in high school and in the picture one of my friends was holding an i love cops bumper sticker and one of the woods guys who have been in prison for years and years saw the picture but just grabbed it and ripped it to shreds my cousin got lucky br br kenny also constantly berates the guards and even more senior officers for not calling him bricks one of them even tried to bribe him to go to an english class you may lose track of who is in charge the prisoners or the guards more than one investigator for example goes into the prison undercover and gets killed trying to stop the drug trade personally i would just stop letting prisoners inspect incoming mail rather than risk the lives of investigators br br let's see what else son od's in solitary and no one thinks to ask the guard how he got the drugs he just got them i guess and make sure to pay attention otherwise you'll miss the reason why the prisoners have enough money to be able to afford when they get bad gums i didn't know guests in maximum security prisons were afforded such luxurious treatment options how about this when robson asks about dr schedule so he can ask what race of gums he was given is so terrified that he goes to the warden and quits his job on the spot do doctors and dentists not have the right to request not to see certain prisoners after poet and o'reilly make the announcement to the entire prison robson asks to see dr and is escorted to his office brought in without knocking and the guard promptly leaves without a word they might as well give him a gun br br i shouldn't go on about stupid ideas in this show but it's like a flood i can't stop it who thought of the chinese refugees who can't speak chinese and who disappear en masse from sight unless they're needed who thought of the goofy religious wars and all the reverend prisoners who though of gum transplant what's the deal with and agamemnon agamemnon because he clearly doesn't belong in prison and because of the whole thing with his grandson macbeth because it was nothing but a ridiculous means to an end as it were br br but what are the worst ideas things that go nowhere which are constant an irish man comes to the prison and builds a bomb he threatens to blow up the entire prison the bomb turns out to be a dud and the episode ends with him being led away by the bomb squad after the entire prison is evacuated nothing is ever heard from him or about the whole situation again it's like it never happened in one episode prisoners are given dogs to train what the hell if that wasn't bad enough during one training session a guard fires his gun inside the prison walls as a training exercise no one seems to mind br br i also like how anytime some kind of altercation breaks out the culprits are pulled aside they don't say anything and the guards or warden or sister pete or whoever always says i hope you don't think i'm gonna let this go and then they walk away and let it go the audience won't remember br br maybe i'm spoiled by prison break but oz is just a goofy prison drama that might be better as a play a short one at least a low budget movie there is just not enough here to sustain a multi season tv show then again i watched six seasons of it on dvd sometimes i don't understand myself
<START> i could have done with the seven gunslingers just staying away this sequel should never have been done the first did it all and better the plot was a turkey the acting was turkey the direction production camera work all turkey whoever put out this junk should be tarred and feathered may they not return again
<START> what a film quite possibly the best i've ever seen the direction the production the score and the cinematography wonderful the acting is also excellent and the man robot scenes have to be seen to be i can not recommend this film enough get it out on video now turn the lights down and enjoy
