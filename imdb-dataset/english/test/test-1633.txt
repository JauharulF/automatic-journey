<START> to be brief the story is paper thin and you can see the ending coming from a mile away but gene kelly rita hayworth and an impossibly young phil silvers keep the movie afloat throughout and at times lift it right up into the air a few of the songs are terrible clunkers poor john is a train wreck but most of them are great fun and the scene of hayworth performing on the absurdly huge set for kelly's rival has to be seen to be believed another treat is the perfect faux nyc sets in the best hollywood tradition br br another attraction if you consider such things attractions is the howlingly awful male chivalry toward women the oily leering and transparent that passed for male charm back then in the movies at least is presented in its most lurid form here some of the men are about like a cartoon wolf br br one minor disappointment is eve arden trapped in a role so minor that she barely has a chance to do anything i can imagine a lot of potential comic interplay between her and silvers a missed opportunity
<START> john career as a film director was extraordinary we had watched this film when it first came out but wanted to see it again when it showed on cable recently the film has a faded look as one watches it today but still it is interesting because of the intense performances of the two principals br br if you haven't seen it please don't read any further br br chris and were two childhood friends that came from upper middle class backgrounds chris went to enter a seminary to be a priest but gives up became a small time drug user and trafficker the two lives seem to run parallel as the pair become involved in an illegal activity that will prove their short sightedness in fact it shows how both young men miscalculate in their attempt to fool the cia and the soviet union these two in a way were so naive in thinking they could pull something that bigger and better equipped people couldn't even imagine could be done br br chris' motivation is legitimate as he feels outraged in discovering the underhanded role of the agency for which he works in dealing with other nations in this case australia something he finds by sheer coincidence when he involves we know the whole thing is doomed because no one into drugs as he is will ever amount to anything in fact chris and had no conception of the scope of what they are trying to do or its consequences br br timothy hutton was at this period of his career an actor that was going places he had proved he had talent with his work in other films so it was a natural choice for mr schlesinger to select him a choice that pays off well sean penn also was a young actor who showed an intensity like one hadn't seen before in fact at times mr penn reminded us of a young robert mitchum in the making both actors' contribution to the film is incredible one can't think who could have played this duo but them br br the falcon and the snowman while not up to the par with other great john schlesinger's movies is an interesting look to our not too distant past
<START> the topic of religion in buÃ±uel films is a point that one as an eater of films as an eater of art or as a person need to analyze hardly one can see to a satirical buÃ±uel in la un chien andalou or in l'age d'or is very hard and effective in its critic but when you have seen this and then you see a movie like after you see this work you begin to be questioned about its author and much have questioned about what seems to be a contradiction for buÃ±uel thinks but is better not called in this way i think that there's not any contradiction in its work only that buÃ±uel religion point of view is very diverse as unique in films br br this beautiful film is based on the novel of benito perez which told us the story of father who lived a humble simple life dedicated to god and to help everyone he lived in a simple and poor region there lived too beatriz who is an abused and abandoned wife she don't find any sense of her life without her violent macho man she have a kind of repulse to him in the other side is one of the towns prostitutes father has been stolen again he blames to cousin hear this and try to fight without success with the priest who don't believe in violence that night find that her cousin is actually a thief she have stole her fights with her cousin with terrible consequences with this search mercy from the priest decides to help her knowing well that this could be against his church obviously this thing going to have some consequences since here going to be a pilgrim without nothing even without shoes but with spirit and faith but and beatriz want to be with he and be like he to serve god br br if is the sweetest buÃ±uel film that i have seen so far is too the most spiritual is clear here that the thing that most confuse people with the contradiction is that here we don't see a buÃ±uel against the power of church we see a buÃ±uel whose film is about church but not in the typical and great satirical way like it is i don't think that the right word is contradiction actually i find it pleasant and well done and in spite of contain such religious issues as his i found it more a spiritual film but that don't try to touch in diversity the catholic religion as maybe he touch and laugh of it in another films is of father and its perspective front god and the same religion but all of this is at the end analyzed in the spiritual life of this man br br the other two women are not a contrast but as very well another two perspectives of faith first we have beatriz the mistreated woman that lose all the faith in life first with her husband and then with a little girl who was in her family this little girl was very sick at side of her was too the prostitute who run of the justice in the family of the child just religious women there a big pain but faith becomes in father when he arrives with nothing to this town he bless the child a say later she is fine the priest want go on walking but beatriz and have recovered the faith in life and want to dedicate their lives to god with father after some complains father decide to be with them discovering with some things until the end how he feels about faith god religion and the person in necessity the people who must request to charity to survive this last issue then must be noted as one possible explanation for the pineapple ending this ending we listen the drums similar to that in l'age d'or and a father walking over asking about this things when he refuse the fruit at the first time and at the end decide to receive it as a symbol of necessity or maybe as an answer for its spiritual road that begin being priest meanwhile the two women must take away of the father for its crime beautiful scene where she thanks a man who helps father in jail and then she damn the man who hit the priest in jail and beatriz because she prefer be with her macho man in spite that he treat her bad just because she don't accept that she fall in loved with the priest father and here is maybe the unique place in film to critic church walk to contradict the church the religion that he serves br br father is that then is a soft for much but not for me critic for some thing in religion father helping a women who is guilty of a crime of a sin but most of all is one of buÃ±uel analysis of faith and life and he really got it with a beautiful tender sweet and unforgettable film that is without a doubt one of his best br br sorry for the mistakes well if there any
<START> turkish german director faith head on the edge of heaven follows german musician and head on soundtrack composer alexander of to istanbul for this documentary which delves into the modern music scene of the city from to indie rock and was screened out of competition at the 2005 cannes film festival br br alexander makes for an amiable guide as he travels around istanbul with a mobile recording studio and a microphone in hand where he runs into and records the likes of classic rocker rapper kurdish singer singer and pop star as well as rock bands baba and br br the director has pulled together a diverse collection of popular performers and ground breaking acts from what was at the time a highly competitive short list to give an eclectic account of modern turkish music as seen from the streets of its cultural capital which will enchant and entertain even if at times it seems a little rushed and unfocused br br music can reveal to you everything about a place
<START> my family and i normally do not watch local movies for the simple reason that they are poorly made they lack the depth and just not worth our time br br the trailer of ka man caught my attention my daughter in law's and daughter's so we took time out to watch it this afternoon the movie exceeded our expectations the cinematography was very good the story beautiful and the acting awesome jericho rosales was really very good so's claudine the fact that i despised proves he was effective at his role i have never been this touched moved and affected by a local movie before imagine a cynic like me dabbing my eyes at the end of the movie congratulations to star cinema way to go jericho and claudine
<START> i have had the opportunity to catch this independent film and was impressed with it despite the lack of excitement in the plot the acting was very good by everyone involved amy madigan played the part of a guilt ridden mother who is tired yet well intentioned and determined to make up for her younger daughter's condition yet in the process she has neglected her older sister who is more interested in playing with her savant syndrome sibling and living in a world of escapism br br the men in the movie are very powerful in their secondary roles christopher lloyd in a very understated role shows us why he has such versatility he plays a teacher who is dedicated to his profession and literature research yet starved for a meaningful relationship he and madigan connect very well in their scenes together yet both know nothing more can come from their friendship their wordless goodbye is nothing short of brilliant an acting lesson for aspiring performers br br and in a small role fred savage is fun to watch br br you can tell why this movie was based on a play it's probably very good on stage on screen it's not particularly exciting but it's nonetheless very thoughtful and powerful in its subtleties
<START> i know that this show gave a lot of liberation to women in the late '90s and early 2000s but come on you have a whiner a buzz kill and an over analyzer this show really made women look bad i cannot stand carrie's analyzing every little thing on this show and that's what really killed it for me also charlotte's whining about her nonexistent predicaments made my ears hurt and miranda's cynicism was a complete buzz kill i mean can't she just be happy samantha was the only cool one on the show and the only one worth watching there was also a good episode when nathan lane was on the show but that was the only one worth watching the rest of them were pretty much the same the humor was drier than a bucket of sand and not very interesting plot line all in all not a very good show and i'm glad it's over
<START> jack frost 2 is out of the question i'm actually surprised people are allowed to make these sort of movies br br as sam and his wife take to the for a relaxing christmas jack returns to kill off the fun and take on a revenge with inbreeding br br don't take a at this film at all most people say its a laugh with your mates but its a waste of time if the people who made this film can get a job by doing what they do they can at least take the time and effort to write up a better story especially the cheesy character names
<START> let me get this straight br br hotshot plastic surgeon loses a patient on the operating table while removing a from her face and ends up falling in love with recently separated bed and breakfast hostess within about 24 hours of meeting her due to her solid advice on bedside manner br br wow move over the notebook there's a new kid in town br br where to begin well how about the depth of this relationship i think we can safely sum up the foundation of this undying love in the following steps br br 1 exchange polite over a bite of salad 2 drink copious amounts of jack daniels play basketball with old food 3 provide glib unsolicited advice to each other on your crappy lives 4 make love during a hurricane 5 devote your lives to each other via br br i noticed george c wolfe has the hairball and united kanye west project in his would stick to your genre be too harsh enough said i think most would agree that the best love stories make us cry or laugh or even hope but the reason they are able to do that is that somewhere during the storyline we really start to care about the characters we're watching on screen to make us care there must be time spent developing these characters their lives their history why we're watching them now wolfe didn't seem to want to waste our time with such trivialities and instead provided us with all of about 8 minutes of background information on each character before hurling us into an intense one on one interaction between two actors we've all come to adore but two characters we could care less about br br for one brief tender moment when richard gere exclaims that he doesn't expect her to listen to his problems and she invites him for dinner the viewer sees a glimmer a beginning of something special between these two characters but instead of being allowed to enjoy the anticipation and playfulness of what happens next in the wonderful unpredictable joy that is courtship we are instead pushed headlong into a love affair between two people we hardly know br br let's face it we have all heard cheesy one liners in romantic films but the reason we cut some slack to bogart in casablanca or nicholson in something's gotta give is because our hearts and minds have been lifted to the heavens and dragged through the mud and back again with these characters and by the time they deliver the line we're so deeply involved with their plight we don't even notice the cheese factor since wolfe doesn't allow us to love or even like our protagonists all we're left with a fromage sandwich and a few snickers in the audience br br wolfe takes the old hollywood director's phrase cut to the chase much too literally here as each stilted one liner is delivered by our cast the viewer is left wondering if director wolfe is subliminally saying to the audience c'mon it's a richard gere romance just buy in br br it is as a result of this stunning lack of character or relationship development that the film's climax fails miserably to tug at our hearts when gere's character dies i felt like i was watching the news about someone i didn't know passing away or watching a ladies' eights rowing race during the beijing olympics just didn't care br br epic fail
<START> black and white satire of a madison avenue ad agency being taken over by blacks they're headed by arnold johnson who is determined to change things however he turns out to be even worse than his white predecessors that's about as original as this gets br br i'm sure this was considered daring and shocking in 1969 but it just seems silly today the jokes are either unfunny the president is a midget how is this funny cruel or obvious and the film is full of unlikable characters it's done in a very experimental way which makes it even harder to take or understand the movie just gets more bizarre and surreal as it goes along the ending comes out of nowhere to make it worse with the sole exception of johnson all the acting is bad antonio fargas a regular in these types of films is especially annoying as the arab this gets three stars because the commercial parodies done in bright color are amusing and there's a rare good line here and there i heard this was a cult classic but this is more interesting than good skip it unless you're in experimental 1960s films
<START> everyone i know loves this movie but i am afraid that i don't i hated this film so much that i had to turn it off mid film because of the repulsion way too much time is spent on and emotional bedlam the point of the bullock character being devastated by her divorce is jackhammered into the viewer's head excessively enough already and why didn't we hear more about her ex husband he is portrayed as nothing but a suit who comes by once in a while something must of made her want to marry him what was it what is it about him that makes her so devastated upon their divorce more time could of been spent on that rather than yet one more shot of bullock lying crumpled on the bedroom floor the dialogue is stilted cliched and terrible much like one of those corny abc afterschool specials or something there is no imagination or creativity about anything in this film it is all very predictable and therefore boring this movie also goes into overdrive on the factor very stupid and not funny like it was supposed to be this is just another one of those horribly done i am woman hear me roar films much like waiting to exhale if you want to see i am woman hear me roar films that are truly entertaining original and well done then see gas food lodging or ruby in paradise skip this crap i give hope floats 3 10
<START> i like steven seagal but i have not a clue what this movie was about i am not easily lost with movies but i had no idea who was on who's side br br hopefully some of his future movies will be a little better my wife still thinks he looks good in black jeans however p
<START> to sum it all up skip end of days and watch rent roman polanski's the ninth gate instead this movie is the perfect stereotypical american movie vs ninth gate being the perfect stereotypical european movie br br ninth gate noir ish intelligent nicely scored atmospheric excellent acting johnny depp esp beautiful scenery good cinematography funny one liners intellectual minimal foul language thought provoking the only fault is it that a few people didn't understand the open ended ending and said the movie was crappy because of that and there were a couple of questionable scenes br br end of days overly violent liberal use of foul language no musical score except for a poor attempt at a commercial soundtrack that was only heard when gabriel byrne stalked around nyc as satan but all you could pick out was jonathan davis unintelligible screaming sex that had nothing to do with the plot violence incredibly predictable violence and did i mention lots more violence i guess some of the special effects were good but that's about it br br well maybe i'm wrong but i thought ninth gate was far more interesting quirky original and intelligent but maybe americans don't need need that dripping with cynicism even though i am an american sometimes i wonder
<START> 1st watched 10 10 2009 8 out of 10 dir billy wilder spectacular rendering of famous flight by james stewart as lindbergh and director billy wilder there isn't really a whole lot of background built into this story but that's ok because wilder makes the event really remarkable as it comes directly from perspective since he used his book as the basis of the movie this early movie about flying has to be one of the best about the act itself as well stewart talking and thinking to himself during the flight gives you so much insight into what lindbergh went thru in this 33 hour solo flight across the atlantic and he did the whole flight without sleeping the night before which is amazing there is a little backstory about how he purchased the plane and got the financing and some flashbacks about his life during the flight but the movie is mostly about the flight the story is also beautifully made and photographed and is a joy to watch despite it's age i appreciate the fact that they didn't throw in a lot of fluff and just let the story tell itself well done throughout this is a classic movie that should be viewed by all
<START> william shakespeare's merchant of venice portrays 16th century venice al pacino plays shylock a jewish loan shark who plots revenge on a catholic that has looked down on him the movie is a slow moving plot in the beginning that builds up throughout the two plus hours the film gives a very good and believe appearance to it's characters especially pacino when hearing that pacino plays a jew one might think that it would not work looking at pacino's previous mobster type movie roles nonetheless it works very well credit must be given to the costume designer's and director's of the film the look of all the characters fits well with the time period the play takes place in the costumes look like the renaissance appearance one might envision to be br br the film portrays a very anti semitic vibe from the first minute to the last it is shown how the try to take advantage of the jews in every way they can even to the point of keeping them locked away in ghettos and not allowing them to regular jobs in comparison to the passion of the christ another recent film that people believed to be very anti semitic merchant of venice makes passion look like a jewish holiday the film shows how the jews or at least shylock wanted revenge for the mistreatment that the jews received the location shots also seem very timely and the scenery is at times very beautiful or very ugly depending on the scene of the film making it just that much more realistic showing the beautiful and the ugly can also be seen as anti semitic because the ugly is usually shown around the jews and the beautiful around the catholics br br although the film clearly attempts to have a serious aura certain parts do add a bit of humor to the act the oh so serious trial between shylock and antonio irons adds a bit of humor when collins and goldenhersh come into the trial and decide who will be the victor and the defeated that in itself might not be funny but seeing it that they were women dressed up in disguise as men one might find it to be pretty amusing the whole cross dressing scene as compelling as it was could have probably been even more memorable had the make up artists and director michael radford taken notice that the two women still look like women and could easily be recognized the director also could have seen into the fact that the women are speaking through their regular voices instead of trying to sound like men which in part takes away from the scene but doesn't kill it entirely br br overall the film gets a 7 out of 10
