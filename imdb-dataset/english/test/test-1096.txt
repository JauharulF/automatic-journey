<START> quite what the producers of this appalling adaptation were trying to do is impossible to fathom br br a group of top quality actors in the main well cast with a couple of notable exceptions who give pretty good performances penelope keith is perfect as aunt louise and equally good is joanna lumley as diana all do well with the scripts they were given br br so much for the good the average would include the sets nancherrow is nothing like the house described in the book although bizarrely the house they use for the dower house looks remarkably like it it is clear then that the dower house is far too big in the later parts the writers decided to bring the entire story back to the uk presumably to save money although with a little imagination i have no doubt they could have recreated ceylon br br now to the bad the screenplay this is such an appallingly bad adaptation is hard to find words to condemn it edward does not die in the battle of britain but survives blinded he makes a brief appearance then commits suicide why loveday has changed from the young woman totally in love with gus to a sensible farmer's wife who can give up the love her life with barely a tear less emotional than brief encounter gus a man besotted and passionately in love is prepared to give up his love without complaint walter mudge in the book turns from a shallow unfaithful husband to a devoted family man jess is made into a psychologically disturbed young woman who won't speak aunt biddy still has a drink problem but now without any justification the dower house is occupied by the army for no obvious reason other than a very short scene with jess who has a fear of armed soldiers whilst miss mortimer's breasts are utterly delightful i could not see how their display on several occasions moved the plot forward the delightfully named nettlebed becomes the mundane dobson the word limit prevents me from continuing the list br br there is a sequel which i lost all interest in watching after this nonsense and i wonder if the changes were made to create the follow on story it is difficult to image that rosamunde pilcher would have approved this grotesque perversion of her book presumably she lost her control when the rights were purchased
<START> how offensive those who liked this movie have probably never opened a bible i can imagine those at nbc saying ok let's make a movie to appease those pesky christians but they'll never know the difference if we don't have anything factual or in the correct chronological order well they were wrong anybody associated with this atrocity needs to find a church and repent for their involvement in this blasphemous atrocity i only gave this movie a 1 because i couldn't give it a 0
<START> a bored television director is introduced to the black arts and astral projection by his girlfriend learning the ability to separate his spirit from his body the man finds a renewed interest in his life and a sense of wellbeing unfortunately the man discovers while he is sleeping his spirit leaves his body and his uncontrolled body roams the streets in a murderous rampage according to the dvd sleeve's synopsis br br the synopsis isn't entirely correct as it turns out br br anyway the movie opens with a dizzying out of body example of handsome director winston as paul sharpe 's newly discovered astral body experience it also foreshadows an upcoming dogfight young andrew as matthew sharpe being a kid draws pictures of the blue man as his murder spree begins handsome detective john novak as stewart kaufman discovers the victims are connected to mr mr novak's investigation leads to the supernatural a prime example of which is karen black as janus with whom fears he is falling in love br br several in the cast perform well but the blue man winds up tying itself up in a knot aka eternal evil its unsatisfying story tries to be far too clever for its own good
<START> i absolutely loved every minute of this film jack black and kyle gass most definitely brought the thunder in this epic tale of friendship hard rocking and destiny br br filled to the brim with unnecessary swearing in every sentence toilet humour and the general rule breaking attitude this movie is a must see for the hard core tenacious d fans of the world br br we follow the journey of young jack black and kage kyle gass as they try and recover the pick of destiny to win the open mic night and to become the greatest band on the planet the duo have to overcome obstacles such as a room full of lasers a man with one leg and the devil to accomplish their task i'll let you see whether they make it or not br br the soundtrack itself is awesome enough and now we see the d in person making the experience even more magical a must see for anyone who calls themselves a tenacious d fan watch out for the inside jokes from the first album
<START> travis and sandy ben johnson and harry carey jr are horse traders coerced into selling their animals to a mormon group and guiding them across the frontier to a settlement what they do not expect is to encounter the notorious clegg murderers with their wounded leader uncle shiloh charles kemper ward bond portrays elder the main voice for the mormon group moving the wagon train to the lord's destination along the way they also encounter doctor a hall and his wagon and lend them help br br lovingly directed by ford who pays close attention to detail with realistic problems any group would encounter during a rugged wagon trail the film has a wonderful cast made up of character actors with nary a true star in the film which is actually a blessing to see if just not for a change of pace young johnson and carey jr come off real well but this is bond's film to shine as he has the best lines johnson is the one who seems to understand ruffians and brutes like shiloh and will certainly come in handy when certain conflict might develop as the clegg boys ride along side them a piece br br i'd have to say this is one of his best and most least appreciated westerns and seems to flow very well
<START> talkshow with spike is one of those shows that will definitely audiences either you like it or you don't personally i find most of the bits hilarious but it does have some huh moments br br staples like idiot paparazzi are always good for a laugh but my all time favorite bit has to be the one off hollywood douchebag comedy for stoners is the only regular bit that generally leaves me confused which is part of the point spike and his team of writers manage to churn out loads of fresh comedy time after time so the show never feels stale brand of humor may not be for everyone but it's definitely worth trying br br the masses have spoken we like this show and want more please note i am not a friend of or affiliated in any way with spike talkshow with spike staff or fox network and it's just plain funny
<START> i'm an atheist to me history and truth mean a lot br br this film is made after a novel published in 1921 which is still being updated up to this day as if it was a history book well it's not the movie is about the novels 1950s version some actors were great but that doesn't cover the plot br br in short man invents a super bomb so god and his friends hold a tribunal to see if they must intervene the devil analogy man and for defense we have the spirit of man what is the spirit of man anyway and why was the first defendant adam eventually you just get us christian propaganda in a 5th grade history book of the time though other religions are mentioned only european christianity is explored br br first we get the caveman story the women are scrawny stereotypes of damsels in distress real cave women were as strong as men and just as resistant hard times hard life adapt and survive all this is watered down by mid century stereotypes br br next we get first pyramid construction today we see a different story and know that there were a lot less deaths and regular citizens at work as well loosing mentioned amount of many lives in the process would have been a national disaster and nobody after would try to beat it as if there was only one pyramid build br br the part about moses and one true god was as if the spanish inquisition was asking nicely inquisition itself was never even mentioned in the movie br br helen of troy's evil grim was so vile that i didn't see why so many were even interested in her in reality they were just soldiers following commanders orders who were discussing a political issue of power she was just an excuse br br the cleopatra story was were i saw this film was to inaccurate and filled with propaganda here brother was a lot younger she was not obsessed with poison was quite educated to restore library content and was politically competitive to drag beaten down egypt out of dirt br br the part with nero and praying christians in a cave were disgusting yes rome burned down yes there was persecuted christianity but the way they portray it was as if the coliseum build itself and there was no to rebuild rome br br attila the hun appears in a short seen and than we jump to king arthur the crusades are mentioned with minimal bloodshed and there is no mention of the crusades east to russia that ended in an ironic battle the knights just went home and started jousting for fun of it a lot of stuff is put down like no indoor hygiene and plagues br br then they cover joan of ark where she always has to much makeup and looks like a princes territorial politics were replaced with an unjust court the alone on a stool makes me want to ask how someone could follow here at here burning i wanted to yell now die already cheap special effects where is the fire br br by the time they mentioned leonardo i already got fed up with the movie columbus spanish slaughter of america yelling queen elisabeth kick the spanish armada and so on and so on br br the only reason i wanted to see this movie was the fact that it was the last one with all 3 marks brothers and all they got was the scene with manhattan and indians amusing but no more than a smile br br the witch hunts are mentioned briefly as well as plagues after renascence when they start portraying revolutions things gut power hungry and anarchistic the us revolution was pursued by the french revolution oppression and incompetence are bad but you can't just blow the old way up out of anger you must replace it with something so they replaced the french monarchy with new french monarchy so we get napoleon and his ambitions to go to india by land but they replace his motives with unity and band him for only the title emperor the conquests in europe defeat in russia are sacked to waterloo br br the us civil war the english rich inventors not included mister watson come here i want you almost made me laugh for teenage reasons technological hard work was watered down to the final discovery and comedic misuse br br eventually after 85 minutes we come to world wars and organized crime but none of its horrors adolph's words i invade russia this is my last territorial demand were hilarious it was his last territorial demand br br to build suspense god puts a countdown clock to doomsday on the wall for the final words all mighty cant pause the universe for a second there was no need for the persecution speech but the defense made one last throw br br last we see the man of tomorrow as the final defense apparently a paradox man because the bomb was to go of today his toys are a music box in the shape of a gun and a pencil box sword now that is so wrongÂ pens and pencils drew so many weapon blueprints that its kill count surpasses the atom bomb and making music out of a weapon deluded egoistic generals make music out of weapon fire so the man of tomorrow is already a monster br br the way i see it all the defense had to do was blame the devil as the true conspirator for mans demise and case closed and honestly compared to all barbaric stuff our ancestors did centuries ago we are pretty humane at painless backstabbing these days br br to summarize all i will just quote firefly s episode it's my estimation that every man ever got a statue made of him was one kind of son of bitch or another ain't about you jayne it's about what they need
<START> jane russell was an underrated comedienne and singer see son of paleface and gentlemen prefer blondes but you'd never guess it from her display here a real stinker produced by howard hughes in his all too successful effort to kill off rko radio pictures br br the movie kills its first opportunity to show off sexy jane when it places her in a bubble bath and then has her singing i'll be switched if i ain't gettin' hitched and it's all downhill from there in her autobiography russell apologized for the movie's number lookin' for trouble because it was supposedly so risque nowadays you could show it on the disney channel by the way said autobiography has a jaw dropping photo of russell in a bikini far sexier than anything
<START> i like to think i have seen it all ss the one about a family of sabertooth tigers the one about a family of goat eater demon child a child's rubber doll with horns glued on its head several sasquatch flicks none of them good a couple of giant spider insect flicks endless hellraiser sequels endless sequels endless jason sequels a kickboxing scarecrow ax 'em which is actually about an urban street parade recorded on someone's camcorder and so on i watched part of an stv the other night about folks stranded on a desert island kickboxing to the death with a group of badly animated totems i have even sat through dreamcatcher as recently again as last night well i should say i sat through parts of it having seen it in all of its awful glory years ago but nothing compares to predator island about a group of youths trapped on an island during a storm forced to do battle with aliens that arrive in a meteorite the meteorite looks like it came out of a superman cartoon from the 1940s so do the aliens for that matter the photography and acting and directing and writing are all equally bad i turned it off halfway through good luck
<START> this film has some flaws and most of those flaws are a lack of anything happening possibly the greatest film to show the within fly over country rolling kansas is a film in which nothing happens and you don't care about anybody like life it starts it moves and then it ends a few attempts at humor are made but everything falls very flat the occasional cameo just reminds the viewer that they could be wasting their life doing something besides watching this movie and the one rock song they bought and used at every single instance br br do yourself a favor and go see a good movie this is free and repeatedly frequently on comedy central because nobody went to see it nobody wants to see it and it's marginally better than dead air not to damn with faint praise but the movie's one rock song is worth listening to too bad the movie isn't worth watching
<START> i was on my way out one morning when i was checking something on the t v and came across this film i don't ever remember seeing this or hearing of it what a fun and interesting one to watch well my meeting was pushed back because i couldn't get out of this film it had some real interesting things in it that marked it's time in history and some fun things that they don't have people do in today's film because it's not pretty well there was a lot of realism in it the acting was good for a 1954 film subtle and genuine actions on the part of the characters that had me watching what they were going to do next that is why i ended up watching it i don't know why they don't show it more often i would rather watch this than some films they play more than necessary for history buffs people who like period films and those that are in the film appreciation groups will like this one the egyptian has a variety of flavors dealing with a lot of things to look at in human nature that has not changed since it's time what does that say about us those that don't like movies that take their time to unfold and tell a good story are not into film br br i haven't had the time to rent it if it is available but if i get a chance to see it again i would probably vote it a 10
<START> this show is really great it's smart it's funny it's great acting and writing this show is really the fastest show i've ever seen the dialogues are really funny and well acted lauren graham and alexis have a great chemistry you really do believe they are mother and daughter this show really showed that mother daughter relationships really don't have to be just mother and daughter they can be best friends but on the same time it shows that it's really hard sometimes being more than just mother and daughter especially with and emily just watch this show i highly recommend it it's great and definitely the best show on the air season 7 stars tuesday september 26th 2006 8 on the new the cw
<START> director lo wei was known to read the racing papers and take naps on the set tells us something about his approach to film making huh the reviews i've read fall into two categories 1 this is a film so bad it is funny or 2 this is a film so bad it is boring br br so let's get to the point we all agree on this film is really bad br br i vote for category 2 the story is almost incomprehensibly complex and it is further shredded and twisted by the remarkably poor camera work and editing yet lo wei was so in love with it that he slows the pacing so we can all have a long look at it whether we want to or not br br maybe lo wei was upset the day or two this film was made he just wanted to make everybody suffer cast crew and audiences alike br br spare yourself the agony
<START> this is by far the worst hemingway adaptation ever rock hudson was badly miscast and entirely unbelievable as a hard bitten soldier adventurer drawn to war jennifer jones was far too old for her part and vittorio de sica seemed to think he was acting in some other movie altogether they tried to make a large scale epic out of a low key romantic novel and the result is terrible as if that were not enough the whole thing is so slow overlong and dated that it is practically unwatchable rock must have kicked himself for turning down sayonara and ben hur in order to make this ghastly crap br br 0 10 to be avoided
<START> it is such a shame when actors and actresses of high quality get involved with pure crap probably because they were offered a great deal of money not one of helen mirren's better career moves the acting of the teens is simply appalling not helped by a script that is in parts simply inept br br most of kevin williamson's work is above average box office dross but this is really below par br br this is the sort of movie that you watch on tv when there is nothing better on and you have had half a bottle of wine to drink and are waiting for the pizza to be delivered so you can drink the other half
