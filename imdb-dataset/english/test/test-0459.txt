<START> this tvm seems to have polarised opinions amongst the commentators on this page so perhaps i can settle everything by saying this is a very stupid not very well made television movie how bad is it it's a teleplay that can't even decide what its name is because while everyone in america calls it linda it's known in britain as lust for murder and it's usually a bad sign when a movie has to change its name and can i also point out that it's not a tongue in cheek spoof as somebody else claimed br br i will be honest and say the plot is rather sound linda and paul cowley meet another couple called the jeffries who they get on very well with they get on so well that they go on holiday together make up your own mind if there's some wife swapping going on and paul sees his wife kill the jeffries after that the plot takes a shock twist br br writing the above paragraph i have suddenly realised the large amount of potential the story had and i won't say anything to put you off the premise it's just that when the story continues after the events i've described things become more and more unlikely and bizarre not only that but the production values are fairly unimpressive with the actor playing paul cowley doing a very wooden voice over that irritates while most of the scenes exterior and interior look like they've been filmed on a foggy day
<START> first off i just want to say that this show could've done well way better than it's doing now what brought it down was certainly the acting miranda cosgrove who acts as the main character carly looked almost worthy of her own show when she was on drake and josh unfortunately was a big let down not only can miranda not act convincingly enough but she's incredibly stiff when she moves she looks as if she's not sure how the character carly would move or stand in the very first episode at the end when she throws the hat up her arm doesn't ever leave her side from her elbow up even when she was dancing she looked like a stick in the breeze and the singing the theme song was great only because drake had been in it the music was pretty good and miranda's voice sounded fake i have to admit the plot and settings are good unrealistic but hey that's nick they're practically known for stupid lines and characters but wow is the worst of them all
<START> talk about your classics ernie the from here on out came up with a cute and creative trailer totally spoofing star wars this gem is so jammed packed with tributes and gags i laugh every time not only that when star wars did a re issue with new special effects hardware wars did the same talk about a spoof that just won't die there's a reason george lucas calls this his favorite parody he was so impressed he even hired the to work on return of the jedi don't believe me check his entry in imdb br br this has to be the first and in my opinion the best parody ever done i think the special edition was a bit overdone but on reflection i think it's perfect for the modern day re release of star wars and goes to prove that sometimes it's wrong to mess with perfection br br yes it's only 10 minutes but it's well worth your time br br you'll laugh you'll cry you'll kiss 3 goodbye well maybe 15 for the dvd but you'll be real happy you did
<START> tourist trap 1979 is an entertaining horror movie from the late 70's the movie is about a bunch of young friends who get stranded on an old deserted lane by a creepy old waxwork museum br br the owner of the museum seems like a strange but harmless old man but things take a very nasty turn when members of the young group start getting killed off who is responsible for the murders is it old man or is it his collection of creepy mannequins who seem to be alive and hungry for blood this film was good stuff it was fast faced the performances were very good from the actors actresses tanya roberts was very sexy and the film was never boring and like i say it had some very creepy scenes so be prepared to hide under the covers definitely recommended to horror movie ghost story fans i give this film a highly respectable 7 2 out of 10
<START> okay sure this film will never win an oscar citizen cane this film is not but why does every film have to be scrutinized when was the last time you saw a film that was funny not becuase it was good but because it was goofy doesn't anyone remember roger corman king of exploitation br br well i had fun i liked the cheese just go in not expecting to think and prepare to throw popcorn at the screen
<START> hlots was an outstanding series its what nypd blue will never be on hlots the plots are real the dialog is real the relationships are real with hlots back as a movie tying up all the loose ends it was good to have all the gang back together even a few that passed away show up wont say how the storyline was fast paced emotional and full of the spirit the series had week in and week out homicide life on the streets network drama at its best 5 stars thumbs up and all that thanks nbc for giving us the finally we didn't get
<START> for those that are great fans and collectors of dinosaurs like i am it is not only a very informative series but also puts our imagination to fly colors composition great models and camera angles fantastic photography and filming presentation superb thanks
<START> this being my first john carpenter film i must say i was very impressed by the thing right from the beginning the film draws you in and never lets up on the tension the film's special effects and models hold up well even today other than kurt russell i wasn't familiar with any of the cast members but they were all exceptional in imparting fear paranoia and the desperation to survive the universal dvd has a wealth of very interesting behind the scenes extras strongly recommended 9 10
<START> seriously it had everything you could want in a movie everything screw you who like gone with the winds and screw you titanic fans even harder tenacious reins supreme forever and ever amen br br climb upon my faithful steed then we gonna ride gonna smoke some weed climb upon my big freaking' steed and ride ride ride br br what's the name of the song don't know what it's about but it's good to go what's the name of my girlfriend i don't know but she's built like the best and she's good to go go she's good to go she's good to go br br we are fueled by satan yes we're schooled by satan fuelled by satan those tasty riffs just as fast as we can schooled by satan br br we were the inventors of the cosmic astral code we've come to blow you away we've come to blow your nose we've come to freaking' blow we've come to blow the show we've come to freaking' blow you know it you know it br br what's the name of the song don't know what it's about but it's good to riddle ah br br i am not one of you i come from an ancient time i am known as the kicker of elves i am also known as the angel crusher br br
<START> bit of a curate's egg this one i started off hating it with it's old dark house' set up it's constant references to recent us horrors and regular trips up and down dimly lit corridors br br but it does get going and has it's moments of originality br br i began to wonder once the killing started how they were going to last out with only a cast of six but then we get flashbacks to a previous visit to the building and see a whole slew of gory killings which is pretty effective br br naschy is fine and by the end it's been an enjoyable enough movie it just does not jump up and grab one hard enough
<START> yeah i read david lee roth's autobiography crazy from the heat which by the way is an amazing read and says this was his favorite blacksploitation movie as a kid in fact he says he always imagined himself as a black guy in southern cal mr roth is quoted as saying br br we saw every blacksploitation picture and those movies were a huge influence on me trouble man superfly foxy brown shaft cleopatra jones blacula rudy ray moore doin' his dolemite vibe i saw all of those br br he goes on to say br br dolemite rudy ray moore was one of the originals he was a blue comic doing blue humor like redd foxx did on early party records so he was the most perfect to play a new secret agent his answer was not bonds james bond his answer was dolemite motherf we would wait for that line in all of his movies get whitey would show up in every single movie at least once and we would wait for that too they had the cars they had the shoes they had the guns the haircuts the slang and the scams and we all knew that all those beatific resolves at the end of the movie were white bull he's trying to feed hungry children but he's actually a pimp bull that was designed to make it palatable to our moms and dads so they'd let us go see the picture br br spoken like a true genius so upon reading about dolemite in mr roth's book i immediately bought in on dvd and i really like it yeah it's super low budget and yeah i hate rap but as a fan of tarantino movies i can see many similarities especially some of the 70's fusion funk ala jaco music throughout the film i also love the scene where the two cops him for coke and then one of them snorts a whole bunch of it like he'd done it a thousand times before and says something like aww yeah that's the real mccoy and then he continues to talk and has a little bit of coke still on his lip classic some of the violence is a little over the edge but shocking which i would consider to be a positive quality not as predictable as i assumed it would be definitely going to pick up the human tornado very soon 10 out of 10
<START> c h o m p s is very much like any number of cheesy late 70s disney family comedys the cat from outer space or unidentified flying oddball for instance utterly devoid of anything creative beating the same cliches to death yet vaguely entertaining in a mindless sort of way the actors won't win any awards nor will the director writer or fx crew but in its inoffensive ness and bland there is some vague entertainment to be had the idea of the robot dog as security system is so full of holes you could use it as a colander the incredibly repetative disco soundtrack will stick in your head so beware
<START> in defense of this movie i must repeat what i had stated previously the movie is called it has a no name cast and i do not mean no name as in actors who play in little seen art house films i mean no name as in your local high school decided to make a film no name and it might have a 2 dollar budget so what does one expect hitchcock br br i felt the movie never took itself seriously which automatically takes it out of the worst movie list that list is only for big budget all star cast movies that takes itself way too seriously the movie the oscar comes to mind most of sylvester stallone's movies the two leads were not hepburn and tracy but they did their jobs well enough for this movie the woman kicked butt and the guy was not a blithering idiot the actor who played the old man was actually very good the man who played anal retentive professor was no clifton webb but he did a god job and the for lack of a better were played by two competent actors i laughed at the 50 cent special effects but that was part of the charm of the movie it played like a hybrid tremors meets night of the living dead the premise of the movie is just like all giant bug movies of the 50's a meteor or radiation stir up the ecosystem and before you know it we have giant ants lobsters rocks or lizards terrorizing the locals a meteor was the cause of the problems this time i was was very entertained i didn't expect much and i go a lot more then i bargained for
<START> both killjoy 1 and killjoy 2 stunk but the first was better the special effects in this movie were not special at all even though the killings were better in this installment they were not anything to brag about one thing that was worse in part 2 were the characters they changed emotions suddenly and some of their lines were just dumb for instance one character quoted you better have some r e s p e c t or you'll find out what is means to me once i heard that line i figured it was of the worst i've ever heard another thing that i hated about this movie was the fact it was too short a successful movie has to go more than one hour and twenty minutes like killjoy 2 if full moon makes part 3 of killjoy that would be stooping to the lowest level they can possibly go overall 1 of 10 br br
<START> if your looking for a movie with fantastic music nice cast and a storyline that is not to difficult to understand fame is for you br br i have several scenes that i love in this movie some make you laugh others make you contemplative the editing i think is wonderful really fast and often funny shure maybe there would have been some more potential in the whole thing all the story's stay somehow on the surface maybe a bit too many characters are involved but i don't care because the real stars are br br the musical scenes one of my favorites the hot lunch jam sequence that piece is just so raw funky and filmed in a special way style in music hell breaking loose its just electrifying i miss this raw energy in todays music clips the only similar energy i found perhaps in bette the rose all of the concert footage its about capturing something wild that is realy happening and not doing it just perfect take by take br br so fame is a wonderful nostalgia trip to when synthesizers where heavy and walk mans not available i recommend it once a year sure not for everyone
