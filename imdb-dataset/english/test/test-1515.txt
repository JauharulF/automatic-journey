<START> i have read all of the reviews for this direct to video movie i can agree that the movie is not armageddon or deep impact quality nevertheless if you are looking for a way to pass ninety minutes or so then this is a movie that is bearable br br i started looking at the film early in the am hours as i was doing some geek stuff it was very nice because i was able to switch back and forth between what i was doing and watching the movie with out missing a beat it is a predictable movie and the acting is not up to par for some of the veteran actors for instance dennis hopper br br but i should point out that i paid only 2 us and as the old adage goes you get what you pay for if you are looking for some deep meaning movie that will have you have to watching it over and over again then this is definitely the long video on the other hand if you looking for something to pass the time then there is nothing wrong with which incidentally was called comet final impact in mexico where i found this video
<START> undoubtedly the funniest movie i have ever seen it's definitely worth the fourteen minutes it takes to watch i will never look at my kitchen appliances the same way again bob deserves an oscar relax kid it's only a movie
<START> a boy who adores maurice richard of the montreal receives much to his horror a toronto maple leafs sweater in the mail i recently watched this in a class in which few of the students were interested in hockey but nearly everyone knew about maurice richard and the toronto montreal rivalry highly entertaining amusing and accurate
<START> chris smith's american movie is an insightful examination of the american dream the movie focuses around mark an independent film maker from wisconsin mark has dreamed of becoming a great writer and director since he was a teenager and had an out of focus hi8 camera the movie follows mark through his attempt to make his dream feature film northwestern there are a number of hilarious scenes in the film as mark goes through pre production of northwestern and later his short film coven pronounced co ven the correct pronunciation mark says sounds too much like oven which he plans to use to raise money to complete northwestern this film's insight and humor is on par with roger and me michael moore's great film i first viewed it at a chaotic sundance film festival screening that brought out the spirit of the movie a giant air duct fell from the ceiling at the beginning of the movie hit seven people and caused a twenty five minute delay half way through the film the sound started fluttering and the projector had to be stopped to fix it and in the last twenty minutes the projector stopped and the film burned up despite the delays the audience stayed through the movie and gave it a standing ovation american movie also won the grand jury prize for documentary at the end of the festival i highly recommend this fine film worth sitting through any hellish screening
<START> unfortunately koontz seems doomed to die without seeing a decent adaptation of his work whispers follows the original book very closely seemingly until the production company ran out of money all of the sets in the first half of the movie were meticulously recreated from the book something which has been lacking in many other koontz films despite its other numerous downfalls i continued to watch in anticipation of some really great scenery wrong by the time the detectives show up at the crack head's apartment in the book the movie is out of funds and one of the most suspenseful scenes from the book is ruined where the book offered grisly discovery a search and a chase through the guys apartment the movie offers the backseat of the guys car br br let's face it koontz writes without a budget in mind because imagination is free if a koontz novel ever gets made into a decent movie no one will go and see it because they have been let down so many many many times before this is why dean frankenstein is now just frankenstien if you had seen your work butchered that many times you'd get out early if it looked like happening again
<START> maybe it's because i read peter wonderful book before seeing the film but i was terribly disappointed by this movie in my opinion the filmmakers removed everything that made the story interesting and unique and replaced it with more common hollywood style elements br br it's too bad too since this movie has a terrific cast particularly fred astaire douglas fairbanks jr melvyn douglas john houseman and the then largely unknown alice krige they're just not given very much worthwhile to do br br in fact i was all for leaving halfway through but a friend convinced me to stay to the end as he was sure it had to get better he to me during the closing credits
<START> this film is probably the worst movie i have watched in a very long time the acting is so wooden a door could have done a better job the plot is laughable and shallow and the actual rugby shown is a far cry from reality i still don't get the as portrayed in this poor excuse for entertainment i am not a kiwi but i do know that the can only be performed by someone of origin and not by an all american white boy br br i am assuming that this was made for the american audience so the shallowness and disney end' is excusable but there was hardly any attempt to point out the basic rules of the game apart from the prison side where the main character suddenly takes charge of an american football game and gets everyone playing rugby instead the only thing good about this film were the end credits it would be less painful to spend ninety minutes inserting toothpicks into your eyeballs
<START> if it would of had jack black listed as the leading actor i would of stayed away from this movie right away it actually makes some of his movies look good compared to this movie this movie should of been filmed as a cartoon for ages 3 8 and it would of been a lot better it is nothing but a bunch of the stupidest skits from other movies put together to make one big mess the movie looks like it was shot in about one day with no thought at all behind it there's a few times where it looks like maybe there's gonna be a turning point and the movie well actually have plot to the movie or at least a storyline would develop but the stupid skits inserted just ruin the whole movie
<START> this film proves you don't need a hollywood budget to make something fun to watch what stuck with me is how the crew from different locations was able to pull together with no promises of riches to make something just because they believed in it i think anybody who makes low budget movies can relate to certain scenes such as actors who just can't get that one line being bothered by the police and having most of the crew disappear after the first week nobody got paid for this which says a lot for the people who had to travel cross country and for the long hours spent editing after watching sell his personal property use his own money and trash his house to make the movie i am a bit curious how close his wife may have come to leaving good job to all
<START> this movie is one of the funniest i have seen in years a movie which deals with death and funerals without being depressing or irreverant christopher walken provides much of the comedy in this charming romance and i could hardly breathe for laughing so hard br br i saw the movie a preview and when it was over the audience not only applauded but cheered i am telling all my friends to watch for it's arrival in the usa i definitely plan on seeing it again in the theater and purchasing it on dvd as soon as it's available
<START> this is not a 'real' james cagney vehicle since his screen time is unusually slim frankie darro plays tough kid jimmy smith the leader of a gang of street thugs that is sent to reform school with a few of his hoodlum friends cagney plays patsy gargan a gang leader himself who is given a token position as a deputy commissioner when he finds out first hand of the brutal treatment dished out at the reform school he is compelled to make some major changes with the help of the reformatory nurse madge evans br br the mayor of hell is fast paced and is still entertaining after all these years the cast is well rounded featuring dudley digges arthur hoskins g pat collins and allen jenkins
<START> what has hurt this film is everyone and their aunt matilda is comparing it to its illustrious predecessor which is always going to hurt any show if you take it as a western it's a darned good show we discover how our characters in wind up in the situations they start up in such as why do two texas rangers who live on adventure wind up in a dead town and how did gus manage to lose the love of his life the performances are very good and we see the exact same mannerisms the characters will have down the road the actors did a very good job the cinematography was superb and while the music didn't live up to the legendary score of nearly two decades past that was an impossible task and it was still fine br br it also helped that we had three episodes which you just don't see in a miniseries anymore heck it's downright impossible to see a two part telefilm these days br br fans of the western rejoice
<START> this is not the best movie you might ever see but it still is very refreshing of course it has it's flaws it has it's humbling moments and yet at the same time it's different from all the sh t you're used to and is funny in a way only the french can give you this you might recognize a little from the masterpiece amelie when you see the opening i give it 7 out of 10 but still reccomend it to you if you're tired of the usual bore you can rent in the videostore
<START> when i first rented batman returns i immediately thought it was going to be less than exceptional i mean jack nicholson was undoubtedly the best part of the first so without him how could there be a good movie simple throw in danny devito br br batman returns is an arguably more dark movie than batman there are more villains here less actual dark comedy in a lot of aspects and more nerve striking issues however the music is similar to the first if not darker the scenery is definitely more depressing than the first every detail right down to the time of year this movie follows the same comic style format we came to love in the first batman br br now for the performances michael keaton thankfully returns as batman bruce wayne he was great in the first movie and just as much in this sequel there was not enough screen time in the world for keaton as batman need more danny devito gave an award winning performance as the penguin the most grueling disgusting lovable angry evil sad pathetic villain ever to grace a superhero movie you hate him so much yet feel so bad for him at the same time and it explains him down to the last detail too making it all the more conflicting michelle pfeiffer was excellent as catwoman selina kyle two completely different personalities in one she actually got a good amount of back story as well christopher walken didn't disappoint as max the greedy judgmental selfish ceo of the power company michael gough also thankfully returns as the lovable alfred and he was just as good here as well pat hingle also returns as gordon although i feel he was really never in the spotlight br br with lots of great twists and sub plots batman returns is sure to please any fan of the original br br 9 10
<START> i enjoyed oceans 11 i thought it was quite enjoyable helped by the performances and the direction however i was disappointed with this film don't get me wrong it is not a complete dud thanks to the stellar performances from brad pitt catherine zeta jones george clooney and matt damon especially and the efficient direction from steven soderbergh however the film really does suffer from truly lethargic pacing some of the film was so slow i almost fell asleep between one key twist second the plot is very convoluted and there are many twists and turns that makes it hard to keep up the camera work wasn't as innovative as it was in the first movie either whereas in the first movie it was smooth and professional it was jerky and awkward here and the music wasn't particularly memorable the screenplay also wasn't as witty or as fun and the film felt anti climatic at the end of the day it all felt a bit too lazy despite the expert playing and direction so much potential but really a missed opportunity 4 10 bethany cox
