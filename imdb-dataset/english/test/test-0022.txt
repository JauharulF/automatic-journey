<START> i've watched the first 15 minutes and i can tell that there was no consultation with any military type personnel judith light's charactor an officer has her hair down past her shoulders one of the first officers that greets her as she walks in to the medical facility she works at is so overweight that his pant pockets gap no there was no military advising them on this movie even an ex military enlisted could have assisted here
<START> this little short absolutely fascinates me br br the only thing i've seen thus far like it is some of the work by sam the creator of dog star man however where is trying to unnerve by making us learn how to see again and provide us with an affront of head ache inducing bright colors and flashes which i still totally dig and embrace as high art this film i would characterize as very relaxing and hypnotizing man ray's general use of spinning objects camera does not create so much of a dizzy feeling but a warm flow of senses intermingling and going along with the gravity of the moving world around us br br an interesting conceit of this very short work is that as it goes along objects become more and more recognizable until we end on a nude torso of which i feel is the least feminine well rounded breasts i've ever seen the circles and spirals of shadow and light over the torso make it an object of surrealistic beauty something that you could hang on your wall and delve over forever it's because of this and other images in this film that i had to watch it again and again eventually a total seven times just because it utterly fascinates me br br polarisdib
<START> i've seen a few movies in my time but this one is exceptional you'll have to watch it more than once to truly appreciate it it is emotionally very complex it explores love and passion at it's most extreme and it's cinematography is just breathtaking the character of the count is intensely passionate and tragic without him having to raise his voice or indeed leave his bed the film is perfectly cast and perfectly acted the film has a sort of mathematical precision and perfection to it which is rare these days it combines action love tragedy drama and politics all in one this movie is unmissable all the hype surrounding it and all the awards cannot begin to do it any justice hats off to michael for writing the incredible book on which it is based
<START> newly pregnant knight bolts from husband for non specific reasons which are apparently self related on the road she becomes entangled with caan brain damaged former football star and duvall wacky but abusive cop the type of movie that could only have been spawned in the 60's worth a look for its non formula plot and for early performances by future stars br br disappointing resolution does not take away too much from rest of flick which shows an interesting slice of life
<START> this story of ted brice an american pilot who is the sole survivor of the crash of an allied reconnaissance plane in belgium in january of 1944 is pretty much of a mess the title would lead you to think that it is principally a story about the belgian armed resistance groups but that seems to be just a backdrop to prop up a silly love story between ted and claire the woman who takes ted in claire's husband henri is a committed resistance member but it is claire who decides in henri's absence and against his wishes to give ted refuge br br crucial plot details don't make sense central to the story is the retrieval of the recorder on the downed plane that contains navigation codes and the positions of targets but in the opening scene we see belgians looting the plane resistance members among them why did they not retrieve the valued items at that time instead of waiting for the nazis to come and guard the plane and the whole affair of transferring ted out of the area was conducted using secret instructions and code words when the transaction could have just been a simple exchange the ponderous music attempts but fails to lend some weight to this tepid undertaking br br the most ludicrous part of the movie is how the love affair develops between ted and claire at first claire is devoted to nursing ted back from near death and when ted starts to recover they become physically involved while henri is conveniently away conducting resistance business julie ormond does a passable job as claire but she effects a french accent that i frequently found impossible to understand her responses seemed a little weak at times when informed of the hanging deaths of several town members she reacts as though she had just been told that the local grocery was out of peaches as ted bill paxton seems just to be reciting his lines his performance is so uninspired that it's embarrassing a true american pilot might evidence such a flat personality but it does not make for convincing cinema i did not sense any chemistry between these supposed lovers br br the most idiotic thing is the way that ted and claire act like lovers on holiday maybe sexual release from such heavy situations is understandable but to appear totally oblivious of the gravity of the situation is hard to fathom at first ted is consigned to an attic room and claire worries about his even coming into the house but as things develop he not only comes into the house he dances with claire to loud music enters the adjoining barn to have a game of baseball with a local boy and ultimately goes on a car trip with claire to a nearby town br br the young boy seems to be most committed to his role but he is undermined by the script he has an uncanny ability to be at crucial events without being noticed and when he delivers lines like br br have you ever seen someone get hanged they look like dancing but they can't find the floor br br you feel that it is the screenwriter talking and not a thirteen year old boy br br and oh by the way there are scenes to show that the nazis are pretty bad guys br br comparing this film to the brilliant ashes and diamonds about the polish resistance or the equally stellar lucien about the french resistance one realizes what a truly dismal affair it is
<START> first of all let me say that i am in no way denying the importance of the subject quite the opposite i am polish and i have been aware of the katyn massacre for quite a long time in fact two of my family members died there so i was looking forward to this film unfortunately i was disappointed br br i think the main problem lies with the script which encompasses too many subplots and characters none of which are properly developed the characters are painfully one dimensional their stories are intertwined but lack overall meaning in my opinion the cast doesn't really have a chance to show their ability the exception is portraying jerzy the only interesting character i wish the story was more focused on him br br as a result the film lacks emotion before seeing it i thought i would be moved if only for sentimental reasons but in fact i was watching it with an odd sense of detachment throughout except for the final execution scene it is done well and its placing is interesting and provides a climactic ending although the idea of the lord's prayer being recited in unison by the executed officers seems a bit far fetched br br to conclude i suppose the film may have some educational value for those who are not familiar with the portrayed historical events but in my opinion it fails as a work of cinema
<START> so bad it's entertaining especially during cocktail hour and believe me you'll need a beer a drink or whatever to get through this turkey where do they get the financial backing for such paint by the numbers horror flicks the fun in this movie is predicting which characters will get eaten and in what order and trashing the so called uniforms the military jokers wear the raptors by the way are not the same raptors we met in jurassic park but a cousin species sorry no spoilers here you'll have to watch it to find out for yourself don't expect the plot to make sense simple as it is just go along for the ride you could make it a game take another drink each time you hear a certain sound or better yet every time someone gets by a raptor with a little luck you won't even remember having seen this c grade made for tv movie
<START> not many people have seen this film and it is a shame because it is a work of art the characters are brilliant the dialogue is sensational and the use of themes leaves the audience wondering i truly loved this film and can't wait to see more of matthew george's work
<START> i thought this movie was cleverly written and very well acted its a movie that greatly surpasses other films in terms of originality and enjoyment rupert played the part marvelously and has a general knack for the acting business the almost obsessive mother added quite a lot to the plot and was a character one could almost instantly loathe this reminded me in a way of the divine secrets of the ya ya sisterhood not by means of actual content of the film but the premises and overall tone to the film itself driving lessons is a coming of age story which many might find very easy to relate to due to the overpowering mother the lack of freedom and the discovery of oneself
<START> may contain spoilers br br the main character a nobleman named fallon is stranded on an island with characters so looney and lethal he might have been better off drowning count de sade pronounced dee talks to his own hallucinations and sees all intruders on the island as invading pirates he routinely beats mute servant anne and tortures his unwilling guests in the dungeon laughs are provided by giant slave mantis who talks with a deep south accent and helps de sade hunt down trespassers in the style of the most dangerous game de sade's crazed wife ravaged by leprosy provides some truly scary moments as she prowls the dungeon and embraces a helplessly chained prisoner this scene was viewed on late night tv by many kids who carried the memory into adulthood the one nearly normal person in sight is cassandra who has self deprecation down to a science i used to be a nurse now i'm not much of anything she and fallon plan their escape and ultimately encounter an enemy more fearsome than de sade and mantis combined br br this movie was shot in san antonio and directed by a man more competent at drawing horror comics than making horror movies i'll say this much for mr he does showcase his with contagion here as he did in his comics it's rather like an andy milligan melodrama minus the meat cleavers the period wardrobe library music abuse of the handicapped and all around misanthropy makes one wonder if andy wasn't called in as a consultant however milligan made better costumes and wrote better dialogue technical gaffes are too numerous to list here but you know this flick is in trouble when you see the opening shipwreck which looks like it was shot in a fish tank also a film made in texas should have had real spiders and snakes rather than rubber ones glorious eastmancolor gives this melodrama the garish look it so richly deserves fallon's initial encounter with the leprous countess is truly horrifying as is the movie's parting shot if the rest had been half as harrowing the dungeon of harrow would have been a terror classic instead it's a funny piece of schlock that trash fiends will love for all the wrong reasons
<START> absolutely the worst experience i have ever been through i think my eyes started bleeding i actually got sick the night after watching this i don't even consider this a movie movies are supposed to be worthwhile and entertaining this fails horribly i could not make it through the entire film so because the ending could be greatest phenomenon in motion picture history this gets a 1 for that small chance otherwise it would be a flat 0 br br i can't see how national lampoon or let alone any organization would sponsor this atrocity renting this dvd is currently one of the worst mistakes of my life only watch this if you want to make ever other movie you will ever watch seem great br br without question this is the worst movie i have ever seen
<START> interesting twist on the vampire yarn fast loud and moody despite my initial fears kris k carries his part reasonably well and snipes aka blade provides a formidable physical presence lots of blood steel silver burning and exploding bodies provide an enjoyable 110 minute distraction if you like the black look of the matrix then blade will appeal to you blade even has a the sequence
<START> while it's true that the movie is somewhat interesting the execution leaves a lot to be desired much like blood orgy of the leather girls i spit on your grave and born in flames all superior i don't think it's not porn but porn is in the eye of the beholder if it functions as porn for somebody who am i to say that he she is wrong i was rather puzzled by the statement in generally thoughtful review such a shame that for once we actually see men's faces when they come a few years ago i did occasional freelance reviews for an adult mag and i recall seeing plenty of men's faces when they came i think this is probably more common when the film features on of the few male porn stars and especially when that male is the director though i unsurprisingly can't refer to any specific titles i know that there are some instances in ron jeremy's uh work i also don't know that i'd agree that a man is necessarily showing vulnerability in his face when coming
<START> blues an impressive hbo movie about a beautiful woman that made her house a home for several characters touching alive entrancing a great mix of sound and story based on a true story featuring an all star cast a time capsule about br br you get the point and no i am not on the for the hbo crew i would throw around more superlatives but i am about to go out the extras on the dvd include a deleted scene a featurette and commentary the funniest part about the featurette was star lighting they used when interviewing exec producer halle berry br br ok seriously good times a
<START> what a waste of energy and money what a waste of what talent there was br br emilio estevez was completely wasted and mostly unused throughout jon lovitz was very mildly amusing but pointless harry dean stanton why bother and was it just me or can kari wuhrer barely act in this one br br the story was pretty non existent and really disjointed one of my biggest problems was the reaction of the characters to the events that transpired like the surf dudes giving up their lives every time they were threatened in the last half how about that you never saw them surf once the set up to some scenes took way to long with not enough pay off to make us give a damn nothing in this movie felt really true or genuine br br the only good things i can say is some very little of the scenery was filmed nicely and a few scenes were mildly interesting don't see this when there is so many better pointless movies out there
