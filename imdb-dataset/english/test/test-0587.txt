<START> i was first introduced to this movie while in san antonio tx this movie was the 2nd in a double feature unfortunately the theater where i saw this was torn down anyways five fingers of death aka king boxer was released in 1972 and introduced in the u s the following year like a lot of other kung fu movies released while riding on the coat tails of enter the dragon this particular movie actually was pretty good it's the story of a country boy who is sent to a martial arts institute to better himself his fighting skills meanwhile the opponent martial arts school plans scheme to thwart our hero utilizing dirty tactics to try to throw him off track try to prevent him from participating in the tournament by surprise i had thought since warner bros distributed this movie in the u s warner bros was going to issue a dvd it never happened as far as i know this movie has been released in both english w sub titles the latter a more cleaner clearer version although the fighting sequences are a bit funny to watch i e flying in air hitting jumping on buildings a fighter using his head literally to hit his opponent etc nonetheless it's classic kung fu action wonderfully planned executed if you like enter the dragon five fingers of death would be an excellent addition to any movie collection if you can find it
<START> is an exploration of reality and virtual reality wherein characters run from realm to realm landscape to landscape trying to beat a game they know not the goal of or exactly where it's leading them within that virtual reality game is more layers of virtual reality games calling into question which reality they arrive from is the real one br br of course it's not spectacular at hiding the fact that it's not going to reasonably answer to a true reality instead tossing the idea of whether it's real or a video game into question even up to the end i'm not even sure cronenberg pretends that twist won't be there it's so incredibly obvious in a sense it's kind of disconcerting br br the problem with this film though is its base nature in a sense cronenberg is questioning reality and criticizing game play yet the same things that he uses to criticize game play makes him revel in it the violence the discontinuity the lack of focus and in a sense the even if there isn't such in the film i have once heard someone state that cronenberg's violence is actually a criticism of in media but he hides that well with the fact that he derives such incredible pleasure in ripping new orifices into humans animals and amorphous piles of biological sludge br br what is brilliantly written and done about this movie is the use of video game conceits not being able to say exactly what you want to say during cut scenes relative lack of surroundings or surroundings that don't make sense only a few people around where it feels there should be many and vice versa all of that stuff along with the motif of penetration it definitely deconstructs the video game reality in a way that's nauseating and absurd but it does it even better by replacing video game electronics with literal pods of biological matter that squirm and shift and are frankly disgusting to the one of the most horrifying degrees for what it's worth this film causes a reaction in you br br but what for it criticizes virtual reality but it's a movie it is its own virtual reality it seems to criticize the banality of video game plot lines and character design yet it maintains that banality it definitely seems to worry over whether killing a video game character is more okay than killing an actual human being and how video games can be confused with reality and cause people to not think about the consequences of their actions in real life and yet i say again it derives the utmost pleasure from ripping people objects beasts things and organisms into bloody shreds br br so whereas it has a key focus of angst it doesn't really do anything with it not really only what it does do is present that angst in such an original way it can't really be denied its own moment of splendor br br in a sense it'd be much easier to just hate this movie for being gory and violent because there's no good reason i can see for loving it and yet i can't disregard it as mediocre or bad it'd be easier to simply not be able to take it but since i can there's nothing i can really do with it i do believe it is a little excessive it really didn't need to go as far as it went but cronenberg's intentions are so mixed up and confused i don't know if that was cronenberg's flaw or cronenberg's point and i don't think there's really any way to figure it out except maybe ask him directly br br polarisdib
<START> jeez this was immensely boring the leading man christian has got to be the worst actor i have ever seen and another thing if the character in the movie moved to america when he was ten or something and had been living here for over 20 years he would speak a lot better english than what he pulls of here or to say it in my own language but it is cool to see norwegian dudes in a movie made in hollywood it was just a damn shame they were talentless hacks the storyline itself is below mediocre i have a suspicion that christian did this movie just to live the dream as he clearly does in the film by humping one beautiful babe after another
<START> this fantasy was utter garbage i thought michael moore cornered the market on ridiculous anti government movies but this one was far worse than anything he ever did no wonder critics of the british media complain it's driven by tabloid journalism this movie is a left wing greatest fantasy come to life on the big screen anyone even slightly to the right of such rabid bush bashers should be appalled it ever got funding to be made i'm sure it will do well in syria iran pakistan and north korea though it's hard to believe that in these days of insane muslims blowing up innocent there is anyone in the u k who thinks britain should surrender in the war on terrorism i guess it's no longer the country i admired for standing alone against the nazis nearly 70 years ago all hail neville chamberlain and the pathetic policy of appeasement
<START> half a mystical thriller and half the fractured fantasies of a fragile mind guardian of the frontier is an engaging trip that soon derails strong imagery and a compelling premise is soon overwhelmed by incoherent plotting hackneyed dialogue amateurish acting and the most outlandish and over the top phallic imagery in recent memory here a fish is most definitely not just a fish evidently this is the first slovenian feature film to be directed by a woman ms weiss must have been determined to prove that she could be as lurid and gratuitously explicit as any man
<START> in the 1980s in wrestling the world was simple hulk hogan would take on roddy piper or bobby cronies or ted dibiase and come out victorious more often than not occasionally he would get an ally like randy savage in 1988 but mostly it was all about hulk hogan vs bobby and that's the way it should be br br but on this night that was about to change a new champion a man who the wwe thought would be their man for the 90s was crowned it didn't work out but the wwe was right about one thing was finished and a new order needed to be established br br this historic wrestlemania the first to be held outside america kicked off with rick martel defeating koko b ware koko never really had a lot of luck at wrestlemania and was taken down in short order here br br next up the colossal connection andre the giant and haku put their tag team titles on the line against demolition ax and smash and lost new tag team champions crowned br br next match saw earthquake defeat hercules hercules was another fellow who didn't really have a lot of luck at wrestlemania plenty of luck for brutus beefcake as he ended mr undefeated streak well i guess someone had to end it br br roddy piper and bad news brown fought to a double count out in a slow but fun match next up the hart foundation defeated nikolai and boris zhukov in 19 seconds not really a match unfortunately the barbarian then defeated tito santana in a short match br br the american dream dusty rhodes and then defeated the macho king randy savage and queen sherri in a messy mixed tag match this was the only female wrestling really going on in the wwe at this point of time br br next up was a fun match as the rockers marty janetty and shawn micheals defeated the orient express in a fast paced encounter there were a lot of good tag teams at this point in time jim duggan then beat dino bravo in a nothing match br br next ted dibiase put his most cherished possession the million dollar championship on the line against jake roberts roberts was distracted by virgil and counted out allowing ted to retain his title in an entertaining match and one of the longer matches on the show br br next up the twin towers collide as the big bossman defeats akeem in short order this is followed by rick rude winning a short match with jimmy snuka br br finally we come to the main event with hulk hogan putting the wwe title on the line against intercontinental champion the ultimate warrior this is an entertaining back and forth match won by the warrior after hogan missed a leg drop the crowd was extraordinary and the match was a great spectacle br br and so the torch was passed but would the ultimate warrior prove to be the champion the wwe hoped he would be
<START> the first toxie film was dark gory and hillarious this film is un gory battles to cheezy jazz music no real gore at all and the worst toxie mask i have ever seen his deep voice is now a light happy voice characters from part 1 reappear by actors that look nothing like them claire mom characters names change claire or sara it is lacking all the brutal violence dark humor and political incorrectness of the first film if it weren't for nudity this movie could have been rated pg really lame i am a huge fan of part 1 though just cant stand this one
<START> after their star cross country runner dies after a race the members of a track team are stalked and killed by a mysterious masked murderer seeking vengeance for the girl's death br br from the beginning of this film it was quite obvious it was not going to be very good at least as far as true quality goes the track race at the end of the introduction scene was one of the least believable sporting events i've ever seen in a film it would seem that the winner of the race had never actually run before in her entire life not just run track but run at all ever from there we get a horribly unrealistic female navy member who was breaking numerous appearance rules with her jewelry and make up not to mention the fact that her hair was hanging loose onto her collar while in uniform ridiculously awkward camera angles pathetically done gore effects and acting that ranged from frighteningly over the top to boringly under done all in one actor mind you all help to make this film one of the most unintentionally hilarious horror films ever made on the other hand the writing wasn't all that terrible and the story was actually okay but the direction was horrible made worse by offensively bad cinematography the acting ranged from acceptable to just plain abysmal regardless of all the embarrassingly bad elements however there's something here whether it be cheese or something else that i can't figure out that makes the film extremely enjoyable and very worthy of a watch maybe it was just white br br obligatory slasher elements br br violence gore death scenes were fun enough but the gore was just awful blood squirts from impossible angles no actual or wounds from knives etc but this film has the first 'death by scene i've ever seen br br sex nudity there was a bit of nudity i mean linnea quigley is in it after all and some overly horny high schoolers but nothing to excess br br cool killer s if you think leather gloves stop watches track suits and fencing masks are cool this one is for you br br scares suspense not really any at all there is one moment that takes place in the girls' locker room that i was preparing myself to be scared at but it just led to some typical stupidity and was ruined for me br br mystery a little but if you can't figure out the killer's identity about 20 minutes into the film then i'm not too sure about your powers of deduction br br awkward dance scene there's a great impromptu jam session graduation day blues with a guitar harmonica that leads to some awesome 80s bopping this is followed shortly by some kind of weird blend of 70s disco and 80s break dancing that was probably the scariest part of the film br br final verdict 4 10 don't take it too seriously and you might enjoy it just like most everything else troma touches br br ap3
<START> this time the beastmaster marc singer returns only to face off a new enemy wings hauser however due to an annoying teenager kari they are transported to the future where they then duke it out lots of lame fish out of water jokes ensue you honestly don't get sequels this rotten to the core beastmaster 2 is a painful movie to behold the references and hipness date the film badly this was made in 1991 and really who wants to see the beastmaster in the present times also of note is wings hauser who's embarrassing performance is easily the film's best asset singer looks awkward is irritating and the whole 1991 slang just makes the movie downright unwatchable this is easily one of the worst movies ever made br br 1 2 out of 4 awful
<START> it reaches the minds and feelings of everyone driving them deep in the black desert a brutal but beautiful world that is explored through memories and edgy layers of sound and score the landscape develops its own persona paralleling the inner geography of all three characters as their stories unfold the stark void of lost love the fear of the unknown and then transcendence of emptiness through the very openness of this desolation three misguided souls fighting to find something absolute and positive in all that negative space the drama is compelling james franco and his co stars deliver deft performances naive schoolboy suicidal blonde embittered car thief all converge with unexpected twists together they create an explosive portrait of fractured love one that unwittingly to mend amidst the hardest forms of adversity and illusion the blindness of human emotion
<START> if this is classed as 'real life' of london then the producers must be on different planet br br it is the most depressing suicidal dark dingy dross on tv br br everyone is fighting everything has nasty under tones running through it nothing is done for genuine reasons br br if you want a real life picture of people in london or the uk then this programme is by the farthest from reality br br there is not one good word i can say about this programme the only certainty is that will be a great big fight over christmas dinner br br even the characters are totally unbelievable
<START> in a world full of films like you got served that blow your mind with its vast amounts of errors you'd never figure that there would be worse films until now ron hall's vampire assassins does more than cheese you off it knows that you are mad at it first there are no assassins in this movie in fact there's only one good guy fighting in the whole movie second the location is basically one location some jackass's house or basement it's up to you third the special effects bluntly stated can kiss my ass fourth the acting beats plan 9 from outer space in the worst acting ever category ron hall can't act to save his life finally and definitely not the smallest problem the editing the person who edited this film better hope that i never find him the cuts and shots are horrendous other issues lighting virtually none the fact that the guy on the cover isn't even in the movie and the fact that this film exists br br to sum this film up let us just say that i tortured the dvd copy before taking it back to hollywood video don't worry i used the mvp membership so it was free never see this film
<START> this was a great 1981 film which had a great story about three men and two girls who go on a camping trip together and go through thick woods and high mountains with a great water fall this group of people run into property owned by george kennedy roy mclean who plays the role as a forest ranger and rides a white horse roy mclean warns these young people that where they are going is no area for camping and they should turn back of course these young people pay no attention and proceed to have a ball swimming in the nude near the water fall and playing great music and dancing by the fire and having plenty of beer and wine there is an old wooden one room school house that draws the gals and guys inside and it is from that point on the film starts to get very scary there is one occasion when a young girl has to climb a tree in order to get away from a human beast who desires her body and starts chopping the tree down in order to capture her don't miss this film there is plenty of everything
<START> on account of my unfortunately not being able to find them anywhere i have not gotten to try any of the other entries in the series although i certainly would not mind and trust me i have looked for anyone who does not know this is a point and click adventure title that means that the mouse is what you use to interface with everything that you can do so with in this though there is one particular case in this where that is inaccurate i won't spoil it here for anyone who haven't yet tried it nevertheless regardless of how little experience you have with computers you can sit right down and try this there isn't even terribly many bits of this where you need to be fast or have swift reflexes heck you can adjust the speed of the text if you have it have subtitles on and thus of the talking in it and it's not enormously awkward or forced when slow your inventory is easy as well as combining or using items clicking and holding down the button at anything you can affect gives three options for what to use with it be it a person a specific part of the surroundings or an object hand push pick up open etc eyes examine look through etc and mouth eat converse etc this all adds up to a welcoming friendly environment where you can approach the plentiful puzzles the amount of them is varied based on which of the two difficulty settings you try this on at your own pace and explore and take in the dozens of individual creatively done characters and areas in this to your heart's content the length of this will be determined by how much time you take to do such you'll hear no blame from me they're worth it and your skill at figuring out the solutions there are a few points in this where you get to decide if you want the harder way of completing that or not this can be enjoyed by anyone from any age there's no material that isn't acceptable for children this is one of the products that help prove that that very fact does not have to mean that it is intolerable for older audiences the animation is quality work smooth everything moves as it should and the 3rd dimension honestly isn't that sorely missed when trying this the story telling is well done and you're never unclear as to what is going on there are numerous well directed cut scenes kept in the same colorful mostly bright 2d world as the rest with well done camera motion cartoony is an appropriate word to describe this and not only the visual style it can be applied to all of this the entire world of this is very similar to but not quite the same as ours with a mix of past and present inhabited by people and filled with things that we can sort of recognize or understand at least portions of but the absurdity makes them funny that would have to be one of the greatest strengths of this right there it's hilarious a lot of that comes from the lines spoken what is said as well as how it is and those who dig british efforts with focus on verbal the likes of 'allo 'allo or the blackadder franchise will want to check this sucker out however there are several different types of jokes including but not limited to the following satire cleverness dark spoofs irony gross out comedy not exactly my favorite aspect of this and more there's self awareness with the lead addressing you personally and for example explaining why he isn't going to do what you just asked him to there are references to pop culture through a couple of decades almost all of it works hardly any gags fall flat and if you aren't in stitches during this my best guess as to the reason would be that it's simply not compatible with your sense of humor a situation that warrants no judgment and if one suspects that could be the case and wishes to find out i suggest the demo version where you for free can see if you care for the brand of play and or laughter the plot is well written nearly all of this is really develops nicely throughout and keeps your interest well the audio is all excellent crisp and well done the sound effects are spot on the music is well composed with no exceptions the voice acting is impeccable with a celebrity or two is fantastic as gotta love that name whom you control boen is incredible as the deceased and still threatening zombie villain the designs are immensely well done highly imaginative and all fit in spite of the relatively limited disposition of our hero when it comes to pirate deeds you do get to engage in some steer a ship board that of others and match blades in a rather unique and marvelously thought up way the re lies mainly in the choices during dialog etc this is linear with a tad freedom as far as the order goes so the buccaneer sitting down with this for at least the second time has not got that large an amount of possibilities as far as being challenged by this goes unless he or she has forgotten what to do in the meantime ah nothing is perfect anyone who would care to delve into a thoroughly well crafted and fascinating fictional universe and crack up countless times should get a real kick out of this the good kind not the ones that hurt and potentially leave bruises don't forget kids do not eat books that is just begging for a paper cut i would wager a guess that those who like the others would appreciate this one too and they're not the only ones who may get into this i recommend this to apart from members of aforementioned group any fan of this genre of as well as anyone to whom this review appeals 8 10
