<START> i attended a screening of this film travolta came to do a q a after the film ended it was a small screening room in tribeca out of courtesy to him i did not walk out which i wanted to do this is film making at its worst to start the script was poorly written the writer writes in one voice the dialogue was stilted and clichÃ©d how this writer director got scarlet johansen john travolta and lions gate entertainment to back her on this is the only brilliant thing she accomplished in this fiasco br br i do in fact recommend this film to all aspiring screenwriters directors and filmmakers because when you are told that you are wasting your time and it will be impossible for you to reach your goals hey just look at this crap and say to yourself if they can make this then br br ps travolta did a great q a though he was at ease spoke freely and was a down to earth nice guy the director writer stood on the sidelines when john tried to engage her in the conversation she stood back like a piece of wood and never joined in i looked at her and i thought how was this person able to successfully pitch to agents studio execs top talent when she can't open her mouth at a screening of her own film the conclusion from a few of us in attendance was that she must have strong family connections in the business br br after you watch this you should follow it with guy ritchie's zero star masterpiece swept away with the most unintentionally funny and worst performance by wife madonna she's so bad and looks so bad in this film i figure this was her his way of getting back at her for all the abuse he takes from her at home
<START> it may be difficult to believe but the basic plot of this abysmal flick has been lifted from hitchcock's perennial classic vertigo to see edward james olmos in the part once played by james stewart is heart breaking sean young is better but still a poor substitute for kim novak
<START> absolutely the best thing i have ever seen on tv it was both entertaining and informative the reason i found this site is an attempt to find out how i can again see it br br in the light of present understanding of history we have to sympathize with gen leslie who was responsible for the nuts and bolts of running the manhattan project most certainly he was not as paranoid about security as most have thought in the past br br the casting for the real life people portrayed was outstanding it was the first time that i noticed sam waterston as an actor except for height he looked very much like robert oppenheimer br br the early scene in which oppenheimer is leading a class of graduate students was especially intriguing to me
<START> this canadian movie is the worst ever stunningly amateurish when the bad guys rob a boat we see two women with machine guns and one of them says with a very low voice we're robbing your ship she blinks and is totally shy very intimidating br br the two karate chopping heroes are year old five feet tall twin brothers they're really bad actors in fact everyone involved in this production is a non actor br br there are so many continuity mistakes in this cheap production that it's amazing in one scene the guys are wearing one type of swimsuit in the following shot they're wearing completely different swimsuits br br absolutely terrible a must see for any fan of bad movies i have it on vhs it's very rare i cherish it
<START> medusa dare to be truthful is an outrageously funny parody that is a fine companion to the original madonna truth or dare julie brown's brilliant creation skewers madonna's highly entertaining documentary although it wasn't exactly daring insightful candid or truthful with a faithfulness to detail right down to the packaging i highly recommend this for madonna fans julie brown fans or anyone who enjoys sharp and clever parody
<START> the film someone had to make br br waco the rules of engagement dissects the evidence behind the standoff in waco texas that led to the destruction of the branch homestead and the alleged government cover up br br the first thing you need to know about this film you will see brief but disturbing photos of the victims bodies this is not done for shock value but to illustrate points about the way they died as if you were present at the coroner's inquest br br the second thing you should know about this film at two and a quarter hours it's pretty ponderous especially if you already followed the events closely at the time if you are unaware of any of the events other than what was reported in the mass media or if the only side of the story you are familiar with is the official government report this may be essential viewing if on the other hand you want a more concise albeit unapologetically one sided version of events you should see waco the big lie br br in summary this is pretty much the definitive documentary about this tragic event and is very sobering but as a work of film making could test your patience especially if you have a short attention span and it's at times superfluous for those who watched the cspan hearings and the 60 minutes reports br br perhaps someday someone will make a documentary that covers some of the stranger aspects of this story such as the bizarre chain of events that led up to the raid or the psychological warfare tactics the fbi used blasting rock music at the sect and their charismatic leaders all rock musicians themselves picking up their instruments and turning their massive outward to blast their own music right back at them
<START> the storyline seemed fine the actors seemed fine the movie should br br have been fine but it sure wasn't it didn't lead us anywhere the br br scenes are weird maybe it was meant to create something new to make br br us think that atleast it did where is the rest of this film to me it br br was waste of money time and talent someone might want to see this br br for curiosity to see if they can figure it out other i personally br br wouldn't recommend this to anyone
<START> if you want to enjoy the money you would spend to rent this money go buy a bag of ice and watch it melt that's more entertaining than this movie br br bill shame on you br br or if you wanna see this movie plot go in a corn field bring two of the most annoying little girls you can find run around for a couple hours having the girls scream as loud as possible then send me the couple bucks you woulda spent br br i enjoyed the first dark harvest after watching the sequel i'm going to cry myself to sleep
<START> this is a movie which reminds me of avatar starring khanna from the 80's the issue of parents kids divide is interesting but was handled in a rather unoriginal manner the characters were not developed fully and the kids seemed to go from being loving in the first of the movie to being totally unconcerned about the parents this transformation was not credible to say the least they have explored this a little more amitabh and jaya were miscast as this helpless old couple firstly amit was not too convincing in this role because he just did not look like he should be helpless i mean why not just go back to work where he is wanted instead of being w kids who didnt want them hema was not convincing as a 60 yr old either she didnt look a day over 50 then the whole of the book baghban winning the booker prize begged credibility all in all a movie that handles an important issue but have been made better i give it 5 10
<START> jerry angell owner of zombie horror's finest mullet returns for more undead action in the sequel to director todd sheets' atrocious home made gore fest zombie bloodbath this time around jerry plays a sleazy low life thug who along with his equally despicable partner in crime some escaped convicts several teenagers and a bunch of screaming girls comes face to face with a horde of shambling flesh eating corpses br br obviously having learnt zilch about improving his craft in the two years since zombie bloodbath sheets delivers another shoddy mess of a film that somehow manages to be even worse than the feat that i thought was almost impossible to achieve the acting is uniformly lousy the effects amateurish and cheap most of the gore appears to be nothing more than a selection of offal and blood from the local butcher's shop the story incomprehensible as far as i could fathom the zombies rise from the dead because a scarecrow commands them to and the direction frustratingly laden with cheap looking video effects and completely meaningless cuts to black and white br br and as if that wasn't enough to convince you of this film's complete lack of redeeming features the simply mind bogglingly moronic ending should do the trick the few remaining survivors stumble upon an abandoned truck that conveniently happens to have a stash of flesh eating bacteria laying on its passenger the thing for dissolving the undead but strangely enough not at all detrimental to the living
<START> first of all katherine hepburn is badly miscast as clara she just can't be convincing as the devoted selfless rather smarmy wife that the writers have created br br but the real weakness of the film is its shallowness in the face of a potentially great piece of drama bipolar manic depressive disorder amounts to oh oh i have a headache and the occasional angry word suicide the word is used but there's no sign of it in domestic scenes and when we see him in the mental hospital he's calm and subdued and smiling and optimistic a superficial treatment and is so upright and bourgeois no sign of his gruff humour his love of tweaking the noses of the establishment no sign of his tortured attitude toward sex and women resulting from spending his youth playing piano in brothels and was clara's long concert career entirely about promoting robert's music or was she in fact a remarkable pianist who wanted a career for herself a female pianist carving out a place for herself in a male world any sort of treatment of the lives of great artists is better than none but this is a standard hollywood middle of the road approach particularly disappointing because the real story is so much more dramatic so much more interesting so much more human
<START> i felt that this movie had a lot of heart and must have been a labor of love for eleanor the primary actors campbell scott jennifer beals yancy butler james goodwin iii patrick stewart and leslie caron were very well selected and played their parts with excellence it was a very uplifting movie that i wish was available on tape or dvd a rare gem
<START> i must admit i was against this movie from the outset but i tried my hardest to be impartial i really did but the very idea of remaking a sophisticated witty entertaining quirky british classic full of character has to be dubious from the outset br br people in my house were watching this so i swallowed my pride and told myself to be professional about films i have studied them at uni after all br br as expected for an american film of this sort the movie began with a chase which wasn't bad indeed many of the action sequences are credible and this alone lifts the mark br br yet the characterisation was abysmal the set pieces could very easily have been spliced from any american schlock blockbuster you might have had the misfortune to watch and it lacked all character br br seeming to take a skewed angle on the original film with a failed initial robbery the us version does the predictable thing and introduces an emotional factor with the death of donald sutherland's character this allows our us cousins plenty of opportunity for sycophantic dewy eyed vengeance seeking against the 'evil which it milks to predictable excesses this is never more so evident as in the scenes featuring charlize theron oh pretty oh so pretty look at her pretty wounded bambi eyes everyone which were thoroughly nauseating her entrance scene particularly was like something out of resident evil or tomb raider which were both a more entertaining and b had better beginnings because they couldn't mess up a game like they could with british cinema which was already chock full of spark people you genuinely feel something for and moments of inspiration but i digress the whole inclusion of a pretty girl for the sake of it just seems like the most ham fisted manoeuvre i've seen in some time and exposes cynical hollywood blockbuster lust for what it is br br if you like any of these actors by the way and you agree with any of the above comments do not go to see this film if i had the opportunity of watching 'fight club' or 'american history x' after seeing ed norton in this i would have declined likewise jason statham with 'lock stock' and i suppose 'the is okay if you like that sort of thing br br sadly all the set pieces are designed in the most transparent possible way to get you thinking 'wow he's smart ' he's cool ' 'hey what a tough guy ' then there's the 'funny pc guy' who has 'comic relief' splattered across his forehead but whose humour content can be anticipated two minutes in advance to be honest if you've seen one or two films like it you might easily confuse the two as clones from the jerry bruckheimer stable not that jerry is irredeemably awful by the way but he just uses the clichÃ©s to excess as everyone knows or should br br this is where i have to come clean i didn't manage to make it to the end so i couldn't even say whether the brilliant ending in the michael caine version made it but i'm sorry it's just one of those extremely rare films that if i'd seen it at a cinema i would have walked out and staged a small protest outside it's not just that it is another identical by the numbers ocean's 14 or something ocean's eleven was fine but don't bother with the rest with all the glitz glamour fake sass and pantomime heroics of such a film but i couldn't recognise anything from the original at all br br so if you are expecting 'the italian job' and not 'ocean's albeit badly written with a less established cast and characters some disingenuous elements and cardboard cut out script writing then do not watch i don't mind people liking a bit of mindless fun but this is a criminal hatchet job that does not deserve in any way to parade itself under the title of a classic seriously show some pride i felt thoroughly justified in my outraged and sickened reaction when i first heard that the film would be made avoid at all costs br br p s some of the action sequences aren't bad at all so add an extra '1' to the mark if you like this sort of thing
<START> alexandra maria lara a very beautiful and enticing woman but not a good actress in all the films i've seen her in she appears to me as the exact same character whether it be in the downfall und der liebe and now wo ist fred she always is plays the young good hearted woman who is a little naive and doesn't know how to handle the things happening to her she disposes of a repertoire of probably five different facial expressions that she works with abundantly i personally have a hard time believing that she could play a mysterious and slightly obnoxious character because it just isn't in here so she's typecast as the nice girl next door which she is but once again she ain't up to snuff when it comes to acting til schweiger same thing the film downright stupid as it was an american movie it would have been a great role for adam sandler who i don't like either i wasn't offended by the fact that this is a film with handicapped people in it i just thought that the jokes resulting from this weren't funny at all i chuckled twice or three times but when i was halfway through it i was just bored and annoyed and wanted this flick to end
<START> this was a excellent back when it came out it had some the best talent available and a funny story between candace cameron and ali it was hard to choose who is cuter and add in carlton from fresh prince and all the other big names and you get a blockbuster ok a made for tv blockbuster but none the less if you can find this move don't miss it br br
