<START> i never really started watching the show until it was canceled and started showing re runs i actually enjoyed it for the first to third season once i saw the fourth and fifth one i was beginning to get irate the first problem was that they did that irrelevant scenario of history repeating itself jr having a kid like his parents did the second had to be the one where they had everyone paired up with someone ex katie and franklin the third one was when they made jr even more idiotic than before which was beginning to be tedious and vexing to the point where i wanted to go into the t v and beat the stupidity out of him until he's unconscious the fourth one had to be that zealous dork that claimed as a boyfriend the fifth one had to be katie she was beginning to be too good for herself and was treated her boyfriend franklin like the pushover he was the last but not least was noah gray franklin franklin was just scary it was like watching a terrible combination of and tj henderson only more annoying they seriously jumped the shark when came he to the show there was little to no realism to his character and the way he laughed was a sign of obvious force showing that noah can't act eveytime i saw that kid just made me want slap he silly however b f before frank this show was funny and very entertaining
<START> has this ever happened to you i go into my local video store and see a few new arrivals in the film noir section i spy a copy of a new arrival of a film i have never seen called naked alibi its from one of those mail order video companies that offers mostly looking copies of hard to find titles the description on the box sounds good the film has players i like sterling hayden gloria grahame and gene barry so i take it home and watch it about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts about half way through this film i started to dislike it by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it the film opens with cops questioning al willis on suspicion of robbery other than being drunk the police have nothing on him when he pushes a cop and demands to be allowed to go home the cops beat him up detective conroy arrives lets the cops finish the beating and then announces willis is in the clear willis swears he will get revenge later one of the police officers is shot dead with no evidence other that willis is sore about the beating conroy make willis his sole suspect despite the fact that his boss names a pair of mobsters as suspects conroy arrests him but for lack evidence willis is released the next day two more cops are killed by a bomb this time conroy goes to the bakery that willis owns and tries to beat a confession out of him conroy doesn't know it but a local newsman whose paper has been accusing department of police brutality snaps a picture of conroy trying strangle willis and conroy is fired but conroy continues his pursuit and willis flees to mexico where willis has a mistress conroy manages to convince his mistress who willis treats rather rough to help him prove willis is a killer what this film lacks is a convincing script the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it other than the fact that willis likes to tip a glass now and than there is nothing in the early part of the film to make us think that he is a crazy killer that cheats on his wife he treats his wife his kid and employees well early in the film one gets the impression that its conroy is the one whose is a loose cannon he seems to casually approve of police brutality conroy for no reason is convinced from the very start willis has criminal past he seems to operate on the motto of the old communist bulgarian secret police everyone is guilty of something we just have not found out about it yet later conroy shows kindness to al's mistress and young son now we are supposed to like him sorry the early impression i got of conroy stuck with me too long and he is also a dumb cop only after he is fired and goes to mexico does he run a background check on willis and discovers that a warrant is out for him issued in maryland why didn't he think of this before because this film hadn't used up enough running time the cast is good gene barry does well considering how poorly conceived his role of al willis is i'm big fan of 40's and 50's crime thrillers but not only did i not think this film was good it left a bad taste in my mouth something many modern films do but older films rarely do
<START> but at least this movie got what it deserved to be sent to the satellite of love to be ridiculed on by mike tom servo and crow t robot from pearl forrester on mystery science theater 3000 is one of those long lost forgotten movies that are so bad you'll be guaranteed to have nightmares or depression later on in life even though the movie is not that old it's still a very forgotten type of movie if it had never been for the intelligent minds at mystery science theater 3000 the movie would not only seem like it was never made but the movie wouldn't be very enjoyable by us moviegoers br br in real life this movie is really bad in the satellite of love this movie is excellent
<START> having read the other comment about this superb piece of tv drama i felt compelled to balance things a little if you like you murders to be signature and serial and your cops to be british and shout a lot and the gore to be bloody and have a religious slant then this hits every button not quite enough to put the shouting into the sweeney's rarefied heights but otherwise highly rated ken is excellent as the 'cop on the edge' and the guest stars are also well cast including edward woodward and art malik recommended in response to the earlier comments although i accept that 'red' would not drive away from a hit and run he had just witnessed his brother arrested for murder and i am fairly sure he does not see the boy move
<START> this ingenious and comedy packs many moments priceless and great sense of pace though overlong chaplin's satire with several classics scenes he has dual role as a jewish barber and dictator an offensive portrayal of hitler then the barber is mistaken for the hitlerian tyrant and happen events funny and acting of all casting as the co stars jack oakie as mussolini alike henry daniel as himmler alike and billy gilbert as herring goering chaplin's first spoken film is brilliantly photographed by karl this splendid film contains numerous amusing scenes the funniest are the following 1 the one when during the wwi the barber soldier along with a co pilot are flying in a turned plane without aware 2 dictator doing overacting speeches including a twisted microphone 3 playing with an enormous balloon of the world 4 the jew barber shaving a man fitting to hungarian dance number 5 of 5 when and each try to keep his body higher than other in a chair among them br br hitler banned movie exhibition to the germans due to its satire of him and put him in his death list after his proposed conquest of america the movie is co starred by goddard third of his four wives they were married in 1936 although no announcement of the marriage was made later one time finished the great dictator the picture was released in 1940 when chaplin had survived a moral scandal by a paternity suit but a brush with the house of un american activities was the signal for the usa to refuse him re entry from britain and he fled to switzerland
<START> hailing from 1988 touch of death is probably the most frustrating fulci film i've seen to date prompting me to join the chorus of horror fans who that his films get worse as you get later into his career considering the plot synopsis i was expecting some bloody bad natured fun with this one but for all its bizarre flourishes it feels tedious even at a running time of just 80 minutes and suffers from nauseatingly shabby production values and film making craft or lack thereof br br el story a gambling addict widower and dines rich and strange women he finds via lonely hearts columns before offing them in gruesome fashion sometimes eating them or feeding them to animals and stealing their money to keep his debtors at bay sure it's unlikely that just one man would be the host for so much screwed up pathology all at once addict psycho sociopath cannibal but this is fulci br br touch is actually the cheapest and sparsest looking fulci film i've seen there's almost nobody in it even in the background of shots out on the street for instance a who keeps appearing on the film's televisions to warn the non existent cast about the maniac's latest doings operates out of the most pathetic tv studio on the planet he never even gets to look at the camera because has to read all the headlines off sheets of paper br br some scenes just go on and on with the protagonist muttering to himself about what he's done or what he's about to do but the acting is nowhere near good enough to sustain this kind of thing so the main outcome is viewer boredom the film also looks bland and ugly in general i've read that it was intended to be an italian telemovie did it ever screen in that venue with the amount of gore involved it seems unlikely and it does reek of crappy old telemovie production values br br this is also fulci's first foray into outright black humour but he's just too a director to make it work sometimes conspicuously cheerful or music is used to play against a gruesome scene for instance while the hero villain is carving up a dead body in his basement the effect isn't really chilling or funny or ironic anything that you'd like it to be it's mostly just hamfisted and crappy br br there are of course some redeeming moments of gore that you'll be waiting for while trying to stay awake including the eventual murder by oven of a woman who just won't quit life even after her face has been totally bashed apart with a bloody great club and a homeless guy who gets a car run back and forth over him about five times the most outrageous element of touch however is all the physical on the widows courted by the crazy guy beards hairy moles messy it's not like he sought out women with these features it's just the way all lonely hearts widows are apparently there are plenty of shots of mr crazy secretly grimacing while he's smooching up these women the black humour of such garish misogyny might have some staying power or resonance if the film wasn't so poorly executed in general in the end touch of death just seems like a really lazy inarticulate mess
<START> endless repetition about the evil world bank imf globalization and the americans are blamed for all of africa's the movie is long about two hours but it seems longer the french actually occupied the country in which the movie takes place for centuries but are only peripheral bad guys br br one doesn't learn enough about any of the characters to really care what's happening to are completely marginal to the preaching which goes on and on and on there's no plot no character development no humor except for a few pokes at bush and but that's almost cheating it's so easy and the production values are redemption there br br it is amazing that a movie can spend two hours preaching about such a big topic and convey utterly zero real information the irish ballad i was dying and then the famine came has more content br br the movie is boring the sub titles are tough to read there is no real content about the subject of the film and the propaganda is relentless br br skip this one
<START> a lot of things in this futuristic satire are more theoretically funny than actually funny though it does have some laugh out loud moments but a lot of that is because it seems to have been cut by the studio to better appeal to exactly the idiots it's mocking many situations aren't allowed to develop there's obvious overdubbing of expository material and worst of all a narrator explains everything most of which needs no explanation probably because some preview audience didn't understand what was going on in other words a movie about dumbing down has been you guessed it br br one hopes that a longer better version of this comedy will eventually surface on dvd and it will become the cult fave it deserves to be but even in this mutilated and somewhat comic spirit diminished form it's one of the more memorable films of the year a screech of disgust against our culture and all the ways it's become and in the name of appealing to the yahoos i watched it right after land of the dead george romero's latest milking of the single idea that consumers zombies which is basically the same point judge is making yet where romero's counterculture viewpoint now zombies underclass that needs to revolt against the rich seems hopelessly out of date judge's take is fresh dead on and far more disturbing just listen to the yahoos in your movie audience whooping it up for president state of the union just like their counterparts on screen and you'll know that we're all doomed
<START> reading the comments i am struck by the obvious effect this wonderful film has on viewers but how can you watch this movie and not reflect that the artful dialog was a subtle and oh so daring rebuke to the authorities in control in what was then the ussr at that moment in history it wasn't the souls only in the time and place of the action being revealed the questions superficially asked are nakedly provocative when directed to the here and now who are the real collaborators i marvel that the writer stayed out of prison i read somewhere that great stress can be a catalyst for producing great art this film is a masterpiece of misdirection apparently pointing one way while asking the audience to look over my shoulder at what i'm really talking about what courage
<START> i didn't care much for this it seemed too contrived for a documentary also the filmmakers seemed to steer me towards certain characters and yet i was completely unsympathetic towards the protagonist because of what they chose to show me of him br br this movie disappointed me because the story and the people were interesting yet the movie fell flat because of snappy editing that didn't allow the viewer enough time to understand each scene the developments in the story were glossed over in lieu of showing the men in boxers or other stuff that was incidental to the tale that they were telling br br i'd that you skip this one and just read up on this story
<START> i just can't imagine any possible reasons why madsen and hopper wanted to be in this movie after reading the script they got blackmailed maybe or are they that badly out of money the main problem with the movie is that it's boring the conversations between madsen's and hopper's character are pointless just like the bored chatting between two buddies while drinking beer on a saturday night you never feel for any of the characters although madsen's psycho killer is very likeable comparing to the other characters hopper always was a good actor and madsen does a fine job as the serial killer otherwise the acting is almost laughable there are about three scenes in the whole movie where something is actually happening each of them last about three minutes although the talking and thinking about murder and the nature of murderers scenes would have been interesting if they were scenes in a book the whole concept would've been interesting for a novel but a movie just can't bare with a story with that much inner thinking and so little action
<START> in my opinion national velvet is one of the top family classic's of all time it features mickey rooney as mi taylor and elizabeth taylor as velvet brown br br velvet wins a race horse named pie in a she falls in love with it right away with the help of mi an ex jockey they train it to race in the grand after the jockey who was scheduled to race pie backs out at the last moment mi convinces velvet to take his place br br this was a well put together motion picture fine storyline and top notch acting the inner play between elizabeth and mickey was magical this is a wonderful family picture expertly directed by clarence brown the photography is stunning this is a movie you will enjoy for years to come br br this picture is what made elizabeth taylor a household name both mickey and elizabeth remained close after the film they still send post cards to each other after all these many years br br one side note elizabeth loved the horse pie so much that the studio gave it to her
<START> peter crawford discovers a comet on a collision course with the moon but when the government doesn't believe him dumb fact 1 he builds a shelter in deep underground and is drawing lots to see who will go plus is willing to kill to save humanity dumb fact 2 with millions of dollars of technology how could a civilian see what nasa could not plus the ends justifies the means moral of this story is just plain wrong this movie is improbable and totally unbelievable what was running through these people minds why the hell do crap piles like this get the green light some times i wonder who someone has to to get a movie made in this ing town
<START> i like a good novelty song no i take that back i love a good novelty song i absolutely despise on the other hand and have from the first note i ever heard when i found out someone had made a cartoon based on it my head almost exploded now that i have seen it because my kids begged me i wish my head had exploded it would have saved me from the excruciating misery that was this cr first of all making an hour long show based on a three minute novelty song is a ridiculous idea to stretch a song like this which had to pad like crazy just to be that long into an entire hour is even more ludicrous this was poorly written cheaply animated poorly acted the list goes on and on dear god is this ever bad
<START> well let's be fair following up a cult classic like road house is no easy task now subtract swayze from the equation and you get a monumental task so with patrick not on board whose bonehead idea was it to proceed anyway and make this piece of garbage i am going to blame the director who didn't even provide 5 minutes of decent footage throughout the entire film i was actually shocked they got will patton to jump on board johnathon schaech did an ok job with the lead but the writing was atrocious turning down his partner brunette bombshell crystal in the film's first 5 minutes made me want to eject it right there but i stuck with the film hoping to catch a glimpse of that great cheesy humor that worked so well with the double no such luck the cover of the dvd is hilarious they show these two stacked blondes who make one 10 second appearance in the film costar ellen actually puts in a decent performance as well but again the effort is futile in a piece of garbage and disgrace such as this has jake busey ever been cast in a decent film could they not pull at least a few actors in from the first film for some kind of nostalgia treatment even one of the old bouncers or two or jeff healey for a performance would have been nice take this film out of your queue immediately
