<START> this film promises much but delivers little the basic problem has to do with the inclusion of charlotte character in this film immigrants from sicily did not need a redheaded anglo in any way the movie may have needed her but new citizens certainly did not in my opinion the decision to include her destroys the continuity of the film this is particularly troubling since it seems to demean not only the characters in the movie but also the history of immigration itself immigrants themselves were heroic figures fully capable of getting along without having to satisfied what i believer to be a veiled image of the white man's burden i wonder if someone will make a movie of irish immigrants which will include a sicilian woman as a major character the left elbow index considers seven aspects of film acting production sets dialogue artistry film continuity plot and character development on a scale from high of 10 for excellent 5 for average and 1 for needs help both film continuity and plot rate a low of 1 the continuity as discussed above is further degraded by the surrealistic ending does not a film of such important historical significance deserve more than a conclusion which reminds one of marc the plot is simple enough until it seems to become entangled with too much time in the old country too little time on the ship and too much emphasis on the ending the acting and character development is average since all the characters are fixed throughout the film and the inclusion of the anglo saxon speaking perfect english almost turns the movie into a satire where's groucho when you need him the production sets the dialogue and the artistry are very good each rating a 10 the sets in sicily on the ship and on ellis island are as good as one can find the dialogue is marvelous and the ethic singing is superb i agree with scorsese that listening to the sicilian dialect is a pleasure note that the immigrants speak of america not the united states the ideal vs the political reality the are many good artistic scenes with dreams of america gold coins raining and giant among the best the average left elbow index is 5 25 raised to a 7 0 when equated with the imdb scale one other notion seems to run through ellis island experience the tribulations of pass immigrants was grueling later in 2006 one only had to pay a coyote or boat owner and sneak into the county under the darkness of night no questions asked the movie is worth seeing but it appears that what one sees is
<START> this movie is very difficult to understand why do the couple want to divorce no reason is given we don't know anything about their life in lisbon and even nothing about marie's job we may only understand that a certain bore appeared in this life we don't even know who took the initiative of asking the divorce br br the way of filming is kind of special i didn't know the director's name before the end of the movie when i read it on the screen i understood why it was so slow only 42 shots in a hundred minutes i counted them it reminded me of some japanese movies i saw in the 90's in fact we must accept that this is the expression of another culture even if the set is occidental i don't know if this story would have suited a japanese couple br br one can see the logic of the scenes but the result is a bore anyway i decided to watch it to the end because i wanted to get the spirit and the meaning of it all in fact i only understood that the story of these two beings may not be over yet since the train leaves the station without marie this is few for such a long time i can't recommend this work
<START> i went to this film having no idea what to expect i actually took a date to it in the theaters when it first came out we both thoroughly enjoyed it and it helped to have someone to discuss it with after seeing it br br i only recommend seeing this film if you appreciate non mainstream movies it's not as disjointed as liquid sky or as fanciful as forbidden zone the original plot is very easy to follow there's a lot of subtle humor br br here's a quick summary of the plot if you are completely lost a big brother type government keeps tabs on everyone in society suddenly a new person appears and there's no data on him he appears insane he may or may not be the second coming of christ the over cautious government goes into a frenzy to find him and discover his true motives the ruler is also obsessed with immortality br br some scenes are frantic while others are completely low key we follow the lead character as he encounters all different kinds of people in society br br i didn't need my consciousness altered to enjoy the film but i know that some of my friends felt that helped br br split was also filmed around santa cruz and san francisco
<START> god where do i begin from start to finish i could not help to hate this movie vines vines that make cell phone noises oh yeah i'm so scared i'm going to rid the weeds of earth come on people the plot went nowhere when the group discovered the ruin and the village people no pun intended came to warn them and weapons in front of their faces don't worry amy jena malone was there to take pictures that whole scene really had me wondering why she didn't take pictures of her beau jeff johnathon tucker sawing off mathias joe anderson legs when the idiots first threw down the rope after mathias how the rope was at least ten feet from the ground but how it eventually was able to be a mere two to four feet from the ground i cannot begin to cover everything that was wrong about this movie there is just too much to cover i will say the graphics as far as the gore were terrific but it amounted to nothing since the acting and script were so terrifically bad
<START> this is the worst movie i have ever seen in my entire life unless you're into masochism never see it it was an insufferably long pointless eye harming depressing movie and will forever top my list of bad movies whoever wrote this movie is a sadist i almost cried at the end that's how bad it was i'd like to give it zero stars but since that's not an option i give it one
<START> brilliant aussie movie a little slow at the beginning but once it gets going you can't stop laughing when i originally saw the movie i vaguely knew the plot line as i am not sure if many people are aware that this movie is based on a true story and more so in particular the director and his mother obviously names have been changed i only knew this fact as the director is a friend of a friend of my family when i saw the movie somehow my kept it secret that we were to meet matthew newton after the screening such a nice gentleman except for a particularly nasty incident with his ex casting as well with sam neill and others a great reason to keep supporting the australian film industry
<START> cobb it sucked i learned nothing about the man i had not heard before the performances were over the top a scene where cobb and al are driving down a snowy road in search of women in reno has to be one of the worst conceived scenes in recent memory it's just plain stupid and unentertaining the flashback sequences were terrible and they used the same sequences over and over and over again if i saw the same shot of cobb fighting with someone at a base one more time i would have become physically ill by watching this 'movie' we get to learn nothing of what it was like in era we learn nothing about his relationship with his players nothing about his days as a manager nothing about his relationship with his family members other than that they don't like him' i thought when i sat down to view this film i would learn something about the era of baseball in which cobb played instead all i got to see was a retread of how cobb hated everything and everyone and how they hated him boy what a great movie sarcasm intended cobb is portrayed as a constant liar in the film so which one of his stories is supposed to be accurate who knows who cares no one will after viewing this piece of crap if you decide to rent this film make sure the fast forward button on your vcr is working as you will be tempted to use it repeatedly hopefully someday someone will make a good film about ty cobb i liked this film about as much as the people in it liked cobb which is to say i hated it now i know why i found it in the rent one get one free section of the video store i think i will ask for my fifty cents back from the video clerk since i can't get back the time i wasted watching this trash oh well what could i have possibly been thinking about a movie that would feature robert wuhl
<START> sir arthur conan doyle wrote a fair number of sherlock holmes accounts but the popularity of the famous detective insured that sequels in both print and on film would extend far beyond the author's works br br in sherlock holmes and the secret weapon holmes basil rathbone serves british intelligence in order to secure a swiss scientist's desperately needed bombsight the film is from 1942 and i wonder if the producers and writers realized how vital bombsight secrets were the american norden bombsight was guarded almost as as the new radar sets that would change the course of world war ii br br holmes and his faithful but expectedly bumbling companion dr watson nigel bruce battle dr moriarty lionel atwill as evil as moriarty has always been it's a bit of a shock to see he's signed up with hitler has the man no vestige of decency i guess not but atwill is deliciously evil br br the story is reasonably fast paced as holmes and watson seek to recover stolen bombsight components before they can be delivered to a u boat rathbone is his usual suave self and several disguises are well carried out br br this and other 1940s holmes stories are now available on dvd and oldies com has put out a very nice four disc set in a wooden box this film is included along with a bonus cd of an interview with the aged doyle the set for about 26 in major dvd and cd stores but i found this and other sets from oldies com at a warehouse club for 14 98 the transfers are very good br br very nice and relaxing late night viewing br br 7 10
<START> i've always said that there's nothing to beat the original form the comics i've been proved right again this like all of the other movie takes on the asterix series failed to impress the makers of this movie don't get it that what makes all the other such comic turned movies x men superman et al ventures successful is that they all deviate from the original comic versions and adapt it to make it more watchable agreed this movie did deviate in the sense that this movie was a cross of two asterix books viz asterix and the great crossing asterix and the also uncharacteristic of the asterix series save asterix and the secret weapon a love interest for one of the main characters was introduced all this ended up doing was create a childishly immature storyline the funny parts were very few and far between all in all a total waste of time and money watching this let alone at theaters even at home
<START> the melancholy of is an anime that left quite the impression on me partially for the characters many of whom fall into anime fantasy sci fi stereotypes but placing these stereotypes in the rather mundane setting of high school is a twist that i appreciated then there's the somewhat insane titular character who is something else a headstrong almost amoral girl with ridiculous amounts of talent and a secret that she's not aware of br br the set up for the series is a bit of a mind trip essentially unbeknown to herself is a sort of super powerful being capable of god like feats of creation and destruction as she can destroy and rebuild reality to her whim our narrator and primary character is a high schooler whose sympathy curiosity for appears to cause her to drag him against his will into a club she's starting to spice up her life because she's bored with the normal life searching for adventure she claims three more unusual members each with secrets and they all end up being dragged into her crazy schemes br br there is a bit of crazy but enjoyable philosophic consideration early on as we debate whether the world is merely creation as she gets bored of the old one and whether our characters exist to serve her or serve her to continue to exist or whether they could exist without her it's a bit of a conundrum but an enjoyable one all the same while sci fi fantasy scenarios do occasionally occur in the series i think the joy of the series lies in how normal things are while there remains this tension in knowing that if things are too boring might destroy the world in hopes of making it more interesting br br the art is clean and in line with what i've come to expect from the anime that typically gets imported to the us i like the character designs and while there isn't a whole lot of action in the series i think it sits better that way the series is narrated from the mind of and he doesn't play an omniscient narrator but only comments on what he knows and what he feels he's has a lot going on in his head but he doesn't actually speak a whole lot so it's good that we get to hear it br br the voice acting in the english dub is acceptable enough but i prefer the japanese acting over it there are some stranger aspects to the series some of which both parodies and traffics in fanboy ism which i found amusing for the first season i have to admit that there's a lack of closure as the series doesn't really have an larger story arc but seems to take things one at a time so it's an easy series to pick up and put down although i think that because of its rather entertaining qualities it's still quite hard to put down it's also based on a series of light novels and the author was directly involved in the writing of the series br br even though it's based on the novels i still wish that the over series had stronger story arcs but i love how naturally we get to watch these characters develop and how well the series can play out the quiet moments as well as the crazier ones seeing grow herself was quite a treat as well as watching the relationships develop between the sos brigade club br br it's not for everyone due to its mind twisting premise and extra ordinary beings in a mundane world setting it probably won't sate fanboys who are into action sci fi fantasy and might be a little too off kilter for the more relationship oriented drama lovers but for those willing to try out something a little different or that like strangely quirky series like this i think the melancholy of is a rather refreshingly unique and enjoyable series more please 9 10
<START> it is now clear that the true golden age of american film was from the mid 60s until just before the release of star wars before then there was too much hays code constricted pap with star wars the green light was lit for most films to be directed at children and morons a practice which continues to this day the seven ups truth be told contains a couple hackneyed lines of dialogue we can do this the easy way or we can do it the hard way is one but i'm damned if i can find anything else wrong with it in fact that line may not even have been stale when this film was made the seven ups demonstrates all that was right with the best films of the golden age sparse dialogue realistic acting real locations winter in a dirty new york has never looked better worse stories and yes the best car chase ever filmed bill hickman is the driver scheider is chasing you will recognize him from bullitt and the structure of the chase is fairly similar to the mcqueen one but i prefer scheider's facial intensity here the pacing the terrific close ups of the schoolchildren and the shattering conclusion that vw bug going about 2 mph always bothers me in the bullitt chase a stringy screechy score by don ellis sets the perfect mood the seven ups bleak grim action oriented grown up this is a film that couldn't be made today there's no gimmick for the kiddies or preposterous ending thank you philip roy scheider and tony lo bianco for as long as cop films are watched the seven ups and its 1970s brethren e g the french connection will set the standard
<START> boogie nights is full of surprises nothing quite prepares one for it its soul yes it does have soul whilst tackling the tackiest of subject matter with both a wry smile and respect cast and wonderful character development the performances somehow combine the best of stage acting with improvisation within a cinema verite style br br the plot proved richer than i expected and the underlying themes are teased out quite profoundly as each b grade human being is brought through crisis into perspective br br a dream case study the film resonates the raw truth of what we all know about self esteem parental love and lack of it attention love deficit and its manifestation in adulthood the desperate need to belong something for everyone here almost camouflaged as issues of untouchables and their separate milieu but of course they are universal br br the film works on a number of levels the ironic loop is that the milieu portrayed exists only because of the voyeur who happens to be watching the film br br boogie nights is non judgmental of its subject matter and characters a rarity it deserves every accolade it has achieved and more
<START> this movie was everything but boring it deals with reality to the people who think this movie was boring open your eyes to the real problems in our society our children are dying the consequences of alcohol and drug abuse are not to be ignored i work in a correctional facility as a chemical dependency counselor and i deal with these problems every day people of all ages and all walks of life are effected by the consequences of their alcohol and drug abuse it destroys families hurts people and leads to serious brain damage all kinds of health problems and death it is all preventable this movie should be shown in every high school in the world if anyone owns this movie and wants to sell it or sell me a copy please e mail me at net thank you
<START> this is an irredeemably stupid boring unimaginative lazily put together piece of garbage when watching a direct to video slasher pick it is only fair to expect the film to be trashy on some level but this goes beyond trashy it is just horrible on every level with a clichÃ© ridden script that manages to be both incredibly stupid and incredibly boring at the same time a cast of no name over actors and some of the worst special effects i have ever seen even fans of slasher movies won't be able to find anything here that would make this film a worthwhile use of an hour and a half br br the plot focuses on your usual group of young people who decide to spend the weekend at a remote farm in west virginia that one member of the group has recently inherited unfortunately for the teenagers the inherited land was once owned by a farmer who made sacrifices in order to help his crops grow or something stupid along those lines and now some evil scarecrows are out to kill everybody i don't know anything about writer director paul moore but i am assuming he is over ten years old and therefore he ought to be able to come up with something more original than killer scarecrows honestly br br the special effects bringing the scarecrows to life are laughably poor they often look like hardly more than costumes on sticks special effects such as these would have been considered rather rather poor twenty years ago but by todays standards they are nothing short of embarrassing br br this is a total waste of time for all viewers whether or not they are into horror movies if you must watch a slasher film rent any one of the friday the 13th or halloween movies most of them aren't very good but are certainly superior to crap like this
<START> i have just seen this delightful classic again after many years the next to last film directed by henry cornelius who died three years later at the age of only 45 the same age at which the film's male star larry harvey was also to die in 1973 three future directors were in the crew jack clayton associate producer guy green cinematographer and clive donner editor this film is based upon the autobiographical story 'goodbye to by the well known british author christopher which was first turned into a play by john van druten then made into this film then turned into a musical and finally filmed as which brought the amazing liza minelli to world attention with her voice which can shatter a glass at the distance of a mile appears as a character in the film under his own name he was gay but in those days that was illegal and could land him in prison so he disguises his proclivities under the description of being what he calls 'a confirmed this is the key to his platonic relationship with the wildly eccentric wacky promiscuous ever cheerful and thoroughly unique character whom he calls sally bowles the portrait of sally bowles in this film is a tour de force by the young julie harris who sweeps every scene into a magical and captivating web of sparkling personal charm what a vehicle for an actress with plenty of charm of her own it is one of the great cinematic performances of the 1950s is played to perfection by the young lawrence harvey in a finely judged performance which never allows the comedy to go over the edge and even the moments of farce bordering on slapstick remain somehow 'almost larry is so funny at portraying a wimpish hypochondriac what an irony considering the total lack of shown by his bravery and stoicism in the last year of his life as he died from terminal stomach cancer and behaved with such dignity and lack of complaint i knew him well in the last three years or so and he was a generous warm and modest person he adored his little girl domino now alas also tragically dead this film was his finest early performance to be followed by his spectacular work in 'room at the top' 1959 'summer and 1961 and 'the manchurian candidate' 1962 larry was often undervalued in his lifetime because he was too handsome was often cast as a cad and glamour boys are not always accepted as good actors but many of the finest actresses played opposite him and they were in no doubt of his abilities and he was a strong lead in many of the most important films of his time if he had lived beyond middle age he would have gone from strength to strength and become a 'grand old man' of the screen sitting in his house in one day he gave me a glass of his usual white wine from a huge barrel which he had brought from some foreign cellar i said he always gave me such delicious wine what was it he proudly answered that it was a which he had chosen himself at the vineyard in france and had shipped over specially he then added with extreme wistfulness 'you know i've been waiting for four years for someone to comment on it and ask me what it is and you are the first person who has ever done so ' what mattered to him was to be recognised for having taste in wine and his more glamorous friends had denied him that satisfaction in this film anton diffring gives a touching early performance as an earnest young man later he was to have to play nazi officers far too much poor fellow and the young shelley winters plays a rich german jewish girl in her usual noisy but effective manner but it was not too difficult as she was a noisy jewish girl herself anyway this film has such an air of joie de vivre about it that it is pure delight
