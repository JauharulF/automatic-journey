<START> crossfire feels like an underdeveloped masterpiece it's well acted and beautifully filmed but thinly written and way too short as is it's just a decent police procedural with hints of film noir at its zenith in 1947 and social commentary also trendy at the time thrown in for good measure it's remembered today as one of the first two hollywood films to deal with anti semitism and as being much better than the similarly themed gentleman's agreement no mean feat but its real subject is the difficulty that wwii soldiers as trained killers were having as they made the transition to civilian life for a more genteel take on this topic try the best years of our lives a man is beaten to death in the first few frames of the film we do not see his attacker the movie is about the investigation of this murder which is actually pretty straightforward but it takes some unnecessary detours like when the main suspect a depressed soldier winds up in the apartment of gloria grahame a dance hall hooker with a really weird pimp played by paul kelly there's also a civics lecture halfway through the movie that slows the proceedings to a crawl and the ending is tidy enough for a cop show but otherwise it's a pretty decent mystery still what a great noir it could have been director edward drops a few hints at the subject of the original novel homosexuality not anti semitism like when sadistic creep monty seethes at the image of his friend mitch talking with a strange man at a bar and the cast is excellent robert ryan makes for a very credible cretin and even becomes a little sympathetic in his final scenes not unlike peter lorre as the child murderer in m he deserved an oscar but lost to edmund gwenn that year you can't beat santa claus robert mitchum is onhand as a soldier friend of the accused killer was mitchum a great actor or a great star someone else can figure that out but his sleepy eyes and bemused half smile work very well here since they imply that his character knows something everyone else doesn't and he does and robert young as the detective assigned to the murder is surprisingly gritty his usual avuncular affability even when he has to deliver the civil rights sermon midway through the picture there's no question that bogart or tracy would have been brilliant in the role but neither of them were at rko in 1947 so you'll just have to deal with dr still young is good enough to make you wish someone had cast him in a detective drama instead of father knows best which he hated and which drove him to alcoholism and suicide attempts the man deserved better than smarm and sanka
<START> ah yet another seagal movie in no less than a few mere months arrive to populate the video store shelves as bad as submerged no but that is not saying much like perfume on a pig br br seagal is professional thief who wants to quit but goes for one last job only to be double crossed by his boss he lands in prison and is befriended by a gangster who helps him to break out and seek payback br br its good to see seagal finally not playing an agent cop or what he usually plays we actually get a usa location in las vegas it seems then an eastern european territory as usual there is no wire fu either here don does an okay job br br however most of the action and fight scenes with stevie are clearly doubles scenes from other movies a lack of realism and logic in even tiniest situation seagal and make a so so team inspiring unintentional laughs one minute sighs the rest br br several notable faces turn up to slum it sleepy kevin tighe is a long way from his emergency days nick mancuso shows up in sleepwalking mode to take a check no more rappers please at this point the action scenes and plots are more predictable and recycled generically more than ever its a stale scene that seagal needs to get out of or hang it up he should have gotten out a while ago
<START> idea is great spoiled big time by the judges br br why make fun of people if what the inventors say is true and as most of them say they spent their life saving on the invention the minimum is to reject the idea without making fun out of the people br br also it shows when they want to accept an idea by the that they added to the judges br br the only one i respect out of the judges is the one who always sits on the right of the table he is a respectable person br br of course the english snob who claims to be a business man wearing a suite doesn't make you one pal br br last but not least the big guy who sits between the english and the wake up man the is no job called and inventor for you to call yourself one an inventor is an attribute not a job man br br i think they wanted to add someone like simon from the american idol they thought it worked there it can work here as well the context is different and the idea is totally different br br it is a good idea and they could have done a good show out of it if they just change the judges and remove their act and attitude br br just stop making fun of the people
<START> this is a phenomenal movie truly one of the best movies i have ever watched i am a serious critic and it takes much to stir me but this movie had all the right combinations for stirring the passion of the actors without the overacting the aching for all the characters involved the serious and subtle truths about marriage and divorce all make this a must see movie despite the fact that it is 1970s this is definitely not an old movie but a classic vintage movie i hope you engage with it as i did when you consider how volatile relationships of all kinds can be when you also consider how deep pain associated with love can be and how the hardest decisions to make will always be the most painful but once they are made the pain will subside but only gradually this movie certainly demonstrates that the most volatile relationships are not necessarily weak relationships and that leaving certainly is not synonymous with lost lack of love the of this movie certainly emanates from a place deep within someone's heart and mind
<START> let me preface by stating that i have lived in louisville kentucky all of my life i grew up about Â½ mile from waverly in the we would pull our down road and cross dixie highway to go sleigh riding on waverly hill many times during the winter of 76 77 we would climb into the tunnel to warm ourselves the place was still being run as a geriatric center at the time we would go all the way through the tunnel up the hill to bang on what we thought was the door to the morgue i have to be honest the only sensation we felt was that we were getting away with something we should not be doing i would have to say we went up that tunnel over 50 times that winter nothing stranger than teen aged boys acting stupid ever happened i love the fact that it is getting attention after all these years one evening when i was young we looked out our front porch and it appeared that the entire hill was on fire there was an older hospital on the hill that burned down it burned for hours while the entire neighborhood sat outside and watched the thing that gets lost about waverly is that many people survived tb there let's face itÂthe doctors back then did everything they thought was correct to save people it took a lot of guts for people to work there knowing how contagious tb was too much is focused on those who suffered i also have traveled into the building several times in the early 70's we would go and visit shut ins in the nursing home through a church youth group by the way the doors there were not prison like steel doors with chains and as portrayed in the film they were wooden and too open it did smell of urine and feces and you saw the occasional open gown associated with patients with dementia it was true that it was closed by the state in the early 80's a lot of that may have to do with the age of the building or the right guy wasn't paid off this is after all kentucky the part of the documentary that turned me off the most was the piling of bodies into a cart if i am not mistaken it appears to have been holocaust footage that was added for dramatic effect it left me with a sour taste in my mouth for the filmmaker i am a skeptic when it comes to ghosts i do believe that many around here truly think the place to be haunted waverly for me however symbolized a fun place for adventure for a boy with a sled
<START> i just purchased this movie because i love to donate to operation smile the charity on which the movie was based but i found the writing of the movie to be very strange it t does not really focus so much on operation smile or similar organizations like the smile train and their herculean efforts to relieve the suffering of children born with facial deformities in third world countries no it concentrates on an american teenage volunteer katie whose over privileged life in malibu california includes a mother who brings her to a doctor so that she'll have birth control pills in her before she sleeps with her boyfriend what is this birth control nonsense supposed to do titillate the audience it's 2005 i'd be more surprised if in 2005 a malibu teen wasn't on birth control and even if she is so what and who cares contrasting katie is the character of lin in china a girl with a facial deformity who missed last year's chance to get an operation and this year does not want to have one neither character is written in such a way that the audience can really identify with let alone understand the motivations of either girl on the other hand the actors do an adequate job of trying to play the bad hand they were dealt by whoever wrote this ridiculous script the best performance was by the gentleman playing lin's father although much of his dialogue is in chinese and subtitled operation smile deserved to be honored by a much better movie than this
<START> the lifetime channel aired this in october but i only got around to watching it now it's the old eternal triangle again Â small town connecticut boy dave ford matt long has a quick fling with his best friend's girlfriend emily emmanuelle on the eve of his departure for law school in new york thinks about her for the next five years while he isn't doing contracts and briefs runs into her again when he returns home after the death of his father on the eve of a big exam five years later and gets involved with her romantically again but director and co writer matthew cole weiss goes way over the top framing the whole thing in flashback as dave confesses to murdering emily her husband and another one of her lovers in front of here comes the spoiler a lesbian cop who's also a flame of emily's weiss overdoes the effect by which dave gets to see chunks of his previous life flash before his eyes even before he's actually dead cutting those in even while dave and emily are having sex and thereby ruining the soft core porn shots that give even some otherwise pretty lame lifetime movies at least a bit of audience appeal i couldn't help but flash back myself to james m cain and how much better he wrote women like this in his classic thrillers all adapted into hit movies the postman always rings twice double indemnity and mildred pierce it also doesn't help that the film ends with the bad guys the bad girls actually triumphant and the decent if naÃ¯ve and stupid hero seemingly on his way to the lethal injection table Â or that the actors playing the people dave and emily are cheating on are both better looking than they are incidentally though this film went straight to cable in the u s there were some blank spots on the soundtrack indicating where swear words were so i presume this got a theatrical release somewhere in the world
<START> i usually can tolerate twisted movies but this one is really a sick obsessive self absorbed movie br br firstly the writer director is totally a self absorbed guy full of sick jokes that are not funny at all secondly he is also a sick pervert who manipulates and poisons children's mind i can't believe my ears when i heard the sick and perverted monologues spoken by the kids br br i really feel sorry for zane and devon matthews they are both very talented but fell prey to eric schaeffer's dirty little known movie br br and what the hell happened to eric good looking face i mean he met this girl that he's supposed to marry but he wasn't in the wedding in fact there is this bald guy in his place did time really fly that fast br br anyway don't waste your time to see this movie unless you want to be poisoned and manipulated by one sick eric schaeffer
<START> don't know what film or version jeff saw but this entire film was awesome not just poitier and going the story was riveting suspenseful and engaging and for the guy complaining about historical accuracy get real yes there were some black deputy in the indian territory but they had no authority to arrest whites outside of indian territory as a rule they did not patrol but exercised warrants on criminals only i did find it odd that corby didn't seem to have indian friends i know their numbers were diminished but it still strikes me as strange even as corby returned to his people his indian cohorts remain faceless and nameless
<START> i was surprised that i liked this movie but it reminded me of a 2004 version of the first friday the 13th there were a number of cheesy elements yet at the same time there were many cool ones the story line was good predictable if you have seen more than one or two horror movies but full of one liners to make it worthwhile there are some memorable scenes worth watching a few issues i had with the plot had to do with the continuity of the characters for instance in the opening scene the scarecrows which were humans on stakes whose blood was drained to grow the crops looked very real but later in the film they looked more like fake scarecrows wearing blue colored masks there were more than several gaps in the plot and the acting was mediocre but at least it sounded like how real people talk unlike hollywood movies where the dialogue is really fake sounding when you think about it the culmination of the last scene when the main character says i'm not a baker i'm a and the head off of the scarecrow is satisfying as his friends have for the most part been killed off by these creatures at that point
<START> obviously a number of agents didn't see beyond dollar signs when they signed up their clients for this 117 minute to the courtesan complex br br sure the film could have been alright had the 1 million been left out of it seriously the amount of the check doesn't matter prostitution is still prostitution and no amount of love conquers all can change the fact that no marriage vows ever meant to imply for richer for poorer for pimping as in fidelity picture the story otherwise though 2 kids flat broke borderline desperate and completely stupid they collide with wealthy business man kids' marriage is strained by imperfect times and the fact that the husband is something of a loser enter mr tuxedo oozing charm and stability a virtual magnet for the ticking biological clock and with him the wife's temptation tensions suspense whom will she choose maybe under those conditions i could actually care as is frankly redford's selfish and manipulative playboy winds up the sympathetic character a woman who will sell herself is just about what a guy deserves who will pimp out his wife the indecent proposition makes the husband a total loser deficient in every positive male characteristic and makes the wife a cheap strumpet seduced by money rather than confused by another potential love a woman devoid of moral center and self respect br br all the impressive talent acting directing cinematography wasted on this film and it was an impressive amount couldn't save it from its splashy but too trashy 1 million pitch line if i see this turkey at one more bridal shower i'm going to roast it or maybe cross it with titanic and pitch the tape in the ocean
<START> when i saw this film the first time i was very impressed concerning the kind of atmosphere the director creates it is also very interesting to see how they imagine the near future in the year 1974 if you see the film you will see a lot of sets and customs which are called freaky and modern again today br br the topic of the film deals with the old question what is real and what is illusion if you see the matrix you will find a lot of similarities but the two films are not comparable at all because welt am is art and the matrix is entertainment if prefer the first one br br unfortunately i lost my video copy of it br br
<START> there are many reasons i'm not a fan of fact based films but more than any other is how the filmmakers give themselves creative license over the story if they have such great imaginations then why not use that talent to make something original otherwise stick to the facts this could have been an okay movie if only they had done just that ed gein was an insanely frightening human being it's been said if you were to take michael myers jason voorhees and leatherface wrap them into one person ed gein would still be sicker scarier so why can't someone make a movie about him that can convey this when will they figure out that reality is ultimately scarier than fiction br br i've read books and watched news programs about him and now i'm not a screenwriter or anything but i believe there's enough documentation on gein that it shouldn't take a whole lot to write a story about all these atrocities he committed without creating murders that had never even been documented i'm aware that he was only found guilty of 2 murders but with all the evidence found in his home and barn there should have been plenty of other ways to put this film together rather than using the deputy's relationship with his mother and girlfriend as filler and far too much of it br br i guess what i'm wondering is this why at the end of the movie did i know more about the supporting characters than i did about ed gein why didn't we get to know his mother father and brother and the relationships between them what made him the psychopath he was what abuse he endured as a child that may have contributed to the man he became instead the only thing we got of his childhood were flashes of him as a little boy running br br in the end i give it 4 10 stars thats 2 for the gore and 2 for kane hodder even though it was kind of bad casting in my opinion considering gein was a man and possibly effeminate and hodder is anything but small and nowhere near what i would consider feminine maybe i was just excited because he was jason voorhees
<START> this film starts out with all the moody promise of a great contemporary noir western after the ill conceived opening flashback sequence anyway the scenery is beautifully desolate the characters achingly isolated while some of the acting is less than believable the plot ultimately delivers enough tension and twists to make this movie worth a look
<START> i watched two very different holmes adventures this morning but you would be amazed at the similarities br br the was presumably the first collaboration between basil rathbone if i were king romeo and juliet and nigel bruce and director roy william neill it was not their first sherlock holmes adventure as they did one a couple of years before this br br the made an excellent team but i prefer the hammer version which i will talk about later br br holmes relies on a lot of disguises to do his work and i am constantly amused by the mannerisms displayed when they figure something out they always seem to dash on when they find a new clue br br the story itself about keeping a bomb site from the germans in wwii was interesting and kept you focused on the mystery
