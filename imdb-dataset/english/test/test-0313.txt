<START> anyone familiar with horror films knows that most of them are not scary at all some people enjoy gorefests with subpar story lines and character development i personally enjoy horror films that focus on atmosphere and interesting concepts e g a tale of two sisters kairo etc whatever the type of horror film one personally likes there are only a select few that really scare you is one of them br br this is a documentary style movie which means that the entire film is a compilation of video clips that are linked by the legend of a demonic entity named the premise is that a journalist filmed his own footage by interviewing people associated with the demonic rituals associated with then compiled footage from other sources that link with his research what results is a relentlessly chilling experience that feels very real and very disturbing despite the fact that the story itself is fake br br some have compared with the blair witch project but the only similarity is the documentary style one obvious difference between the films is that scares the viewer by linking events to one another using different sources for example the journalist records the exterior of a house that he is researching and sees something strange on the porch later in the film a clip from another character's home video introduces that very same strange occurrence the viewer's memory links the two incidents and chills start running down their spine another example involves a television show with a child psychic who answers every single question correctly except for one in fact her answer is so wrong that the viewer may wonder what the filmmakers were thinking later on however that wrong answer turns out to be linked to an extremely disturbing event this is intelligent film making indeed br br another difference between and blair witch is that provides not one but two very long finales the second of which is placed a minute after the credits start to roll and is the single greatest scare scene in the history of horror cinema i do not say such things lightly it totally wrecked me in a wonderous way br br other aspects of film making are well done the legend and ritualistic background of are very interesting and most of the actors did a good job the only over the top performance comes from a guy who's supposed to be crazy anyway so that's expected the cinematography is intentionally gritty because all of the footage is supposed to represent videos shot on camcorders japanese films are not known for their special effects but the effects used here were awesome in some cases they create an other worldly feel e g the static interference or the first finale but in other cases they are alarmingly realistic e g the second finale br br when all is said and done goes down as the scariest film i've ever seen i would go so far as to say that there is no film in existence that provides such sheer terror from beginning to end like does see it now
<START> ha ha oh no what to say about this film yes green eggs and ham makes more sense than this movie where does one start a lot of the good stuff has already been said so i won't divulge into the same territory i believe you already have the movie summary so i won't paraphrase the movie br br first let's start the with good br br 1 if you like psychological thrillers that make you think as i do the first 29 minutes of this film will be for you this is one of those films that illustrates the question that you always talked about on long car drives when you were kids like what if you had to chose one family member live another to die or what if you had to die by drowning or fire this movie is a great concept bottom line br br 2 the wardrobe group did a fine job with bringing us back to the 70's realistically though how difficult is that to accomplish okay that's about all for the good let's talk about the bad br br 1 this movie feels like a 2 hour twilight zone episode this could easily be 90 minutes that might have made the movie tolerable br br 2 do you remember in the movie from dusk til dawn the movie started out interesting then halfway through the movie it just took a degrading turn yep same thing here i would venture to say that the writers started with a concept then had no idea what to do with it i've gotten deeper thought provocation out of transformers 2 br br 3 yes we get the dilemma in the film we understand the philosophical undertones and utilitarian approach but the story jumped around way too much didn't elaborate on the current story arc and took a forgive me completely insulting direction br br 4 the ending didn't make sense not at all none br br this movie would make a great term paper in college philosophy 101 if you're board out of your mind in bed sick or have ever enjoyed being hit in the face with a pie and can view this free on line by all means go for it br br if you need to pay anything to view this movie don't waste your time you're better off watching old howie mandel stand up on you tube you will get more philosophical stimulation your sock drawer
<START> this is not a new film it is a re cut of 1994's emmanuelle queen of the galaxy and it has been significantly truncated warning many characters appear in the credits that have been cut from the movie br br if you want to see this one in its original form pick up queen avoid this one at all costs as the cuts make it even than it was originally
<START> jude law gives keanu reeves a run for his money as the most wooden actor around renee z's character is straight out of the beverly hillbillies and the two leads have about as much chemistry as darth vader and queen the bad guys are the worst kind of cliche and there's not a subtle moment in the film incredible that some critics actually liked this movie
<START> spoilers br br i've heard some gripe about the special effects but that should detract from the movie the movie is a suspense film and it's very good at that so from that stand point this movie rocks franke rocks enjoy to one's plastic hearts content so no complaints for this movie unless you watch the english dub which is a total farce it creates the illusion it's a b movie br br one complaint i do have is the music video on the dvd it doesn't say who sings it i'd love to know br br 8 10 br br quality 10 10 entertainment 10 10 replayable 5 10
<START> i raced to the library to check out this miniseries after having just finished listening to the marvelous talking books unabridged version of the book the first half of this tv version is really very good but it stumbles quite a bit in the second half the relationship with the trustee is overplayed and conflicts are inserted between jean and joe that don't exist in story unwisely in my opinion as they greatly diminish the power of their love story i was disappointed to find that the wonderful bryan brown's joe seemed a lot and much less appealing than the man in the book but helen jean was really quite good i think they would have had to make this a 10 hour miniseries to develop the outback story properly but all that said i did watch whole thing in more or less one go and did appreciate its merits all the while wishing that someone would do a less soapy remake
<START> it's said that this film is or was banned in the us since it was released since there is no information on imdb i must rely on my other sources and believe it if this is really true the movie is even more hurtful and frightening and is it is anyway br br the movie is a so called mockumentary although i think the topic is too serious call it like that it creates a scenario where america is like a military state and all revolutionary objects are arrested immediately without proof after an obligatory tribunal they have to decide if they go to prison for some years or choose the punishment park in that they have to walk through the desert for three days to reach an american flag posted 50 miles ahead while they're are followed by police and army troops br br the movie itself pretends to be a documentary about these incidents and follows both the and the hunting through the desert filmed by european film crews all the facts are explained the ask questions and film everything people stare directly into the camera shouting at it it seems very very real talking about realism here is nonsense this movie is not about how to make a realistic film it is about how such a film would look like if it was real and it certainly would look like this if it would be filmed anyway in an state like this there surely wouldn't be a european film crew allowed to film those things br br there are many things that frighten us the defendants are people from all social classes political leaders musicians authors unemployed etc they seem to be hopeless rebellious or scared they are no heroes they talk a lot in the tribunal knowing it doesn't lead to anything saying nevertheless all they said in speeches and books and songs before one says he's not afraid to die is this true well he doesn't have to run through the desert hunted by cops the defendants have no chance or at least their only chance the decision between prison and punishment park is no chance really the way they decide in the end and the way film ends makes it clear that this kind of heroism is suicide br br these remind us a lot of in the third reich the officials use the same kind of idealistic ignoring all the arguments from the defendants starting to scream at them and then telling them they should be quiet they warn the defendants of watching their language and insult them much more they ask them questions the defendants can not answer but it's never they should these scenes are a statement about what we call justice br br the scenes in the desert are on a different level when we see the prisoners for the first time we realize that they realize they haven't got a chance seeing the desert and the mountains feeling the sun and the thirst they don't have a clue how they should stand this free days the film crew follows them and talks to them while they try to escape this madness they argue should they play the game or escape or revolt it all leads to the same and no one is surprised some will question if such parks would exist in reality in such a state why not it empties the prisons and allows the government to punish the revolutionaries as they want to it is not a gas chamber but the nazis killed jews before concentration camps were built the comparison is fair since they is no real difference br br the movie is scary and depressing the problems that are talked about sound to familiar to ignore these is not science fiction talking about poverty unemployment and crime is not utopic the film shows us that government and democracy as it is presented to us is not only useless but dangerous it also shows us that revolution is not definitely the solution the defendants seem to be confused because they don't really know how to fight this they do things but for nothing even is this delivers no solution to us it still is a statement br br to me the most frightening thing is the fact of the banning of this movie here we have a film that accuses the loss of freedom moral and peace it accuses the government a fictional nevertheless to be dangerous and inhuman and such a film is banned think about it when you see the american flag the next time
<START> a plot that is dumb beyond belief however that said it must be admitted the lead actors go at their roles as though it were shakespeare and that is as it should be it isn't their fault the writer seems to be in a coma br br hats off to what is really a very cunning performance by joanna she proves that just because it isn't on the page doesn't mean a role can't be seized and dug into and she does so with gusto good for her br br ditto to christine elise who is called upon to be little more than confused and weepy but goes way beyond what is asked of her by the script br br and to grant show as well a graduate of daytime and prime time soaps ryan's hope melrose place he is always versatile and underrated his primary drawback seems to be his impossible to ignore good looks he is a sturdy well grounded actor capable of much more than he is generally given the opportunity to do br br the rest of the cast is basically window dressing br br the direction is adequate and the script as i alluded to is fairly idiotic br br watch this one to enjoy three good actors in the leads taking delight in performing some much needed scenery chewing it's fun
<START> i went to see this movie with a lady of mine who doesn't like heist movies but she enjoyed it i missed bits and pieces of the movie all the way through it is a story about edward norton and a crew stealing some gold and norton deciding he wants it all to himself then the people he betrayed want to get back at him it is a well put together funny and action packed film that i need to see again the whole way through one of my top movies of the summer so far br br a big help to the entertainment factor is seth green i dont know anyone who doesnt like seth green and he adds to the flavor he plays a guy who says he created and his stole it from him he is a computer genious who is a wonder to watch br br it was said that norton didn't want to do this film but if i were him i would have wanted to sign on br br the only problem is that it is very predictable any movie go er should be able to say in their own mind what is happening before it happens br br my biggest complaint with the film is eddie nortons choice of facial hair the thick yet thin mustache and a small pike on his chin he looks like an 80's porn star for gods sake
<START> swoon focuses on leopold and homosexual relationship a facet of the case that has been mostly and unjustly ignored since their trial even by leopold himself in his autobiography but even in its treatment of this swoon over does it by far worse it twists combines and straight out alters the details of the case which will irritate anyone who knows much about it while at the same time managing to confuse those who are not familiar with it while it is an interestingly made film swoon stinks br br 1 out of 10 awful
<START> jay craven's criminally ignored film is a sober breath of fresh air in the generally narcissistic and derivative world of independent film first off the photography is pure aesthetic pleasure capturing all of the gloomy beauty of northern new england in late autumn cinematographer paul ryan did 2nd unit on malick's days of heaven second the performances are uniformly excellent rip noel is charming and is at once sensitive and exuberant to say nothing of a fine supporting cast overall though it is a tribute to the narrative strength of the film that the story maintains a strong and lively pace while still unfolding in its own time and the film comes to a conclusion natural and genuine that nevertheless does not seem expected this is one of the rare cells of dignity in the independent film world a film that explores a small piece of the intersection between humans and history
<START> the plot for black mama white mama revolves around two female inmates at a women's prison in the phillipines one black and one white these two women are thrown together in the prison pam grier is lee daniels lee is incarcerated in the hellish women's prison for dancing as a harem girl br br lee's boyfriend owes her part of his profits from his drug dealing activities lee is mainly interested in breaking out of the prison to get hold of her drug money so that she can leave the phillipines and assume a better life margaret markov plays karen brent a white women from a privileged background who is also a revolutionary karen has joined a group of revolutionaries determined to change the corrupt political system she's captured by authorities and held as a political prisoner br br the story line takes off when karen and lee break out of the prison they were in together the two of them also happened to be chained together at the wrist as they flee they also fight with each other because they have different goals to pursue naturally they hate being chained together but they also realize that they must put aside their differences to help each other survive while they evade capture br br if this film seems very similar to the big bird cage it's because much of the cast in the two films is the same as well as their location in the phillipines roger corman has always had a consistent stable of actors that he used in all of his 70s b movies besides pam grier sid haig roberta collins claudia jennings betty anne rees and william smith were also among the many actors that were frequently cast in corman's aip films br br like the big bird cage black mama white mama relies on too much gory violence to be palatable pam grier conveys her usual tough chick persona in this film and shows her competence as a female action heroine margaret markov is less effect in her portrayal of the revolutionary karen she just seems to fragile and well coiffed to be a dedicated political guerrilla except for sid haig as the colorful ruben the rest of the cast is forgettable br br this film has little entertainment value unless excessive heinous acts of violence are your thing only the performances by pam grier and sig haig make this film worth watching
<START> i saw the preview in and thought it could be a cool film turns out it is an awful garbage there isn't much nudity in the film not to mention not having much sex either there were just some dumb and corny dialogues along with some dancing you usually expect to see during audition in our case you may even see it in the actual films conclusion i ain't got none for it just leave it alone
<START> steven seagal is back here with his third film released this year of course as a one time fan who has become increasingly disgruntled i can say it comes as no surprise that this is pretty lame firstly the film made headlines because of apparent problems in production due to seagal he would turn up late on set change the script crew etc and generally cause problems for the director don e faun leroy his lack of talent his trouble enough this also happens in their second collaboration the upcoming mercenary which promises to be just as bad as this garbage this also marks a big turning point in seagal's career because this film is the first of his to really dig out the stock footage there was a little in ticker but this film takes the biscuit they borrow bits from the order a van damme movie seagals biggest rival in dtv movies no code of conduct undisputed and also an entire action sequence from the little known peter weller starring vehicle top of the world interestingly the car chase stolen from weller's epic made almost 10 years ago and ironically probably cheaper than this garbage is actually by far the best action scene of the film i was shocked enough when dolph lundgren had a brief stint in the stock action video world which thankfully he has escaped from seagal though is the leader of the dtv action market currently with van damme and snipes his main rivals seagal still manages to sell movies and for the life of me i don't know how surely the fans must be getting bored of this awfulness longing for a return to the likes of above the law the story here is totally lame in fact the film has so many plot holes it doesn't bare thinking about for example at the end of a film there's a little girl that seagal apparently knows at an orphanage who he gives a necklace to why i don't know but we never see her at all in the rest of the movie or hear her mentioned seagal has a girlfriend in this movie who at the beginning of the film is with a psychic and she becomes haunted by visions which by the end of the film are never explained and mean nothing the film is so ridiculously glued together by a series of meaningless pap that it becomes headache inducing this is by far seagal's dumbest movie seagal himself is as wooden as ever however to his credit he doesn't get dubbed in this one as far as i could tell seagal does however feel the need to talk like he is a gangsta rapper making me long for the days he would don his brooklyn italian american accent in his classic early films he also has a painfully unfunny double act with who i assume is a rapper it is funny how producers seem to think that the combo of seagal plus hip hop star seems to work because his team up with in exit wounds was his most successful film since under siege clearly though if no one has heard of the rapper it won't work this is an action film though and so the action itself must be judged unfortunately the action that didn't come form the nu image back catalogue is strictly routine there are a few small fight scenes with some classic seagal aikido but when 90 is performed by his stunt double who really does have a rigorous work out in this film it really doesn't impress much there are also some standard gun fights which really only have some nice violent and bloody going for them all in all this is a painfully boring experience and once again i'm left giving the same verdict seagal has lost it i keep asking the years old question now why do people still watch his movies that is all very well and good as a question but the sad bastard that i am continues to watch his films in the deluded hope he may do something good once again chances are slim unlike seagal's ever expanding waistline 1 2
<START> i do not know what today's movie goers expect but after 68 years of movie watching well maybe i didn't watch many movies in the first 9 10 years so make that 58 years of movie watching i expect to be entertained not bored to tears assaulted by continuous profanity every other word and idiotic scenes of violence that are presented in with no other purpose in mind but to show blood splattering and body parts being mangled surveillance is one of those movies that was made by people who have no imagination little if any talent a total inability to tie scenes together and an unreasonable trait of letting a scene go on and on long after the purpose for it has elapsed that anyone would ever think that this was a worthwhile movie when it is nothing more that hollywood garbage is beyond me as a combat veteran i have seen violence blood and gore in many forms and movies like we were soldiers is about as violent as a movie can get but it has redeeming value surveillance must have been dreamed up by persons in a drug induced stupor with no writing ability no directorial training no experience in film editing and a total lack of contact with reality just a stupid movie of two serial killers posing as fbi agents setting up a scenario to kill some stupid foul mouth cops etc a high priced piece of garbage that only an idiot could like
