<START> cannibal ferox 1 outta 5 stars miserable excuse for a movie which you might enjoy if you really like boring nonsensical jungle movies spiced up with scenes of graphic violence a pair of drug dealers on the run from the mob travel to the jungles of paraguay to search for and cocaine they meet up with another young traveler and his two hot babe sidekicks one of whom is an anthropologist seeking to prove definitively that cannibalism does not and has not ever existed one of the two dealers turns out to be a bit of a psychopath and he tortures and kills a couple of natives in order to get them to tell him where they hide their jewels and how they could even tell him when he doesn't seem to speak their language in the first place well the natives are suddenly not too thrilled with white folks in their jungle and capture them all for some torture poor acting poor plot and poor direction not a decent moment of suspense in the whole dreary 90 minutes even the special effects are not particularly convincing though a couple of shots will still make most viewers cringe the only good scene in the whole movie is when the two women are imprisoned in a mud hut and seem to touch the hearts of the natives with their rendition of red river valley the following is a quote from the movie but i wouldn't be surprised if many viewers weren't saying exactly the same thing by that point oh god please let her die soon oh let her die soon and let me die soon too please
<START> no gore no blood no gratifying death scenes dumb dumb dumb dumb dear god sitting through this movie made me sick sick sick sick very boring extremely boring br br theres not even a humorous aspect to this film i cant find a good thing to say about it other than the lead guy had a nice body i guess definitely not worth the fifty cents i paid to rent it
<START> wow this movie is bad think flashdance with ninjas the worst part is when a sword is supposed to be floating in midair but you can see the strings or maybe the worst part is the gigantic eye patch that looks like a coaster that the good ninja wears actually there are so many bad parts i can't make up my mind which is the worst i can't believe anyone actually put up the money to have this thing made the only redeeming value is that it is good to laugh at
<START> beats me how people can describe this adolescent exercise as film noir true there's a gun a bottle a dame the lead is a private eye but that ain't what makes the genre folks this thing plays like reheated tv cop show stuff lots of bloody beating lousy continuity with a dash of chinatown memories thrown in pretty hard to watch beyond the first 10 minutes you want contemporary feel watch anything by john dahl
<START> who reads these comments may think we may have in hand a great movie i am portuguese and i'm ashamed that this film became a blockbuster in portugal it can't really call this cinema the direction and mise en scene is basic even ron howard does better the script is bad and pretentious a really bad tarantino the cast is covered in tv stars models and reality show stars that don't no nothing about acting when you put in a movie this ingredients of course that the fans of this kind of tv shows will all go see i am also surprised that people who make comments here in imdb say that this movie is a masterpiece i thought that this site was only for people who truly like cinema and understand a little bit of it all the movies made to be blockbusters in always use the same ingredients and are always awful if you think this movie is reasonable please don't say your love movies and cinema
<START> i really loved this movie and have spent several years trying to get it it is just not available and it has not been on tv for many many years i enjoyed it and the songs because it had something different to say and made you think how every person looks at something from different also we often don't appreciate something we have till it is no longer there br br my 12 year old daughter just the music and is entranced with some of the songs someday i hope to get a copy of the film so she can have an opportunity to view it oh would i love to see it again too br br
<START> this video has heartfelt memories it has a great cast and all the actors did a great job i have been searching to buy this video if anybody knows of where i can purchase please e mail me i really want to add this to my collection
<START> ninja hunter aka wu tang vs ninja is pure entertainment from start to finish due to its outrageous characters nonsensical plot and lack of any pretensions whatsoever the makers of this film have given us a truly ott masterpiece which has to be seen to be believed br br the plot centres around wu tang villain abbot white who wants to destroy the shaolin monks and become supreme martial artist in order to do so he teams up with a clan of ninjas led by three masters Â gold ninja white mustachioed ninja and black ninja Â and succeeds in destroying the shaolin temple and most of its inhabitants however there are some survivors it is their job to pass on the knowledge of the shaolin finger jab to a new generation who must defeat the ninjas and abbott white if peace and order is to be restored br br unfortunately abbott white is a difficult foe to beat since he is able to make himself virtually indestructible by sucking the life force out of hot naked chicks an excuse for some welcome gratuitous nudity br br other treats in store for viewers include loads of very impressive fighting despite some of it being speeded up some really amazing outfits the aforementioned gold ninja abbott white's yin yang suits and even some assassins wearing swastika tunics a ninja turning into a flying carpet plus some cheesy gore for good measure and i nearly forgot to mention the really impressive eyebrows on display in this movie Â surely a good reason not to pass up on this gem
<START> a touching love story reminiscent of the mood for love' drawing heavily on chinese poetry and how this is used by eastern people to communicate feelings to each other the story focuses on a schoolteacher who wants so much to be a model teacher as well as a good husband and father a senior student is very attracted to him as the story unfolds we see the emotions below the surface in his 20 year marriage and how he grapples with the moral dilemmas that face him a beautiful and moving story
<START> it doesn't matter whether drew or leelee are total babes but there are a lot of girls who are so pretty and hot but they appear to be so nerdy this movie is not oscar type of movie but it has at least a good point of view of what life is like for young people or for real people it made us laugh and learn to accept others for who they really are this movie represents the real world and that what really matters
<START> the palestinian situation is fertile and as yet largely fallow soil for film making 'divine intervention' tries hard and gives us an insightful peek into the almost surreal life of those caught up in the troubles but the film amounts to little more than a handful of admittedly lovely visual jokes thrown onto celluloid while the links between them become increasingly obscure as the film progresses a missed opportunity to say something more coherent about a very topical issue
<START> it seems that dee snyder ran out of ideas halfway through the script the second half of the movie is basically just a rehash of the first which makes the film very boring to sum up cop's daughter is suckered into party via where she is sexually molested tortured by psychopath played by snider cop rescues her psychopath is put in therapy jail psychopath is released four years later and the whole thing is played out again within all this are many unexplained plot elements why was captain howdy psycho in the first place what's with the one time personality detour to bible thumper how does he kidnap all the adults and manage to sew their mouths shut without a struggle and perhaps the biggest unsolved mystery of all how does a man with pink hair hide himself completely behind a 5'6 average build woman these are just some of the questions i had watching this film br br it seems that snyder was trying to make some kind of commentary on a the dangers of online chatrooms b the hypocrisy of christian sexual mores and c the effect our twisted puritanical society has on us as individuals if that is so he failed the movie is just too poorly done to entertain never mind convey social messages the torture scenes are stupid and boring bordering on silly especially when snyder goes into one of his pain and death monologues and everything else is just plain dumb the call tracing scene is really lame when are the cops gonna get caller id and 69 the young partner of the main cop character is particularly awful he shouldn't be working as an actor basically and the audio in the final showdown scene is really poor i guess they couldn't afford two boom mikes br br the rest of the acting is not awful but it's not good either the cop is pretty one note and his detached quality is not quite believable dee snyder is actually not too bad but he snarls and sneers way too much robert englund who deserves way better puts in a somewhat amusing performance of a hypocritical redneck if you're a big robert englund fan the movie is probably worth seeing just for him everyone else is forgettable br br in conclusion we've seen all these plot elements done before and done better in films like silence of the lambs hellraiser and texas chainsaw massacre i suggest you rent one of those instead of watching this turkey 3 10 br br
<START> this film revival right march in a bad film industry and saudi arabia i want to know how the director was able to stand in front of people of the industry after he making this film work was so very bad we do not know how cinema saudi companies such as and other does not support yang filmmakers in like we hope in the future to prosper film industry in saudi arabia but without such intervention fools traders and idiots make us bad movies do not benefit the reputation of cinema in saudi arabia is like the roman and iranian cinema at the same time please makers simple experimental cinema in saudi arabia such as abdullah and others to achieve the dream of a good film industry to participate in festivals world away from the major companies interventions stupid
<START> in the midst of a documentary about his parents the filmmaker's mother dies but he continues making the documentary discovering a story he did not anticipate the result is an absorbing drama that has the quality of fiction in the best sense of that word where a likable but unknowing narrator unwittingly privileges the audience the narrative thus has a double weave the story of the documentary and the story of the documentary maker br br our admiration is with the filmmaker not only for doggedly pursuing his story though it risks his entire notion of his parents' relationship but also for never giving in to sensationalism or melodrama although the stuff of hollywood lurks in the details doug block treats the story as he would everyday life for those of us who have always speculated about our parents' life before we came on the scene or after we arrived but while we were too self absorbed to notice they had a life independent of ourselves 51 birch street gives fair warning there are wondrous things back there in fatherland but beware if you choose to enter there br br but that caution is for the audience to go slow wandering about in the details of their parents' past it is not a warning for those offered a glimpse into the life of parents the film is a marvel at making the mother come alive as a vibrant and passionate yet introspective person who makes her own conscious decisions during the 50's the filmmaker's particular success is to make the viewers actually see the young woman behind the elderly parent and grandparent we all know our parents were once young and vigorous but in 51 birch street the mother is the father who has been distant while the filmmaker and his sister were growing up ultimately remains distant in the film but that is due more to his own elusive nature than to his portrayal this biography turned autobiography is dramatic intense and unforgettable sure to send viewers scurrying for a closer look at their own family albums but more hesitant about looking at the backs of those photographs
<START> the 1990s film with anthony hopkins and debra winger is rightly showered with praise and i enjoyed it very much but this tv original is just as good and in some ways more appropriately cast claire bloom isn't a brash joy but she is still confident and throwing her cap at her favourite author played by joss ackland in one of his best performances br br quieter calmer and less emotional than the attenborough film this may be but it does justice to what is a marvellous play full of meaningful dialogue you'll still cry to this version but perhaps you won't have the musical prompts to set you off br br there's room for both and having seen this on stage i would say that the ackland bloom one is slightly more faithful but they're both excellent
