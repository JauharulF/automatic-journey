<START> as i have said before in previous comments some programmes are there to be entertainment' so i get somewhat frustrated when commentators seem to be expecting a program that will reveal the meaning of life you will not get that from cleopatra and it does not presume to offer it what you get is a girl who was frozen and is brought back to life some 500 years later and her adaptation to this new life is realistic she does not settle in within 10 minutes as what happens with other time travelling adventures and neither is she the female equivalent of james bond ready to take on all comers cleopatra is by her new surroundings and frightened by some of the weaponry on display as most of us would be however it is light entertainment the stories have a beginning a middle and an end in quick time and their are some surprisingly good moments of acting the episode when there is a double of cleopatra is particularly moving and jennifer sky i think gives one of the best performances of someone dying for a long long time and being a film and television buff i know what i am talking about finally to prove my sincerity i have purchased all but four of the episodes and i am entirely satisfied with my purchase the only reason i do not have the complete set is because i purchased the other episodes before realising that there was one complete box set victoria pratt and gina torres complete the trio and for light entertainment cleopatra certainly entertained me
<START> movie watchers often say great movies must have 3 memorable br br scenes to be considered truly great broadcast news doesn't have br br three it has twice that this movie is extremely well written by br br james brooks holly hunter and albert brooks have never been br br better i love this movie for many reasons it is great because it br br makes you laugh and it makes you cry albert brooks has several br br great lines and many unforgettable scenes 1 laughed i can br br sing and read i am singing while i read with midnight train to br br georgia playing in the background 2 laughed telling the br br william hurt character that you really blew the lid off of nookie br br after watching hurt's report on date rape 3 cried when aaron br br a brooks finally tells jayne hunter that he loves her and she br br can't end up with hurt's character because he represents br br everything about journalism jayne finds finally 4 laughed who can forget the scene where aaron br br anchors the weekend news hilarious this movie should have won an oscar it has everything i love in br br movies great acting intelligent script and even a jack nicholson br br cameo
<START> yes 2 37 is in some ways a rip off from gus van elephant it's about some students who are dealing with their problems leading to the suicide of one of them yes it's full of clichÃ©s but that's life you just can't deny that creepy nerds disabled persons or popular students who despite their popularity do have problems are existing in the real world br br but that's not what this film is all about it's not about life in highschool it's not about the misery of life itself br br if you look beneath the surface beneath the soap like social relationships that are shown you will find some gripping thought provoking criticism of our society br br why are people committing suicide do we really understand their motives or are we just trying to understand after its already too late and why is it always someone you would never have expected it to be br br this movie doesn't answer this question but it raises it and it does so in a very intense way all the way it keeps you guessing whose blood it might be that you see at the very beginning you are following the paths of some students all of them having a more or less good reason to end their lives just to be forced to watch the gruesome act in the finale br br did you know who it would be or were you caught by surprise like in real life br br the message is by one of the surviving kids in the end we are always so fixed on our own problems we forget to see those of others there might be someone a colleague a friend who does not want to live anymore but if you don't open your eyes you'll never know until its too late br br this movie delivers well it might have some flaws but they don't matter anymore when its over either you see a reflection of society or you are blind for reality
<START> at it's core this is a fairly typical revenge western heavy on the spaghetti and if you follow it as such the protagonist comes through successfully defeating the main villain however there's so much going on that has no bearing on the story that you have to wonder what the film makers were thinking about i'm referring to stuff like the way miss singing number just pops up out of nowhere and the boxing match in the middle of town ok they have a loose connection to the influence villain mash has but why all of a sudden does he turn up with an alias mr donovan br br on the flip side i thought it was pretty innovative how the camera shot showing the wounded wallach's view of the trail might have been filmed by someone with an actual bullet in his shoulder and wasn't it great the way girl uses the old headache routine when he gets a little frisky don't let me forget either the great stunt work by the gravel pit bad guys as wallach guns them down as part of the finale br br still there was one thing unaccounted for and i kept waiting the entire movie for it whatever happened to that trio of hoods that donovan hires near the start of the picture you know the guy martel that a funeral parlor wanted to hire for his gun prowess the devil's henchman mitchell with the rifle and the knife thrower lincoln tate each had a five thousand dollar bounty on his head and they were supposed to protect donovan from the guy who survived the massacre of the opening scene they were never heard from again i like to think that maybe donovan just had them killed and kept the all for himself
<START> the first time i've seen this dvd i was not only happy because of the fact that it was the first time in decades that the band put out anything but also because the dvd itself is extremely loud jimmy page obviously can't live with quiet music i guess i do must say though that during the concert at royal albert hall they expanded 'how many more times' and dick' too long other than that it was my favorite song of all time is now on that dvd trampled underfoot it's either that one or 'in my time of dying' in that song jimmy really plays that thing good ever seen randy play well jimmy plays just like him except his guitar is lower
<START> this movie gets a 10 because there is a lot of gore in it who cares about the plot or the acting this is an italian horror movie people so you know you can't expect much from the acting or the plot everybody knows fulci took footage from other movies and added it to this one since i never seen any of the movies that he took footage from it didn't matter to me the italian godfather of gore out done himself with this movie this is one of the goriest italian movies you will ever see no gore hound should be without this movie in their horror movie collection buy this movie no matter what it is a dream come true
<START> sublime perfect profound a true lesson on the idealized meaning of life we get completely caught up in the life journeys of martina and phillipa and br br babette their yearnings desires sacrifices resonant long after the movie has ended seeing it years ago as it was gaining a great deal of notoriety at the audaciousness of its subject matter half the movie being a single dinner the audience was and as some of the courses took their final br br glorious shape laughing at the reaction of the diners as they became totally seduced by the pleasures being introduced to them by babette and being totally surprised at the turn of events at the end of the film subsequently seeing the film years later after my own twists and turns of life i realized just how profound the film is on this viewing tears flowed freely the film's br br meditation on the passage of time and the way it uses a seemingly simple story to comment on life and love and art and generosity is truly something to br br cherish
<START> a stunning piece of art you can watch every image of the film and see the beauty in it first i would like to say that i saw the soldiers i understood that it was from here that star wars been inspired the scene were they kill the baby is frightening and when i saw it i did not like it but when the film was end i thought about that scene and i changed my mind and thought that in the world war 2 that was exactly what the did br br the ice battle scene is some of the best war scenes i have seen if not the best they way this film combines music and so superbly stunning visual images is really excellent then the score is one of the most famous sound in history and i thought it was some of the best to br br what more can you say then a work of art eisenstein have created a stunning masterpiece a propaganda film and a beautiful work of art i am very happy because i have just got the criterion collection eisenstein set
<START> just a great soundtrack really enjoyable music outstanding cast great lead performance worth watching br br doesn't really explain what happened to the neighborhood you are left feeling that integration is to blame or that with the departure of the lead character the neighborhood disintegrated br br this movie seems well researched and extremely well crafted i especially enjoyed some of the minor characters like jeffrey wright br br the cutting during the opening sequence helps express what a lively engaging and desirable experience that nightclub would have been with the jump music food drink dancing gambling and sex
<START> tourist trap is among my favorite late 70's early 80's horror flicks a group of young people are heading somewhere one pair in the car ahead that car has a flat and our film opens with the young man woody pushing the tire along looking for a service station he finds a seemingly abandoned place and yet hears voices and investigates and ends up with a piece of pipe through his stomach for his efforts along comes the rest of the young folks in a vw thing and they pick up woody's girlfriend and find this very same place oasis or some such thing and then mr happens along while the girls are enjoying a dip in the stream of course the vw thing has mysteriously died at that point so odd mr chuck connors offers his help mr has a museum with lots of wax figures and he lives in the museum but behind is a big house where he says lives and who is why crockett he says but if it were crockett they'd all probably be safer the girls are left alone while goes to help with fixing the car but of course curiosity gets the better of one she goes to investigate and finds the house full of creepy mannequins and one rather animated one named what follows is a rather creepy night of terror as one by one they're taken prisoner by who says he's brother one girl kidnapped earlier is treated to a plaster facial which results in her death when it covers up her air supply at any rate there's somewhat of a twist to this and kind but weird mr is not exactly what he appears to be a good creepy late 70's horror flick and lots of mannequins make for a very creepy atmosphere 7 out of 10
<START> i have seen this movie several times it sure is one of the cheapest action flicks of the eighties so i think many viewers would definitely change the channel when they come across this one but if you are into great trash dragon hunt is made for you the main characters the mcnamara twins are sporting great moustaches and look so ridiculous in their camouflage dresses one of the best scenes is when one of then gets shot in the leg and is still kicking his enemies into nirvana this movie is really awful but then again it is a great party tape
<START> seeing this movie always reminds me of what i remember summer being like god such a long time ago the entire scene involving the overnight from the canoe procession to the end of the trip is precious and story about the homicidal maniac is urban legend right out of my youth a highly entertaining movie made many times better by the awful sequels that followed
<START> i have been a huge fan of the original crew of the enterprise since i was eight years old i watched all the movies and appreciated each one for what they retained from the old series and for further developing the characters and the star trek universe in general even in the undiscovered country i thought the aging of the characters was well handled and the story worthy of a theatrical release however having said that star trek v the final frontier is easily the worst of the series featuring the original crew i agree with many that the camaraderie of kirk spock and mccoy is well handled but the overall script the direction by william shatner and the special effects are not worthy of anything more than a television episode this is a buddy movie and at times almost unrecognizable as a star trek movie the action sequences are not sustained and therefore build little or no tension the dialogue is weak though it does provide for a few laughs both intended and not intended the klingon's seem thrown in as an afterthought the whole sha ka concept is just silly and laurence a fine actor in everything else i've ever seen him in boarders on the absurd in this movie the scene where conjures up images of spock's pain and mccoy's pain shatters the image of the characters as we've known them spock would never be party to such stupidity and mccoy trying to save his father is full of insipid redundant dialogue and totally wastes deforest acting abilities the whole scene is wasted and really shows us nothing new and nothing we want to see from these characters i understand that shatner didn't have the luxury of working with ilm for the special effects and that the budget for this movie was tight but that doesn't allow for such a bad story in some respects i think this story does fit in with the old series but the movies including star trek the motion picture are all much better quality than this it's a shame that most of the other characters have so few lines and so little to do with most of this movie the focus on kirk mccoy and spock is nice but way over used the old crew really seems to be out of character i liked the old klingon general and the sultry in the bar i liked some of the humor and the idea that spock has a half brother but that's about it if this was a tv episode i'd be able to accept a lot of the faults as a movie this is just bad uninspired film making it's a shame too because i want this movie to be good even if it was the level of star trek iii i would be happy but this movie makes all the other movies in this series seem like works of shakespeare
<START> 78 years ago the premiere of anna christie advertised by the slogan garbo talks the film runs for 16 minutes and the viewers reach the climax of curiosity greta enters the bar and gets through a long awaited transfer from silence into sound a few seconds closing her silent era and at last greta garbo says a historic line gimme a whiskey ginger ale on the side and don't be stingy baby br br anna christie 1930 is the movie by clarence brown that introduced a great silent star greta garbo to talkies nowadays we can only imagine what serious transfer it was for actors and actresses the careers of many were bound to end something we hardly or not at all see at present and it was no coincidence that it was clarence brown who directed the first talkie with the swedish beauty garbo trusted the director after two of his great silent productions flesh and the devil 1926 and a woman of affairs 1928 movies that achieved a smashing success at the box office both with garbo in the lead br br but we are in 2008 and that fact about the movie now purely historical appears to be of minor importance the question for today's viewer is not what garbo's voice sounds like but if the movie is still watchable after these 78 years in other words we all strive to answer the question if the movie has stood a test of time has it br br when i recently watched it i came into conclusion that except for some minor technical aspects including static camera anna christie is still very entertaining it's on the one hand a wonderful story of a life of a reality that the young woman faces being based on eugene o neill's play and on the other hand an artistic manifestation of true magnificence in the field of direction and acting let me analyze these two aspects in separate paragraphs br br content chris christopherson george f marion a heavy drinker lives a life of a sailor on a barge although his days are filled with sorrows he is consoled by a letter from his daughter anna garbo whom he hasn't seen for 15 years she says that she will come back to him he starts to change everything for better however forgets that his daughter is no longer a child lacking experience but a 23 year old woman who has got through various sorts of things on a farm in where she lived and worked moreover he forgets that she has a right to accept another kind of male love in her life this brief presentation of the content not from the perspective of the main character but the one which is introduced to us sooner than anna her father chris makes you realize how universal it is simply no letter from the whole text that life appears to be has been erased after all these years cases discussed here in 1930 are still meaningful and valid br br performances there are not many characters in the movie but there are two that really shine in the roles it is of course greta garbo herself who did something extraordinary in her 15 year long phenomenon the presence that strongly marked the history of early cinema something i have already discussed in many of my earlier comments on her films but here garbo is slightly different i admit that there are moments in this movie when she does not feel very comfortable with her role that seems to be caused by her new experience with sound in english however her performance is as always genuine and unique but that is what everyone has expected from garbo the true surprise of the movie for the 1930 viewers and also for us is marie dressler as marthy she is excellent in her facial expressions in her accent in the entire portrayal of a drinking woman who looks at life from the perspective of hitting the bottle her best moments include the conversation with anna christie in the bar preceded by her hilarious talk with chris the rest of the supporting cast are fine yet not great whatsoever here the german version makes up for it particularly dressler except for garbo herself constitutes an absolutely flawless choice br br if you asked me what i like about anna christie nowadays that's what i would tell you it's a classic movie however there is one more thing that i must mention at the end it is humor wonderful wit that is noticeable throughout although the content is quite serious and anna christie in no way carries a comedian spirit the only garbo's comedy was ninotchka there are such moments when you will split your sides don't skip for instance anna and matt's visit in the fun park particularly at the restaurant where he orders milk for her thinking how virtuous and innocent she is beer for himself and where suddenly marthy joins them by chance br br anna christie is a perfect movie for classic buffs and a must see for all at least a bit interested in the true magnificence of performance if you are fed up with many of those modern starlets seek such movies out and you shall be satisfied very worth your search br br skaal greta garbo skaal marie dressler let us drink a toast to the great jobs you did in the movie skaal after all these years when wine tastes much better and your spirits are with us in a different sense
<START> this is by far one of the best movies i have seen in a very long time top 20 of my lifetime i laughed more than i have since hitchhikers guide to the galaxy and cried more than i have since i saw the notebook if you are looking for a touching movie without the sappy edge this is the one it is real and powerful see it and you won't regret it i was reluctant at first and i only watched it because i had to do a school project about speech disabilities but this movie is so much more than that it is about life free and independent from the way the world would have you held down its about the disabilities that each of us have that keep us from see ourselves and what we miss but letting everything else get in the way
