<START> an epic story of hope constrained by budget and limited artistic ambition seeing as terrence malick produced this i expected something haunting and lyrical instead we get a typical norwegian co production revolution with al pacino anyone where quite possibly good intentions are scuppered by a dreadful screenplay and where many of the characters are reduced to stereotypes the me tarzan you jane english dialogue between the non english speaking protagonists is particularly cringeworthy Â one could speculate whether nick nolte and tim roth ad libbed their own as they almost sound like real people the story is loaded with implausibility we are expected to believe that can speak a smattering of english after having spent his entire life living as a peasant slave his vocabulary but unfortunately not grammatical command increases impressively in the refugee camp without the benefit of night classes coincidence is rife i wonder whether an hour or two has been edited from the first third he tracks down his mother in ho chi city almost immediately after bumping into his thirty year younger half brother who nonchalantly recognises him mum gives him a gold or something similar of great value as they part but this is never referred to again his relationship with me dead inside ling is supposed to provide the obligatory love interest but feels as artificial as leonardo and cameron in gangs of new york br br the voyage in the rust bucket of a boat does convey a sense of the appalling conditions that human trafficking entails indeed the only time the film is remotely exciting and unpredictable is the jerky hand held footage shot from the bridge during choppy weather conditions incidentally a boat cruise from malaysia to new york via the cape of good hope and the african coast without stopping for fuel or supplies is certainly an epic journey the beautiful shot of the new york skyline echoes malick's use of magic hour but i want to know why the coast guard didn't show up perhaps they were watching the super bowl or something of course manages to track down his blind old dad on a remote farm in texas with the same flair he displayed in ho chi city i was impressed at how nick nolte could wander around digging fields and feeding horses on a large ranch without the aid of a guide dog or white stick for demonstration of how a story about the travails refugees could be structured and shot on a small budget check out michael far superior in this world
<START> since i am not a big steven seagal fan i thought this was a pretty good movie it is apparent that his fans are very displeased with this drama that lacks an over abundance of martial arts and brute force br br gailard sartain plays a self claimed patriot leader of a militia in a standoff with the for weapons violations he surrenders with the intentions of releasing a deadly virus seagal is a former cia agent turned country doctor that pressures himself to find the antidote for the lethal bug that has incapacitated a small town his grandpa's native american herbal remedy figures into the salvation br br notable appearances by l q jones camilla belle and silas weir mitchell my personal favorite in this movie is whitney yellow robe she is stunning and appears to have what it takes to take on a more challenging role br br despite the far fetched ending this was a decent movie that could have used a lot more action
<START> i'll bet i watch this film 4 or 5 times a year and will do so more often now that the hollyweird moguls have seen fit to put it on dvd because it's a classic with a capital c this film is timeless how can people pay 10 00 nowadays to see the junk that comes out of hollyweird with movies like the egyptian the ten commandments ben hur captain newman md on tape dvd and cable movie channels i could go on forever but this film is so great and for a relative unknown edmund purdom carries the movie like atlas carried the world the story is wonderful the acting is first rate and the graphics at the end are so powerful you sit in your seat for a few minutes just trying to let the words sink in really a knockout of a film i'd give this one 15 stars if they'd let me they don't make them like this anymore but they should
<START> in a sense this movie did not even compare to the novel however it was good to have a visual of what the congo looked like and also the natives if you are not good at visualizing as you read i would never recommend watching the movie rather than reading the book i hardly suggest even watching this film let alone any other films based on this literary work this movie and many others did not fulfill this book one important part that is missing from the movie is marlow's sense of how government of lack of there in africa was forming an early genocide also in the movie marlow and his companions didn't stop and get the note and wood likewise african mistress knocks marlow out towards the end of the story which has a major influence in the story but was not in the book in the novel kurtz died on the ship however he died in his hut in the movie the fiancÃ©'s reaction to marlow's interpretation of last words also differed this movie is only effective if you wish to visualize more clearly the novel
<START> i saw this film at the 2001 toronto international film festival la pianiste reinforces the austrians grim thesis i'm isabelle huppert won a well deserved best actress award at cannes for her portrayal of a woman who in her efforts to attain the artistic ideal loses her humanity trapped by her talent she suppresses her emotions and her sexuality until they can only be expressed in twisted and terrifying ways when a younger student falls in love with her our hopes rise but are soon dashed by the realization that she cannot experience love the way others can it is too late for her and the film's final 30 harrowing minutes are tellingly devoid of the beautiful music that carried the first 90 minutes the message seems to be that the music itself is not enough without the life and beauty it's describing
<START> this vicious little film is horrendous my low rating for it comes for two main reasons the first is that it is an animal snuff film and i find that whole concept so vile it turns my stomach filmed over a hundred years ago i can only hope that we've evolved into something a little more humane and compassionate this film is complete and utter exploitation made to cash in on the sensational aspects of the film and the subject historical interest aside this is something to watch only if one finds themselves in the grip of morbid fascination br br reason number two look at the way that the camera is set up it is placed in the best possible location to fully capture the full effect long march forward of the elephant perfect view of the electrocution platform and a cold and clinically dispassionate viewpoint of the elephant with smoke coming out of it before it finally collapses sickening br br thomas edison did many great things for civilization and his talents and intelligence aren't in doubt nobody is perfect but when you realize that this film provided a an opportunity for him to trump early cinematic competitors with a sensationalist film of an elephant being electrocuted and b he filmed the execution to demonstrate the greater effectiveness of dc as opposed to ac you can't help but wonder if the scientist in him was a little too dispassionate and cold any number of peter cushing's mad scientists would be proud the rest of us should be ashamed and revolted
<START> this movie has a decent story in my opinion very good fight scenes but i was a little bit disappointed by the end of the movie i think that it was a way better if denier knew karate also or if she knew to use some weapons her character has become more interesting too and she was a decent opponent to cynthia i think when the director filmed the final between cynthia denier he wanted to finish the movie earlier so he didn't care how the end was going to be all in all i think that fans of cynthia rothrock will be very satisfied watching this movie it's not like 'yes or sworn to justice but it was entertainment enough and cynthia looks awesome in this movie so my rate for this movie is a solid 8 10
<START> distant is a slice of turkish life flick which follows the mundane activities of two adult male cousins one a photographer and the other an unemployed underachiever there's little doubt that auteur bilge is a work in progress with considerable talent however this little foreign minimalistic arty is so full of empty filler and so devoid of story or anything engaging or provocative that it will likely appeal to only the most avid devotees of cinema and mainstream audiences should look elsewhere i personally grew quickly bored with the slow pace of the film and found myself fast forwarding through the empty spaces and there are many between dialogue plot development and denouement distant is a very nicely done bit of b
<START> this review contains some small yet significant spoilers br br br br i just finished watching my copy of br br and it was great this might sound cheesy but several times during the film i forgot it wasn't real xd the acting is convincing although the acting from kobayashi playing himself i think seems a bit hokey at times matsumoto in takashi shimizu's rinne seemed to change levels of believability throughout the movie sometimes she's really good then the next moment she's really cheesy especially at the end's exorcism and subsequent re possession br br a character that was ridiculous at first was mr a man covered in believing worms are coming to eat everyone he provides unintentional comic relief at the beginning acting like the stereotypical alien abduction type victim but near the end has some really creepy scenes br br the plot was very interesting and really kept me wondering how everything tied together there are some things that aren't really explained like a mass suicide in a tokyo park and where the reincarnated boy came from but everything else turned out fine the ending has got to be one of the most unnerving if not the scariest sequences i've ever had the pleasure to witness br br all in all is a very fun way to spend 2 hours and the new hong kong dvd provides great picture and sound most importantly the english subtitles engrish free for a great j horror experience i highly recommend picking it up
<START> the brotherhood of satan is a stupefying combination of conventional horror elements mixed with some imaginative characterization and direction bernard it all starts out with father charles bateman as ben driving out west with his pretty blondes luscious capri as nicky and daughter as k t things get weirder and weirder for the trio as they approach the town of which is being gripped by a satanic cult br br when the dullish travelers hit the action switches to the film's more interesting assemblage of characters townies l q jones as pete the sheriff martin as doc charles robinson as jack the priest and moore as tobey their interplay is sometimes fun soon enough it all gets very silly and predictable mr martin is the stand out as you might expect he considers the possibility of a satanic cult to be a cock and bull story but is of course their leader the come in children ending is puzzling unless perhaps it was the film's original title
<START> taylor wanted to make this movie for 15 years and finally found jamie foxx to play the title role foxx is amazing in his portrayal of ray charles from an interview i saw with foxx he met charles several times and the two of them also played piano together foxx had piano lessons as a young child and actually played piano in all his scenes i didn't see charles live until his later years so it was great to get a perspective on how his career developed i hope foxx gets nominated for the best actor oscar as he certainly deserves it the music also is incredible it really showcases the breadth of charles' music from country to blues and everything in between the movie also gives an unblemished account of ray charles' life from the many women he had relationships with to his drug habit and the consequences of that
<START> i just finished watching this movie and am disappointed to say that i didn't enjoy it a bit it is so slow slow and uninteresting this kid from harry potter plays a shy teenager with an rude mother and then one day the rude mother tells the kid to find a job so that they could accommodate an old guy apparently having no place to live has started to live with his family and therefore the kid goes to work for a old lady and this old lady who is living all alone teaches him about girls driving car and life i couldn't get how an 18 year old guy enjoy spending time with an awful lady in her 80s sorry if my comments on this movie has bothered people who might have enjoyed it i could be wrong as i am not british and may not understand the social and their family structure and way of life mostly the movie is made for the british audience
<START> i mean you just have to love the italian film industry someone came up with a post doomsday action movie road warrior and the italians were busy for years doing one rip off after another then some other one came up with a successful barbarian movie conan and the italians were busy eh see above br br besides countless other variations of the theme one of my favorites is umberto lenzi's the barbarians starring the paul twins the ator series was created and this the second one is probably the worst or best depending on your point of view br br ator is called back into action by his old teacher who has discovered some kind of nuclear power that of course has to be protected so it won't get into wrong hands the old man sends his daughter to ator and after a few complications ator his sidekick tong and the girl set back to the castle which meanwhile has fallen to some evildoer of course an old class mate of ator somewhere along the way the heroic trio forgets about the plot and eradicates some giant snake worshipping cult for the fun of it not before some virgins are sacrificed just in time before the madman finally loses his temper and kills the wise teacher our heroes remember their duties invent and grenades and save the day br br included terrible acting by all participants especially o'keeffe incredibly hilarious special effects you just have to adore the snake fight scene which must be sort of a hommage to bride of the monster badly staged fight scenes numerous continuity errors ator flies two different during the climatic battle watch for it just an example and an overall non understanding of the concept of history cavemen civilized barbarians castle builders all thrown in one film br br if you're like me devoted to bad movies this is the one of the series to see you'll probably end up for the records the malta filmed third part is actually quite watchable br br considering joe d'amato's other efforts this is probably his most entertaining movie as he certainly has failed to deliver watchable horror or erotic movies but i strongly have the opinion that this was completely by accident br br
<START> ok first of all who in their right mind would remake hitchcock and second who would do it shot for shot i admit i had no intention of ever watching this movie for that very reason the original psycho is one of my favorite films ever and this just seemed like a degrading of it i did watch it because my girlfriend wanted to compare it to the original and we both agreed less than five minutes into this crap that it was awful first as mentioned they did it shot for shot where's originality why remake a movie that is almost perfect exactly the way it was done the first time why remake such a movie to begin with if you are going to remake something remake something that doesn't work and make it better br br second they used the exact same script from the 1960 version the dialog no longer works it works fine and sounds perfect for the 1960 version but seems odd and stilted coming out of modern actors why not update the dialog hitch didn't write the script you could have rewritten br br this film had some very good talent and they were wasted by imitation of the original actors the actor who played the car salesman seemed like he was just playing john anderson's performance as the car salesman in the original all the actors seemed like the only direction they were given was be the characters from the original movie vince vaughn may have seemed a little creepier than anthony perkins but in doing so you loose the sympathy you are supposed to have for norman having norman masturbate while watching marion undress was going too far and lost the innocence of the character that i think tony perkins captured so well in his performance viggo mortensen's accent was annoying and rita wilson was far too old to play caroline her lines came off as someone desperate rather than just young and fun like patricia hitchcock's performance br br the only good thing i saw about the film was that gus van sant was able to open the movie with the shot hitch had envisioned hitch wanted to open with 1 long shot going over phoenix but couldn't at the time so he had to settle for a series of shots cross dissolved together this film fulfilled that vision with a helicopter shot going into the window of the hotel after that though the film became a worthless waste of celluloid br br if you are curious about how to destroy a wonderful film watch this but do not under any circumstances watch this before you watch the original this is a faded of the original and should never have been green lit stick to the master's film not the imitation
<START> i preface by stating i am a big fan of and not one of patrick therefore i watched this to see her performance and of course it was excellent i do not feel the director was adequate for the film as several very bad choices were made re shot angles blocking etc if the director was trying to give it a realistic feel they failed and lost some good performances because of it nearly always felt that the camera was way too static too far from intense facial reactions and so many times when the action depended on the intimacy of lead characters the dialog was slow and plodding this easily could have been resolved by cutaways or changes of camera angle but the impression i got was that the budget was too small and only one camera was used i also got the impression that perhaps scenes were shot multiple times and the energy coming from the actors was used up
