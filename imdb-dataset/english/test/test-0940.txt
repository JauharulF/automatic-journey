<START> i must admit when i first began watching this film i had no clue what was going on so the beginning was a bit confusing for me however that did not diminish my enjoyment of the movie the characters reveal themselves to be more complex than they may first appear and that is what makes this a memorable film at first i heard this was a real hollywood movie although it obviously lacks the stereotypical guns and fists element the convincing performances of talented actors such as martin sheen and sam neill more than make up for it i'd rather see a film with more substance than shooting any day
<START> because this is yet another dead one lifeless voice acting second rate animation contrived and un funny songs although the bit sung by the devil would have been worthy of tim curry and a weaker plot than land before time 99 fossils on parade br br i have to admit i haven't seen the first film i'm not a big fan of movies involving heaven or dogs especially not in combination still i hope to see the first one soon as there had to be a reason someone would create such a god awful sequel br br if i didn't get this movie for free i wouldn't have it at all for a flick the only good thing in this was the devil 2 10
<START> nothing to watch here it's all been done and better before who cares about this woman deficient in every way as a mother as a wife and as a friend in one instant when she could have taken the high road she jumped into re addiction with both feet and held her breath for no better a reason than me too if she wasn't the pretty and young person she portrays on screen but looked more like the real human wreckage that is represented by our family members neighbors and friends who really suffer from additions we'd change channels in a nanosecond br br this movie starts out at the bottom and goes downhill nothing redeeming no lessons taught nothing uplifting in any way none of the main characters even evoke sympathy let alone empathy well maybe the snake i would have had more fun if i'd shut a door on my hand who needs drivel like this
<START> first off i want to say that i lean liberal on the political scale and i found the movie offensive i managed to watch the whole doggone disgrace of a film this movie brings a low to original ideas yes it was original thus my 2 stars instead of 1 are our film writers that uncreative that they can only come up with this acting was horrible and the characters were unlikeable for the most part the lead lady in the story had no good qualities at all they made her bf into some sort of a bad guy and i did not see that at all maybe i missed something i do not know he was the most down to earth relevant character in the movie i did not shell out any money for this garbage i almost wish peta would come to the rescue of this awful offensive movie and form a protest disgusting thats all i have to say anymore
<START> this film is superb wesley snipes plays blade the vampire hunter with pure class he kicks butt in such a fluid and violent way that would make bruce lee proud the movie is a fast paced thrill ride of action and superb stunts the first action scene and last are outstanding and wesley looks like a terminator as he runs around wiping out all suck heads the script is pretty good and there is sharp dialogue too wesley should have done more action films than he has i know he is a very good actor and in this he is not as much as in his more comic or drama roles but as far as action stars go he is the best actor of them all only bruce willis stallone and perhaps tom cruise if he counts as an action star come close also aswell as wesley being quality steven dorff is also very good as the bad guy it was an unexpected surprise that someone of small stature compared to snipes should come across as menacing but he does overall the film is sharp stylish and i hope the sequal is done with the same sort of pace
<START> there is a fantastic song in killjoy 2 that goes on about how clowns are usually really nice and fun but killjoy is a killer i don't recall the song in the first movie but when singer fernandez sings yeah killjoy 2' is sounds like the 2 may have been added in for this dire sequel the film is much worse than the first movie and that was really bad this time the cast including the usually excellent debbie rochon have given up trying and director tammi sutton creates no tension and presents merely a dull and steady film full moon pictures produced this during their phase none of which was very good but none so bad as here
<START> this movie is a hidden gem i can't understand why this movie doesn't get more air time errol and eleanor parker make for a real attractive and dashing couple and their chemistry is impeccable i really liked the touch of his daughters reference to him as being her robin hood i highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys errol flynn it's nice to see errol playing a father as well by all accounts from his very own children he was a very attentive and loving father in real life also the supporting cast is wonderful as well you can't go wrong with supporting players such as hattie mcdaniel and lucile watson hattie mcdaniel makes a movie that much better from the get go this movie has now become a holiday tradition in my home enjoy
<START> making this short and to the point this movie was great i loved it i actually picked this up at a hollywood video for 3 bucks on vhs and watched it about 5 times in the last couple weeks i'm a big bogart fan and i just latched onto this movie i thought the song was funny and now have it as a ring tone on my phone robert sacchi is great and pulls off a good bogart his nose is a little big his voice is a bogart columbo mix and he does a few things that are awkward but otherwise he was fantastic and this film was wonderful no one can be a perfect bogart but he was great remember sam marlow is a fan of bogart and isn't going to do everything he did he mentions a lot of other movies and does some things that were never part of the real bogart's character's but it's so funny and hilarious and has a great cast including some beautiful women watch it and have fun
<START> potyomkin is among the finest films ever made and possibly the best of the silent era was a pioneer of film form and his use of montage editing has influenced films to this day the odessa steps massacre footage is as powerful today as it was when first seen over 70 years ago do not pass up the chance to see this film
<START> lackawanna blues is an entertaining engrossing emotionally charged hbo tv movie based on the childhood memories of actor ruben santiago hudson who also appears in a small role this joyous motion picture experience is centered around santiago hudson's childhood guardian rachel nanny crosby a strong big hearted black woman who ran a boarding house in upstate new york during the 1950's nanny was a one woman social service organization whose boarding house was filled with drunks derelicts cripples drug addicts misfits and everyone else in town who needed a hand up instead of a hand out the crux of the story revolves around nanny's relationship with young ruben beautifully played by marcus franklin a boy whose divorced parents were unable to raise the boy properly so nanny took him in s who has been wasted for years in the thankless role of lieutenant van on nbc's law order turns in a powerhouse performance as nanny the neighborhood mother figure whose boarding house became a symbol for the downtrodden black folks in her town is nothing short of magnificent in a performance that earned her a golden globe and an emmy award is backed by an impressive all star cast that includes terrance howard brilliant and heartbreaking as nanny's husband louis gossett jr rosie perez jimmy delroy lindo macy gray michael k williams jeffrey wright henry simmons patricia ernie hudson mos def and hill harper as the adult ruben colorful and exciting beautifully photographed and exquisitely scored this is one of a kind motion picture experience that works on all levels but if for no other reason is worth seeing for the electrifying starring performance by s who is given the role of a lifetime and makes the most of it
<START> this movie is hilarious the laughs never stop every scene is packed to the limit with hilarious comedy chris farley is a comic genius and spade plays his character to a tee farley was one of the best slap stick comics ever and in this movie as with all his movies we see how much time and energy he devoted to portraying his character the way he saw fit tommy boy is an excellent example of a comedy it always makes me laugh no matter how many times i have seen it before
<START> while caricatures and or references to entertainment industry people or things or even brands of products is usually a staple in shorts like this one they aren't used in quantity here most of the individual gags are rather generic as i'm going to give examples there will be spoilers below br br there are only three well technically four there's a quick one at the very end of the cartoon caricatures that i spotted which is kind of low for this type of short though one is a featured character with a fair amount of activity they are jack benny as jack bunny leopold and the inimitable ned sparks as a crab on a can chances are very good that if a crab was involved in a warner brothers short in the 1930s 1940s the caricature used would be ned sparks there are also references to billy rose's and a riff on a radio show character called henry aldrich coming mother a play on superman here and the villain is a take off on king kong that's it for that kind of gag br br the products themselves are mostly generic and the gags are more plays on basic items in unusual situations such as turtles coming off of cans of soup to attack the villain as tanks tomato soup cans doing the can gingerbread men who turn into using tissues for and so on the gags are very good and it's an excellent example of a bob clampett cartoon clampett had hit his stride as a director by this point and while it isn't anywhere near his best work it's nothing to sneeze at either this short can be found on looney tunes golden collection vol 3 which is an excellent set that i highly recommend this short itself is also recommended
<START> worst horror film ever but funniest film ever rolled in one you have got to see this film it is so cheap it is but you have to see it really p s watch the carrot
<START> this movie was physically painful to sit through maybe because like many people my age and younger i grew up with dr seuss and loved his books funny clever whimsical and subversive at the same time the cat in the hat sucks all of the interest and spark out of the story and mike myer's performance as the cat is mostly bewildering why the borscht belt accent the unfunny patter the inappropriate jokes the charmless costume i had to go back and re read the books to see the real problem the books are simple this movie is overblown and way way too long br br you don't expect every kids' movie to be toy story or the iron giant but this one set a new low how could mike myers need the money
<START> jack sawyer and sayid swim to the boat and find a completely wasted desmond his traumatic past experience before sailing to the island is disclosed through flashbacks sayid plots a plan with jack to surprise the others in case michael is double crossing the group john locke convinces desmond to invade the hatch which is protected by mr eko and not press the button of the computer to see what will happen br br this episode is one of the best of the second season unfortunately we lovers of lost can see the lack of respect the producers of this stunning series have with the fans in the usa the air date of this episode was 24 may 2006 therefore along this period fans have to wait for the third season in a very suspenseful situation with jack and his group surrounded by the others and finding the truth about michael and the death of ana lucia and libby john locked inside the hatch without the intention of pushing the button and mr eko in despair outside the hatch i hope the fate of lost be better than angel and its very disappointing conclusion or lack of conclusion after five seasons my vote is ten br br title brazil not available
