<START> revisiting old films that you thought were average isn't necessarily a good thing they sometimes get worse championed by the fangoria camp in they labeled it the scariest film since texas chainsaw no luther the geek inexplicably developed a cult following as an intense horror picture actually it is just an average stalk and bite film that briefly sets itself aside from the pack by featuring a killer who like a chicken yes like a chicken to the filmmaker's credit at least they didn't make the killer sound like a duck a la the new york ripper that would just be silly br br narrative logic is completely abandoned in luther the geek i'm not saying that slasher films are abound with reason but at least in halloween michael myers escaped luther is actually paroled after a lengthy scene where people argue he is reformed even though he like a chicken and has razor dentures which he apparently fashioned in prison it is the kind of film where a couple sees a bashed in door and the girl dismisses it by saying oh my mom must have forgotten her keys she forgets a lot of things since my dad died the kind of film where the hysterical mother runs into a cop looking for luther and tells him the killer is in my house so what does he do he grabs her and literally drags her back to the house and says just show me where he is and i'll do the rest why not call back up br br it is too bad the film is filled with such horrible action and dialogue because the luther character is actually pretty interesting most of the credit goes to ed terry a dead ringer for tom noonan in manhunter who gives the clucking luther a genuine air of menace in the hands of a right director luther the geek could be on the same level as sonny boy or santa sangre and be a true cinematic oddity but albright is not that director and merely places the fascinating character of luther in tedious slasher trappings
<START> this is one of the best episodes of doctor who ever we have the the cyber conversion units may scare young children and of coarse the doctor doing one of his best acts bravo david tennant good scenes as if it was a movie with thrilling scenes in some streets an invasion on the base and leaving the world different to ours basically a 45 minute movie br br being part 2 of rise of the this would never disappoint with it having a great build up to the final br br the doctor plus an evil enemy daleks master autons or even is a battle to the death just be careful with young children watching this
<START> this movie was really bad plain and simple how a movie like this gets wide release is a wonder to me br br it's a decent idea but it just didn't flesh out edward burns is a decent actor though i liked his small role in saving private ryan br br let's get down to the big issue here br br the visuals were so incredibly bad i thought i was watching an old dinosaurs in 3d point and click adventure demo on windows 3 1 i mean i've seen cut scenes in console games from pre 2000 that have better looking dinosaurs than this i mean heck the original tomb raider t rex looked better than this one br br the lizard monkeys were laughable i thought they were some sort of ripoff creation from killer instinct i've seen better sock puppet monsters now that i think about it br br you know there's a ton of made for tv movies that are better than this how does a gem like scifi channels the shining get such a small audience but this load of cgi easy to make 4 gets put out in the open i don't care if it's a ray bradbury story
<START> this movie is stupid made by stupid people the plot i suppose works well enough for a horror movie but the actions these characters take is insanely stupid like incredibly non sensical stupid to the nth degree basically the whole movie consists of these 4 idiots being captured repeatedly despite having many many easy ways and opportunities to overcome their captor it does not make one lick of sense and is not entertaining whatsoever stabbing yourself in the eye is more is more rational and probably more fun than watching this br br spoilers the ending is hilarious the only good part of the movie i nearly died laughing at the end that whole stupid movie and it ends with the dumb girl getting shipped off in a crate to white slavery in asia hilarious i thought it was a totally awesome ending to a really sh tty movie
<START> this is a typical college comedy and its very average the story is ok but not very entertaining its about a unlucky guy named reno who looses his job gets his car ripped off and then his uncle dies in a his got a girlfriend though a nice one btw anyway this uncle gives him his mansion in la and mercedes as heritage and soon reno and his girlfriend moves to la to this new house the problem is that they would need some roommates in order to pay the high rent for this house and so the film unfolds br br the movie starts ok and has a few funny jokes here and there but the suddenly the movie takes a turn straight down to hell the ending is bad really bad it destroys everything about the movie you will know what i'm talking about when you see the movie br br 2 10
<START> i love the beach boys and their music so being that i am a filmmaker i thought wow a beach boys movie sounds great well wrong i just actually turned off hdnet the channel the movie was playing on because it was so bad someone above mentioned about editing well they should have at least looked at the monitors while they were filming i don't know if anyone else caught the mustache falling off the face of one of the guys after he kissed his wife and then he it back on with his hands ever heard of re taking a scene acting was terrible direction was terrible make up was terrible possibly the worst make up job i have ever seen brian wilson's fat looked like pl ado br br this is honestly the first time i have ever commented on imdb and i know it really doesn't make a difference but come on what the hell were the producers thinking
<START> night of the demons 1988 was another in a long line of teen horror films that were released on video and pay t v during that mecca of film making the eighties but unlike most of the crap that was being peddled around this one was actually a decent watch a group of bored teenagers decide to party halloween night away with a pair of bizarre sisters mimi kinkade and linnea quigley at the infamous hull house your usual cast of stereotypical teenagers are invited to the party but an average teenage bash turns into a night of terror as they try to survive halloween night when they undead residents of hull house decide to crash the party who'll survive this night of bloodshed and horror br br a nice horror film that is best seen in the unrated version if you watch the r rated cut then you'll miss all of the splatter effects and nudity stay tune for the amusing epilogue a gory film that was followed by an equally entertaining sequel for horror fans only br br highly recommended
<START> oh my god i was so expecting something more entertaining than this when i downloaded this movie seeing as 1903 was one of my fave years for movies ever but it sucked the plot although i'd hesitate to call it that is about some dumb elephant it slowly makes its way onto some platform and gets electrocuted to death lame even for a short film the plot was too thin to keep my attention edison is like the worst director ever plus the elephant has no screen presence whatsoever and the ending wow that wasn't predictable at all sarcasm br br the picture quality is horrible too you can barely tell what's going on most of the time the only positive thing about this movie is that unlike most other un scary horror flicks this didn't spawn eleven sequels other than that this is a complete waste of money and 1 minute of your life you'll never get back
<START> what a shame this movie was never released it is now playing on cable i tuned in based on my high regard for the stars and was rewarded by seeing a movie far better than the ones i've been paying to see in theatres recently i like to be surprised so often movies are marketed as offbeat but are in fact more of the same old recycled drivel this movie is genuinely different with the bonus of a heartwarming message jonathan pryce sings like an angel even though he is required by the plot to sing some of the most sentimental songs ever written he does them so well one doesn't mind cathy bates and rupert everett are well cast and superb but a newcomer in the role of cathy bates' daughter in law steals every scene she is in give this film a chance
<START> big d b tries to keep peace between the settlers and their red brothers br br boone an aging bruce bennett has to try and prove to the local indian chief lon chaney jr appearing to be drunk as usual that his son was killed by the tribe's leading jerk who has also been dealing in rifle trafficking when nobody's looking young sings though he holds his rifle like it's a mop br br ok western adventure directed by two guys neither of whom has many credits on his resume but this flick ain't too bad and it has a nice short running time of 76 minutes
<START> this is a luminously photographed and unusually well written western by veteran creator of rawhide charles marquis warren gordon douglas is its chief help in this regard its strong plot line can be told in a few sentences a hard nosed by the book cavalry officer captain richard lance captures a leader of the indian enemy after a massacre at a fort he insists on bringing the man back for trial to be sent his commander sends another man to try to take the prisoner for trial and the patrol is wiped out this means the leader has escaped and lance must now lead a second patrol and he picks the men the fort can most spare a company of problems to defend the advance fort that had been wiped out and save the command from another attack by stopping up the pass in that sector as lance young gregory peck is quite strong other in the large cast of this film which really shows life at a cavalry outpost looking like an army establishment of heterogeneous and quarreling types includes war bond powerful as a hard drinking sergeant neville brand and steve brodie as troublemakers warner anderson and lon chaney jr as psychological troublemakers and gig young art baker herbert as fellow officers with nana bryant as the colonel's wife even barbara payton as the love interest gets by in a difficult role michael is the captured war chief and jeff corey plays the scout there are really two great scenes in this very well made western the long section at the fort before the last patrol is sent out and that long patrol to the doomed ft defiant itself once at that fort peck gets to deliver a grand speech in which at the demand of the men he has lined up for orders he tells them each why he took them along reading them their shortcomings one by one they then tell them why they think he sent his best friend to die in his place take the indian in instead of going himself and he proves them wrong for the remainder of the film by winning his lonely battle through intelligence and courage the music by franz waxman is good the production qualities admirable the argument about what would happen if lance takes the war chief in happens to be true other than this mistake by the central character this is is great western it has been a favorite of mine for fifty years
<START> the final entry in the on the buses trilogy sees the usual wasters go about their business in wales i feel sure the franchise could have continued but harold pinter complained that the screenplays made him look bad in comparison and so no more were made br br it's actually less than two minutes before we get our first dollop of sexism a woman running for the bus finds her breasts fall out of her dress for no reason whatsoever still it does at least make stan reg varney laugh but then what doesn't he and jack bob grant spend the entire movie laughing uproariously with little or no provocation you get the impression that they'd wet themselves watching paint dry br br as before the only funny element is the genuinely amusing stephen lewis hilarious as blakey he's on his own though with a cheesy dated script that even wastes first rate talent like wilfrid brambell and henry mcgee yet it seems as if only lewis understands how to time the shaky material wringing laughs out of even the weakest lines describing how her daughter fell in a river stan's mum laments i hope it's not polluted well it will be now blakey quips br br the plot if indeed there is one sees stan lusting after a young girl but being continually thwarted by her domineering mother it's a recipe for side splitting hilarity i'm sure you'll agree and whether it's on a storm lashed boat or the swimming baths stan and exploits always produce the same result abject boredom later conquests include maria an italian stereotype and a staff co worker even stan's mum gets a one night stand with stan reminding her to put your tin drawers on br br when one of the comic highpoints is arthur overhearing olive trying to locate a light switch in the dark i can't find it and thinking she's talking about sex then you can see why this work reaches the upper levels of literary sophistication in fact why it didn't get in the bfi's top 100 movies is beyond me br br other rib tickling shenanigans involve olive anna karen breaking her glasses i don't know what's more surprising the lame predictability of the set up or the underdeveloped pay off the short sighted olive follows a man in a kilt into the gents thinking he's a woman in a skirt the next shot sees her marched out by blakey and redirected to the ladies and that's it next she ends up in another man's bed and is ordered out by his wife and no that's all there is to that scene too br br when holiday on the buses was last screened on british television there was a breakdown in transmission it actually came as blessed relief
<START> first let me mention the fact that in spite of its title in plural there is only one kitchen story as to whether died or not at the end i'm not so sure since in one of the very last scenes his pipe is seen lying on the table next to the two cups on the dvd cover there is a reference to tati it claims that the film is drÃ´le tati Â» funny reminiscent of tati Â» the great jacques tati relied mainly on mime and silent deadpan attitudes to achieve his comical effects and to offer his critically satiric views of his french society of course does take place during the and it does offer some rather faint satirical references to the absurdities of bureaucracy and there are some long moments were no words are uttered â but they are not really funny are all these small details enough to make a movie this being said i have to admit that does deal with the sometimes false objectivity of scientific research versus the of human subjective emotions generally speaking the movie was agonizingly slow with nothing much happening with barely any the involving parts were the set up during the first 15 minutes or so and during the last half hour or so indeed the last segment was finally interesting and moving it might seem that it was a short subject of less than an hour unduly stretched to some 90 minutes now about the set up a observation on the behavior of single males in their kitchen at first it seemed very promising â with the charting out of the comings and goings of bachelors in their kitchen as a means to determine what new inventions would be most useful to come up with but very quickly this premise turned out to be just a prologue an to introduce the real subject which was only fully developed towards the end and which was about loneliness and the invaluable bond of friendship pity i honestly wanted to like that movie yes it seemed so promising when i heard about some of its unusual little which were indeed there and which i enjoyed â such as the burning of a nose hair instead of using scissors to cut it off the of having a huge quantity of black pepper stacked away in a barn the role reversals the observant becoming the observed a mouth emitting sounds from a radio program and there is also a sick horse becoming the catalyst of half hidden human despair the relative importance of right or left side car driving in sweden and norway a reflection of the importance for each of these very close neighboring countries to affirm its individuality am i the sole person who did not fully enjoy that film does this necessarily mean that i'm wrong perhaps itâs almost generally praised were in fact for me perhaps could my individual views on this movie ironically reflect the very essence of the film itself which would be the vital necessity to have the right to differ to affirm individuality and not to follow blindly trends and opinions each one of us has the right to have different personal views and not to be a slave of the demands of bread winning demands often we do have other alternatives that would allow each one of us to be useful to our society while respecting inner principles in short being true to oneself â the way that in that film ends up by giving up his job while preferring to stay in his new friend house and help his out with the tasks of his farm and so la as the french say
<START> let me start by saying that there's really no reason to watch this movie i only sat through it because i was trying to kill some time before going to work br br basically it's your typical sophomoric comedy aimed at the teenage set there's nothing remarkable about it other than the complete ridiculousness of the story not to mention that there are plot holes big enough to sail a carnival cruise liner through obviously this isn't supposed to be a realistic movie it's supposed to be funny sadly it mostly fails on that count as well i must admit that i laughed a few times but mainly in a holy sh t i can't believe how stupid this is kind of way br br if you never see this movie you're not missing a thing
<START> possible spoilers br br i love dennis quaid and i like meg ryan i was looking forward to seeing them together being married and all i wanted to see their on screen chemistry okay that being said i guess the fact that they are actors their off screen relationship didn't have to permeate their performances especially with this script br br how stupid can a professor be to glue himself to anyone i don't remember the original but i can only assume that o'brien probably was handcuffed to his leading lady probably in a more inevitable way if i were bonded to someone i'd be pretty angry the crush i would have would definitely have dissipated quickly meg showed not even a little annoyance only slight surprise dennis would have to take me kicking and screaming that whole section of the movie was so horrible especially meg having to go to the bathroom 2 between dumpsters in the dark at night ewww no f ing way br br what's with dennis socking every single suspect in the movie sock first ask questions later not once not twice but too many times i could have kept count if i were so inclined br br the most interesting part of the movie was nick and his family drama too bad that couldn't have become more of the plot the assumed off screen drama leading up to this tragedy i think it could have been written in without distracting from quest br br my blame lies with the writer of this screenplay unless the director and others doctored it up so much that it's unrecognizable br br i won't even get into the real reason poor dex was murdered how ludicrous is that even when dex confronted the real killer and the reason was explained a true film noir moment everyone on screen seemed bored oh happened oh yawn dex even says this is a silly reason for a triple murder oh the tension you could cut it with a spoon br br if anyone but dennis had been in this movie i'd have to give it 1 2 star only because i really have seen worse but in this case 1 1 2 stars br br for dennis and meg stars see anything else
