<START> didn't sound like it was from a fantasy film the film is dark with dark overtones the soundtrack way too uplifting to the point it intruded on the visuals i'm sure they were aiming for something militant but it just didn't work the scene when astin is attempting to escape is a perfect example why does it sound like the goonies there is no comedy there is no brightness to this br br the idea of the movie is great and the acting is very good as well i enjoyed everyone's performances it's available on online viewing br br definitely worth a viewing but write your own soundtrack
<START> the movie is complete disaster i don't know who write scripts for movies like this one but i would definitely love to meet one of them and talk to him a little bit perhaps script writers really don't know sh t about situation in foreign countries in present or recent past or they just don't give a damn and write everything that they think it's interesting br br a great and everlasting formula with mad dictator 1 lonely hero an american of course might seem like a good idea but come on we had such a tyrant in serbia milosevic who did a lot of bad things to it's people but i simply can't imagine him yelling shoot them shoot them with such a barbaric passion like in medieval times maybe they wanted to show how evil he was but it was a stupid idea much better impression would be if he just did it in cold blood like the real monsters do br br the list of nonsense is too long but the funniest thing is no matter how many national tv stations there are in russia russian president watch american cnn news omfg br br give me a break br br burn this piece of please br br awful
<START> to be honest i thought this movie would be a japanese drama i was dead wrong this movie is based of the popular japanese anime novel of the same name it tells the story of a town that is cursed by the or the spiral in english little by little the towns residents start to slowly become dangerously and violently obsessed with anything to do with spirals and some of the residents start to actually turn into living things the actually have some sort of spiral within them such as a snail br br the movie was one giant random acid trip twisted with romance and drama sort of like what makes this movie disturbing is the ways that some of the people are obsessed with the spiral for example one of the dads has a garage full of house hold objects with spirals incorporated into them one girl took her extremely long hair and teased to an insanely huge spiral like style one kid slowly transformed into a human snail one man could twist his body into a spiral shape one woman attempted to cut her ear open to obtain the inside and one teen ran over himself so that he could be twisted around a car tire and one kid stuffed himself into a washer so he could become a spiral br br another very disturbing aspect of this very well syndicated is the atmospheric tone and the style in which this movie was shot the camera angles add to the psychotic and twisted story in other words a very good cinematography the overall coloring of this picture makes for a somewhat demented story the coloring is a blend of lime green yellow and a little orange and the special effects with some of the spirals are outstanding br br however like many japanese films this one has an undertone of forbidden love and romance between a girl and a boy however with all the spirals and strange happening going on in the town it is hard to keep up with the relationship of the two teens but in some way it is very irrelevant more like a second hand story that has nothing to do with the actual story of the spiral obsessed town br br overall i would recommend this film to anybody who likes vastly different and bizarre foreign films it has just enough wackiness and insanity it touched me
<START> after watching the series premiere of talk show with spike i took a moment to really think wow there are actually good shows on after 12 besides snl and i was also sad to see that it was only 30 minutes long his great writing skills helped this show overcome a series lack of money and helping hands electronic lincoln was hilarious and i really think this will be a good dark horse talk show br br i was very happy with the way he handled it and gave andy some good lines to work with as you would have suspected it was a little shaky but for that kind of time slot it was very good br br overall if you are not someone on weed or even if you are and you don't have something more important to do than watch this great piece and have a fun time doing it
<START> i was 12 when this film was released and adored it the song's were inspiring and it made me feel good watching it several time's at the cinema i actually had the soundtrack album and played the song's over and over br br 26 years later i'm ashamed just sat and watched it with my 2 daughters who enjoyed it lot's but my cynical older grown up eyes hated it it's very poorly directed in many places and considering it was lionel jeffries directing i really wanted to enjoy it the character animation was so rough yet the backgrounds were quite good i remember the critics at the time saying that it was a poor film and was horrified but now i agree br br it is an old film yes compared to what can be achieved now maybe that's why i thought it was good then but that does not excuse it for it's poor acting directing and sloppiness the main child actor's voice seem's dubbed which is very distracting too can't quite see what they were trying achieve when it was being made all that it become was a weak film
<START> okay it features one lovely blink and you miss it joke when the dead are rising from their tombs the names of the old time horror directors like jacques tournier and jean are featured in the tombstones and the smashing of morally bankrupt con rightist villains is on target preaching morals etc but why these soldiers are anti republicans because they have gone to the war most of them should be republicans right why they don't go to killing the enemies who killed them or something why they all want to vote against the republicans why this story has made of a movie questions never answered
<START> witchery or witchcraft as it's commonly known in europe beings with jane brooks linda blair waking up from a nightmare involving a witch jane's mother father rose annie ross freddie robert champagne are interested in buying an old deserted hotel on an island about 50 miles from boston renovating it reopening it together with jane their young son tommy michael manchester rose freddie are planning to travel to the island with an architect named linda sullivan catherine hickland to check on the amount of work that needs doing they also meet up with the estate agent jerry giordano rick farnsworth hire a local fisherman named sam george stevens to take them to the island once there they enter the hotel begin to inspect the property while back on the boat sam is killed the boat is let loose to sail off into the distance they discover two unexpected guests in the shape of a photographer named gary david hasselhoff his virgin fiancÃ© leslie leslie cumming who happens to be researching a book that she is writing about the gruesome legends superstitions surrounding the infamous island hotel as the night draws on a raging storm outside isolates them from the mainland as a mysterious 'lady in black' hildegard knef keeps popping up as the ancient evil that resides in the hotel seeks fresh victims for demonic possession human sacrifice satanic rites br br the director of this american italian co produced film is somewhat shrouded in mystery as the imdb lists fabrizio laurenti as martin but there are rumours that joe d'amato did the honours either way to be honest despite it's bad reputation i found witchery quite entertaining in a so bad it's good cheesy sort of way the script credited to harry spalding daniele on the imdb again is confusing too as the actual credit on the film itself is daniel davis anyway whoever wrote this thing did a decent job please stop laughing at heart it's a haunted house horror but adds some gory deaths a surreal feeling to everything the different sets of characters have reasonable motives didn't get on my nerves as much as i'd thought they might it's not plotted very well it doesn't make a whole a lot of sense the dialogue isn't exactly top drawer stuff but as a whole witchery entertained me for it's 95 odd minute duration plain simple it's reasonably well paced a little slow to get going maybe but there are plenty of surreal bizarre goings on gruesome deaths to keep one amused one part of witchery which destroys some of it's credibility is this so called storm there is no storm in sight the sea is probably calm enough to swim in supposed 'twist' ending didn't really work for me either just check out the dumb expression on cummings face on that final freeze frame the hotel provides for a good isolated location adds a certain atmosphere to the film which has the distinctive indefinable 'horror' feel throughout cheap horror at that technically witchery is not too bad at all it was obviously shot on location so it looks good throughout while not exactly the pinnacle of film making finesse it's overall production values are slightly better than expected the violence gore is of typical euro explicitness a woman has her lips sewn shut hung inside a fireplace so she can't scream as the others light it someone is crucified then burned alive impaled on a swordfish someones veins expand pop a woman is raped by a man with no lips witchery was shot in english so there is no dubbing as far as acting goes david hasselhoff linda blair in the same film what more can i say yes ladies hasselhoff does take his shirt off for the lads cummings takes hers off both hasselhoff blair are a hoot to watch in this thing however the little kid is very annoying really can't act at all i sure most sane film goers will disagree with my opinions but i still stand by the fact that i liked it would happily watch it again witchery is pretty good fun definitely worth a watch if your into 'bad' films or your a horror fan in general
<START> i have always had this morbid curiosity when it comes to notoriously bad and unpopular movies i also have always enjoyed so bad it's good flicks you're looking at someone who actually liked recent cheese filled kid flicks like catwoman and thunderbirds 2004 br br so i watched this and it turned out that all the critics are right about this one it's a major flop but unlike a lot of flops it isn't even enjoyable on any level not even just to make fun of it's just one boring cringe fest after another all the way through br br i had been warned i didn't listen i am a fool br br don't be a fool don't waste time and money on this pile of trash
<START> a fun romp a lot of good twists and turns and we were not even baked br br didn't know this movie even existed until watching the extra trailers on a monty python dvd oddly it was there along with the city of lost children and the adventures of baron br br the plot keeps you wondering throughout br br the acting was awesome hank azaria shows his talent again bill bob is billy bob br br definitely worth watching
<START> i knew it would be a bad movie when i rented it but i hoped for a good bad movie oh well had fun making fun of the endless sand trudging eating camel dung well actually eggplant and weird grimacing acting from i think it was about five actors the dvd needs a director's commentary so that i can find out what he was thinking or if he was at all i can't believe they actually went to england and wherever to film this could have been done anywhere would have been better if they had managed to get her naked the best line of the movie he waiting for his upgrades yup still waiting now that was funny if anyone had more than 3 pages of dialog beyond the narrator shut up already then i'll watch it again
<START> the third part of miike's dead or alive trilogy is as unrelated to the first two parts as they were to each other more or less show and riki are back again for the lead roles but this time the movie thrusts us forward 300 years or so into the future post apocalypse br br riki plays a tough cop an enforcer for the corrupt city's extreme police policies and show plays a drifter who hooks up with a bunch of the city's oppressed rebels the film must have been shot in hong kong as most of the rest of the cast are cantonese speakers with terence yin and josie ho being the most recognisable faces there's also a hk stunt crew on hand for the films action sequences which are very cool in a hk via miike style br br this could be fodder for a dreadful low budget b movie but in miike's hands it of course becomes something more interesting it's quite a slow thoughtful film that meanders along and doesn't try to force anything down the viewer's throat characters are rounded and interesting and the plot an interesting but fairly loose framework for the story to be hung on br br all in all a fairly low key effort until the action scenes which show miike's increasing prowess at directing and choreographing very nice action watching the short making of with show riki in wire rigs is really fun you can tell they were having a great time br br the finale of the film tries to tie together the 3 dead or alive movies which is quite unnecessary because each one is really self contained miike's explanation of the connection is very funny though and caps the series off quite nicely br br not as deep or well developed as not as outrageous and intense as still another good miike movie though
<START> after getting thrown out of their last job and finding employment scarce in the united kingdom the six members of the wonder boys better known as the crazy gang see an advertisement for employment in the gold strike town of red gulch in the yukon territory it's from a newspaper clipping and on the back there's a story about chamberlain saying the country better be prepared for war off they go to the yukon and the frozen limits br br by the way it's case of misplaced chamberlains the clipping is forty years old and it refers to joe chamberlain and the boer war rather than neville in the current crisis but that's typical of how things go for this crew i can see stan laurel making the same mistake br br of course when they get there it's a ghost town inhabited only by young jean kent and her grandfather moore marriott he's getting on in years and is a bit touched in the head got a gold mine that he's misplaced somewhere that he goes to in his sleep that is when he's sleepwalking the gang better help him find that mine or otherwise pretty ms kent won't marry stalwart trapper anthony hulme but rather saloon owner bernard lee a fate worse than death br br this was my first exposure to the crazy gang and i can see both why they were so acclaimed in the uk and why they never made any impact across the pond the jokes come fast and furious and then were a number of things that the code in the usa just wouldn't allow the jokes are also strictly topical british and a lot just wouldn't be gotten over here br br the sight gags are universal the final chase scene is worthy of anything that the marx brothers did in america my suggestion is that if you watch the frozen limits tape it if you have a working familiarity with british history and run it two or three times just to make sure you pick up everything it will be worth it
<START> okay i had watched this movie when i was very little and the day that we were cleaning out the closet i see this i thought i have no idea of what this movie was like so i went ahead and put it in oh my god this film is so darn bad i never thought that this film could ever get as close to my least favorite film as it did but i did laugh because all the jokes were so corny and ridiculous not funny so much stuff in this movie was funny because it was so stupid this film is not anywhere near good i would have to say if you want to watch this movie you definitely better not expect anything big and if you've already seen it trust me i feel your pain as well
<START> i'm pretty sure poe would have considered this a travesty the first two stories are decent nothing spectacular and then there's toby dammit what on earth was fellini thinking it's a rambling random dull piece with little to recommend it one should feel frustrated at the lack of backstory or conclusion but there's only relief that it's over
<START> superb even the author was laughing at the end and what a balcony scene this film has it all wickedly funny and yet strangely faithful to the bard of avon but not for the faint of heart and the best credits since monty python and the holy grail i am troma
