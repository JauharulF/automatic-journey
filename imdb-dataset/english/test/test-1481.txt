<START> this movie based on a true story of gerrit is one of the best films i've seen on race relations in south africa a very good history lesson of the turmoil of 80's south africa i put it in on the scale of american history x as far as it's depiction of how a young man can get seduced by the aryan doctrine and how the certain segments of the christian church taught a false doctrine regarding race to justify an injustice br br it's strong message of forgiveness and redemption is one of rarity in films today the violence is well done as to show the severity of crimes and greatness of his transformation br br one word about jan ellis who played gerrit he carries you through the darkness of beginnings to his enlightened transformation he went to some dark places as an actor and is to be commended on his performance br br another standout performance was that of mpho who plays moses one victim of crimes he was able to pull from some places of pain that really touched you as you watched his performance br br very good movie to show the teens
<START> although my exposure to world cultures is limited i do try this was a film that i tried and hated worst of all after hearing so many people decry the shallowness of typical hollywood fare and its stereotypical caricatures i saw characters too outrageous for eastenders being paraded as realistic br br clint wants out of the drug life and to do this he aspires to be a waiter aim high i always say brad or a faxed photo of him or quite possibly a curly wig on a stick it was hard to tell offers to hire clint if he gets a pair of shoes br br clint and a huge entourage apparently wander the whole of england trying to get him some shoes eventually they end up at a suburban home whose isn't clear mum helps a girl shoot up oh now there's some realism for you mrs brady may have been a ridiculous stereotype of american housewives but she never helped marsha tie off and find a vein good god dad comes home and sings some elvis tunes and then chases the kids away br br why didn't clint borrow some money and buy shoes at a second hand store why didn't he go to a church and ask a kindly nun for some help why didn't he hang out in front of a shoe store and panhandle i just don't know none of these things seemed to be beneath him benevolent groups like goodwill and the salvation army have stores to help people i know people who work there if someone with no money showed up and needed shoes the staff would give the person some shoes maybe not prada or gucci but some form of foot covering not many of these groups hand out cell phones to the underprivileged but shoes are usually no problem what a dumb concept the world or at least the western part of it simply isn't that cruel in england maybe it's from the queen's royal charity rather than goodwill but people who need shoes do get them br br aside from the quest for shoes there was no discernable plot to get in the way of the action not that it made the movie any quicker or more bearable mind you despite checking the tape jacket several times i was not watching the 20 hour extended version it only seemed that way br br did clint get his shoes did the cardboard cutout of brad dourif hire him at the restaurant did i ever watch anything else foreign ever again br br spoiler yes yes and yes br br as for the fate of this particular film i decided to end it all i took out my s w 45 and shot a half inch hole through the cassette blammo i made sure to rewind it first i put it back in the tape sleeve returned it to the rental store and amazingly no one ever called to ask about it meaning of course that no one else rented it for at least the remaining three years i lived in that city others knew something that i didn't live and learn br br btw if you rent something you've never seen before and someone has actually put a bullet through it take it as a sign and if you work at the video department i'm just kidding br br footnote this classic has yet to see the light of day on dvd for which we should be eternally thankful to the digital gods

<START> dracula john carradine visits dr edelman onslow stevens who believes everything can be cured by science he wants to cure his vampirism edelman agrees then lawrence talbot lon chaney jr pops up looking for a cure for his turning into a werewolf thr frankenstein monster is discovered too but doesn't really do anything br br very ambitious plot for a universal horror film from the 1940s trying to cure the monsters by science is actually an interesting idea also this movie has beautiful sets love the castle to doctor lives in tons of atmosphere is very well directed great use of shadows and has pretty good special effects br br the acting is all good except for carradine he tries but i could never accept him as dracula also lionel atwill pops in playing as always the chief of police this is pretty much forgotten and derided as a stupid film but i think it's very good it's also to last time the universal monsters were done seriously the next film was in 1948 in abbott costello meet frankenstein it's a great film but the accent is more on comedy br br the only real flaw here is there's a lot of plot for 67 minutes and some gaps in logic why does dracula try to bite lovely martha when he's being cured and why and how does the doctor get into his castle still these are small complaints recommended
<START> two hands is a good addition to the australian film catalogue br br it is that curious mix of real life surreal life comedy tragedy and love the australians have developed on their own br br heath ledger is basically a good if naive guy wanting to get on he falls in with a local big man bryan brown but at the very moment he sets a first toe on the dark path to crime he meets alex rose byrne here is the cause of the error to change his life in ways unexpected after getting on the wrong side of accidentally things get very bad very quickly and if not for a little otherworldly help this would have been a short sad film yes jimmy learns a few lessons in life and no one escapes uninjured in one way or another but at the end of it has a feel good feel to it although there is a lawless theme through the story it is not glorified and helps to show how destructive crime can be on normal lives br br heath ledger is excellent as jimmy innocent and savvy at the same time rose is hypnotic as alex and bryan is marvellous as usual this is a small ensemble of characters are believable and i found myself caring about the good guys and disliking the baddies br br this dvd is usually in the cheap aisle so i would recommend adding it too your dvd collection it would be money well spent br br 8 out of 10
<START> its a good film set in vienna about a cab driver toni donald who steals a passenger's identity when the passenger is shot whilst sitting in the back of his cab this gives him an identity as he is an illegal immigrant but he needs to play out the role of the victim until he catches a flight to the u s with a ticket in the victim's name mrs joan rumbles him but she is accused of having mental problems by her husband claude francis lederer a concert pianist as a result toni is let off the hook claude does not want to part from his wife but she runs away from him there are several plot twists and eventually both toni and mrs make a run for it together they are both trying to escape from their lives in vienna there is a tense exciting build up to the finale are they going to get away br br unfortunately the picture quality isn't fantastic and there is a line that runs down the middle of the picture for a while the cast are all very good in their roles especially francis portrayal of claude also important to the story are manfred inger as the cab company owner marie inge as hometown girlfriend and the inspector hermann erhardt br br its a good film
<START> well i like patricia she is a beautiful lady and an extremely gifted and versatile singer her acting in this film is more than competent and from my point of view about the only redeeming of this film she very gently captures the essence of the lonely singer with a very serious problem however what i tremendously dislike about the film is the shameless product placement for a well known french chain of hotels the other thing is that the story seems to meander for way to long without really deciding what the film is about and what it wants to be on a positive note you may argue that the film is not predictable but you could also say it's plainly boring because of the lack of cohesion there are some nice shots in the film you can't help thinking that all the parts just don't add up to anything at all it really is a pity really shines in this film
<START> for connoisseurs of bad movies galaxina is a true gem with truly horrid dialog acting and directing it's no choice for people seeking a proper movie but as one of the most unintentionally hilarious movies of its genre it's priceless for a good laugh in particular the scenes involving the harley davidson worshiping motorcycle cult are especially good and many other scenes present an opportunity for a cheap laugh br br sadly the scenes with dorothy stratten really fail to deliver but since she's playing an android i suppose one can excuse her for wooden acting br br bad movie lovers don't pass this one up
<START> the message of hero is quite clear the idea of greater china is more important than the death and the suffering of millions at a time when china is dangling its war toys over taiwan it is unacceptable for western viewers to endorse this piece of over produced government sponsored dogmatic trash br br particularly surprising is the promotion of this film by the liberal media roger ebert of chicago tribune david of slate charles taylor of salon and many others have wholeheartedly endorsed hero in so doing they have implicitly legitimated its reactionary political message the only critic that i know of who saw through the film's glossy facade was j hoberman of the village voice who wrote of the film's sanctimonious traditionalism and its glorification of ruthless leadership and self sacrifice on the altar of national greatness i for one sign my name under final pronouncement hero is nothing more than fascinating fascism
<START> definitely worth renting good clean family entertainment my 4 and 5 year olds and i loved it kept them on the edge of their seats i recommend parents sit with their younger children to watch this as it can be quite suspenseful for them it's not too often you can find movies that you can watch with your children and so this is a rare find some of the acting realism isn't quite there at times or maybe is a little corny but children don't seem to notice or care they love it parts are predictable but other parts are not like trying to figure out who the good guys are and who the bad guys are the movie doesn't have any really scary creepy stuff and so i doubt it will give children nightmares it does inspire children to dream which is something we need to encourage and foster more in our children rent and be blessed
<START> another great musical from hollywoods golden age i liked this movies story about a trio of friends who are performers at a small nightclub that is far from broadway and all its glitter although not the big time they are very content with their lives and the small club where they perform gene kelly plays the owner of the small club and is also the boyfriend of one of its dancers rita hayworth who happens to garner some attention when she's given an opportunity to be on a cover of a magazine trouble begins for gene kelly as his girlfriend is now the talk of the town phil silvers plays one of the three friends and does a good job of course there is the music and the dancing one dance performance by gene kelly stands out he is walking along the street at night alone and he see his reflection in a shop window his reflection soon starts dancing along with him in the streets great cinematography don't miss this one great entertainment
<START> the mystery and its solution was a great noir conceit i do have some questions though maybe i wasn't paying enough attention br br who killed the neighbor and why who killed the replacement girl and why br br and some minor quibbles they should have shown the at the hotel for the switch not that they should have shown the switch but they should have shown jim and the girl going in the hotel jim going to the bathroom coming out and being told by the bartender that his girlfriend went to the car without him br br then jim getting back in the car and seeing the sleeping woman and little girl in his back seat br br this would have given the viewer a sporting chance at figuring out the solution br br i wish i taped it though i'd like to see it again
<START> i think shane black is one of the all time greatest action screenwriters ever he gave us the awesome at it's time lethal weapon shooting mel gibson to super stardom then followed that up with the second best movie bruce willis has ever been in the last boyscout stumbled a bit with the last action hero but redeemed himself with this one the long kiss goodnight br br if you're a fan of action films this has it all action comedy thrills then tops it of with more action comedy and thrills geena davies is great samual l jackson is even greater don't miss it br br 9 10
<START> i caught this film at an screening in los angeles in july 2006 it's rough around the edges sound recording in particular is wobbly and often very funny the script is rather jarringly episodic and ends abruptly but ash christian infuses the film with lots of genuine heart it's also a refreshing change of pace to have a gay film that doesn't star underwear models obsessed with partying and chasing straight guys props to a warmly sympathetic jonathan as mr cox a kindred spirit to rodney ash christian the lively and spirited ashley as rodney's best friend and deborah as rodney's mom who is given the best one liners in the script and steals her every scene the film is like its writer director and a bit odd but also very sweet
<START> it may be hard to explain how but this film is a masterpiece perhaps because i never imagined that a plot like this or a film with so few words would convey all this poetry the true poetry and aristocracy of human passions and obsession bogard is amazing and needless to say that venice is utilised as a perfect scenery dark sinking and dreary just like soul and classical music is more that a simple background escort to human feelings in my opinion a classic masterpiece of european film making
