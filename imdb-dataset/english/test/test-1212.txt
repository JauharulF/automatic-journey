<START> i thought this was a great action flick a very good role for geena davis she is a very versatile actress one of my next to angelina jolie i actually watched the long kiss goodnight right after seeing the new tomb raider movie it got me thinking charlie or lara which one would win in a fight either way both women are very strong intelligent characters that are fun to watch especially when they're kicking butt i just hope to see geena in another film soon seems like she's been out of the spotlight a bit too long it would be especially nice to see her in another film with samuel l jackson now they make a great duo watch this film if you haven't you won't be disappointed
<START> simply the best and most realistic movie about world war ii i've ever seen not only because the german soldiers talk german and russian soldiers talk russian no english in a german or russian dialect also because of the realistic decor in which the movie was shot the acting is outstanding no hollywood sentiment at all even no love story stalingrad was supposed to be one of the most horrific battles during the war and in such context there's no place for sentiment or romantic scenes what you get is a movie which will make you thrill to the bone and which have one of the best unhappy endings a movie could have
<START> start with the premise that you will do anything to replace your lost love with a look alike throw in your scientific knowledge of a disease isn't this the stuff that leo g carroll contracted from the spider venom in tarantula throw in the fact that the main character instead of finding some way to attract the young woman engages in heavy handed stalking until he totally draws attention to himself and has to hatch this insane plot if he can make the girl's father sick then help him recover she will marry him the problem is that most of the events are random and unpredictable anyone with half a brain would have seen through things there's a third party a woman that the doctor played by j carroll naish has treated with great insensitivity you know she is going to be a factor there's also a gorilla kept in a cage who is used occasionally for heaven know's what oh well there is so little sense to this who thing that it plays itself out and people get their just desserts
<START> this movie is the worst ever sorry but this was a total waste of good hours quasi psychology and b actors makes a baaaad horror movie you can say that if you are into bad movies you will adore this one and the hot chick wasn't all that hot there is absolutely no climax to the movie and the worst part is the ending song some homemade thing with these words its in awful condition the world is a mess when heads fall of bodies and girls wont stay dressed the cops they are clueless eating donuts in their car next morning headless body topless bar jesus sorry guys but milks gone bad with this one
<START> from the opening shot of the meteor falling towards earth you know you're in for something special br br this is an ultra low budget shot on video movie about a group of teens stranded on a lighthouse island with some monsters the story is unremarkable and nothing you haven't seen a thousand times before the acting isn't great but isn't completely horrible however the special effects of which there are a good deal are laughable at best in fact if you can read this sentence chances are better than 50 that you could do a more credible job creating the video explosion and compositing effects in this movie than the filmmakers br br the movie's saving grace if you're in the mood for a grade z turkey of a film is that there's always something happening and it never gets boring and if you like making fun of bad movies with your friends you might just find this worth a dollar rental br br and i must say i appreciated the opening joke that is the dumbest name for an island i've ever heard probably the best moment in the movie
<START> along with cops the goat is one of keaton's two funniest shorts which makes it one of the best shorts ever made this has an decent plot for a short and it forms a perfect line on which to hang some great gags keaton is mistaken for an escaped convict how the mistake happens is a classic and then must elude the authorities best gags the bread line and t he elevator
<START> such an awesome movie i was transfixed the entire time and so emotionally overcome in the end the two young male actors in the movie were more than compelling in their performance as their friendship and support of one another was quite believable and i thought the comparison contrast between their respective home lives vs health situations were made so very real between them the success in bringing this movie to life was obviously a team effort so to actors producers writers directors and all of production i say well played having missed the credits at the beginning of the movie it was being shown on hbo i was so very surprised that i had to actually research albeit briefly the internet in order to find the title of this movie something so great should have been known by me a clear indication that this movie must be re released
<START> have you heard the theory of cloning redundancy where a copy is poorer than the original caddyshack 2 is a perfect example of that they try to duplicate everything from the first movie now in a few cases this work robert stack is actually a little better than ted knight when they play essentially the same character i actually like randy quaid who is no more or less offensive than bill murray in the original but jackie mason is no rodney dangerfield and worse of all demonstrated once and for all that dan ackroyd is one of the worst comedy actors of all time there is very little that i like him in and nailed the coffin shut on his comedic career as far as i'm concerned he seems to feel the same sticking more to like driving miss daisy and hosting factor other than that it's mostly been there done that for caddyshack 2 watch the original twice rather than each version once and you'll get more for your rental money
<START> but i still enjoyed watching her so i gave it a 3 instead of a 1 her expressions are priceless some of the other cast members e g michael are really slumming too the cat himself is somewhat amusing aside from that the movie is all cliche culminating in a much too long car chase it's also at this point that the movie becomes unnecessarily crude having been very family until then
<START> loved today's show it was a variety and not solely cooking which would have been great too very stimulating and captivating always keeping the viewer peeking around the corner to see what was coming up next she is as down to earth and as personable as you get like one of us which made the show all the more enjoyable special guests who are friends as well made for a nice surprise too loved the theme and that the audience was invited to play along too i must admit i was shocked to see her come in under her time limits on a few things but she did it and by golly i'll be writing those recipes down saving time in the kitchen means more time with family those who haven't tuned in yet find out what channel and the time i assure you that you won't be disappointed
<START> swift's socialism and pacifism come through against all odds in this well done remake did you know there is no after well fact he meets warlike miniatures socialist giants head in the clouds literally philosophers and pacifist horses who rule over yahoos nearly neanderthal humanoids is that where yahoo came from we also meet the dastardly dr bates the devoted mary gulliver the sweet and devoted son thomas and the full cast of a truly horrific 19th century lunatic asylum suspension of disbelief comes easily and our 7 and 12 year old girls enjoyed it as much as my husband and i did sorry for the length imdb requires 10 lines
<START> the undoubted highlight of this movie is peter o'toole's performance in turn wildly comical and terribly terribly tragic does anybody do it better than o'toole i don't think so what a great face that man has br br the story is an odd one and quite disturbing and emotionally intense in parts especially toward the end but it is also oddly touching and does succeed on many levels however i felt the film basically revolved around peter o'toole's luminous performance and i'm sure i wouldn't have enjoyed it even half as much if he hadn't been in it
<START> wagons east is widely known as john candy's last movie as he died on the set that's just what makes it so sad not simply that candy suffered a fatal heart attack but that it was on the set of such a crummy movie seriously i don't know what they were thinking when they came up with this piece of crap but the flick has no redeeming qualities it's as if they took every unused script for stupid westerns and just mixed them together and filmed it no wonder john candy didn't want to make the movie maybe his contractual participation was what did him in br br anyway the point is that candy did much better than this throughout his career to be certain he had already completed michael moore's canadian bacon in which the united states declares war on canada just stick with that one and you can say that candy ended his career honorably as for richard lewis who previous had co starred with candy in eugene absurd but hilarious once upon a crime he made up for this piece of crap by frequently guest appearing on countdown with keith in later years
<START> shah rukh khan plays an obbsessed lover who would go to any lengths to get his lady juhi chawla does a wonderful job of making the best of her character and sunny deol plays the hero and action man this film is very good and i'd it to anyone
<START> during the civil war a wounded union soldier hides out in a isolated confederate ladies' school where the head mistress and the teacher of the school decide to care for him and keep him about until trouble starts brewing between the lonely and sexually frustrated women and girls the soldier decides to take advantage of this situation but it all comes at a price in the end br br dirty harry 1971 which was made about the same time of the beguiled might be my favourite collaboration between eastwood and siegel but after seeing this i tend to think this to be the finest work together a very atypical savvy and stylish vehicle for eastwood is always on the mark with richly controlled direction by don siegel and a hauntingly rousing music score by lalo schifrin standing out strongly is its lurid and bleak nature that's intrusively planted into the film's psychological makeup and manipulative strangle hold in sexual depravity it's played out and makes it more the brooding and blood curdling when those random shocks and saucy intentions take hold with gripping tension the way siegel illustrates john b sherry and alluring bold slow burn screenplay taken from the novel of thomas cullinan is effectively done through stark emotions and the script's tight lyrical context siegel's strong direction captures the idyllically southern victorian setting with such potently garnished photography and he sets up some strangely piercing imagery with great clarity and restrained br br while the performances are truly commendable and high of quality clint eastwood as the smoothly suave sweet talking chameleon union soldier is very impressionable and delightfully assured a profoundly eminent geraldine page steals the picture as the hardened head mistress and the elegant elizabeth hartman adds a delicate to her innocent character mae mercer is strongly tailored as the black maid and jo ann harris is the pick of the crop from the young pupils with her seductively sly persona br br honestly while eastwood's charismatic character plays the field for his own selfish needs there's still mixed intentions there that the one's being played where rivalry between the women creep in turn out to be no better than their guest at the end throughout there's a perversely dark sense of humour and ironic touch settling into the material what's demonstrated here is simply more than your basic little minded shocker but one that's thickly layered with intrigue and a sense of realism that's hard to shake that also goes for its extremely eerie title and closing song br br a effectively chilling low key item that's hard not to be tempted by it's swinging hospitality
