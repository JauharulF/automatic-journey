<START> by jove what an unholy mess revenge incestuous love mechanical games like fighting ceaseless and utterly unnecessary violence some primitive music hammering away at the bewildered victims big surprises which actually tend to be about as revelatory as the national headlines add some shoddy camera movements pretending to be stylish and creative and you've already impressed the crowds this movie's totally undeserved popularity powerfully indicates the very low level pop sub culture has succeeded not only in achieving in the last decades but also in imposing as dominant taste on an impotent audience for by far deeper insights into human sufferance under mental sickness without oldboy s vulgar excesses i recommend an older dutch french movie the vanishing br br well don't believe there's absolutely nothing good to say about this movie in fact there is the in famous scene in which the hero is really a hero an abject father who sleeps with his daughter and then attempts to obtain rather than redemption eats a live octopus benefits greatly from the vivid presence of the best actor in the entire cast the octopus itself too bad the poor beast having been eaten couldn't survive its one and only act in order to obtain yet another worthless diploma for the best actor at the cannes festival br br which festival by the way between moore's propaganda nonsense and this epitome of worthless if somewhat exotic weirdness became a festival of the vapid and of the ludicrous br br sic transit gloria mundi
<START> this has to be one of the most awfully scripted films i've ever seen it's basically a remake of the beast from 20 000 fathoms 1953 but done with your standard snake like puppet monster instead of a sleek ray harryhausen creation combine the plot of that classic monster movie with the production qualities and acting level of the creeping terror and you have an idea of what this movie is like br br the movie is dubbed although by the original actors i think that the movie was originally dubbed in italian for that countries audiences then redubbed for us release which just makes the movie seem weird the sounds like in a japanese monster movie just don't quite match properly to the action on the screen even if the actors' lips are moving properly br br poor ray milland he's certainly come a long way down from the lost weekend or dial m for murder or any of the number of excellent movies he was in add this to his other sci fi panic in the year zero x the man with x ray eyes and you can see a once good actor fallen into a boris karloff syndrome stuck doing really bad horror films in foreign countries just for the work
<START> i tried lord help me how i tried but there are just some people almost incapable of creating quality brett ratner uwe boll britney spears and asylum to their credit the 9 11 commission report seems like an honest attempt by the company to advance into a more sophisticated state of storytelling and movie making but for all intents and purposes it comes off as another truly film in their gallery at the opening the disclaimer notifies audiences that all the names have been changed but the names of the terrorists remain relatively the same a man named attempts to learn how to fly a plane with a stone cold grimace that would instantly make anyone uneasy this undercover agent is able to learn how to fly on a small computer and you have to wonder not how he was able to get into this program so easily but on how these people didn't even ask questions because this scene is so far fetched in its presentation and the actor playing this man is extremely over the top and you can see that director scott attempts to mimic paul greengrass with a bright grainy photography that's followed by an awfully dizzying and irritating hand held direction that throughout the entire film attempts to take off from greengrass's gung ho guerrilla film making techniques br br you can sense scott emulating greengrass's technique for realism but it becomes rather lame brained halfway in meanwhile the film comes off less a traffic take off and more a take off on law order in which we'll have the disclaimer notifying us the names have been changed the logo almost reminiscent of the law order logo and then ninety minutes of the actors pumping their chests and discussing politics br br neither of which are ever as compelling as it tries to be and then when the film seems as if its attempting to be an adult drama scott relies on his old the sex scene scott's new film looks like it really wants to be thought of as a low budget munich but it's not and it manages to be underwhelming on every such occasion possible the 9 11 commission report falls flat and that's because its limited in its attempts to imitate other films br br while i appreciate the ambition inherent behind the camera this new perspective of the events leading up to 9 11 is flat and dull hard as it may try to be a low budget munich it's only really as entertaining as a normal dolph lundgren film you'd find on cinemax
<START> witchy hildegard knef traps a group of people in an isolated hotel and picks them off one by one in twisted disgusting ways i thought i'd seen it all until one unfortunate man here is crucified and then has his head set on fire hildy is quite the prankster too she takes a nagging harpy and sews her mouth shut then hangs her upside down in the chimney just in time for a roaring fire witchery made me sick it made my eyes hurt i was ready to write it off as the worst movie ever ever ever made by otherwise competent people until the finale i have to admit i loved the ending it involves a boy and his toy tape recorder cornered by linda blair looking fantastically possessed the scene only lasts for about a minute and the movie's over but you know that old saying if you've got a great ending people will forgive you for just about anything
<START> in order to pull off a job like this caper in rififi e g the score and its opines one has to have nerves of steel this one apparently demands and commands it jules dassin is the master br br i was on the edge of my seat throughout it deserves to be better known even though it was not at the time of its release in 1954 due one supposes to the director being blacklisted in the hypocritical hollywood of its day br br i would recommend this film to anyone who has not has the pleasure of seeing it br br i cannot give it enough stars
<START> for those not in the know the asterix books are a hugely successful series of comic books about a village of indomitable who resist caesar's invasion thanks to a magic potion that renders them invulnerable supermen there have been several animated features only one of them the twelve tasks of asterix really capturing the wit and spirit of the books despite being an original screen story before a perfectly cast christian clavier and gerard depardieu took the lead roles in two live action adaptations that proved colossally successful throughout europe but made no impression whatsoever in the english speaking world br br the uncut french version is great fun but sadly does not appear to be available in a version with english subtitles outside of the uk dvd while there's still no sign of a us theatrical or dvd release the miramax version of asterix et mission is also on that dvd and has played on uk tv and you'll never guess what it's been completely re edited at least 21 minutes gone and dubbed into english maybe mistook it for a hong kong movie after all he never saw a foreign film he didn't think couldn't be improved by heavy re editing and shelving for a few years br br whereas asterix et contre cesar was lovingly dubbed into english from a particularly good translation script by terry jones but otherwise left unaltered that sort of thing really isn't the miramax way the results ain't good the film was the best attempt to get the books mixture of slapstick anachronisms and highbrow classical humorous asides to the screen but a lot of the classical references are gone such as the great raft of the medusa sight gag or the cyrano de bergerac references from depardieu alongside anything that seems too french or might slow the picture down with the result that the first 20 minutes are now a real slog several punchlines to sequences are missing depardieu's part has been trimmed his part was already fairly small because of his serious health problems during the shoot the us version has been partially digitally to change the unhealthy of his face in the original and as usual with dubbing because literal translations into english don't fit properly lines are either rushed so much they're not funny anymore or the dialogue has been changed completely a couple of these changes are admittedly funny like one character dreaming of a world in which he could move his lips in french and hear the words in english br br not a total disaster but very disappointing considering how good the full length version is it would be nice to think that miramax would do a shaolin soccer and release both versions but since they've shelved both films for two years since paying for them another classic case of harvey's notorious chronic remorse gee wonder why disney were so p d at their and still have no release plans that may just be too much wishful thinking br br it's a real pity that such an accessible and entertaining film will now only be available to non french speakers in such a clumsily bowdlerised version it seems the plucky may have been able to defeat caesar's legions but are no match for the miramax
<START> don't be fooled by the other reviewers although this film contains an impressive array of talent the material they present leaves a great deal to be desired nat king cole's 3 numbers are pretty lame and not even close to his later efforts though he does impress with his piano playing is not a bit funny though i remember her as a very entertaining talk show guest from my youth actually the best performances are from a couple of fat guys who impress with a lively tap dance and a four tops takeoff and the jazz band itself especially in the number featuring the bass player the print itself is pretty poor quality and the wonderful butterfly mcqueen is totally wasted in the wraparound plot
<START> step by step is my opinion is a pure abc hit i can't recall every episode but i still enjoyed it it's hard to say which episode was my favorite however i think it was always funny when a mishap occurred at school i always laugh at that as a matter of fact i think just about every single one of j t brandon call and cody's sasha mitchell lines were funny it would have been nice if penny had stayed on the show throughout its entire run everyone always gave a good performance the production design was spectacular the costumes were well designed and the writing was always very strong in conclusion i hope it never stops airing in syndication
<START> normally bbc productions of jane austen are pretty good but northanger abbey is just odd what were they thinking this film has little of austen's charm and ironically mimics the gothic novels that austen so wonderfully mocked not only that the gothic sequences are tacky over the top and frankly silly the actress playing miss morland is poorly cast with no obvious appeal to attract the attentions of an eligible bachelor and though i rather liked the creepy peter firth as mr he is not a bit like the novel even when delivering dialog straight out of the book robert hardy as general turned in one of his few terribly ham performances this film was so bizarre and strange that i actually watched it again just to savor how freakishly wrong it was
<START> without a shadow of a doubt this is and probably will always be the worst film i have ever had the missfortune to see my whole life take 5 wooden actors who got thrown out of acting school because they were so wooden someone sat on them thinking they were a bench br br then add a cheap camcorder you know the old vhs types that cost Â£20 on ebay add a terrible story line with no effects and yes you have this film what a shocker it was they couldn't even save it by having a fit girl in it she was fat and ugly and was the worst of all i actually watched it all as i could not believe this crap ever got funded br br miss at all costs
<START> and you know why because they thought or at least made horror fans think that a bunch of obnoxious foul mouthed screaming teenagers some stupid demons where do they come from what is their purpose who knows and a dark mansion are all you need to make a horror movie needless to say they were wrong you also need a script some logic some rules and some invention this flick does have one scene that lives up to its reputation the lipstick scene of course and a couple of funny moments the kid brother's description of his mother's cookies linnea quigley's don't look at me scene it also has more profanity than any movie i've watched since i last saw reservoir dogs literally every fourth or fifth word is a f or a b then again when a movie begins with four false scares in its first 5 minutes you know not to expect anything resembling good filmmaking 1 2
<START> a mediocre at best horror flick that deals with dumb not so horny teens who discover an evil video game gasp is killing those who die in the game double gasp this movie is the sustained mystery of the mystery gang in scooby doo i was waiting for them to pull off a mask of one of the villains i could deal with this for 40 minutes even as a movie on sci fi but going all the way to the theaters come on people the effects were very mediocre this whole scenario is something of crummy two but director uwe boll since this would be his cast as always the great thing about video game systems is the glorious power button i'd suggest using that mid viewing 1 2
<START> once you sit down to see this film a cannon for you get the feeling it's going to be a great the reason the film begins with a rousing score by noted composer elmer bernstein who gave us such memorable themes as 'the great escape and the magnificent seven ' indeed when you read the opening credits headlining the cast is none other than george peppard as capt rod douglas you know it's going to have action and lot's of it furthermore when you see actor john russel playing general john j you know you're in for a heroic saga the story is taken from the annals of the mexican revolution and involves the u s in a border town dispute with the mexican bandits who cross the rio grande in the early 1900s among the most brazen of the rebel leaders is general cordova raf with his army of mexican revolutionaries he attacks kills his men and steals some valuable artillery pieces since the united states army cannot enter mexico legally capt douglas is sent on what is slated a suicide mission without orders and without aid from his mission is to retrieve the cannons destroy a rebel stronghold and bring cordova back alive selecting the roughest toughest most experienced certainly the most insolent men available douglas enters mexico and attacks the nearly impregnable fortress dramatic action follows as does lots of explosive excitement if one is asks for criticism i would say the choice of heavies and john are not very menacing not so with the men who side with peppard pete duel and don gordon who is superb nevertheless this movie is recommended as good viewing
<START> this film follows the life of a great guitar player who wants to make it big but acts irresponsibly almost to the point of self destruction br br i was expecting the usual woody allen witty dialogs sarcasm and humour but sweet and lowdown failed to provide any the main character ray is an egocentric rude irresponsible and hurtful man he is so unlikeable that i do not want to now about him or care about him i wonder why a film about him has to be made the pacing of the story is slow making the film a terrible bore even sean penn's great acting fails to revive the film to a watchable level br br i like woody allen's films a lot but sweet and lowdown is a major disappointment
<START> let's face it this is a pretty bad film however if you go in ready to make fun of it you can survive the experience okay you'll scream in agony a lot african jungle fun in a dopey kind of way br br tom conway who spends most of the film wearing a funky chapeau is using the local witch doctor and mad science to create a perfect being it looks like a varmint that has been on a six week drunk and is in a sack dress ugly is being kind but it won't kill for him because he's using a good girl as his subject he needs a bad bad girl br br marla english and lance fuller are two petty crooks in search of african gold acting lessons for ms english should have been at the top of the search list she's a bad girl and lets everybody know it in a performance worthy of a junior high school play mike touch connors is the white guide english fuller con into leading the expedition br br english conway finally meet and it is a match made in hell she is the perfect subject to become his voodoo creature because she'll do anything stress anything to get what she wants you will do anything to stop the agony of this movie at this point br br what made this movie interesting for me was conway wearing that funky tribal hat headdress floral piece still trying to figure out what kind of dead animal it was guess he thought if he pulled it down low enough over his eyes nobody would recognize him br br truly bad cinema
