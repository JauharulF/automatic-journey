<START> first of all this movie is a piece of reality very well realized artistically some kind of combination between american beauty and as good as it gets and of course something specifically to all russian movies of course the valuable one no dirty propaganda the problem of loneliness of man especially recommended for the people which really want to see beyond all propaganda about communism both positive or negative propaganda a movie about common people their problems lack of satisfactions especially for young ones fear when touch the real and too dirty face of the society and about the fake solutions alcohol and violence and probably the only real solution true love of course it's very well located in the space and time of russian perestroika but it's valid for all the society except a perfect one but don't worry not possible to find this on our earth for the last time definitely recommended
<START> the evil professor moriarty plots to gain control of both sherlock holmes and the secret weapon which could win the war for the nazis br br basil rathbone nigel bruce return to the screen as sir arthur conan doyle's beloved detective and sidekick sherlock holmes dr watson in this entertaining little mystery universal studios wasted no money on either fancy production values or a sensible script knowing that its two stars would be all the attraction an audience would need indeed rathbone as the cerebral ego and bruce as the bumbling id seem to actually become the characters they are creating gleefully keeping their faces straight while engaged in the most utter nonsense br br dennis makes his first appearance as the dogged inspector lestrade of scotland yard teamed with bruce these two good hearted but pedantic fellows actually get to save the intellectually superior holmes' life twice lionel atwill a master of the sinister who deserves more recognition for his talent does a fine job as moriarty making the wicked rascal a foe worthy of holmes' steel relishing the scenes in which he gets to inflict torture pain br br william post jr and verne play the swiss scientist and his girlfriend who are at the heart of the mystery but they're not given much to do sweet mary gordon makes a token appearance as holmes' landlady mrs hudson br br rathbone spices up his already classic interpretation of holmes by getting to appear in disguise three times during the story thereby revealing to the viewer that the great sleuth was a bit of a ham actor at heart br br this film which is based very loosely on elements in sir arthur's short stories 'the dancing men' and 'the empty house' followed sherlock holmes and the voice of terror 1942 and preceded sherlock holmes in washington 1943
<START> this movie was terrible not only was the plot weak but the acting was unbelievable bad and at times pathetic very unrealistic dialogs people in real life don't talk like this and there is no emotion or feeling in anything said very monotone except for the almost indistinguishable whispering that constantly occurs even the editing is bad the cuts are terrible the camera work was sloppy and shaky on close ups even sways back and forth during conversations there is nothing positive about this movie and george needs to be working on heavy machinery or anything where he doesn't have to converse with other humans because he clearly doesn't know how to how did this movie win get nominated for awards oh my god
<START> i love this movie when i saw this movie on tv when i was a kid it scared the hell out of me probably because mannequins give me the creeps too jocelyn jones molly is an excellent actress she uses her facial expressions especially her eyes at playing terrified chuck connors is great as mr i was happy to see him play such a different roll the other actors in this movie are great too tanya roberts becky and robin sherwood eileen are great actresses and i hope to see them in future films especially jocelyn jones br br so if you love scary movies but are tired of seeing the same old thing check this movie out
<START> in america the jewish jonathan safran foer elijah wood collects personal belongings of his family for recollection a few moments before dying his grandmother gives an old photograph of his grandfather with a woman called augustine in ukraine jonathan contacts the odessa heritage tours a family agency in ukraine to guide him to the location where the picture had been taken to find augustine and together with the interpreter alex eugene his grandfather and a weird dog they travel in an old car searching the missing past of jonathan's family br br everything is illuminated is a strange movie about a weird young man with the compulsive behavior of collecting souvenirs from his family to not forget them that seeks the past of his grandfather to understand how could be his life if his grandfather had not moved to usa this bizarre vegetarian character meets a dysfunctional ukrainian family that owns an amateurish travel agency specialized in helping jews to find missing relatives and together they have an almost surrealistic road trip through the country of ukraine the movie begins like a comedy with a sarcastic black humor and ends in a touching and tragic drama recommended for specific audiences my vote is seven br br title brazil uma vida an illuminated life
<START> i appreciate the effort that the filmmakers wanted to depict the story of moses and the exodus of israel and that the film helps viewers to put themselves into moses' shoes and gain understanding of the intense burden laid upon moses' shoulders as excited as i was to see this film i was greatly disappointed in the storyline i'll leave out the special effects and artistic ability in this review what is most disappointing is the historical inaccuracy of this movie and how it is so far from the historical accounts from biblical texts one of the overarching principles from the bible is that god led his people out of egypt and he promised that he would take them to a land that is flowing with milk and honey not only did he give this promise but he led his people in a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night he never left them he always was visible to the israelites the movie however depicts a god who remains silent during the entire wandering through the desert this movie changed the essence and theme of the biblical text and instead depicts god as a silent cruel void br br in addition the depiction of moses was just as wrong moses was known as a man of faith why else would he be such a father figure to israel throughout the old and new testaments even that moses is known as a man of great faith however the movie depicts him as a pragmatic angry insecure loner who despises the calling that god placed on his life ok i'll allow some creative freedom for the filmmakers in the exodus story but this is beyond creativity it is heresy
<START> takes place in the 1940s right after the second world war main character gunnar gustav quits his job to get a chance to make a difference in the bombed out postwar europe he packs a book by his favourite ludwig and embarks on a trip which will eventually prove famous statement true nothing is what it seems br br there are two main plots and several subplots to this film which takes place on a train bound for berlin writer director peter dalle also playing the role as the conductor of the train has assembled an impressive cast including swedish legends lena nyman and robert overall the acting is excellent br br offers some rather twisted slapstick comedy combined with more subtle black humor like the nun who loses her faith and starts cursing violently it's like meets peter jackson braindead bad taste in schindler's list i laughed during most of the film and when i woke up the next morning i laughed even more an intelligent film for fans of swedish comedy
<START> having dabbled in the modeling industry as a model i watch this show with a slightly different view than most might while i admit can be a fun and entertaining show as the seasons go on it seems to continue to drift from any reality br br the show seems to be almost pure publicity for its contestants seeing that none of the show's winners or fellow contestants have made much of a name for themselves out from under of the show's umbrella maybe that's because the truth is any girl with real potential to be a high fashion model shouldn't have too much difficulty submitting to agencies you can do so via email or snail mail if distance prevents you from attending an agency open call signing to an agency and starting a modeling career yes the process does not guarantee success but apparently neither does and participating in a reality show seems to offer less of a boost in the modeling business than signing to a top or decent agency which only one contestant each cycle has a guarantee of anyway br br nonetheless the show can't hurt certainly can be amusing and has a sort of magic that particularly works for teenage girls i have found though i must add may become a tad tiring and dull after watching several cycles as it has become for me and besides some unrealistic situations each more outrageous than the last the only other annoyance is the overuse of tyra tyra tyra tyra seems to genuinely want to guide these girls to success but is it necessary for each of temporary digs to be covered in tyra pictures for virtually every panel and challenge to include a story or scenario that tyra experienced and overcame i think not br br in my opinion take out a little tyra put back in a little more reality and could be a 10 star show instead of a 7
<START> no blood no sex though it oozes passion no special effects but just one of those pearls that comes across your movie screen when you're not really looking and grabs your attention br br great acting great sets great music beautiful storyline if only there were a lot more movies made like this one br br the sets move us through time and make us feel like we were there br br the acting appears like real life and elevates us to the level of awareness of nanny to whom no one is a lost cause least of all the inhabitants of her own halfway house br br best of all it's a true story of misfits learning to fit in i was somewhat jealous of the good times that everyone appeared to be having in the movie could we all spend some time in nanny's house
<START> if you want to see someone accidentally eat another man's testicle or look at a row of pathetically fake hard ons at a wedding or listen to a man talk about how good it felt to have sex with a girl while she was throwing up then this is the movie for you alternating in neck breaking fashion between romantic and gross out comedy is certainly interesting the lovely jaime pressly plays the wife of horatio tell me another one who is found in many silhouetted situations with other women but there is surprisingly no nudity jake busey is thoroughly revolting as a hound dog who you wouldn't want as your friend shannon elizabeth and jerry o'connell are both good and make a convincing couple but the movie is far too busy trying to disgust to be any good
<START> as i write this norman wisdom is a very confused old man who spends most of his waking hours cackling and old catch phrases at his increasingly suicidal nurse br br indeed by the time you read this he will probably have joined the hereafter and the obituaries will record a near 80 year career of hysterical mirth making from the lovable with the crooked chequered cap what most of these obituaries won't recall is how norman wisdom had already committed a form of suicide back in the late 1960s with this staggeringly poor yet strangely compelling to his movie career br br the signs are ominous from the off Â tony presents go the titles you scratch your head Â where have i seen that name before well on the titles of a lot of the cheapest crappiest british films of the 1970s so just take your pick br br then it says Â a menahem golan production oh dear br br from what i could make out what follows is a combination of confessions from a holiday camp and last tango in paris sponsored by the tourist board br br norman wisdom is very versatile at being norman wisdom or a variation of such here even in trash like this he's never off form and somehow keeps you watching through parted fingers as he paws and dribbles all over a clearly insane sally geeson tony and menahem golan were between them responsible for some true cinematic horrors but the bedroom scene in filmic atrocity reborn sally plays the role of a sex toy very well by the way br br i wonder if any of the crazy young cats who populate this movie's party scenes maybe thought to themselves in a quiet moment norman sex hippies get me outta this mess i guess it was a payday for them br br a do feel sorry for the pretty things though they probably thought yeah this'll do for us what blow up did for the br br and so old norman's leading man career ended freezing his little balls off in br br i went there once it was a depressing place
<START> there is a bunch of movies that we say must be seen twice in most cases this is mainly a recommendation you understand the movie anyway after the first viewing and watching it for the second time helps you catch the plot twists you just did not notice however for mulholland dr this is different the sequence that worked for me was see it first time spend a day in internet trying to figure out what this was all about and then see it second time otherwise most likely you will not be able to enjoy this film to the full extent then you start to understand that this piece is ingenious camera work is stunning and the aftertaste follows you for weeks br br 9 10
<START> its a very good comedy movie liked it i don't know why i love this movie i just love it storyline it is a story of two boys amar aamir khan and prem salman khan who want to get rich quickly by taking all the short cuts in the book amar is the son of an honest barber murli verma in mumbai while prem is the son of bhopali a hardworking tailor in both amar and prem sell their father's shop and house respectively and zero in on a hill station where a beautiful wealthy heiress raveena raveena tandon has come from london accompanied by her friend cum secretary karishma karishma kapoor with the intention of getting married to a virtuous indian the lucky man to wed raveena will inherit her father ram gopal paresh rawal entire wealth amar and prem see their get rich quick chance and woo raveena each trying to out do the other enter paresh rawal in a double role whose sole ambition in life has been to grab his twin brother ram gopal millions so plants and robert in house to help him in fulfill his ambition as the story progresses it turns out to be a mad chase from ram gopal wealth full of humor romance thrills and chills will raveena karishma see through amar and mischievous intentions will succeed in his motives see it all in super comedy br br aamir salman raveena karishma and paresh at there best br br good music br br good direction br br good story and screenplay br br and very good comedy
<START> i for one absolutely loved this movie br br it is not a typical asian horror where you would see a gruesome looking ghost usually a woman that is going around scaring people you barely see any ghosts for a majority of the film but the way this movie keeps you interested in the plot and characters is genius this is not the movie for you if you're into gore e g saw hostel or surprise scares where stuff pops out at you hollywood horror slasher films but this movie has an underlying creepy factor throughout the entire movie which i loved is a progressive and somewhat experimental approach to horror amongst the ridiculous remakes and unoriginal crap being released by hollywood in today's society br br please don't let the documentary style of filming turn you off why should it it is far superior to the blair witch project because for one the acting in is brilliant and it really makes you really feel like you're watching something you're not supposed to be seeing br br is definitely one of the best horror movies i have ever seen only a few films have made it into my top 5 horror and this movie holds a solid 1 spot on my list
<START> while it has been many decades since i last read mr wells war of the worlds or the time machine or any other of his works i believe that they were all set in london or at least in england this grade b c movie is set in the eastern part of the united states as was orson welles excellent radio adaptation 67 years ago however this film exhibits none of the quality of the narrative style of the mercury playhouse program thomas emoting would not be acceptable in most high school drama clubs i was actually embarrassed for him his rolling around in the grass on the hill crying my family my family was almost laughable as was his reaction to the death of his brother of the three film versions of the story that i have seen this was by far the worst with gene barry's 1950's version the best this was the first time i ever saw a machine monster dripping sticky saliva such as did the creature in the alien
