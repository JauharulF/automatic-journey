<START> when i first viewed this movie i didn't know the title of it i realized it had chevy chase in it with the same name he had in caddyshack so i had an idea this was caddyshack 2 at the end of the movie when i did find out it was caddyshack 2 i was disappointed they could have done better dan akroyd i thought was bad the whole story was bad call this movie by another title but don't call it caddyshack 2 you give that great movie a bad name jackie mason's daughter when i first saw her looked like his wife how old is this girl geez how about making this movie a little believable i thought chevy chase was good
<START> the best years of our life is often compared to it's a wonderful life they never should be their only commonality is the desire to make a serious comment about a war that took millions of lives it is hard to know what value individual life may have how many people know that 1 in 22 people lost their lives violently in the last century what a statistic we have to live with also our feelings about war have changed in 60 years we have progressively moved from thinking that war is just if the enemy is the right one to believing that no war is totally just especially the ones that have been fought recently br br i have been a life long pacifist i oppose all war not long ago i had that position tested it occurred while i was on the uss lexington which is permanently anchored in corpus texas the ship required a crew that is 3 or the community in which i live it is a powerful experience moving around on her decks she had seen a great deal of action someone granted me the right to be a pacifist and it was not cheaply bought br br i cannot watch the best years of our life without thinking about things like the lexington br br each of the three veterans paid their dues and they paid mine as well br br no one of them got off any easier than any other the navy air force and army paid equally although in different ways each had problems directly related to the war and each had to work terribly hard to overcome those difficulties it took more courage to face their civilian surroundings than it did to deal with war because each had to do it on his own each could understand and sympathize with the problem of the others ultimately no one could help br br the moving part of the film this could be the beginning part of the spoiler is what follows when one of the male leads found someone who knew enough to give advice the obvious case is when derry told herald to marry the girl don't hesitate do it tomorrow it is hard for harold to believe that anyone could love him when he had been a football hero and athletic star before the war but to his credit harold listens br br the other is when al tells derry to stay away from his daughter the meaning was clear mend your relationship with your wife Â standard fair for 30's 40's films derry did not debate the point he felt he was not fit for al's daughter so he agreed the truth of the film comes out when we consider the daughter feels the same way about derry real emotions from real people i think our era has deep problems with feelings and sentiment and honor i sometimes think we believe these values do not exist that's perhaps why people looking at this film have problems br br al is not free of advice he does not totally want any time his boss talks to him al gets tied in knots and rightly so there are some things that cannot be judged by the standards of occupation they must be judged by huge general and only someone tested by the severities of life would understand what those are br br all of this leads up to a scene near the end where all the planes that fought so valiantly are stripped stacked stored discarded and soon to be recycled their function worth and pride as translucent as derry himself he can overcome that which he does making him fit in his mind for the woman he loves br br i gave the best years of our lives a 10 and there are few films i feel that way about this is not a film for popcorn it deserves our attention we are very privileged to eves drop on something so private as the lives of these wonderful people we ought to be careful that we don't abuse that privilege
<START> my wife invited my son and i to watch this on cable tv on a lazy saturday evening thinking that it might show an unusual role for juliette lewis on this promise at least the movie delivers her character is ineffectual adhering to nearly every slasher type horror movie cliche as does the movie a cataloguing of its studied adherence to them would be an exercise in recall of something i hope to quickly forget so i won't make one basically this is a whodunnit heavy on the red herrings everybody appears guilty rather than just the two one suspects from the beginning the rule out the logical and obvious and what's left is it rule of bad horror movies works well on this one the only surprise to have any impact on me was its final of the indeterminate ending cliche will jane keep her appointment with her attempted rescuer who will tell her the obvious to the audience identity of the 2nd conspirator propelling her into another round of hysterical victim play mercifully i will never know
<START> another direct to video movie from disney that is essentially perfect for the kids the problem with new groove i find is that everything that made the first movie a fun great ride is replaced with a more sad and sombre film in this movie learns a great deal of lessons at many others' expenses it takes away much time that could be spent at creating a more enjoyable film br br new groove deals with two stories returns for payback and one ms hopes to defeat camp counseling championship this all leads up to confronting his father and his disapproval over his son's direction in life br br from lord of the rings to michael jackson's thriller new groove recycles every bit of time that it allows to entertain its viewers if you loved the original or are looking forward to the upcoming tv series about i recommend to his loyal fans
<START> i was just looking up who will love my children to buy when i came across this web site and an entry made by a fellow briton i am a great fan of this movie and would and have recommended it to all what i found comforting is to find someone else who also finds comfort in the good will of others i also have a son with amongst other things and it is also a fear of mine to think if anything ever happened to me and my husband that someone would not only want to take on just my beautiful 'normal' daughter but my special and gifted son also missing home and being able to relate to people raised with the same values as myself has more meaning than you know living here in the us i have yet to meet anyone who has seen this movie so to all of you reading this if you have not seen it make an effort to do so it is a very moving experience especially for anyone who is a parent or even if you just have a sympathetic bone in your body you will cry and beg after that you will count your blessings and to anyone who has ever been through an experience like or close to this one my heart goes out to you it makes me realize no matter how hard or stressful thing get just remind yourself that there is always someone worse off than you an amazing movie and what makes it more powerful is the fact that it is based on a true story do not be put off by how sad it is at the same time this movie is heart warming and makes you feel encouraged about the strength and goodness of mankind
<START> an odd beam of light penetrates the bedroom of dr craig burton arnold vosloo and his wife sherry jillian as they are making love about two hours are unaccounted for as they embrace seemingly unharmed under hypnosis during a session with psychiatrist dr susan lamarche lindsay crouse craig discovers that his wife was impregnated by aliens sherry resists this notion as absurd and is quite happy to relay news to her husband that she is indeed pregnant ecstatic after their trying for ages to get pregnant sherry is frightened at craig's persistence of the fetus not being his this stems from a check on his low sperm count with odds especially high that he could in no way have impregnated his wife awkward troubling experiences with the fetus inside her leads sherry to some scary discoveries her doctor david wilford brimley finds that the ultra sound gives some unusual results of the developing infant's appearance but it's craig who notices that it resembles an alien sparks ignite cutting out the electrical equipment even shutting off through hypnosis sherry reveals the experience of her abduction but lamarche believes her problem is psychological not physiological with no one believing his wife's alien impregnation theory craig turns to dr bert brad dourif whose work is in the studies of alien life and abduction but bert is reluctant to help craig who will go to the ends of the earth to save his wife's life from possible harm tragic results occur as lamarche and others try to keep craig from his goals of cutting the thing out believing he is mad craig will still pursue his task trying to drag bert down this path with him br br grim absorbing horror tale about one man's struggle to save his wife from the harm of beings no one else believes exist thankfully dourif's character isn't some quack nutjob but an intelligent doctor who wishes to learn more but his pursuit of the truth of aliens isn't hostile he does hope to learn from sherry but isn't incredibly demanding in this goal the story is told realistically it's easy to understand why others might deem craig off his rocker vosloo doesn't take the character too far but expresses the distress of his current situation how can he save his wife from this hostiles and prove to others that he's not nuts deserves credit for the demands of the difficult abduction scenes where her unfortunate character is naked on this table being and molested by these things crouse is fine in her limited but important role as the voice of reason in a situation where her clients seem out of control psychologically the monster effects are icky and effective i think the film works quite well and director yuzna deserves credit for restraining himself for this film at least the final twenty minutes as craig tries to perform his removal surgery with a scared bert watching the crazy situation escalate is nail biting br br you know fans of fire in the sky might dig this flick
<START> the impossibly sexy rosie plays charlotte beale a new nurse at one of those movie type asylums where the doctor in charge has his own unorthodox ways of treating the inmates reluctantly bringing her on board is the officious dr masters anne macadams a k a annabelle the inmates don't take too kindly to charlotte either br br part mystery part horror this initial effort from b movie director s f has an oppressive feel to it these colorful psychos including a nymphomaniac with no self esteem a gentle giant who's already had a lobotomy and a supposed judge who speaks in jargon dominate the screen with their unnerving presence br br it's a picture that works fairly well establishing the gritty grim atmosphere right from the get go some brief bursts of graphic violence also help to give it that good old fashioned exploitative quality br br it builds in intensity as the heroine struggles to maintain her own sanity offering one surreal encounter after another particularly effective is the poetry quoting dotty old mrs br br for cheap 1970's era cheese it's pretty effective with a particularly nasty climax i had a pretty good time watching it br br 7 10
<START> fata morgana is by far one of the weirdest and most perplexing art films i have ever seen i hesitate to call it a documentary because while is does have elements of documentation of it's images the images themselves are so unusual so hallucinogenic so unclear that i wonder whether it was really worth telling this story just so that these images can exist the film basically is the tale of the earth and the creation of the earth shot from the perspective of an outsider be it alien or something otherwise indescribable all taking place in the sahara desert the title of the picture relates to the illusion or reflection of images both real and that people in the desert often witness these are also known as mirages br br the film opens with a plane landing followed by the plane landing again and then again and again and again and again and again and again with each plane landing shot the actual architecture of both the location it is landing at and the plane itself begin to slowly dissolve into one another and grow less and less real and more and more reflective imagery the imagery in this film only grows more intense and more unusual as the picture continues the narration of the film tells of the creation of the universe as alarming sexual images of sand and landscape move past the camera the shots go further and further into the desert and herzog films whatever he sees and finds the strangest reflections of the world are on display in the distance while herzog meets some of the most pure and photogenic collections of outsiders that you are ever likely to see when the leonard cohen soundtrack kicks in you can be sure that you are in the world of a mad man who is in love with the universe br br i cannot say too much more about this film without ruining anything but i will say that it is a sobering experience and there's really nothing like it i love seeing films that are just in classes of their own this film certainly is a good example of how herzog loves to intermingle narrative storytelling and documentary film making into an interchangeable form fata morgana unfortunately does overstay it's welcome just a bit but by the time it nears it's end the images will most likely be burned into your mind forever definitely a must see for those who are obsessed with the nature and the origin of the universe
<START> this movie has everything typical horror movies lack although some things are far fetched we are dealing with quality snow man engineers the only preview i can reveal is that i cant wait for dare i say oscar winner this is a perfect date movie i advise all men for a nice romantic surprise see this movie with that special person
<START> a more detailed review can be obtained anywhere else in the web this one is a good portrayal although i do not agree with it entirely is a commercial guy and hence views from his angle only br br ram gopal varma rgv seems like a political party has created a marvel in rangeela so this one seems like a pale reflection of that one in some parts i'm not even going to compare urmila and both are good the former has better acting talent although the latter is catching up nicely br br anyways i like character she is true to her art not touched by any unnecessary emotion and definitely not too practical she is a dance scientist actually she is so sure of her theories that even comparing her to a scientist would offend her hey donald trump maybe you gotta ditch melania here is and you've already built a taj mahal ain't this easy abhishek on the other hand is a practical fellow who wants money power fame etc hence these two albeit were struggling to get a break into the film industry cannot get along given their different styles and approach to life this is very typical but what i like about the movie is that it says what an abhimaan would say in its total runtime in one scene what's new this movie takes a different angle to the film industry and how different people get into it there is always something different about rgv's movies this one is different too it is way too slow for his standards in parts it drags one almost to sleep br br noticeable it is tough to notice anything other than in the first half of the movie i think this skin show was necessary for the dance sequences involved also looks like is a pro in yoga she is way too flexible almost like a devi aby baby is improving as an actor with every movie i am sure his blood is paying off rich dividends the title song was really good the music overall was above average
<START> an stunning look at the ocean and the life in it br br the good br br the camera work was absolutely phenomenal every shot is done beautifully br br it was interesting seeing all the different animals that i could have never even imagined br br david attenborough has the perfect narrator's voice no one could have done any better br br the bad br br there were one or two different times where there was a reference to the earth being 1 million years old i hold a different belief br br overall a tv series anyone can enjoy i highly recommend buying it 10 10 stars
<START> oh boy where do i begin on this piece of slime this is one of the few real high budget films on my list that i've actually seen fit to give a 1 rating and that's not for the production values which are pretty high this movie has absolutely no respect for the account in the bible and treats the whole story as laughable fantasy i could not recommend it to anyone except to see how low as a society we have become br br for the first thing noah was absolutely not friends with lot anyone who actually read genesis could tell you that was who they were thinking of the writers were just trying to pad out the story with the whole subplot and it seems out of place because it is noah is treated as a prudish goofball you were kissing you were kissing but at least it's a step up from voight's hilarious overacting in anaconda br br however these offenses pale in comparison to the heretical treatment of god in this movie god is portrayed as a petty being who changes his mind at the slightest whim i'm one eternal perfect but i can be wrong what where are they getting this from this kind of god no one should ever pay any attention to much less worship praise or love what the director's saying in this i do not claim to know i just know that a responsible treatment of noah's ark should not take such an easy way out shame on these people
<START> this movie was poorly conceived poorly written and poorly acted all of the characters were two dimensional it was a real amateur attempt the movie was fundamentalist christian propaganda the christian characters are holier than thou and they are without a shred of compassion for the skeptic or the undecided characters the movie was a real gotcha for both the skeptic character and myself as a viewer putting us in a very uncomfortable situation i complained to the theater management and was given a free pass to another movie i remember another movie on a similar subject the rapture starring mimi rogers that was much better and professionally done i think i'll watch the rapture again if you attend unidentified and don't like it don't say i haven't warned you
<START> this is one of the best czech movies i have ever seen the director did excellent work there is great camera and the actors are really great i like war movies so i really liked this one i would recommend it to anyone who wants to know something about czech pilots during 2nd world war and their life after the war in communism
<START> paul bettany did a great role as the tortured father whose favorite little girl dies tragically of disease for that he deserves all the credit however the movie was mostly about exactly that keeping the adventures of darwin as he gathered data for his theories as incomplete stories told to children and skipping completely the disputes regarding his ideas br br two things bothered me terribly the soundtrack with its whiny sound practically shoving sadness down the throat of the viewer and the movie trailer showing some beautiful sceneries the theological musings of him and his wife and the enthusiasm of his best friends as they prepare for a battle against blind faith thus the movie completely br br to put it bluntly if one were to remove the scenes of the movie trailer from the movie the result would be a non descript family drama about a little child dying and the hardships of her parents as a result clearly not what i expected from a movie about darwin albeit the movie was beautifully interpreted
