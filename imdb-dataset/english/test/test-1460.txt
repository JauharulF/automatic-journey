<START> this movie must be exported to the rest of the world an absolute masterpiece with a both bizarre and grim film about four different stories from four different locations in sweden the one with the newly renovated hotel with the improper wooden figure of an old finance minister is absolutely the best of the four odd story about love or career i would love to see all four as a film on their own they can be so much more extended br br also the unique pause in the middle is something i've never seen before br br can't wait for the series if they're doing one or the extended dvd apparently they had cut out a lot to fit it in to just 3 5 hours
<START> i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had it's share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out 12 years ago this movie contained an all star cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i haven't seen before this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it it is a movie that you can sit down with your family and watch though we would have to cover the kids eyes a few times due to the discretionary love scenes overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 1 10 scale lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a must have
<START> beautiful emotional and subtle i watch this movie at an art center with a smaller screen in a film room with 95 of senior citizens i wish bigger cinema like around here would show it great cinematography by wong and christopher doyle since i understand cantonese it's a lot easier for me to understand the movie as simple as the story goes many english speaking viewers didn't get the whole story three old ladies next to me keep yapping and have no clues about the movie br br spoiler they were surprise when i mention that mr chow did sleep with mrs chen and they have a son she went to singapore trying to tell him but didn't br br spoiler br br the mandarin translation of the movie title actually means flowery like moment or memory the phrase usually used to describe beautiful and wonderful memory that was and short the whole movie pretty much fit the title not to mention the flowery cheung sam br br my favorite scene was definately the street corner in the alley it looks so beautiful the sun shining on the old and faded wall at night in the dark in the rain truely a poetic moment i felt a strong sense of intimacy of their relationship seeing them standing against the wall and talk quietly i felt a terrible heartache when mr chow was rehearsing his departing moment and mrs chen cried on his shoulder bravo wong kar wai br br as much as i like this one chungking express still top my favorite however i'll give this one a 10 as well as a point of reference cthd only got 7 br br if you love art you will love this movie don't miss it
<START> wow stella shorts are great lots of patrons from the state and stella the tv show i never knew that stella could have gotten any better then they were on the tv show stella or even comedy central presents stella i also never knew short comedies could be any good my favorite ones were pizza racking leaves the woods and david arranges to a meeting with his long lost cousin greg i think over all that david was the funniest one its funny when he doesn't make sense i like the music in the shorts thats something i pay attention to a lot they always had good taste in music i wish they still made shorts either that or bring back there sitcom i hope they continue making good and funny comedy
<START> i expected it to be good after i'd seen some other superb moments and read much about it but this movie is brilliant clever very bright emotionally and perfect in all moments every movement is there for a reason everything fits so closely and true and honest this is the movie about the beauty and innocence about it's simplicity
<START> the trouble with this film like so many other films that fail is the script br br the script is so unfocused it flounders around all over the place what is the story here ok it's a biopic but i think everyone will agree there is no way that an entire life can be condensed into 100 or so minutes some selection and editing is required but this script just didn't select or edit enough it didn't render hoffman's life down to one or two definable pivotal moments or themes that the audience could identify with and through them 'get' the bigger picture of the whole man br br the movie wanders from being a straight plodding genius' biopic to semi docu using new shots faked up to match archive footage to sub true life sob stories movie of the week the whole i'm bringing up a son who doesn't know i'm his dad shtick to political conspiracy theory movie etc etc it just never makes its mind up what it wants to be and the half hearted citizen kane like narrative structure reporter interviewing people from hoffman's past is soon abandoned which leaves the film even more unstructured and flabby than it starts out br br the movie is full of moments and incidents that contribute nothing to the story and could well have been cut to leave room to expand something more important the whole scene in the psychiatrist's office after vincent d'onofrio pounds the window screaming i'm abbie hoffman i'm abbie hoffman i'm abbie hoffman i'm acting i'm acting i'm acting could have easily been cut all that happens is the psychiatrist says you have bipolar disorder here's some lithium and the two women in his life say we could see you weekends more often and bang that's it no more mental health problems it is such a laughably pointless tokenistic scene it could easily and should have been dumped before it was shot the scene where they all get high and watch newsreel footage from viet nam and hoffman phones god pointless tells us nothing about anything yet when it comes to a important moment like the drugs bust the film making is so hurried the situation just comes out of and doesn't make any sense to the audience suddenly he's dealing in heroin where did this come from why what is going on here br br i being a middle aged would guess i am sitting well within the target audience for this movie but even i got fed up with the portrayal of 'the man' 'the 'the etc as brutal be suited unthinking hippie hating androids it may have been like that in 60's america i don't know i wasn't there but in film terms it was cheap clumsy polemic br br having said all that vincent d'onofrio was convincingly charismatic as the younger hoffman and i could watch janeane garofalo in anything even reading a bus timetable though she just wasn't right for this part
<START> there's nothing left undone about this perry and croft masterpiece as good as any of the best episodes thankfully it was still filmed in time before the late james beck sadly passed away to be included in it to show his talent br br it shows right from the start how the platoon is formed from the state of national emergency showing the boys as inept under captain arthur lowe and sergeant wilson john le mesurier as they usually are through the series br br along the way does his usual longing to show authority but the chaps can't help but let him down at every turn during wargames and suspecting an invasion they have a chance in the film though to redeem themselves when they actually capture the nazi airmen who take the church congregation hostage br br that was a nice finale especially as had been able to prove himself to the general being given one last chance to shape up a great film plenty of good lines and laughs it's another one for the dvd cupboard i'm glad the bbc is repeating it and on this day 2 8 08 they deservedly had 'dad's army night' not to be missed
<START> ok i don't kid myself that this is the typical gay love life but since when are straight romances in real life as they are on the screen this movie is well balanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sex obsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients' houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander and having seen him in priscilla queen of the desert only the day before he is probably one of the most secure in their masculinity actors around anyway the plot flowed smoothly and the male bonding scenes were a hoot thumbs up 8 10
<START> this film has to be one of the most boring films ever made the only thing i liked is using argento esquire lighting in most of the scenes the music is awful and the pace is so slow that you can watch it at the speed and even then it would be slow the story doesn't exist it doesn't even have any shocking scenes br br it is classified on this site at least as a horror but it's not it's a sort of an art film exploring the dark side of the human nature if you are into that kind of thing and can stand the slow pace then watch it but i'd rather recommend you something japanese e g ichi the killer i think that the only reason this film was never in theaters is a fear of audience committing collective suicide caused by the huge amount of boredom generated by this movie these 80 minutes of it's length would've been better spent watching the paint dry br br i gave it 1 10 simply because there is no 0 in the pull down menu
<START> cooley high is such a great film that even with the period's sound track urban landscape wardrobe and slang it still doesn't feel dated the sound track by the way is a timeless classic in itself br br instead it absorbs you right into it that is a staple of a good movie from start to finish it doesn't miss a beat and i never grow tired of watching it br br it's ending is unique in the respect that it's one of the saddest and at the same time uplifting of all movie endings there may have been a few since comes to mind but cooley was the first and much more emotional
<START> killer flood the day the damn broke 1 10 finally a movie whose title is spoiler proof even by the low standards of disaster movies excuse me allow me to correct myself even by the low standards of made for tv disaster movies this is truly awful where do i begin br br the dam may have once seen a photo of a dam but i doubt it most especially large ones that generate electricity have oh i don't know a power plant nearby some gates for water to run through heck even a high tension electrical wire or two br br the dam is also somewhat two count them two employees staff the entire dam all three shifts and the employees were apparently imported from a clichÃ©d ridden world war two film as they heroically and rather needlessly have long eulogized death scenes complete with photos of floating by heck one of them manages to get shot by the dam itself in a way that defies description br br the special effects consist of flowing water superimposed on photo's of the town in a method that makes a sixties godzilla film look like the matrix a three year old drawing with a blue crayon on the film stock would have yielded better results since the disaster money shots are worthless how is the rest of the film br br needless to say the script and acting follow the special effects lead this is no diamond in the rough this is the rough so is it a guilty pleasure killer flood is awful enough to generate some laughs and the film itself has that earnest incompetence that makes a good cult classic but bad disaster films need to age like a fine wine avalanche the swarm meteor it is also doubtful that michelle green hiding from the flood in a dumpster with a golden retriever will ever match the great henry fonda being pelted by that are supposed to be killer bees check back with me in
<START> peter lorre gives one of his most evil performances as the owner of the titled place the plot has a new government agent being put on the track of peter lorre's character when the g man's contact his killed by one of lorre's agents the g man is sent to prison for the killing even though everyone knows there is more to the story lorre has the man paroled into his care and brought to his island where he is mining diamonds lorre wants to know what our hero knows but he isn't talking and a battle of wills is set in motion br br this is a good solid little thriller that doesn't quite make a great deal of sense plot wise but even so the film holds your interest i had put the film on last night in order to use it as something to drift off to instead i found the tale riveting enough i was up an extra 70 minutes lorre is the reason that one falls into this his quite demeanor is unnerving he does very little but its clear from his orders and the way everyone reacts to him watch how they light his cigarettes that he is a bad dude br br worth a look if you should run across it

<START> br br in japan and elsewhere in europe new technology is enabling filmmakers to bypass the closed shop of the hollywood mainstream and avoid ed wood like visible low budget production values to produce compelling films what a shame that in the uk we can find examples such as name of many a video game where brain dead attempts are made to imitate so many films and console games beloved of teens that themselves are cheap of clichÃ©s abound like testosterone fuelled check out a bit of the synopsis br br set in futuristic london it tells the story of a team of virtual reality virus exterminators faced against the ultimate internet virus br br go back and read that quote again avoid guffawing and try to find a single original idea in it this should have seemed a tired sad concept in 1993 never mind 2003 ah but there is more the has already caused planes to crash infected the air traffic control centre etc it has been developed by a 'child genius' and manifests itself as a scantily clad athletic jiggling discount lara croft imitator who does a great line in snarling and cod martial arts moves straight out of the playground the living product of adolescent fantasy oh and she is accompanied by 'predator' like sound effects to emphasise her remarkable powers br br the whole thing has a 'futuristic' vision of stunning originality the building filtered with aftereffects to look somewhat green the budget does really show which in this day and age should not on the whole a pointless mess of cheese ham and clichÃ© that roger corman would have left on the cutting room floor in his most shameless desperate moments shame that such an alleged labour of love delivered nine minutes of wasted celluloid br br
<START> le 2004 is a beautifully made film that takes small carefully positioned steps towards its ending that need to be savoured in order to be enjoyed from the contrasting landscapes to the tightly enclosed world that the hero inhabits we are taken by the director and controlled from the very moment we enter the hotel we like the hero will never escape from the suffocating intensity and paradoxical monotony of his criminally driven mafia world that the film resists mafia stereotypes whilst revelling in them makes it all the more successful the concrete grave the inevitable brutal executions and overwhelming are laid bare and exposed for what they are just brutality and business and no more life is about being part of the corporate machine that is organised crime and not about love or living for self family or others our hero is indeed a hero in that he gives up his life for the sake of the touch of the beautiful barmaid the resolution of the misery suffered by his only neighbours in the hotel and in order to escape his decorative prison the consequences of love are indeed beautiful and brutal at the same time see it
