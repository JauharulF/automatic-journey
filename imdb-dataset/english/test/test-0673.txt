<START> i just realized why the colors and sets in were so flashy and gaudy and just painful to look at the story is about a high class prostitute known as an oiran in japanese their kimono were always flashier and gaudier than other kimono so that the oiran would stand out but the director had to make sure that the director stood out even more than the main character or even the story br br what anna did in the movie just gave me the creeps you couldn't call it acting it was nothing more than catering to her flipped out high school girl fan base hey anna good luck on that one as you get older yeah right an oiran as a crude and vulgar prone to violence biker chick didn't we already see you portray this character in a more appropriate movie br br the story was painfully boring and predictable what is the story of an obnoxious little bitch ever remains true to her self which is just that an obnoxious bitch she finds that inexplicably men are attracted to her and that she has an unexplained ability to manipulate men and becomes a successful high class prostitute even though she talks and behaves like she's a member of a female biker gang this so called seductive ability of hers is talked about but we never see it in action probably due to the ineptitude of the main pretend phony biker chick i mean actress br br the main character of the movie makes a wealthy and powerful man angry at her because she keeps him waiting while she services a much more lowly customer not very oiran like is it how could such a woman ever become an oiran oh because the previous oiran got herself killed and the house needed a whore that could demand a high price who would pay a high price for a slut so cheap rumors get around how could there be no repercussions for what she did to the powerful guy because the screenwriters are dolts they just made up a bunch of crap br br then an even more wealthy and powerful guy falls for her why and she throws him over for a penniless guy who is generally cold and distant toward her but respects who she really is which doesn't make sense how can anyone respect someone so worthless br br speaking of crap it's like the director down and took a huge psychedelic colored dump on the aesthetics culture and society of the edo period what of such things as mono no aware subtlety elegance a hierarchical society all shat upon by a director who comes off as a senseless parvenu the amazing thing is that so many other japanese in watching this movie down around the director and took steaming spoonfuls of this blazing colored stinking crap and exclaimed how tasty it was br br argentinean tango music with violin and as backdrop for the edo period when japan was totally isolated from the international world except for the 3 7 acres of why not just have anna the bad ass biker oiran answer her cell phone and the rich and powerful character drive off in a hissy fit in his red ferrari the music we had to listen to was jarring and anachronistic the same as the art design br br near the ending i liked that there were only two or three tiny flowers on the shrine cherry tree but earlier the second she said she would leave the quarters when it bloomed we all knew exactly what would happen how boring to telegraph the ending so clearly but what's the point of the old tree blooming that rich and powerful guy already made the pleasure quarters bloom in cherry blossoms like the mountains of in spring that didn't impress her at all no of course not i already know that about whores the guys that treat them nicely get kicked in the balls maybe it bugs the whores to have people them when they themselves know the truth of who they are just cheap and worthless br br considering the director's obsession with goldfish the second to last scene should have been of a goldfish bowl on a verandah accidentally knocked over two fish tumble into a stream which carries them off to escape beyond the walls of the pleasure quarters belying how goldfish are stuck in their bowl and can't survive outside just like the denizen's relationship with the pleasure quarters otherwise the talk of the fate of goldfish has no meaning br br in the final scene the cherry trees were full in bloom but the brevity of the blooms is one thing special about cherry blossoms i couldn't help thinking that soon enough dusk would wipe away all the soft pink color and warmth from the scene the sky would go quickly from hints of shadow into an ever deepening gloom and night would fall it would become cold very cold and dark that really wasn't a happy ending was it romantic love in the edo period could survive in the face of terrible poverty and being ostracized for about as long as those cherry trees bloomed maybe a few days unless it sooner but the romantic love we see here it's existence in this period is incomprehensible br br anna walking in the shoes of an oiran she couldn't do it literally check out the scene of her promenade where she seems to have the correct footwear on but she has to hold on to some guy's shoulder to keep from tumbling on her ass br br i was going to give this movie two stars for the art direction but then i realized what that was all about sick dominance on the part of the director those colors and sets are just the way the director has of screaming i'm the most important one here me it's all about me
<START> i cannot believe i enjoyed this as much as i did the anthology stories were better than par but the linking story and its surprise ending hooked me alot of familiar faces will keep you asking yourself where i have i seen them before forget the running time listed on new line's tape this ain't no 103 minutes according to my vcr timer and imdb space maggot douses the campfire in his own special way and hikes this an 8
<START> from all the bad comments about this movie and add them up i feel the same way it may look like the australians are weaklings instead they were brave soldiers in this film it was very terrible and too graphic i didn't see enough heroism just more cowardice which is ashame because its nothing from what i read we don't need the extremity of violence like that we can use our vivid imagination of what they went through it's like saving private ryan where the nazi is pushing his knife slowly in the soldier for example mel gibson is a over extreme director for his movies not because of the violence but for the level of historical inaccuracy letters of iwo jima was one of the war films that was close enough to history although i could be wrong except flags of our fathers and bridge of the river kwai you're better off reading it its an insult to the victims and the fallen if you don't tell it right and the movie drag on for too long there was nothing interesting about the dialogue and not enough retribution from the aussies to kill japanese soldiers just read history on the internet mags and in books movies always kill the sense of realization what they did to pows in singapore and the philippines was just dreadful to civilians it just makes me feel proud to see goodies beat the baddies but movies like this ruin it
<START> lackawanna blues is a very moving film depicting an era filled with varying emotions and characters as seen through the eyes of a young boy the film clearly supports it takes a village to raise a child and reminds of an important time in black history and culture i gained an incredible amount of respect for macy gray as an actress her character was a little crazy yet lovable clearly we all have known someone like macy's character s is absolutely fantastic as nanny i never realized that was such a great actress law order never showcased the depth of acting abilities like lackawanna blues i was pleasantly surprised and amazed the music and the characters reminded me of my own childhood it was a sweet nostalgic walk down memory lane i truly enjoyed the film and eagerly await the dvd release to add to my collection
<START> the premise of bottom crossed with fawlty towers sounds great however have managed to create a film that raises barely a titter ten years ago mayall's mad stare and idiocy were funny now they are just annoying br br the film had promise though the most horrendous hotel in britain is not a new idea but failed to deliver the saving graces were competent performances from simon spaced big train pegg and mathieu and the film is only 90 minutes long sorry guys but you really have hit the bottom
<START> clearly patterned after the first gangster movies that warner produced the same year little caesar 1931 and the public enemy 1931 this gangster movie is one of the better efforts i've seen although not quite in the same league as the previous mentioned classics it has a powerful performance by young sylvia sidney she's magnificent and delivers her lines more natural than perhaps anyone did at the time gary cooper is better than usual at this stage in his career and shows signs of what would follow the next few years when he rose to the top the movie has some fascinating villains in paul lukas never seen him this detestable and guy kibbee what a shock to see him act the hoodlum the direction of mamoulian is very inventive probably the first voice over to show a persons thoughts appear in this movie if you get the chance to see this little gangster flick don't let the chance go by
<START> i won't waste your time by describing the plot for this the other reviewer already did this quite well i will however give you my opinion of this movie this movie is basically anti japanese the japanese are portrayed as evil b tards who have respect for nothing as well as having very poor martial arts skills groups of japanese men get there asses kicked by single women on more than one occasion the fact that the japanese fighters lose almost every if not every fight in the movie kind of takes away the suspense the plot is actually quite solid and perfect for a kung fu movie though the problem lies in the fact that there's not much fighting when there are fights some of the fighting is quite good but other scenes are choreographed badly one scene angela mao takes on six japanese in a church and kicks all their asses the problem is they show her fighting them one by one when they're all supposed to be attacking at the same time i gather this movie was cheap considering how cheap some of the sets are they use the same village set for when they are in korea and when they are in china without changing it at all some scenes are filmed at real locations though and they look good overall the only real problem with the movie is it's slow moving and uninteresting plot since there are few fight scenes we have to rely on the plot for entertainment and well i wasn't entertained br br one and a half stars out of four
<START> i enjoyed this film immensely due to pungent scenes humorous as well as ironic some even tragical believable performances witty dialogue and a heartfelt rendering of what itÂ´s like or rather c a n be like to be hetero and or homosexual on the lookout for fulfilment of your desires iÂ´m aware of the paradox here homo a n d this is something the film tackles on end but never uses for caricature if youÂ´re as open minded as the people seem to have been who made that film in the end it wonÂ´t matter to you if those who lie in each others arms are of the same sex or not br br mr smith from the matrix gives an admirable turn as a gay houses salesman with strange appetites here but thatÂ´s not the only thing to marvel at enjoy
<START> seriously i can't imagine how anyone could find a single flattering thing to say about this movie much less find it in themselves to write the glowing compliments contained in this comment section how many was on during the filming of this movie was he giving a bonus to the actor that spat his lines out with the most speed and least inflection or thought the dialogue is bad the plot atrocious even for a screwball comedy and claims that the movie is an homage to classic film comedy is about the most inane thing i've ever heard the cinematography is below the quality and innovation of that exhibited by the worst made for tv movies the acting is awful although i get the feeling that the fault for that lies squarely in the lap of the director and speaking of which did i mention the direction is so haphazard and inscrutable that it defies the definition of the word the whole thing is a terribly unfunny even in the much beleaguered world of so bad it's funny clunkers soul sucking waste of two hours of your life that you'll never get back be afraid be very afraid
<START> this film is a fun little private eye detective story like they aren't made any more it's all there tom conway is the suave detective called the falcon goldie locke what's in a name is his wisecracking bumbling sidekick louisa is the damsel in distress and of course there are the damsels maid the professor with the secret formula the bad guy that wants the formula and the police inspector who's after the falcon there is a murder and the falcon gets implicated the scenery is night clubs expensive hotel rooms a luxury train the suburbs and beautiful cars go watch this little gem when you see it pass by on afternoon tv
<START> i finally saw laure and i have to say that i equally enjoyed it and was dismayed by it what's great about it is the atmosphere the music the location the cinematography and the beautiful cast the story is non existent for sure but with these movies it doesn't really matter the pace in languid and the settings are exotic the film has a lot going for it unfortunately it also has a few things going against it the first thing is that the gorgeous annie belle and the handsome al cliver have no chemistry whatsoever because the two are playing a couple and are on screen for almost the entire length of the film the lack of chemistry between the two is a definite liability according to imdb al and annie were a real couple when they filmed this movie they sure kept their attraction to each other from showing on screen br br the other problem with laure is that some sex scenes are just ineffective or even ridiculous there's one sex scene that stands out as one of the silliest i've ever seen in any soft porn flick our young blonde couple are picked up by a helicopter pilot who happens to be a cross dresser the pilot flies over the city to pick up his girlfriend and they have an orgy of sorts in the helicopter in mid air and al cliver is filming all of this with his 16mm camera i kid you not ridiculous we later see that 16mm footage being edited on a while the footage rolls al and annie start making out this scene is actually good but the footage on the screen behind them was at times too much watching the footage of the cross dresser getting it on with his bimbo while piloting the helicopter almost had me rolling on the floor laughing out loud is this supposed to be erotic or believable in any way the last thing i want to see is a woman pleasuring a man in drag certainly when the man in drag makes for such an ugly woman while piloting a helicopter no less al and annie getting it on was cool as was the music during the entire scene i just wish the footage on the editing screen wasn't so silly br br speaking of drag another dull plot point in laure which really drags the movie to a crawl are all those moments with the great maria and his two wives a married threesome is an interesting idea but it hardly registers here as hot or even interesting the two women are sorta dull and we rarely see the three having sex in fact keeps his clothes on for almost the entire film even when he's with annie belle this is another minor complaint about laure there's nudity but it's not as much as other films of the same era it just needed more skin to punch it up br br except for those minor complaints and the drag queen moments laure is actually very watchable i love these kind of softcore films from the 1970s when the attention was set on mood and atmosphere not the crude stuff we see today br br p s make sure to watch emanuelle in egypt which stars annie al but also another famous screen couple laura gemser and gabriele the music in that movie is also great
<START> where do i begin its one of the most frustrating movies i've seen because it makes a lot of sense in terms of the point but it comes off as seriously stupid a movie about a ghost inhabited bed the first 2 minutes of the movie shows a black and white flashback of a weird looking fat dude going dominatrix on a from pulp fiction lookalike contest winner and strangles her with his tie this is supposed to set up how the bed factors into the story still though if you wanted an opening to keep people interested or send them away early having a strangulation is the way to do it fast forward to the present day a married couple moves into an apartment with a friendly landlord and begins unpacking their things so far everything's normal then one night while doing the on a single mattress they realize they need a bed frame this is where things get fishy why didn't they bring or buy a g d damn bed frame before they got there we learn that the door leading to the attic where the first 2 minutes took place doesn't open but then once the couple realizes they need a bed frame the door magically opens they go up to the attic and discover the old bed frame and decide to bring it downstairs and their lovemaking days are saved or so they thought the rest of the movie centers around the both of them being haunted by the the female is an artist so she starts drawing up the ghoulish images she dreams about and the male is a photographer so he starts having his models act as if they're bring tortured or tied up one of which has gray hair and appears over 50 years old yuck the female grows increasingly scared and she discovers the house she lives in was once a haven for serial killings and murders which bring about the end to the movie they find the friendly landlord murdered which makes no sense since ghosts need to take a human form to kill and decide to get the hell out of dodge while packing up the husband goes up into the attic where he is possessed by the crazy fat dude and the female bashes his skull in before the cops show up and take her to a mental ward where she kills some dude trying to hit on her br br well if you've read this far you have to be thinking one thing why the hell didn't they just throw the out the window seriously they never said anything about the actual house being haunted just the bed so why not get rid of the damn thing and move on that's why the movie is so frustrating because it actually is a good plot and the actors follow suit accordingly but there are more holes in it than sonny corleone at a toll booth the couple did try to leave town as to every other movie that has the ol oh lets give this place a chance honey scheme going so props to that still though me and my buddy who watched the movie kept saying every 5 minutes why didn't they just throw the bed out especially once they learned it was haunted would have been a good time to set it on fire or something br br all in all its a near watchable movie with plenty of porno like bed scenes and a believable plot to an extent but the solution is so simple you're scratching your head by the end of the movie wondering how stupid can the married couple be the highlight of the movie is when the husband tells the 50 year old model to spread her legs and his assistant tells him that he can't shoot her like that br br 4 out of 10 a low budget porno the man show would love
<START> i'm not sure what it is but there seems to be some curse when it comes to films about the elusive bigfoot there has yet to be a film that intelligently approaches the subject nor one that creates any real suspense both legend of boggy creek 1972 and the first film entitled sasquatch 1978 have become minor cult classics but neither were very memorable both films were targeted at family friendly audiences thus themselves from actually trying to scare anyone harry the hendersons 1987 was the first big budgeted film to use bigfoot with a terrific creature design by rick baker however they too chose to aim for younger audiences but this time as a comedy as did bigfoot in 1995 i've long awaited for someone to tackle the subject as a thriller perhaps in the vein of jaws or predator when i saw this at my local video store i thought my dream had come true boy was i wrong lance henriksen plays a billionaire who leads an expedition into the pacific northwest in hopes of finding his daughter as she was on board a small plane when it crashed in the mountains the premise is interesting and sounded promising the truth is it never builds any real suspense i never found myself at all interested in any of the characters as each of them were very two dimensional and rather bland even the always dependable henriksen seems to be phoning in his performance every time he appears on screen he looks plain bored he should be as there is no action to speak of for the first hour of the film as for the creature where do i start i figured at the very least we would get a cool looking monster running around in the woods but instead we get this bald yes i said bald man with pitch black skin and patches of fur here and there picture a cross between swamp thing and from land of the lost and you'll get the idea nothing like the artwork on the cover box i assure you sloppy editing and careless direction also adds to the confusion as half the time everything seemed out of sequence while the other half of the film was constantly used up with these long slow fade outs which made no sense or served any purpose they even stole the whole infra red vision p o v from the creature in predator which just looked too silly and out of place to be effective maybe all this proves is that hollywood should just forget about trying to make anymore bigfoot films as they have yet to make one that works so far each one has been as scary as an episode of in search of 3 10
<START> i am continuously amazed at the us networks what is the matter with them yet another very very promising series axed after just 15 episodes and we are left not knowing what the hell happens to everyone i really thoroughly enjoyed this show and am so annoyed that we will never find out what happens to the characters and the 'monsters' from the deep this show had everything humour suspense action what more could you want why oh why did the pull the plug on this it just doesn't make sense buffy went on for 7 series as did charmed and enjoyable as they were surface invasion and dead like me were even better just because a show does not get terribly high ratings doesn't mean it's rubbish and if they gave it a bit longer probably more people would catch on to it and they would end up with a big hit on their hands one season just does not give it enough time to catch on and the networks are far to eager to pull the plug they should learn that like fine and cheeses they take time to mature br br bring surface and invasion back p l e a s e
<START> this is the worst film i have ever seen bar none from the flimsy looking poorly lit sets to the laughable acting to the infantile plot and shoddy drawn out action sequences this film is so bad its hilarious for about ten minutes after which you will be reaching for the remote or the power socket to end this film non experience although it was obviously made with the entire production and acting collective tongue rammed in cheek please god i found jack frost 2 so dreadful as to be unwatchable for more than a quarter of an hour if you have not had enough of it after this time you must be indulging in drug abuse
