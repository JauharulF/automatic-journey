<START> how bad can you make a film a good question which house of the dead 2 succeeds in answering i could not believe it was possible to get something worse than the first house of the dead but amazingly the director has succeeded the only feeling you get from the film is that its bad just bad what with overacting bad fx and a stupid story its this kind of movie which gives a bad name to z movies in general why could they not learn the lesson from the first house of the dead movie anyway i guess you will have understood by now that you should not see this film it is but a waste of time watch bad taste or dawn of the dead if you want to see some good zombies
<START> team spirit is maybe made by the best intentions but it misses the warmth of all stars 1997 by jean van de velde most scenes are just not that funny and not that well done the actors repeat the same lines as in all stars but without much feeling
<START> i'm sorry folks but these enthusiastic reviews on this prestigious site about this movie are very strange to say the least is craziness picturesque i ask and didn't find an answer of course the movie is beautifully filmed at part it's almost a documentary but then the fact is that when it comes to the women grazia she shows every sign of a deep illness and i was wondering throughout the movie what the heck she has her behavior is absolutely worrisome and the shocked citizens of the village are very right indeed in wanting to send her off to a proper institution to see what can be done about her condition she needs treatment urgently behaviour like hers is inferno to everybody around her her husband the poor children especially and the fellow citizens let's not be falsely romantic about this i hated this condoning portrait of a mentally ill why for god's sake should the husband not want to have her cured or at least try to do this why the horror of going to milan a big city sure but lots of possibilities of capable persons to cure her irresponsibility anyway i inspired myself on this site for renting the movie on dvd and after seeing it i had to post this for others to make themselves an opinion on it frankly i understand why the movie did not get any further as an indication to the cannes selection
<START> this movie defines the word confused all the actors stay true to the script more's the pity because the acting is fine but the script is a confused pastiche of pseudo psycho analytic random ideas the pacing is mind numbingly slow and the soft focus lens cinematography gets on the nerves quickly i give it 4 out of 10
<START> high school years and decades later some look back on it with fondness others with embarrassment but few find it easy to forget it's one of the most critical phases of our lives when changes come fast and furious whether we're ready or not no longer children not yet adults irresistible forces buffet us pushing and pulling us in every direction br br fame did its best to capture this turbulent chaotic period for its cast of young characters for the most part it succeeded it meandered but did feel like a slice of life this movie holds a special place in the hearts of the class of '80 we had just bid farewell to a decade and soon to the end of three or four stimulating and sometimes difficult school years we were headed out into the cold cruel world leaving home for college then parts unknown as we approached our watershed event this newly released movie was like a two hour yearbook for us we couldn't escape the titular song on the radio that was us up there on the screen those were our friends rivals and classmates as we had faced our own dreams frustrations successes and failures br br it's especially poignant for those who attended any of new york city's other elite top tier high schools especially stuyvesant bronx hs of science or brooklyn tech like the kids here we were considered the best of the best we had no auditions but instead rigorous entrance exams perhaps even more than the performing arts kids we were expected to change the world although not necessarily become famous like them not all of us made it but the pressure cooker environment fostered extraordinary camaraderie and de corps not unlike the toe tapping hot lunch jam in the cafeteria on our own graduation day our spirits soared almost like the jubilant crescendo in the rousing finale the film leaves us fittingly on a single triumphant note at the end of i sing the body electric pointing to the blindingly bright boundless future and all the promise it held br br fame couldn't have been set anywhere else this story never would have worked in a small or suburban school los angeles has a stronger identification with movies and television but nyc is a mecca for all of the arts home not only to what was then called pa but also world renowned nyc is a cultural center unmatched by any other city in the world it's also a time capsule of the rest of the city of the time showing the seediness grit and dirt that was endemic of a new york still struggling back from the fiscal crisis that had nearly bankrupted it but most of all it showed the vitality since muted by the inroads of giuliani disney and tourism br br what i wouldn't give to be young again but with fame at least i can remember what it was like
<START> if i was british i would be embarrassed by this portrayal of incompetence a protection agent of the special branch unable to defend herself against a sick unarmed and untrained assailant the home office sends a single science adviser to investigate a possible level four biohazard and that advisor doesn't have the sense to wear even a mask and gloves totally unprotected london police officers working side by side with technicians in full biohazard suits the advisor and his bodyguard the lair of a sociopathic doctor experimenting on human subjects without any backup puh leeze one wonders whether the producers could not afford to hire any technical advisers or if for some arcane reason they consciously decided to portray the principals as hopelessly incompetent even my wife who has no background in either medicine or law enforcement was rolling her eyes in disbelief after the first episode i was discouraged now that i have seen two episodes i give up
<START> what could have been some majorly creepy stuff ends up being an incomprehensible nutty motion picture that even the filmmakers themselves probably didn't understand had they shown more of the satanic ritual or whatever it might have been creepier but as it stands now this is a waste of time and brain cells is anybody else getting sick of the whole little kid drawing creepy pictures with crayon thing could there possibly be a bigger horror clichÃ© probably not i know i know it's from some different country and it's far too refined and sophisticated for me to understand so i shouldn't expect the plot to be spoon fed to me blah blah blah whatever i still say the movie blows
<START> most of the other posts beat this movie up and deservedly so i've just got to chime in on the technical ineptness of the film makers it would have been nice if the director had at least had lunch with someone who knew what a gun was because he had no clue br br spoilers ahead you have been warned br br stupidity br br spec ops team assembled from various military units whose members have never met each other before br br maybe two people in the unit had weapons that used the same magazines parts ammo etc br br the sniper school instructor uses a sub machine gun pistol caliber as opposed to a rifle which we would assume she would be more proficient with br br one poor team member's night vision optics weigh more than the rifle does you can tell when he handles it that it is seriously top heavy br br the team leader sends out a team member to challenge the skeleton man when they first confront him challenge a 200 year old reanimated native american skeleton with a long spear and an attitude riding an undead war horse with a severe nosebleed i think not bubba br br bullets do not spark when they hit trees mr director a couple of people have already mentioned this br br the teams air support consists of a ubiquitous black helicopter only this one has a couple of sidewinder missiles underneath someone forgot to tell the helo crew that the skeleton man doesn't fly and they are over the american heartland where there won't be any enemy aircraft they should have carried some air to ground missiles instead br br the air to ground consists of a door gunner with a semi auto ak 47 or 74 needless to say he only hits dirt should have brought a belt fed light machine gun br br door gunner later finds out that a grenade launcher is pretty useless as well br br a wooden arrow from a freaking recurve bow does not down helicopters mr director br br i pretty well could not take anymore after this point about 30 minutes and gave up you seriously need a morphine drip to make it through this flick it is just that painful
<START> this movie purports to be a character study of perversion some reviewers have been gulled into assuming that because perversion is depicted the film is psychologically deep actually considering the salacious material it is surprisingly tedious and shallow with no motivational substance why is the main character the way she is you won't find out from the script for a better treatment of the same theme and a more entertaining movie try bunuel's belle de jour
<START> the kid was born retarded it pulls in a half dozen directions features dialog and action lifted from much older and better known flops and might be funny if only the writers knew what funny is br br disney stuff has gotten a lot better in the last couple of decades but don't let that fool you they should have given the kid a wide berth sang it a lullaby then ran the train into a ravine mercy killing
<START> altman is very proud of the fact that people in his movies talk over each other because he says people do that in life well people also cough burp go off on tangents etc the point is that just because people actually do something doesn't make it compelling cinema that's one issue br br the bigger issue is that this just isn't a very clever or direct or hitting or relevant satire in 1988 or 2004 garry trudeau is still living in the 1960s and thinks everyone except a small core of republican elected officials is a 60s style hippie liberal i mean the guy still trots out in his strip a character that is a complete anachronism yet trudeau still employs him as if he is representative of a large stripe of american youth br br don't get me wrong i am a conservative but i'm not saying that this is bad because it's got a liberal bent it could take a liberal tack and be funny and relevant but it's not it is mainly a vanity piece with a bunch of prominent celebrity liberals including the odious repellent ron reagan jr at times it feels unscripted and the rest of the time it has a snarky air of self importance and aren't we oh so clever ness br br someone said that this show insists it has a cult following i think its cult status is more wished for than actual i'm certain there are two or three people out there who taped all the original episodes in 1988 and still have them but if that is the standard then every show ever aired is a cult classic to some degree if tanner didn't have the names altman and trudeau attached it would be another forgotten hbo production from the 1980s instead it's presented as hard hitting incisive political commentary from guys who are at the top of their game the reality however is about as far from that as possible pat paulsen's presidential satire is more relevant than tanner ever was and he's been dead for a decade
<START> if this film were to be rated on a scale of 1 to 10 one would need to create a new rating system as this one should not even qualify the film's plot if you can call it that revolves around charlie stephen baldwin an ex special operatives agent who is being targeted by the brother of a man he killed while he was still working for the us gov't if this sounds like an interesting scenario please don't be fooled as this film will not deliver that which its action themed story suggests br br comedian chris rock once said that when one sees an actor doing a bad film that it makes one want to send the actor 50 given that the actor must be desperate for money to be doing such poor quality work after watching this film you may want to send stephen baldwin 100 br br it appears that baldwin did not put any effort into his role in the film in the film baldwin is forced to run all over the city of los angeles in order to protect his honeycomb wife from being murdered by the brother of a man he previously killed however throughout the picture it appears that baldwin can barely pull off maintaining a light jog his laid back performance succeeds in from any suspense that the film might have intended to portray br br if you are the type of person who enjoys watching very bad films and laughing at their shortcomings than this film is for you however if you are looking for a well made action thriller it would be best to look somewhere else rather than renting this film
<START> possible spoiler alert br br it's unlikely that seagal will ever again scale the heights of he did with on deadly ground mainly because no one's ever going to let him direct again but he sure tries don't he br br this one's a typically brainless and badly written little fantasy about how indian folk remedies are much more effective than western medicine seagal seems to actually believe this nonsense although he never explains why life expectancy in the americas and europe is so much higher than it was in 1492 br br kinda like he never explains how his supposed water fueled engines work in on deadly ground br br even the action in this one sucks
<START> the italian concept of sprezzatura was the grace and nonchalance in social manners that led to success in love as described in the 16th century manual the the film hitch is worth watching for the embodiment of the concept in the dynamic performance of will smith br br smith plays the character of alex hitch hitchens who is a professional dating consultant to those short on luck and confidence the best scenes are when hitch coaches the painfully shy and maladroit albert in his quest to win the heart of a new york socialite and in hitch's own attraction to sara and a surprise for her when visiting ellis island in these scenes smith is supported with good work from kevin james and eva mendes but this film is driven by the charm and winsome personality of smith br br from start to finish smith rises above the average comic script to make hitch an eminently watchable and entertaining film i do not believe there is another actor working today who is capable of delivering the charisma and the perfect timing with the comic moments like will smith in this film and his secret is in the sprezzatura
<START> i was 19 or 20 years old at the time and living in salt lake city utah and i still remember the new dome theater called the century 21 chairs that rocked and a new sound system large screen and huge open space between the screen and the packed theater we felt all the excitement of a new preview screening of a film ta da da da ta da dada dada i can still hear the opening music ringing trumpet and the crash of i loved the interplay of characters and the filmed vistas i know peter finch and luv and sally had some trouble with the lip sink but hey this was a feel good go feel better about things film what i regret is the way they cut the meaningful heart out of it showed the cut version and then called it a flop i saw the cut version and i can see it lost its view of the vision it had in the preview edition yes i wince a bit at peter's effort to make love through music but you know i didn't see it that way when i left the theater when they surveyed us as we left i regret any comment i made that may have altered the original i liked it then and still see it while i listen to the music on my lp most of my family has heard me sing much of the sound track and i can use the films monologues in our games of what movie is this i wish a director's cut on dvd was available it is available on vhs but its not quite the same i would particularly like a full serious lord of the rings style commentary about its origins struggles and triumphs picky people should leave things well enough alone bring it back
