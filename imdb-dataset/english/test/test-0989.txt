<START> it may have been thrilling for an audience in 1946 but the movie is now a bit boring i had a hard time sitting through the whole thing and it was very predictable i mean we know from the beginning of the movie that welles is the nazi war criminal and i'll give you one guess as to whether he is caught and appropriately punished in the end br br not worth watching it's sad that welles only made three movies worth seeing in his long career kane ambersons and a touch of evil
<START> the evil that men do 1984 was one of the few non cannon films charlie bronson made during the 80's unlike most of the cannon films charlie starred in this one wasn't fun or entertaining charlie basically tortures and people for over an hour and a half if you thought he was mr emotion before wait until you see this br br in this one charlie goes to an unnamed central american country and shows the populace that whoever messes with chuck or his people have to pay the piper this one is no fun it's not cheesy or campy just brutal sadistic and not in a good way br br i didn't like this one i have no love for this film no recommendations because it's not worth watching maybe if they didn't cut the hell out of it watch with br br don't bother
<START> aslan adam or as it's more commonly known amongst english speaking audiences starts with an epic battle as king solomon his army defeats a load of guys although i'm not sure who they were the film itself isn't too helpful in establishing the fact anyway after king solomon has slaughtered all these guys princess maria bishop commander antoine are forced to sign a treaty which lets king solomon rule just about everything in sight soon after princess maria seduces solomon they have sex meanwhile in the shortest wedding ceremony ever just two sentences long antoine weds princess maria is planning to rebel against solomon gain some sweet revenge in the process antoine his guards attack kill solomon even though his pregnant wife princess escapes with her protector with guards in hot pursuit after the shortest labour ever less than 5 minutes or the time it takes to run around a bush princess gives birth to a young baby boy who is hidden in some bushes away from guards unfortunately when tries to retrieve the little fella he finds that the baby has been adopted by a pride of lion's as one of their own year's later the evil antoine now rules treating his subjects with no mercy princess maria has given birth he has a son but is also still kicking around trying to put together a gang of rebels to overthrow antoine the task seems hopeless unless they can enlist the help of the legendary who is more beast than man br br this turkish greek co production was directed by as is a one of a kind type of film i found it hilariously bad but at the same time immensely entertaining the script never seems to take itself seriously it is a pretty funny film at times it moves along like a rocket is never dull or boring some of the english dubbed dialogue is just hilarious in context with what's happening on screen none of it makes any sense we get a boy raised by lion's an evil king betrayal dark family secrets birthmarks that form the shape of lion's in an element of the story that was present before the kid was raised by lion's crazy fight scenes torture scenes where the posts people are supposed to be tied to wobble ancient castle interiors that randomly contain zip wires gymnastic rings idiotic bad guys who all seem to have extensive facial hair a central character who has a jaw line resembling a house brick can be stabbed twice have his hands covered in acid this acid can eat it's way through steel but is kept in a ceramic jug fall over 20 feet onto a concrete floor yet maintain no serious injury aslan adam is a terrifically entertaining film i don't think i've seen another film quite like it that i can compare it too if your looking for something serious then forget this but if you like 'so bad they're good' type films want to have fun laugh be entertained then aslan adam should be at the very top of your list total 100 gold for bad film fans those with a taste for the different bizarre on the disappointing side only gets his steel claws 10 minutes before the end which is a shame br br director certainly keeps things moving along at a brisk pace although it's far from well made during the opening battle one moment guys are fighting on a sand dune the next their on a hill with trees in the background there is one point where uses a to pole vault but it's obviously just a long tube with a vine wrapped around it then there's the scene when a bloodthirsty pack of are supposed the chasing down but the dogs used are obviously different breeds including some of the most harmless looking dogs ever there are just so many individual scenes in aslan adam that are just hilarious stupid bizarre or all three that i could go on forever just check the ending out when is jumping flying about everywhere like he can fly there's lots of blood in aslan adam although not much actual graphic gore or violence a few stabbings someone has their hands cut off is as graphic as it gets br br technically aslan adam is pretty ropey the period costumes are bright garish featuring purples yellows reds various other bright colours the fight scenes are cheap but at least the filmmakers tried to put as much action in as they could the music seemed like it was more suited to a classical ballet rather than an action film is yet another bizarre aspect to aslan adam the acting was bad even dubbed you could tell the acting was bad br br aslan adam is pure gold from start to finish there are so many things to like laugh at enjoy in this film that i just ended up really liking it in no way whatsoever can aslan adam be considered a good film in any sense of the word but it's one hell of an entertaining one i may have have to watch this one again sometime soon just to prove to myself that i didn't dream it all the best turkish action film about a man raised by lion's you will ever see period proved popular enough to spawn a sequel ii the 1979
<START> years ago with ray of light madonna broke through to a truly amazing level of musical artistry and since then she's occasionally transcended even her own standards this concert production with its hypnotic editing amazing dancing hallucinatory lighting effects and trance inducing arrangements blows away all previous efforts madonna's apparent ambition to single handedly bring about world peace through music and dance may seem hubristic or absurd to some but hell somebody's got to do it thanks to her assemblage of the remarkable talent of everyone involved in this production confessions tour live from london places her once again among the top ten artists working anywhere in the world in any medium
<START> i went to see the italian job with mixed reviews in my head i was pleasantly surprised with an entertaining close to 2 hours i thought the cast was just great and so were the special effects with the safe and truck just dropping out of sight if you like fast paced action movies this is the one to see
<START> man i think people have forgotten how to watch a movie everyone thinks they're a critic they comment on things that the average movie goer doesn't even know or think about br br i enjoyed the film it was what i was expecting therefore was not disappointed steven gets a bad rap for putting his views into his films but that's also a reason to watch what's even more funny is the people that complain about his films say he's the worst and that we shouldn't watch his films yet watch his movies anyway all so they can comment on how bad they are who's the dummy if you don't like his work don't watch it then you won't have to subject yourself to this supposedly painful event br br stop comparing movies to other movies and watch a movie on an individual basis and you may begin to enjoy films again
<START> okay i'm a history buff and okay i'm a action film junkie so of course this film is on my top ten of all time i really love the action scenes and the unique weaponry of the period i sort of have doubts about fighting two handed sword from horse back and the sword seems more katana like than like oh well i've never fought from horse back either br br i love the attempts at philosophic proverbs too the typical desert probably couldn't read the koran so they'd take his word for it several writers have criticized connery's brogue well on vacation as a youth i met a family of south africans in our west dinosaur national monument and although they spoke between themselves yeah second generation germans can hear the difference they spoke english with a scottish brogue seems that who teaches you affects your pronunciation scottish missionary
<START> this movie was very good not great but very good it is based on a one man play by ruben santiago hudson yes he played most of the parts on paper it looks like stunt casting yes let's round up all the black folks in hollywood and put them in one movie halle berry even produced it the only name i didn't see was oprah's thank god because it probably would of ended up being like a hallmark movie instead this movie was not some sentimental mess it was moving but not phony the characters came and went with the exception of her husband pauline and the writer in question the movie revolved around the universe of nanny mrs bill crosby and how she raised the writer and took in people now being a jaded new yorker when he said she took in sick people and old and then we see them going to a mental institution to pick up a man i'm thinking looks like sister has a scam going getting folks jobs and taking the checks but no she explains to lou she just wants 25 bucks a week and did not want the money ahead of time i think that part was put in the movie just for us jaded new yorkers so we know she is not scamming the poor folks g it was written by a new yorker so he knows the deal g she almost seems angelic and looking through a little boys eyes i can see why she is married to a ne'er do well who is 17 years younger and fools around on her terrence howard was born to play these type of parts he was good but i would like to see him play something different who plays nanny is also very good but for some reason the person who stood out to me was a small role played by jeffery wright where is this mans oscar he already won a emmy and a tony he was in shaft and he stole the movie i did not even know who he was in this movie he is a chameleon never the same i never seen him play a bad part yet this was a 5 minute role and he managed to make me both laugh and cry i re winded the scene few times one time because i didn't know who he was his wife carman was excellent i have seen her in roles before mostly mousy stuff but she is so good here i actually know people who act just like her so it was very real to me macy grey who had one of the bigger parts was also very good i was very happy that they did not kill nanny off i thought she was a goner in the beginning of the movie but she was able to go home and start her old routine of taking care of people there are women like that in most of our lives people we might know or even lived with thank god for them i do not know how they do it all of the time i have a friend who lost 2 children and been through a lot of stuff but whenever i am feeling selfishly sorry for myself i call her and she always puts me in a good mood this movie is a tribute to all of those people i only wish they they told us what happened to some of the characters like the the one armed man boyfriend who is played by one of my favorite actors on hbo's the wire omar rosie character and richard the lesbian and delroy one arm man he was mesmerizing in another small role
<START> excellent film featuring anthony wong that certainly lives up to it's title erotic but increasingly violent courtesy of dreams purchased from a crazed occultist that rapidly turn into nightmares of some magnitude as the sorcerer gets inside them to manipulate poor mr wong well filmed and very fast moving this is a non stop tale of serious magic herbal power and corruption but also makes time for some fine sex scenes and some very bloody violence there is also just a little touch of humour now and again to catch you further off guard and the whole thing makes for a most exhilarating 90 minutes or so excellent performances all round
<START> don't torture a duckling is one of the coolest italian horror films i've ever seen and i've seen my share to call it a giallo is a little misleading because it's not really a typical murder mystery it's more of a straight horror movie br br complete with one of the most brutal and gory scenes ever in a movie this old fulci's twisting and turning film oozes with a creepy ambiance and an old school italian feel the setting is perfect an old italian village the music is ridiculously perfect the finale is genuine and original br br after seeing don't torture a duckling you really have to wonder how fulci's later stuff got so off beat i like all his stuff but he strayed maybe he figured he already did it because with this film he hits the bullseye br br i'd recommend this film to anyone who thinks that dario argento owns the giallo genre fulci beats him with this one br br 10 out of 10 kids
<START> i first saw this movie at a premiere party in mr hometown there between directors musicians and other norwegian celebrities i laughed and laughed i just couldn't stop if you like a comedy with black humor sharp lines and excellent acting this is one flick you have to see it's like mixing true romance with the wedding singer and add a dash of mad about you br br 10 points
<START> after seeing the movie i feel the father and the mother are both reasonable person although not perfect at all on the contrary i don't like the author and his two sisters br br is a person's journal an accurate portrait of herself no most of time people only write problems in her journal because she want to solve the problem so a journal is always a more negative side of a person in this movie the author judge his mother's life by her journal not a wise choice br br the author's elder sister is so ugly external and internal first she said her father's second marriage is not fair for her mother then she said she doesn't love her mother so she don't love both father and mother i doubt she love anybody in the world her face is so ugly just a reflection of her heart through out the movie i feel the author and his sisters are lack of love and respect to their parents however i feel the father are mother are very loving to their children even the author try to portrait them as cold deceitful person
<START> let's face it lot's of bad movies are made all the time for those people who work in film you have probably poured a lot of time and effort into many of these plot less wonders sometimes and this is my opinion it is the act of merely making the movie that is important to us to tell a story no matter how simple and unrealistic also the collaborative process is one key characteristic that is unique to film and theater to put on a production of any caliber requires the talents of a varying amount of people depending on its scale to bring its story to life the most intriguing part of american movie however is not the movie being filmed it is the movie maker himself as a character of his own life which demands our attention none of them serve as models of the filmmakers we know and have worked with but i will argue they are archetypes of small parts of us which try to be a part of this cult activity of independent film making alright a very small part of us these are the people who live under the rocks of their own lives and just so happen to be by the romance of cinema this leads me to my next argument american movie captures the raw spirit of independent film making bad stories told on nowadays digital film with sloppy effects and horrible performances because this is the best they can do with a budget of a couple thousand dollars rather than a studio budget of several million dollars a day that is the difference between low low low end productions and studio productions the independent filmmaker just wants to create a linear or even a nonlinear story to shoot as well as he can with the money he's investing in himself and the resources around him in order to see a finished product on his rundown tv rugged individualism materializes in every art form i find this film to be a brilliant document of truth for many filmmakers and no i'm not full of myself man these people are hilarious their problems seem hilarious their characteristics are hilarious best line of the movie it's alright it's okay there's something to live for jesus told me so said a million times by a funny old man hat's off to tom beach chicago rules
<START> i was drawn to friends by the soundtrack scored by a very young and yet to be famous elton john whom i had see in a club in nearby houston i had no idea of the emotions and impact the movie would make recently i was brought back to the movie by a song that heart did called seasons then i found the elton john song friends thinking it was the same song it's been 35 years of so anyway the flood of the emotions of friends came back like seeing an old photograph of your first real love i have more recall of the way the movie hit me than i do of the actual details of the production plot etc so forgive me for a rather poor review i remember taking a couple of special friends on a date to see the movie and them being as moved and teary eyed at the end as i was i'm both anxious and nervous to find a copy and see it now so many movies which seemed so important to me back then i e the graduate easy rider now just seem silly and i don't want this to fall into the same category but i will find it and if it turns out silly then at least i'll be able to turn my wife onto a great no outstanding soundtrack when we met we went through this with last tango in paris the youngsters i work with i'm 56 respect my opinions but it's hard to explain the feelings of the sixties and the movies and songs that reflect such strong feelings but seem a little aged now i just can't figure out if the the aging process is the movies or me friends is a very special sensitive and wonderful movie it will bring back a lot of special feelings i'm sure by all means rent or buy a copy indies were not near the strong genre then that they are today
<START> highly politically charged drama that while biased is extremely well handled and one of the most intelligent films ever made it contains almost no preaching but rather follows a naive tv reporter who gradually comes to realize the threat presented by nuclear power plants not because of an inherent danger but because the purveyors are more interested in the bottom line than in the safety of those affected br br many hated the film because they saw it as a political tract made by ultra liberals like jane fonda and michael douglas but if you view it simply as a drama it's gripping exciting full of well developed distinctive characters and ultimately a truly suspenseful contemporary thriller that hits close to home br br historical note for some especially those in the energy industry and inhabitants of the pa metro area it hit perhaps a little too close to home as less than a week after this film was released the devastating explosion at the three mile island nuclear facility occurred br br update 04 08 2007 in the nearly a decade since i first wrote this critique i've heard a lot of commentary on the film one thing i think really needs to be noted is that this film is not the ultra liberal anti nuclear tirade that it's often tagged as being br br while the makers and stars are or were notable hollywood establishment liberals what this film attacks is not the very idea of nuclear power but rather the idea of human greed corruption and fallibility calling into question the potential hazards of something that nature has already made dangerous br br no one who accepts reality can argue the fact that human exposure to nuclear radiation is at least quite likely to be fatal close friends of mine who worked at a nuclear plant for several years even told me of their employer's official policy on the maximum safe exposure levels that its employees could handle br br you don't have to believe that corporations are inherently evil in order to accept that individuals in pursuit of wealth and power are greedy and often corrupt and even if you refute that claim you can't dispute that all humans are prone to make mistakes when it comes to exposing innocent people to nuclear radiation we can't afford any mistakes and that more than anything is the argument this film seeks to make br br condemn it if you must but try to have a little perspective we're currently engaged in a war whose ongoing results are quite different from those originally predicted an incredibly costly war with no end in sight and whether or not you feel the war was necessary to combat global terrorism you can't dispute the reality that the length the financial cost and most importantly the loss of human life have all far exceeded the levels that the experts assured us of back in 2003 so even if no one involved is greedy or corrupt mistakes were made and mistakes of a pretty serious magnitude to boot the same kind of serious mistakes if allowed to arise in the nuclear industry could render much of the earth's surface
