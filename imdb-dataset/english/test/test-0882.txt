<START> before seeing this picture i was quite skeptic i don't like movies with an agenda nor do i appreciate being scared into thinking like the writer i was also afraid this would be like the 2 part mini series 10 4 which had a far fetched concept little relation to the real world and very poor execution at the beginning is says this film is fiction but the events portrayed and the information about uk emergency planning are based on extensive research and the general feeling is that you're not being sold on an idea but that you're being taught a lesson in civil awareness the message that is being conveyed is obvious from the start it is coming and we're not prepared the use of real places and a scenario which not only could happen there are plans for when it does all add to the disturbing effect the movie will have on even the most cynical of viewers the movie's perspective is that of the society and it stays away from heart breaking personal moments which won't convey the message so none of the romeo juliet drama we're used to
<START> i got this movie for fifty cents at a going out of business sale i want my fifty cents back bad acting poor script writing lousy direction historically inaccurate even the sound of the film is awful it's not the subject matter that offends i'm one of the many who find suspense films and true crime films very interesting the subject matter could have been treated more seriously with much more attention to detail and accuracy and the lack of respect shown for the victims and their devastated friends and family is enough to puzzle anyone also there is little to no attention paid to what could have caused someone to begin the bizarre behavior that ed gein was displaying in acting out these horrible crimes br br save your time and sanity don't watch this awful film if you bought it you have my sympathy it's not a total waste though you can throw away the disc and make use of the plastic case
<START> messiah was compulsive viewing from start to finish the story centred on apparently random murders of men in london in various gruesome ways red metcalfe ken has to find the truth which to his surprise is a little closer to home than he might think br br gripping drama and ken was brilliant hopefully we have not seen the last of red metcalfe
<START> this was one of the worst movies that i have ever watched the story was about a woman prisoner sent into space to try and save mankind but what it actually turned out to be was that the prisoner was actually put on board a space ship with a nymphomaniac lesbian commander all the story was about was having sex over and over again there was no need for all of this footage only to create a soft porn film of course we had to see the heroin of the movie having sex for about 2 minutes i don't know what all this had to do with the actual plot of the movie except i assume to get men to watch it i gave it 1 out of 10 only because there was no other rating lower don't waste your money or time it has nothing to do with science fiction but rather a movie for young adolescent boys to watch to see t a the creature was shown only more than half way through the movie and looked like the alien in the movie with weaver poor excuse for entertainment
<START> what the hell was the point of this dull movie it looked pretty interesting in the beginning but quickly fell flat on its face its supposed to be based on a true story but for crying out loud is there no more script writers left in hollywood man iv'e seen these guys in some of the best movies ever made defoe can play just about anything and when i see he's in a movie i don't have a problem renting it but i'm starting to wonder redford also a great actor is also slipping perhaps their hard up or just losing their senses the dialog was long and terribly heavy eyed especially at home with the family i wonder if the actors thought they had a hit going here perhaps uh an oscar
<START> largely forgettable tale in which mercenary employer travel into the jungle in search of missing sister br br despite its connection to the cannibal movie family this film is more of an extreme version of rene guyana crime of the century clearly aims to exploit the at that time topical jonestown massacre by depicting a rogue self righteous zealot with a penchant for bigamy and just a hint of megalomania played with ruthless intensity by ivan rassimov leading his motley crew flock into self inflicted oblivion with sister in toe attempt to stop the rot but after several failed coups they end up fleeing into the green inferno only to run afoul the locals and their notorious appetites br br one in a string of excessive gore fests that emerged in the late seventies early eighties where every new addition seemed to engage in a one upmanship contest with its predecessor by attempting to contrive the most gory and graphic display ever brought to motion pictures this inferior instalment employs all the motifs and gimmicks of the others but with much less success br br was it the so called amazonian natives who looked like they were bollywood rejects this film was made on location in sri lanka or the inept decapitation and castration scenes that seriously diminished the authenticity that was apparent in cannibal holocaust you can decide without spoiling the conclusion it appeared as though put more emphasis in his shock and awe climax than in the basic requirement for a cohesive ending where all loose ends are resolved most unsatisfying br br as with the others where the extent of the graphic depictions of violence toward humans is limited thankfully the filmmakers have spared no extreme in inflicting the worst possible cruelty on hapless animals in their pursuit of the most sadistic shocks unfortunately the only thing shocking about this film is that it rates a mention among others of the ilk that deal with the subject matter more convincingly br br if there are any redeemable features at all is an affable if somewhat one dimensional leading man and his bevy of scantily clad co stars lai and provide some visual respite from the relentless slayings
<START> yep this has got to be one of the lamest movies i've ever seen it's utterly tasteless has no style whatsoever the story is so thin that you can watch television through it and the whole film has so many holes you could drive an oil tanker through it br br sure i appreciate a good b movie as much as most male white homo sapiens do but this has got to be the worst i've seen in fact it's so b that it lacks everything that makes a b movie interesting br br the whole movie is based around such charming artefacts as the characters beating the crap out of each other various bodily functions and the complete lack of sanity of anything on screen br br it's not even funny in fact it's quite the opposite i found it even boring at times due to it's extreme predictability br br i find nothing good to say about this movie it was a waste of time watching it and i hope others don't do the same mistake if you also pay for it you should get a serious done
<START> instead of watching the recycled history of pearl harbor with nothing new to reveal except for a couple of real events involving a few individuals thrown in so the makers of the film could say they contributed to the spread of history along with nothing but cgi explosions filling in for a sappy romantic triangle one should go see dark blue world br br this film takes place during the historic time in wwii which the czech pilots left their homeland and went to fight for the raf instead of laying down their arms and giving in to the nazis it was a part of history that should at least be told once to the outside world a love triangle takes place between the main characters but one of them does not die off conveniently like in pearl harbor but through sacrifice for true friendship the movie is tragedy after tragedy with not even a bittersweet ending with our hero not enjoying glory of taking his country back the return of love by his current lover the return of love by his reunited lover or even the return of unconditional love by his life long pet he is utterly heartbroken and feels no worse off in the russian labor camp this kind of ending is something that hollywood would probably change if it was their script br br the movie does play on the sentimental sometimes but it also shows the humanity of people overall a worthwhile movie
<START> drab morality tale about a high school kid who's pretty much the now stereotypical nerd he's smart but has no friends no social skills and a lazy loser of a father who borrows money from him a pretty girl hits on him he should've known she wanted something he's supposed to be smart right she manipulates the poor desperate fool into writing her term paper on shakespeare which the teacher immediately knows she couldn't have written he loses the girl not that he ever really had her the confidence of his teacher and his college scholarship all in one fell blow br br marv is so silly and desperate for love that he decides to rob some heroin dealers who are running the stuff through the warehouse he works at then maybe the trashy little slut will be impressed and want to marry him sad really sad marv is such a pathetic dope and pretty brainless for a supposedly smart guy i mean trying to rob drug dealers has this kid got a screw loose that you stop feeling sorry for him and get the dreadful urge to kick him in the butt instead br br the girl of course tells her boyfriend about the robbery marv boasted of to her and talks him and his cronies into stealing the money from marv and company they try to do so and in the process manage to shoot several people the cops show up at the same time and the idiot marv is dragged away a total disgrace forever i know this thing was geared towards making teens behave themselves by showing them the consequences of bad behavior but all it really illustrated was the consequences of stupid behavior which is the premature end of your film career of course goodbye marv we never really knew ya and thank goodness for that
<START> now i've seen many many b grade films in my 15 years of living and i must say that this was one of the better ones i personally enjoyed the real estate and the storyline but it did suffer from amateur acting although adrienne barbeau did give a decent performance as lisa grant joseph bottoms couldn't hold his part well enough to be considered good the other performance which really fit the film was that of barry hope barney resnick it begins with an eager real estate agent taking an asian couple through a house only to find there's a dead girl in the shower of the it progresses with detective speculating and introduces the key characters with reasonable grace i think that for any person who's in for a giggle at the over the top drama the victim provide during the over the top gory scenes this truly is a gem xd who am i kidding it's not that great but worth a watch if you're insanely bored
<START> i'm seldom partial to movies about smart assed teenagers who have problems with authority but toy soldiers has grown on me with repeated viewings this is as much a movie about billy tepper growing up and becoming an adult as anything else and i give credit to sean astin and writer director daniel jr that they don't make a big deal of that but let it just unfold and sneak up on you the camaraderie of tepper's friends their grief over joey's death and their joy at their survival all are genuinely moving and i have to admit i take a certain patriotic and perhaps slightly reptilian glee when the u s army guys finally move in and righteously kick some terrorist butt ooh general kramer and the heroic robert folk score is the cherry on top i'm sure i could find a hundred reasons not to like toy soldiers but as long as we don't take it too seriously i don't see the need this is one of the most entertaining bad movies in my pantheon
<START> i am a fan of a few of the vacation films but when a movie franchise goes from the big screen to the tv screen you know it's out of steam made for tv national lampoon films do not do well on tv this movie is another reason br br i think a lot of us were excited when this was coming out but we also had to face the reality it's a tv movie randy quaid is fine as cousin eddie but is better in a supporting role than the lead dana barron sets history as the first actor to reprise her role as one of the griswold kids she is just as pretty but it doesn't help a thin script br br why was this movie even made it was probably because nbc recently picked up another few years of presenting x mas vacation there is nothing wrong with the acting it's all in the script it's just not that funny people need to think before they write stuff like this it is one christmas movie i do not recommend
<START> i've tried to remember the name of this movie for years and years finally read something today 03 09 2005 that mentioned stacy keach's name and it reminded me that i had seen a movie that he was in in 1974 at the atlanta film festival so i did a google search for keach's movies and found the gravy train we were supposed to see duddy kravitz at the film festival but for some reason they were unable to show it and instead substituted the gravy train we were terribly disappointed that we weren't going to be able to see the much hyped duddy kravitz and had heard nothing of the gravy train and have heard nothing of it since br br however i recall we were pleasantly surprised at how good the movie was and as i recall it was quite humorous would love to find it on tape
<START> when i first saw the poster of this movie i discarded it off as another low budget movie targeting youth after some days when it finally made it to the theaters one of my friends told me it's a good one br br a year later the first time when i saw the advertisement that anand was going to be aired on television and the moment finally came as i flipped channels and for a moment i stopped to watch and that's it i ended up watching the whole movie br br and by now 3 yrs later i'd have watched the movie at least 7 8 times and i don't really watch movies again and again br br this movie is great because it tries to be different when all telugu movies were composed of 6 songs and 4 fights br br it's a simple movie a bit slow but a very gripping screenplay there're no loose ends in the movie very well versed dialogues which is really really hard to find by br br music is both classic and soothing great renditions by radha krishnan some great also come in the through out the movie br br cinematography deserves a mention editing is not slick but adequate for a romantic one such as this br br but what really blows you out in this movie is two things 1 the way each scene has been treated with utmost respect by the now famous br br 2 the beautiful lyrics by br br and one more thing deserves a special mention kamalini part of her success attributed to for lending her such a beautiful voice really tell you the voice does wonders to me br br the other actors are equally good raja in the title character and the little girl and the way she shouts when she gets a new dog br br ultimately i can tell you this movie is soon on its way to be another classic with those old classic romantic ones along with another classic romantic piece
<START> i like 50s sci fi movies a lot i like the really good ones such as the day the earth stood still when worlds collide invasion of the body snatchers and many others and sometimes the really bad ones because they can be really funny and great to watch with friends such as plan 9 from outer space however when a sci fi movie is bad but not bad enough to be fun it really should be avoided this movie is just such a film the posters make it appear as some sort of sexy she beast is attacking mankind whereas the real plot is a lot less interesting a woman is married to a womanizer she is contaminated and begins to grow to a huge size and decides to track down this worm and kick his tail and that's about it also many of the special effects really stink especially the gigantic papier mache hand that comes into the room to grab the wicked hubby
