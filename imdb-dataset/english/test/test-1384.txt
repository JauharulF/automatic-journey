<START> aussie shakespeare for 18 24 set with blood blood and more blood and good dose of nudity this will not be for every one on may levels to violent for some too cheap for most done on low budget they try and do there best but it only works sporadically and this macbeth just seem to be lacking its just not compelling although there is some good acting on the part of most you don't get into there heads especially the best performance came from gary sweet and the strangest mick molly if your into shakespeare then see it but if you like your cheese mature you will love it it not a bad film but it not that good either sam would of loved it that is if it was filmed as a western i was expecting a lot from this as i loved romper but this is was a vacant effort
<START> after seeing a texas tale of treason the measly correspondence efforts by cox could not even afford the massive collusion stu directed with no budget it tells a story about dedication sweat whiz fire and punk rock i love it my favorite parts are the interviews with marci she's such a hot baby babe and she digs me but she just doesn't know it yet the japanese clerk his lines that cracked me up the sex scene was really cool i am going to see if stu will come over sometime and do the box light wave thing when i'm doing it with my woman the intro and of course my 5 seconds during closing credits i know thats going to get me some chicks i hope to see more from because i know i can expect the unexpected
<START> this is one of my all time favorite cheap corny vampire b movies br br calvin klein underwear model oh i mean stefan the good vampire returns to transylvania to ascend the throne of vampiric royalty but manicure impaired and eternally drooling half brother has other plans having killed their father the vampire king now sets his sights on stefan stefan's new mortal girlfriend michelle and her two pretty friends and the all powerful br br okay the scenery is beautiful and it should be as it was shot on location in fricken for gosh sakes the actresses are no great shakes and stefan the heroic vampire is about as charming as a refrigerated fireplace poker but who cares there's only one reason to watch this movie and his name is he's a physical homage to nosferatu and he has the best lines in the movie all spoken in the raspy voice of a man who smokes ten packs of cigarettes a day the cemetery festival scene is one of the best scenes in the film as slowly approaches the camera and reveals his grinning slobbering face for the world to see i found myself cheering him on as he collected victims and taunted his perfect brother but maybe i'm just a sicko questionable taste in men aside i highly recommend this film to vampire enthusiasts it's original it's fun and is one of the best vampires i've seen in a long time much more fun than the stiff tragic whining undead brats that endlessly grace the horror screens these days enjoys his sadism and never apologizes he's what a vampire should be
<START> i have read almost all the books by now and have seen the musical production in two different languages i absolutely adored everything that i have been acquainted previously but lately i've been running out of resources to sustain my fancy i still have couple of books left but they are either in transit or they are the sequels which i am not in a hurry to read so an idea dawned on me sink me there are movies which i have not watched thus i must watch them immediately br br the first five minutes of these series were acceptable in fact i quite enjoyed the variation of the reason for the denunciation however different it had seemed it went all downhill from there though was too foppish and i daresay too old for this role not nearly that dark and dashing figure with his dreadful either or and what was that with random bed scene featuring him it was way too creepy wasn't his only love the madame guillotine and his only interest his job and his only obsession sir percy marguerite prettiest woman in france cleverest woman in europe i think not although whatever compelled her to break into the study of sir percy i haven't the faintest idea and whatever my lord tony has done to deserve this death yes every member of the league did pledge his life to sir percy but he would have never endangered any of them nor would have run away like a coward when his dear friend faces mortal danger and if by any means he had to mourn his companion he would have done that mourn not just move on as if nothing had happened which brings me to another point sir percy his portrayal was most dreadful he was neither a lazy fop nor a gallant and elusive hero who is a master of transformations nor did he care too much about his pronunciation of that word alone made my ears bleed and with his own hands he had never killed anyone so what was that with him randomly walking around and slaughtering people br br the costumes were just too flashy for that time period as well this is post revolutionary france we are talking about not pre revolutionary people in dresses like that stand out in a crowd quite easily it was all just gah br br although i must admit after i watched other parts my opinion did change slightly watching it as a separate work independent of scarlet pimpernel series it was tolerable just your other average hero in the mask but for what they tried to pass it it is still miserable
<START> evan almighty continues the mainstream bruce almighty franchise this time with newsman turned freshman congressman from buffalo evan baxter steve carell at it's center a wholly innocuous and not even really self doubting man god morgan freeman decides to enforce some sort of quest upon baxter in order to illustrate the importance of kindness so that baxter can change the world aka pay it forward br br think of evan almighty as a wholesome derivative of gentlemen ' baxter is not a con but his colleague congressman long john goodman wants his unquestioned support on a bill that essentially is harmful to the environment and well meaning baxter knowing the importance of networking and visibility is willing to support him br br in addition with the new job comes more responsibility and baxter is in a sense vilified for not spending enough time with his family br br so god decides to give evan baxter some guidance by forcing him to become the modern day noah his orders build an ark except while it may be mildly humorous to see baxter's transformation to the weirdo with a beard o there doesn't seem to be much point to this whole thing which becomes abundantly clearer when the climax of the film fizzles spoilers if none of the population is killed by the flood then what was the point of summoning the animals or at least the ones that obviously weren't from suburban virginia or more importantly if all baxter had to realize was that long's projects faltered in their quality then why did he have to build an ark br br so although a comedy like this needn't be a hysterical laugh riot it was certainly one made far less enjoyable as it was crammed with far too many homilies and not all from morgan freeman and action that seemed intended for a film of more epic events
<START> i obtained this little piece of on the videoasia tales of voodoo dvd label quite where the voodoo is supposed to fit in i have no idea indeed i would not usually connect voodoo with indonesia anyway let alone with wips br br i know and love wip movies i have seen most of them i could not therefore resist this little known gem from the description given to it on the cover br br it is appalling you cannot have a wip movie if the women keep their clothes on even in the shower although it gives a nod to the exploitation genre wip without nudity is like a big mac without the beef br br as my gym teacher used to say on the whole i'd rather be at the disco
<START> this movie is the last straw in a list of films i have seen this week that have pushed me over the edge and forced me to join imdb and spread some warning to the public it was absolutely horrible the film was drawn out and painfully boring the sound effects and even picture quality seemed like they came from willow 1988 or maybe even conan the barbarian 1982 the battle of was absolutely absurd this largest filmed reconstruction of medieval battle ever staged in the british isles made me snicker there wasn't even a coherent formation at all just a few guys with spears and horses running right through them the scenes of douglas especially in the last battle were simply horrible as was most of the acting in the film
<START> i've tried to reconcile why so many bad reviews of this film while the vast majority of reviews are given a rating of between 7 and 10 the reason may be this film is kind of hard to describe in a positive review although a few have done that quite nicely already this film is confusing depressing and doesn't have a happy ending i still gave x a rating of 10 because it is basically for me literature and art combined on film that is really my favorite kind of filmmaking i've only seen two of carax's films this one and sang as with this film i'm being somewhat pretentious when i call this one of carax's best films but i am carax has a minimalist style if that type of film does not appeal to you and is boring then it would be best not to watch this but x was less minimalist than sang so it had quite a lot of intensity for a thriller at least for my taste i found it quite interesting and absorbing the two lead roles did an excellent job acting i mean the lead and the young woman he thought was his half sister catherine d is always great but her role was not very large or significant in the story but everyone did a fine job i thought the cult stuff was great it may have not been very believable but that is due to its being rather abstract there is a lot going on between the lines in this film this is a very freudian psycho thriller
<START> this movie was amazing i was in tears by the end of the movie okay i know the acting sucked but that's not what was important the message came through loud and clear about god's love for us and jesus's sacrifice the movie was realistic and showed actual human feelings whether it be pete's anger of the blond girl's sneers or the guy that asked questions but it also showed the joy that comes from a true relationship with christ the cars were awesome and the actors were very hot and that attracted my eye but what i liked most about this movie was the clear gospel message the mother and pastor supported ben in his new walk with christ and tried to be a godly example to others nicky d showed that no matter if you have all the world has to offer without christ it doesn't matter nina showed how a misguided but good person can easily miss the mark i loved this movie and think that it will bring many teenagers to christ
<START> this review contains a huge spoiler but i don't know how to explain how cool it is without giving it away i saw revenge a while ago br br now you might think it's just a rip off of child's play indeed there are similarities br br however chucky was a possessed doll who works independently of the kid it is possible that is possessed with a demon or cursed or something however the puppet itself is actually completely inanimate the kid is insane and the kid is the one killing people everyone including the audience the survivors and the kid herself thinks it's the doll but it's the kid br br the nudity is almost a pity because otherwise i could tell everyone to see it because it really is an interesting horror movie
<START> this film is about a gap that exists between the real world and the world of the dead there's a lot of mumbo jumbo about the internet i e if you install a program on the computer you see dead folks much like if you play a videotape you'll die in ringu frankly most of this seemed rather silly and lost me what i did find interesting is the idea that the dead live within their own separate existence being totally alone for eternity this was sobering and fascinating br br i love japanese films and have seen a huge number compared to most americans however one genre that has become popular in recent years that i just can't relate to very well are these horror films i know they are super popular especially since they seem to be remade so often in the states i've seen both ringu as well as the ring ju on and the grudge and was rather ambivalent despite their popularity about the only recent horror film i really liked from japan was a reworking of the great british film on a wet afternoon and what do i think made different well unlike the other films as well as kairo gobs and gobs of money weren't spent on special effects or trying to scare the audience instead the emphasis was on the story the bottom line is that these other films are a lot like american films like halloween or friday 13th with scary things jumping out just to scare the audience and plot is purely secondary at best for me i want story not cheap thrills or ghosts as the primary focus of the film br br with a relatively high rating i know i am in the minority but i just don't find this a very satisfying film all too often minor things occur that might startle someone slightly but the characters begin screaming and crying and acting as if to say this is the scariest film ever made so you'd better start shaking well i think it just tries too hard and i wish it had focused more on the afterlife seen at the end of the film and plot progression not scare tactics
<START> an exquisite film they just don't make them like this any more we on an upper middle class family in dublin in the early part of the 20th century they are hosting an after christmas dinner for their friends and relatives their table talk is just idle chatter but it is so well written that one is engrossed away from the dinner table some fine piano playing helps to create an intimate atmosphere as if one were there as one of the guests perhaps a bit too perfect for an amateur player the odd mistake here and there would have added to the magic of this film no real story but real entertainment and an object lesson for up and coming film makers
<START> the cure is an outstanding real life drama that deals with a very sensitive subject it is the story of the profound and dear friendship between two boys eric and dexter the latter has acquired aids from a blood transfusion thus he and his mom annabella sciorra have become outcasts shunned by the public and labeled as dangerous company basically due to a common lack of public knowledge of the disease br br when eric brad known from 'the and and his mom move into the house next to them he has to deal with public insults and the fear of catching aids himself however eric overcomes his fear and risks everything at first he starts talking to dexter but eventually he climbs over the fence and joins the witty boy played by jurassic park's joseph and his games very quickly he develops a real friendship with dexter who is delicately built and frail due to his condition br br the central theme of the movie Â the theme which makes it pervasively authentic and tragic at the same time Â is how eric and dexter try to find the ultimate cure at first they experiment with all kinds of plants and leaves Â which is very naive but also genuine at the same time as it shows how young kids deal with such heinous diseases and how strongly they still believe in the magic of the world when they hear about an alleged cure which has been developed in the south they do not hesitate and take off for an adventure that will bring them even closer together and symbolizes the ultimate quest for hope br br so they board a raft and head on the mississippi river what starts as a real adventure becomes a dangerous undertaking which is emotionally intriguing and instructive at the same time the scene when dexter reveals his fears and talks about the end of the universe where everything is dark and cold eric hands him his sneaker a symbol that wherever the boy may have to go eric is and will always be with him he will never have to be alone this sequence which is one of the most compelling ones of the movie features a very convincing interaction between the two actors who manage to avoid awkward and corny dialogs and deliver a very genuine performance that is eventually smashing in its tenderness and honesty br br i will not go any further in outlining the plot as i do not intend to give away too much information the ending however is emotionally tough and makes the audience so much a part of the tragedy that everyone who watches the movie will feel personally affected this aspect makes this movie so strong so outstanding and so convincing the emotional burden on every character is so real and so thrashing that even the tougher members of the audience might need some hankies br br a 10 is doing justice to this movie and is not too high a rating there is hardly any other movie i have seen in my life so far that handles such an emotional issue with so much wit and sensibility it is the story of how two boys make each other's life richer and how they teach each other lessons of life thus dexter overcomes his isolation and sadness and eric learns what really counts in life and both of them realize how much of a gift real friendship is when it comes to the hardest moments of life br br this movie is tragic Â but its message is sheer inspiration
<START> if you watched pulp fiction don't see this movie this movie is not funny this is the worst parody movie ever this is a poor attempt of parody films br br the cast is bad the film is bad this is one of the worst pictures ever made br br i do not recommend plump fiction i prefer the original pulp fiction by the great quentin tarantino this is one of the worst parody films ever made br br plump fiction is not a good movie it is not funny it is so dumb and vulgar
<START> lil pimp is the story of a little boy who becomes a pimp the animation and voice acting were perfect for this type of film br br i laughed out loud for the first 20 minutes or so of this movie mostly at the concept after that the joke wore thin as a 15 20 minute animated short lil pimp would have been a classic instead this movie consists entirely of one joke that lasts far too long br br voiced by ludicrous does have several crude and funny one liners unfortunately that is all the boy's pet rat is good for as he contributes nothing else to the story eventually i grew as bored with his remarks as i did the rest of this movie br br i am a big fan of south park and other animation aimed at adults i also play several online pimp games so i am partial to stories about pimps the transition from little boy to lil pimp was brilliant but after that both the story and dialog became redundant and predictable br br i give this movie a five it is worth watching for the great concept and voice acting just do not expect much else or you will be quite disappointed
