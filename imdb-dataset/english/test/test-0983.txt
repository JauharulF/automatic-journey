<START> frank tashlin's is a so so private snafu short which aims to teach the importance of the censor in stopping military secrets from leaking out snafu attempts to get word out to his girlfriend that he's to be stationed in the south pacific but the censor foils each attempt he makes to send the letter these early scenes are the best with the unseen censor plucking the letter out of the sky with long mechanical arms nets and even a specially employed eagle the second half of the cartoon in which snafu manages to send the letter with the aid of technical fairy first class who is actually teaching him a lesson is less funny and climaxes with a disappointing only a dream finale the main point of interest in this part of the cartoon is the appearance of extremely scantily clad girlfriend who is even seen bare breasted albeit with strategically placed limbs at all times aimed at the military the snafu shorts were often characterised by a heightened but these scenes in as they may be are by far the most erotic i've come across in any of these shorts thus far despite all this i prefer the snafu shorts that go for the jugular a little more usually resulting in the death of the main character for great examples of this seek out tashlin's 'the or chuck jones's is fairly weak by comparison
<START> the opening of imamura's masterpiece avoids mere sensationalism in its depiction of the unfathomably horrifying events of august 6th 1945 in which 90 of hiroshima and tens of thousands of lives were annihilated in an instant instead imamura emphasizes the unprecedented strangeness of the catastrophe focusing on such portentous images as the diabolic mushroom cloud silently in the distance and the black rain that a beautiful young woman's face the rest of the film traces the ramifications of the latter incident bringing the atomic holocaust and its aftermath over 100 000 people died of radiation poisoning down to the intelligible level of the plight of tanaka and her small community bound by the bomb br br the survivors strive for normalcy and continuity most notably by attempting to find a suitable marriage for but the imminent possibility of radiation sickness shadows every aspect of their lives potential suitors naturally enough shy away from a young woman no matter how attractive who might suddenly grow sick and die genuine love when it finally does appear does so unexpectedly and ambiguously we are left wondering if love across class lines is more a token of status as damaged goods or of a common humanity thrown into bold relief by harsh circumstances that transcends class divisions br br the film's classically restrained style intensifies the impact the spare eloquent interior shots reminding us that imamura began his career as an assistant to the great ozu imamura's mastery is evident for example in the paired scenes of bathing the first emphasizing her lovely back and legs the second how her hair is falling out the shots stand almost as bookends to the trajectory its tragic essence the film's documentary style realism is violated for expressive purposes several times perhaps most notably in a scene that lays bare the troubled interior life of a shell shocked veteran both the score by the renowned avant garde composer toru takemitsu and the stunning black and white photography contribute greatly to the film's brooding atmosphere when in the final shot uncle kazuo kitamura the film's laconic narrator looks to the vacant sky for a rainbow as a sign of hope and regeneration the black and white imagery suddenly becomes so poignant that it is almost unbearable few films from japan or anywhere else for that matter could be compared to the great humanist japanese masterpieces of the 1950s this film is one of them when i finished viewing it for the first time i sat stunned unable to move for at least five minutes overwhelmed as i was by the emotions great tragedy should inspire terror and pity
<START> being an admitted chess addict i was excited to see a documentary about the 1997 rematch between garry kasparov and deep blue supercomputer i was hoping to see an in depth look at the match and a lot of what kasparov had to say boy was i wrong and misguided by a mile this documentary is a lot like many modern documentaries there is a lot of flash but no real substance after watching it i am sad to say i felt like i wasted my time one of the most annoying aspects about the documentary is that it does not stay at one place for a decent period of time it has the typical mtv type editing where the camera shows different images and quick sound bites from people every five seconds it is very sad that film making has been watered down to the attention span of a 10 year old child br br i understand it is difficult to make a film about chess but that does not mean one should make it flashy 'game over' did have a couple of interesting ideas though it brought up the idea whether computers can think like human beings or not whether computers have advanced to a unique new level this is what kasparov thought after the match but this film does not go deep enough with this idea also this film tries to bring in a bizarre theory it tries to imply the paranoid that a human being was making the moves along with the help of the computer kasparov had suspicions about this but still to this day there is no evidence towards the end of the film it tries to imply the bizarre that maybe might have been the human being who was secretly making the moves with the aid of deep blue interesting to think about but i don't know how plausible or realistic it is i still would not recommend this movie though not even for chess addicts
<START> i don't normally write reviews but for this film i had to i'm shocked at the acting talent in this move going to waste the script was appalling the editing awful and the plot very thin you spend the first half of the movie wondering who is talking to who and what on earth they are doing the latter half of the movie slows down slightly but has no depth or feeling the only saving grace is the nice but still limited cgi and the location being london i gave 3 stars for that and the fact the actors still tried to do a good job with the drivel they were given if you fancy losing a couple of hours of your life with mediocre popcorn disaster movie entertainment by all means this is the movie for you but i would recommend doing something else with your time instead like watching the real archive footage online http www com flooding
<START> like another reviewer my wife bought this movie as part of a 20 movie family pack i guess you could say that this was a decent made for tv movie for 1980 but it is super predictable and the acting except for robert conrad is generally sub par the football scenes are nothing special and seem to mainly act as filler for the movie the movie is very dated now but a decent remake could probably make this into a good movie however is that really necessary i mean how many underdog sports team works together for the big game with the undefeated guys movies do we really need this is probably a good movie for your younger kids if you find it in the bargain bin but a sports movie buff will find it lacking
<START> well wright may have made a gritty depiction of life around 1800 as he so repeatedly and anally goes on about because of when it was written as opposed to published but it is his not austen's and shouldn't claim to be an adaptation br br mrs bennett looks like a rural this is a pampered woman they have servants remember the book scene with the servant dressing the hair etc but wright portrays her with rough skin all down her chest rough hands and working in the kitchen and the pigs wandering through if he wants bucolic he should try tess br br mr bennett the script makes too cuddly and modern and ignored the weakness in him the scene where he stops mary playing is supposed to make you cringe not pass in seconds if it doesn't don't include it br br macfadyen is very weak in the part and seems to be doing some kind of pride by numbers acting the first proposal he looks like a nervous schoolboy rather than a man overcoming his pride to make a proposal beneath his station most of his lines he could as well be reading a shopping list br br lydia is awful completely over the top with excessive shrieking and skipping indeed knightley plays elizabeth more like the giggling inane character lydia actually is in the book at times br br and elizabeth half the time knightley is clearly mimicking voice and intonation close your eyes to see what a copy it is and in her role you see wright's major error there is no prejudice br br from the first encounter with darcy she clearly fancies him when he comments to on the attractiveness of the women in the hall she initially looks hurt not shocked and the latter should set up the prejudice side of things and when she and are prancing round the room she comes across like a tease obviously all over him and by virtually cutting out you don't get elizabeth invested enough there to set up the prejudicial aspects falling out of that relationship br br and apparently it is caroline not miss and mr happily wanders into jane's bedroom and and and wright can boast about how great he is with period all he wants but a few panorama shots of rural life which show the preference for hardy don't excuse him the glaring blunders all over the place br br the cinematographer who clearly wants awards should have been in he veered between bronte and hardy throughout the film and wasn't the last proposal shots lighting from tess the need to see darcy walk along through the with unkempt shirt was just dumb but most importantly when going between those 2 very different landscapes they forget the most important one austen she'd have laughed out loud at the elizabeth sad therefore rain running through to picturesque folly wet darcy rubbish br br i admit i found it impossible the watch the film without using the book as context i was prepared to give it some leeway as it had to provide the story in a short space of time but to forget fully one half of the core of the book in prejudice and darcy to continually look more constipated than prideful made it almost unwatchable i could only see it as a mess with generally poor performances when knightley wasn't aping ehle she was gurning or skipping or both and only calmed down a couple of times to indicate she does have some promise but about on swings to convey emotion isn't a substitute for a poor script and poor direction although for some it was simply a case of bad script br br tom holland alone would escape censure while he toned down the comic aspects of collins he did turn in a very interesting approach dench does superbly the schtick she can do in her sleep whether it be here or in oscar wilde but this was supposed to be lady catherine de not lady she was just a little too sane br br the shortened length could have been handled by a competent screenwriter surely not characters filling in story gaps and helping along the audience all over the place elizabeth couldn't have come up with the figure and while they wanted to cut time with her learning of involvement in marriage the lines didn't fit with lydia it was the worst case of incongruous exposition in the piece br br it really is appalling stuff anyone who reviews it saying it works well in the context of the book is someone i frankly don't believe has read or understood the characterisations in the thing wright seems to think his characters are in the 1990s not the from their behaviour i'm not convinced he has read the book he certainly doesn't understand it he doesn't understand austen's acerbic wit or lightness of touch he certainly made a dull plodding film out of it br br what is possibly worse was the sad pathetic need of the chick lit lovers to need the 'i love you i love all over the place so they can sigh and get off on it the fact that it has no place in a work by austen is apparently irrelevant br br anyone who reviews it as a film alone well more difficult for me except i would note the poor acting the weak darcy and the gurning skipping inane irritation of the whole thing if you are going to adapt you can change a lot but if it loses the spirit and key motivations then don't insult the book by taking it's title
<START> like most other people i saw this movie on mystery science theater 3000 although it received some well deserved barbs it's one of the better films to be featured on that show br br the premise is better than even your average hollywood blockbuster these days it poses some interesting moral dilemmas although the score is sometimes obtrusive it also provides a few lovely moments when richard is walking by the river watching the movie you can see where a lot of plot developments probably looked very good on paper richard's discomfort in modern society is an interesting problem to ponder and the ending probably would have been a nice '70s style if the preceding affairs hadn't been so goofy br br unfortunately the movie is visibly cheap making the flaws all the more obvious the clone farm is very obviously a college campus and a beer can serves as a major plot point lena and richard have zero chemistry we are supposed to believe this is a meeting of kindred minds but there doesn't seem to be a brain cell between them the cranky old couple schtick also gets real old real fast there are also some mistakes that can be blamed on bad directorial choices such as the decision to hold a climactic conversation out of reach of any audio equipment whatsoever br br in all a noble effort but is nonetheless best viewed on mst3k
<START> tart is a pathetic attempt at film making which wanders around and among a bunch of manhattan teens exploring all the usual teen preppie stuff sex drugs and classical music almost completely without story focus or purpose griffith is in the film for about 2 minutes while swain dutifully works her way through another in her long list of dog flicks nothing in this films works and wayne should consider getting a real job not recommended for anyone pu ugh d
<START> family guy is probably the most ballsy sitcom ever produced it relentlessly skewers everything it can think of from tv shows to family drama best of all it's one of the few tv shows on today that's actually funny br br the show revolves around the griffins peter the obese father whose schemes are limited by his lack of intelligence lois the mother who is more or less the head of the family even though peter considers himself to be that chris the fat teenage son who has just as few brains as his dad meg the black sheep of the family that is the but of everyone's jokes the baby who has plans for killing his mother and taking over the world and brian the family dog who is frequently the voice of reason but is frequently corrupted br br family guy employs many tactics to get laughs from the audience most notable are the frequent cutaways that spoof what has just been said they are effective because of the impeccable timing and in how they play out family guy uses spoofs to get humor as well most commonly from 80's tv shows what really makes the show so great is that a person doesn't have to be familiar with what it's spoofing i'm sure it would help but the material is funny enough in its own right but the show doesn't stop there not only does it spoof just about everything it skewers its own spoofs the show is filled with off color humor the only reason why people aren't up in arms about the show is probably because it makes fun of every race sex and other generality equally there is nothing sacred here and no one and nothing is immune from family guy's satirical jabs br br putting on musical numbers in a film takes a lot of time and effort and it's a very big risk but family guy contains some great songs all well written and performed and of course they are hilarious perhaps the most famous one the freakin' fcc is both catchy and hysterical because it hits the ratings board where it hurts br br the voice characterizations are right on the money seth mcfarlane is tremendously talented he provides the voices for peter brian which is his own natural voice and not only are the voices consistent and creative he can alter their pitch at will so it really seems as if they are spoken by three different actors alex borstein brings a nasally drawl to lois that is perfect for the character seth green is unrecognizable as chris had i not looked on imdb i would have never known that it was him lacey chabert originated the character of meg and while she was good mila kunis really elevated the character with her sharp voice kunis gives meg a new sharper edge that she didn't have with chabert br br family guy has been compared to the simpsons and that's entirely understandable and not just because they are produced by fox both are satires of blue collar life and while the simpsons is good family guy contains are sharper edge the show is utterly fearless there is no real sacred cow the show lampoons handicaps physical and mental ethnicities tv shows and movies celebrities politicians religion especially catholicism drug use and addiction sexual humor of all kinds including s m and some that's just beyond description not everything family guy throws at the audience works but as a whole the show is consistently amusing and frequently hilarious br br if there's any flaw with family guy it's that the jokes run on far too long sometimes particularly with the awkward moment jokes the sequences are stretched for so long that not only does it cease to become funny it becomes so irritating and long that a fast forward button is warranted these can be effective at about 10 to 15 seconds but the show sometimes stretches these to beyond two minutes one could argue that the show rewrites its rules to suit the plot and it often does for example brian frequently acts like a person but he still acts like a dog when the story requires it but that's not a problem because the show still works br br some people have argued that the show has stopped being funny while i agree that it's not as edgy as it used to be i think the blame lies with fox not mcfarlane and his crew the show originated with fox but after some lackluster ratings and viewer turnout it was canceled however dvd sales were large enough for it to be picked up by adult swim the show became an instant success and it was once again bought by fox however because the show is so big now fox is afraid to let the writers experiment and try new things while it's still funny the humor is not as fresh and edgy br br definitely check this show out it's awesome
<START> a light uplifting and engaging movie watching irene dunne is a delight as you watch her she ceases to be irene dunne and becomes in every way paula wharton br br i have enjoyed irene dunne in every movie that i have seen and that would be nearly all of them what a shame that most of her movies need restoration so badly i do hope irene dunne movie are restored before it is too late they are such treasures thank goodness this is not the case with over 21 br br it is a must see if you like superb acting and witty comedy with serious overtones i agree with a previous comment on the speech the world and apple pie it was one of the many highlights of the movie i read somewhere that irene dunne helped in writing that speech along with director vidor irene dunne was a very good and charitable person in private life and it certainly seems to show through in her movies
<START> even though this film was nothing special as such i am drawn to comment on at least one factor that ruled in its favour that of the lead female performer in the film dyan cannon in spite of the film's ridiculous storyline and what she goes through here hers was the best acting job in the film making the unbelievable seem more plausible her raucous scene with the gay photographer david hemmings has to be seen to be believed good work dyan
<START> not sure if this is just a lousy movie or if it was intended to be a mockery of a b western story line was so so but the filming editing and acting were just plain bad plus the music in the background was irritating to no end too loud and just non stop many times you could not make out the dialog over the background music i'm in sass single action shooting society and do some old west shooting with them and a lot of the actors are members of this group so that's why i bought it if you have no interest in this group of people or that sport you certainly most likely wouldn't even have this little bit of interest to help out with the film the acting of even the veteran actors particularly stella stevens left a lot to be desired also
<START> this is not so much of a review as it is a testament that it has been proven yet again that the academy rewards money not artistic accomplishment and i must say i am saddened that this usually artistic and intelligent band of imbd members have left this off the top 250 boogie nights is powerful raw and gutsy through script direction and acting very few movies can claim this triple crown
<START> this film is a work of pure class from start to finish for a moment forget the famous 28 minute no dialog heist forget that it's set in paris and forget it's noir the film itself the premise and the execution make this a pure gold experience it's sharp intelligent and thought through in great detail just like the heist itself it portrays real characters that are not only believable but whom you empathize with it's a film that doesn't glamorize the notion of a robbery but shows it for what it is theft it shows that a heist is hard work and ultimately not worth doing now all things considered put on top of that a daring 28 minute sequence with not a word spoken and set in gorgeous paris with truly great attention to detail and fantastic cinematography and that last scene when you look up and see those trees wonderful use of raw and basic filming techniques it is a master piece in my view and i'm glad to have seen it
<START> saw the film at the closing gala of the ealing film festival in west london england enjoyed it immensely although the crow the chinese policeman don't appear and dan milligan becomes dan madigan played by sean hughes i the interaction between dan and the author writer director voiced played by lord richard attenborough works very well br br the rumour is that lord attenborough and elliott gould as dr goldstein appeared in the film for just a pint of beer br br spike was shown the film on video before he died and by all accounts enjoyed it immensely
