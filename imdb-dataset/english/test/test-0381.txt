<START> human traffic is without a doubt the most original and compelling film that i have seen for a long time it documents 2 days in the lives of a group of young people bored with their everyday existence and dead end jobs and taking ecstasy at raves on the weekend it is hilariously funny and extremely poignant and at times very sad in the same genre as 'trainspotting' it has a great soundtrack and features hot young rising british stars the movie was made on a miniscule budget and i look forward to future offerings of writer director justin kerrigan when his talent is discovered by the major movie makers
<START> thankfully brief mystery about a telephone operator who is discovered to be the kidnapped daughter of a railroad tycoon the discovery brings about an attempt on her life which is foiled by charlie as a crime deflector things take a turn for the dangerous when everyone ends up in the title location and another attempt is made on the girls life your enjoyment of this film will depend upon your tolerance for and his nonsense i normally like but there was something about this role that rubbed me the wrong way actually i think it didn't help that the mystery wasn't very good so there was nothing beyond the characters to keep you watching yes the finale on the train was exciting but it didn't make up for everything that went before not worth searching out but if you stumble upon it give it a try
<START> this new installment to the child's play series has not one scary scene but tons of hilarious jokes such as a stoner witnessing chucky him the finger and saying rude f king doll and lots of references to the series you can kill me but i'll come back i always come back the movie's title was probably thought of before the script and was written around it this is totally different from all other films in the series it doesn't even have andy the central character for all the previous ones chucky seems to interfere with characters from another movie a soap opera about two teens running off together to get married there is one cool elaborate death scene involving broken glass and water spilling everywhere the movie is very gory very funny and has pop culture references from martha stewert to jerry springer do not see this one before you see the other three it will really ruin the effect since the first one is truly scary lots of guilty pleasure fun and silliness br br
<START> i've never expected too much from a film by trashy b movie director jim wynorski a silly premise some cheapo effects and a bit of nudity from some busty babes and i'm usually fairly happy br br well cheerleader massacre delivers on the former and definitely the latter but unfortunately is a tad light when it comes to the splatter and when a film has the word in the title and on the gore then houston we have a problem br br movie centres on a group of cheerleaders who along with their teacher mini bus driver and a couple of guys become stranded in the mountains during a snowstorm they make their way on foot to a deserted mountain retreat where they find food and shelter and a crazy killer who wants them all dead from the outset good old jim ensures that his film features plenty of scenes loaded with t a and includes the obligatory shower scene along with numerous other moments in which tasty women get nekkid including a spot of raunchy softcore sex and a very gratuitous three babes in a hot tub scene none of the women look young enough to be cheerleaders and are never even seen in their outfits but who cares about such details when they're all too willing to strip off in the name of art br br i do care however about the movie's numerous lacklustre deaths with such an extremely lurid title i had been hoping for some inventive bloodletting to go with all of the bums bush and boobs instead practically all of the killings occur off screen or feature next to no gore only a silly post decapitation scene achieved with cheap as chips cgi comes anywhere near to delivering the goods br br still if you're feeling in the mood for some titillation or a bit of slasher silliness minus the grue then at 82 minutes at least cheerleader massacre won't be too much of a waste of your time
<START> this movie was of the 67 of 71 best pictures i have seen by far the worst first of all i found the plot line somewhat absurd the absent husband for 25 years still in love not even a letter give me a break and why was the guy who was absent for so long coincidentally working on an oil rig next door to the congress woman's party this film also exhibited some of the worst stereotyping of african americans that i have ever seen it makes gone with the wind see prissy look downright progressive i have scarcely seen a movie that i disliked this much ugh
<START> that's about the only redeeming quality in a movie that otherwise insults the viewer's intelligence by losing track of time plot and reason for being produced br br plus how that guy with the glasses ever got a gig in hollywood is beyond me
<START> writer director michael hurst's sci fi channel sequel to stan winston's classic horror tale of revenge gone awry has its moments and some decent gore but ultimately falls short in comparison to the original br br i'm pretty sure the filmmakers weren't trying to make a comedy but i caught myself laughing throughout a family feud started over a car accident is the basis for this entry into the franchise the hatfield and mccoy families live in a backwoods town with dirt roads drive pickup trucks drink moonshine and kick each others asses every chance they get just when they thought it was safe to hate each other and live happily ever after jodie hatfield amy manson and ricky mccoy bradley taylor decided to fall in love causing the fit to hit the shan one night the two lovebirds decide to head out into the woods for some quality time while ricky's sister plays lookout but it just so happens that on that very night some of the accidentally kill ricky's sister and catch him and jodie together you know what happens next ricky finds his sisters body and decides to pay a visit to haggis so that he can exact his revenge through the mighty pumpkinhead ye haw also harley lance henriksen is back to warn potential damned souls against using pumpkinhead to ease their pain which really put a kink in the story because harley is supposed to have called on pumpkinhead years before this story takes place but the setting and characters look like dirty pilgrims that somehow traveled through time in order to bring the pickup truck back to plymouth then there's the sheriff rob freeman who has his own ties to the demon and looks like he belongs in a 70's revenge movie instead of a made for cable horror flick br br some of the gore and special effects were cool but instead of sticking to the man in a suit way of thinking hurst used some terrible looking 3d shots for certain scenes one particularly embarrassing shot shows pumpkinhead jumping from tree branches like a badly rendered 3d monkey the cinematography was exceptional and elevated the quality of the movie quite a bit the acting was pretty decent also with the exception of a few poorly executed accents br br family feuds never end well especially when the families involved in the feud have to deal with pumpkinhead i didn't enjoy every minute of this flick but it was much better than most of the movies the sci fi channel spits out maybe it's a sign that the channel is trying to bring the quality of its movies up to match the quality of its original series' i wouldn't waste any coin on a rental but if you get the chance to catch a rerun of it on the boob tube i would say to check it out it's a not so killer film but it rises slightly above the level of trash that makes it onto dvd these days
<START> too much stock footage almost one third of this 53 minute film really slows this one down granted that the plot is that john weston john wayne is sent by marshall george higgins george hayes to participate in a fixed rodeo say ro day oh but character development and interaction are sacrificed the relationship between the bad girl usually a latina even in the great duck soup 1933 and the 'heroine' polly ann young a loretta young look alike hey it's her sister could have benefited from more screen time the happy ending is too abrupt although this time john wayne actually kisses the girl br br the most interesting stock footage was the lengthy rodeo parade of real indians and but when the best part of the movie is the stunt work by the mighty yak yakima canutt who gives us jumping from one horse to another and several different running leaps onto a horse you know we're in trouble as noted by others the final fight with the villain is very poorly done br br my copy from disc featured an added sparse ill fitting pseudo classical stereo music track that ruins the authenticity of the original film the dvd box had audio 5 1' on it if you're going to modernize and colorize it you should add a 'western' sounding score with acoustic guitars and an accordion br br finally we have to say this is one of the weakest lone star efforts
<START> anyone who has spent time working in a hospital or medical facility has got to appreciate this film the plot is absolutely wild but entertaining from start to finish the acting is superb george c scott is the brilliant doctor but class a failure as husband father diana riggs a sex symbol of the 1960s and 1970s of the avengers saves him from himself the surrounding cast is superb and the dialogue quite entertaining i think i enjoyed the film more on viewing it the 4th 5th or 6th time because i caught that much more of the richness of the dialogue and the interplay of the characters well worth seeing again and again you just won't want to check in to a hospital in the near future
<START> well the previews looked funny and i usually don't go to movies on opening night especially with my kids because well you never know here is a movie that doesn't appeal either to children or adults as the jokes are too perverse for children and falls completely flat for entertainment purposes for adults i was actually embarrassed to be with my 9 and 6 year old and having to explain to my 6 year old what s h t spells essentially what happens here is a total twisting of dr seuss's classic it adds an evil and lazy neighbor who wants to marry the children's mother for her money if that was a subplot then maybe that would have been fine but it ends up being the major plot around the whole movie and the cat plays more of a subplot role in exposing the neighbor to the mom for who he really is take my advice and read the book and pass on the movie
<START> this movie is a fine example of what happens when a studio wants to get a sequel to a fine movie out of the gates at all cost only with this movie it truly is a near miss everything seems in place for robocop 2 to be a worthy followup to the groundbreaking first movie the complete original cast apart from the casualties naturally returns and gives it their best too bad a hackneyed script and an incompetent director as good as neutralize their efforts br br irvin kershner might have been the ideal go to guy for george lucas to direct the empire strikes back for a pedestrian filmmaker like kershner there isn't much to ruin in lucas' charmless film series a worthy successor to a classic like robocop would have needed either paul verhoeven to return or a director with enough brass to give his own spin on it kershner doesn't know how to give his own spin on anything lucas hired him for that and he's surely no verhoeven br br so what we get here is a movie that goes through all the motions to replicate the first movie but with none of the freshness humor or daring the original had kershner probably thought he could top verhoeven by adding more gore and gratuitous violence but instead he reveals how much he was at work as a director for hire instead of a passionate filmmaker and that's a shame since everything was in place to make this another classic as mentioned the actors give it their best but delivers some groundbreaking stop motion effects and there are some great ideas in the story by frank miller who was born to write a robocop movie if only the studio had hired a director who was competent enough to make all the potential come through
<START> the book was one of stephen king's best the movie was pure rubbish it was painful to remain in the theater until the ending which wasn't even the same as the book i guess that this is the result when you try to cram 10 pages of story into every minute there is no good reason to watch this movie
<START> my interpretation is that the term is used in the sense of the opposite of people who are not warm toward others the film reminds me of the teachings of the dalai lama in 'the art of happiness' where his main point is that the key to happiness is connecting with others not only are the characters in the film insular but they are also humorless charmless shy quiet and unfriendly these characteristics appear to prevent them amongst other things from forming and enjoying relationships and being able to talk about and deal with their problems and as a result they are terribly unhappy i see it as a strong vindication of the dalai teaching i'm not a buddist by the way if you are one of the people who thinks that their behavior is a natural response to living in a large city then i think you may be right but i recommend the dalai book city life need not be like this br br i can see why some people found it boring it does drag a bit in places and the characters are not particularly likable and it does contrast to lost in translation where the insular characters are much more likable and do connect with one another even though they don't connect with people generally
<START> one of the worst excuses for an irish accents i've heard from a truly great actor too its a bad irish accent not to mention a dublin accent which is completely different anyway the film is loosely based around the story of ganglord martin cahill and its done much much much better with brendan gleeson in the title role in the general
<START> the king of queens could be divided into two eras br br the first era constituted of the first few seasons portrayed the issues of everyday life of a man and his wife making it through life in the city paycheck by paycheck br br the second era increased the scope of the show addressing current popular culture and marital issues with a humorous spin br br but besides all of that br br this show was freaking hilarious br br kevin james when not doing crap comedy films with adam sandler is a genius of laughter and his chemistry with leah was unparalleled on tv br br jerry stiller as the psychotic live in father in law added his own unique style of quirky humor and patton as the man child spence was amazing he's a great comedian too the king of queens was the final sitcom of the 1990s to go off the air and it's a damn shame now all we have to watch are the idiotic sitcoms full of untalented actors and actresses whose only appeal is their physical appearance i like many fans of actually funny tv shows am now in a state of mourning
