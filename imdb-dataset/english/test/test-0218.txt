<START> more exciting than the wesley snipes film and with better characters too the last vampire hunter must save los angeles from a coven of vampires out to conquer the city aided by a tabloid journalist lost of fun and the names of the characters are great
<START> jewel thief is the crime thriller of bollywood and why should it not be it is directed by the biggest exponent of the crime thriller art in indian cinema vijay anand mera and manzil i could watch this movie for any of the following reasons in order of importance br br 1 vijay anand's direction 2 r d music 3 dev anand 4 5 ashok kumar 6 lyrics br br even if jewel thief is not a bond movie it definitely has bond babes helen tanuja and the mysterious and some cameos but our vinay dev anand is anything but bond he is out of control for most of the story and goes where the story takes him almost always as confused as we are he even flirts with tanuja trying to hit her romantic nerve just so that he can get employed in her father's shop br br dev anand might be in a double role well i don't want to spoil your movie or else i would have told you that is what most of the mystery is about dev anand works in a jewelry shop and there is a robbery when he is supposed to be at work though is not or at least has a perfect alibi we wonder who did it is it dev anand as the person he claims to be or is it someone we have not yet seen but many people claim is his look alike comes who even claims that he is her fiancÃ© in a tense situation dev anand has to prove that he is vinay and not amar while everyone wonders if dev anand is vinay or amar he is asked to remove his socks amar we are told has 6 digits on one of his foot while we watch with bated breath the events that are about to unfold dev anand even finds time to joke br br the real life brothers director vijay anand and actor dev anand have many movies between them this is not the best of them but definitely the best in crime thriller br br there are moments of hitchcock's north by northwest but the movies are very different except for the confusion about who is who a treacherous female lead and lot of traveling there isn't a lot of similarity dev anand could very well be amar in addition to being vijay people have seen him they identify him where ever he goes there are too many of those people for this to be a fraud finally vinay thinks it is better to carry along with being amar to find out what is the truth and it is a sad mistake he gets too deep into it only to be saved by the twists of cinema br br when i watched the movie as a kid i was definitely not amused the ending confused me completely even now there are parts about the ending that i do not like but i'd recommend this movie anyway br br even as a kid i enjoyed the songs this movie has to offer dil ' a definite loafers song in kumar's voice i could hear gaya ' whole day long ditto for ke which is set 'under the of at least the story line suggests that among the sexiest song to come out of hindi cinema featuring tanuja as the seductress helen's cabaret and we 'look at her' pe ' now could there be any better thriller of a song than this as the song progresses we are more tensed than we ever were and the words in lips' add to it
<START> sure the concept had already been done with alf and the thrust modern society onto one or more out of place characters but i loved both shows and watched them religiously until they ended in 1990 when i learned about scorch i was actually very hopeful for something new as new tv in the 90's so far hadn't impressed me but at least star trek tng and the simpsons were still going br br what i got was a big disappointment the acting was awful but considering the ridiculous dialogue and wholly unbelievable writing i can't blame them too much for what they had to work with there were a few humorous moments but most of the deliberate jokes seemed forced in their delivery the whole production work on the show seemed too low budget for what was on tv at the time in the 80's it would have fit right in br br still it was the first episode and had to introduce the characters and establish the entire premise of the series so i gave it the benefit of the doubt the second episode wasn't as bad and i started to get my hopes back that once it got into its stride the show would improve sadly my vcr ended up not recording the third episode aired i never got to see it and the series disappeared from the tv listings after that all i have now are the first two episodes recorded off the air onto a vhs tape
<START> feeling minnesota directed by steven and starring keanu reeves cameron diaz and vincent d'onofrio the strained relationship between two brothers sam d'onofrio and reeves is pushed to breaking point when arrives at sam's wedding and makes off with the bride freddie diaz a former stripper marrying sam to repay a gambling debt owed to night club owner red lindo writing and directing debut is a frustrating mess full of hateful characters and lacking coherence putting keanu and diaz in the same movie should at least provide some eye candy but even cops out on that score grudging his actors up with little positive effect very poor
<START> scary in places though the effects did leave something to be desired unless you have bad eyesight or are afraid of the dark however most of the acting was convincing and most of the effects were well done i thought the creature looked a bit too much like a man in a gorilla suit for my liking it reminded me of the original pink panther film
<START> if you would like to watch an example of how not to make a film then you need to watch this i myself with no film making experience could do better the script is laughable with a weak plot and there is no effort to be seen for any intelligent structure in order to make up for this flaw you would think the action would be decent wouldn't you br br as the acting editing and overall piecing together of the film is appalling the only saving grace is the dreadful performance by the lead actor the reason why he is the saving grace is because he is so genuinely bad at acting that he should win an oscar for it at least some recognition for making me laugh at him so much br br toss in a dead woman's body after an all male shoot out where did she come from pull the semi automatic trigger tens of times while the pulls off two gunshot effects reflection of the camera crew in kool mo dee's shades one and only one music track for the whole film an unoriginal script that has no logic is a perfect recipe for a really really bad film its actually more fun spotting the errors than actually trying to find something positive avoid at all costs
<START> this movie started off great the first 30 minutes are very funny and clever with some interesting characters that's the good news the bad news is that the film then gets too repetitive and then it gets downright stupid br br what we wind up getting is a santa claus with magical powers with a lot of new age baloney thrown in the mix it's just ridiculous and hardly the kind of christmas movie i would expect from jim ernest br br to be fair it still had a decent amount of laughs and is profanity free but just not a film i could recommend
<START> what impressed me the most about one true thing was how up front it was when the daughter mentions her mother's cancer at the beginning of the movie as depressing the subject matter was it was a refreshing change of pace instead of being blindsided with the revelation about a character's fatal illness 2 3 into the movie love story terms of endearment etc br br meryl streep renee zellweger and william hurt give very strong performances that don't go over the edge the characters they play seem human they're not perfect people arguably one might not say that about the martha stewart type character streep plays but throughout the film i found her character to be noble in a non sappy way she's dealing with her plight the best way she knows how br br one true thing is an observant unsentimental family drama in which the tears at the end were well earned
<START> in dramatising wilde's novel john osborne has condensed events eliminated a number of characters and generally implied rather than shown essential wickedness if you want a more explicit rendering see the 1945 film wilde and robert louis stevenson lived in about the same time frame but were certainly vastly different men and writers this story really treats of a theme similar to stevenson's dr jekyll and mr hyde but note that wilde chose to treat his story as fantasy whereas took the scientific route both the protagonists are men in whom good wars with evil with evil winning in the end br br the actors in this bbc movie take a different route too from those in the 1945 film john gielgud says all the same caustic and cynical quips as george sanders in his role really projecting wilde himself but with a subtle difference you'll suspect that sanders really believed what he was saying but gielgud may be saying what is expected of him rather than what he sincerely believes peter firth too shows the two sides of his character in restrained fashion but then we don't get to see as many of his escapades as hurd hatfield had a chance to display br br it's a very good production with the dramatisation reflecting the essentials of the novel if not all of its ramifications
<START> under the assured direction of f gary gray italian job never loses its grip on being cool and fun although the material is rehashed and average the film itself is masterfully executed and is satisfyingly good the tone could easily have been much heavier considering the murder revenge plotline but f gary gray keeps the tone light by good humor snappy dialogs and pulsating music it is a pleasure to see these would be bad guys form a great bond and stick to eachother through deceit and murder while never forgetting to have fun this one is 7 10
<START> i had heard of john garfield but didn't know him i loved this movie i had never heard of it i just picked it up randomly john garfield is a boxer in the movie he had been in real life also so he knew his part he was a fugitive throughout the movie someone else killed a man he character was blamed he is befriended by a family who has questions and is not quite sure what to make of him all sorts of minor plots ensue my favorite was the scary swimming scene in a water tower where the water was deep and one dead end kid couldn't swim and none of them could get out john's character saves the day the dead end kids were great as his friends and followers one of them right to the very end ann sheridan played the family's daughter and john's eventual love interest she was believable but not lovable in my opinion the only weak link in the movie
<START> let's see a couple dozen gary larson gags as well as his illustration style a possibly legally difficult wholesale appropriation of an aardman character a more than generous sprinkling of art direction from various pixar films positively lion king esquire villains living in what amounts to an elephant's graveyard in the middle of farm country oh and a riverdance joke ten years after any possible relevance the kids three and five liked it but boy it was a haul for dad just another weak attempt from nickelodean films to hitch on to the animation explosion i really really wish they had spent a little more money on character design on rendering on a script on a director
<START> by all appearances this serial could have been made any time since the mid forties the cardboard sets the moon kings with lightning bolts sewn onto their you know the drill this one is a rocky jones adventure featuring the space cop's dealings with the insufferable bitch queen of planet a commie planet that won't join the united planets when the noble of intergalactic reason announce that is on a collision course with this other vaguely slavic planet bitch queen decides to blow the other guys up rather than evacuate her land this introduces a moral to the effect of the greatness of a nation is not in its land but its people which is hammered home five or six times in the climactic the constant nasal ranting about provides relief from some seriously wanting space effects is this a tv show
<START> a scientist has developed a serum which grotesquely distorts the victim's hands and heads the scientist decides to use his serum on a concert pianist to extort money from him for the cure as well as take the man's daughter for a wife according to the dvd sleeve's synopsis j carrol naish as dr igor plays the monster maker in the low budget bela lugosi mode br br mr serum causes a real disorder which american heritage defines as a chronic disease of adults marked by enlargement of the bones of the extremities face and jaw that is caused by of the gland ralph morgan as anthony lawrence plays the afflicted man with some dignity pretty blonde wanda mckay as patricia pat lawrence is the daughter desired by mad scientist naish in early scenes ms mckay and naish emote hilariously br br watch for as maxine in a surprisingly good supporting performance she plays the somewhat garbo like and long suffering assistant to naish ms definitely steals the film and you've got to question dr sanity in casting her aside glenn strange as steve and a crazed gorilla ray corrigan add to the fun the monster makeup maurice is very good br br the monster maker 1944 sam j carrol naish ralph morgan
<START> this program would be useful for training hardened felons basic human emotions beyond this purpose the show has no value other than to fill bandwidth that would otherwise go in the electromagnetic spectrum i feel a greater sense of suspense and anticipation listening to a computerized voice chip endlessly droning out the products of a random number generator fortunately the helpful and frequent music cues will tell viewers how they're supposed to feel in case they are unable to fully the predictable and shallow plot line i did find amy to be a superficially positive character as she is a role model to young women that they can serve in traditionally male fields unfortunately her totally subjective approach to the law is guided solely by whatever capricious personal guidelines amy elects to employ resulting in amy's trials more closely resembling appeals to the personal mercy of a tribal despot than a true administration of justice this show is unpalatable in any amount although this is to some extent mitigated after two episodes by the brain's god given filtering processes by which the show will thankfully leave the same imprint on the viewer's memory as a television tuned to a dead channel at maximum volume
