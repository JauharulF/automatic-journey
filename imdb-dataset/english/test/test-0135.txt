<START> nishabd means wordless this must be the condition of the script before the shooting of this film started and therefore throughout this film cries for content what you go for is an unusual love story between a 60 yr old man and an 18 yr old girl and what you get are very usual very common events that neither excite nor surprise so what we are left finally is with picturesque locations of kerala shot brilliantly by cinematographer amit roy and camera friendly histrionics of newfound khan this does not cover up for lack of a concrete script producer director ram gopal varma who has such a good track record of films needs to pull up his socks as far as mr bachchan goes i don't want to discuss him in context of this film br br while reviewing i am feeling loss of words i am left speechless rather wordless br br personal opinion this film can be compared with an equally bad film released some time back called black i don't see the difference between the histrionics of lead characters in both the films what did you say just now that was a world class cinema blah blah and i don't have any taste well take a walk no i don't mean literally but actual one to the theaters showing this film because in that case you might find this film an oscar level material
<START> this movie is an incredibly self indulgent character piece that assumes that the mere impression of a story is as good as an actual story it was utterly painful to watch and had i not been suckered in to buy the dvd because of john travolta and the positive buzz i would not have finished watching it br br this film lacks anything resembling an interesting premise and seems to rely on weighty and frankly heavy handed characterization there is one altercation scene between and bobby long in which a tv is destroyed that when played out is incredibly flaccid and ill timed br br i found myself caring less and less about the characters as i watched it it was probably very fun film school wise to make it but it is just awfully boring to watch a indulgent and pretentious film school project you should not waste money on
<START> although this episode was offensive to the syndrome association others thought it was funny while others thought it was a bad way to start the new season br br this episode was funny and just shocking south park has made history as being their first episode with the most cuss words unless you count the movie as an episode br br i enjoyed how they made fun of chris hansen and his television show to catch a predator i didn't like the idea on how they thought chris hansen would do a show on and let a boy speak out and bash the jews br br one thing i did not like is how south park thought that people with syndrome would just blurt out bad language like that i've seen people on television with syndrome and they do not just blurt out bad words unless i am incorrect
<START> apparently in the eyes of some there aren't enough horror films these days involving young people being chased across a desert by a mysterious bloodthirsty madman in a truck i mean all we have so far is joy ride wolf creek jeepers creepers monster man among others rest stop may very well be the worst out of those it is about a girl and her boyfriend who leave their lives behind to start over together in california along the way they stop at a grimy lavatory so the young lady can relieve herself but when she returns she finds that her boyfriend and his car are gone from there she learns that the culprit is a guy driving a yellow pickup who proceeds to stalk and terrorize her as she hides in the restrooms this movie is so unoriginal that it is flat out boring the acting is annoying the gore is mild and the killer whose identity is not revealed throughout the entire movie is anything but memorable terrible terrible film
<START> mild spoilers br br in this would be satire chaplin set his sights on the evils of german fascism playing the twin roles of dictator and one of his subjects an inadvertent world war i hero and jewish barber through events inspired by both adolf hitler and the marx brothers negotiates contracts and declares war on neighbouring whilst finding time for numerous oddly flat set pieces the dictator's much celebrated waltz with an globe is actually entirely heavyhanded underwhelming and unfunny br br chaplin should certainly be commended for looking to lampoon hitler and for speaking out strongly on celluloid his much maligned final speech is actually the bold memorable highlight of the piece but the film simply isn't sharp or funny enough to merit the praise frequently heaped upon it nor to demand repeated viewings the best gags are away from tiresome posturing and involve the barber attempting to avoid a large spinning bomb a sequence which steals from the gun tussle in the gold rush and later with a pot on his head accidentally walking the plank off the roof of his shop br br compared to the director's silent classics the great dictator is slow wildly inconsistent and altogether somewhat unsatisfactory whilst the barren spells between laughs are often long and difficult to endure there is no doubt that chaplin was a genius but even geniuses make disappointing pictures and the great dictator certainly ranks as such
<START> don't get me wrong i love stephen king and this is a pretty good movie over all the rabid cujo is very scary and the movie is suspenseful but after the first few minutes that poor donna and her little son tad were held captive in their pinto by the rabid st bernard i began to wonder why she didn't do something to help herself br br she could have stuck her foot out the door and pushed the car backwards i mean it was a pinto for pete's sake and they were on a downhill incline and rolled to safety but then it would have been a very short movie when she got the car started did she pop it into reverse and hope that she could get at least get part way down the driveway no she tries to make a three point turn in a car with a bad she did manage to get out of the car and look around for 45 seconds or so at one point to try and get to a baseball bat that was lying on the ground nearby what a waste of time i mean if you're going to make a run for the bat do it and at least you'll have something to hit the dog with but forget the bat were there no tools in the car like a tire iron or something i didn't see her looking in the spare tire well of the car really why wait until you're bitten and weak from and your son is having seizures before you make a stand against the animal br br at the end of the movie she was battered and torn but by god she was still wearing high heels
<START> i watched this film many years ago on tv and taped it from there i could never really understand why my own mother was upset watching it it was because i was so young at the time i have just sat and watched this film again i now have 2 children of my own and i had to try and fight the tears back but that didn't happen i was crying through most of the film it just to show how different you feel when you have children of your own such an amazing family such a heart wrenching film truly wonderful someone has said about 8 still living any more news are you all still in touch i would love to know touched by the film all over
<START> this is the kind of movie that begs to be shown on tv at 3 or 4 in the morning if at all br br no doubt the film makers responsible for attack of the 50 foot woman thought they were making a pertinent statement about women and philandering and the dangers of the demon rum all wrapped up in a sci fi allegory br br or maybe it was a tax write off br br either way attack proves best for the viewer under the following circumstances a extreme intoxication b seen on a double bill with any of those jacqueline suzanne movies maybe once is not enough or c just a night when you feel insecure and the world around you is a little too perfect pop in attack and you'll feel great guaranteed br br it's good for a laugh at the expense of the hokey script the rubbery special fx and that four eyed sheriff and i think the last line should be engraved in a monument somewhere in washington d c it's just that memorable br br four stars for attack of the 50 foot woman buy a copy mail it to gloria steinem she'll love you for it
<START> despite what its critics ensue i enjoyed immensely for precisely what it is eyecandy for both sides of the gender spectrum soderberg has done the artsy hard edge stuff before won oscars is at the top of his game ocean's 12 is light commercial fluffy steve's day at the midway if you will i am generally not a fan of zeta jones but even i must admit that kate is stunning in this movie it's ending screams of an upcoming and i will be one of the millions who flock to see 120 minutes of george and brad and matt through clooney's digs in lago di como as they swindle some rich bad guy again and again if we tolerated 3 installments of the lord of the rings i ask if we can drool over clooney's salt and pepper lid just one more time
<START> what a crappy movie the main character in this movie was supposed to be born and brought up in canada yet he had a thicker indian accent than his parents is it just me or does look gay in this movie also do all the chicks in canada dress like sluts at least that's how it is in this movie all the females are dressed like strippers don't waste your time with this one the only good thing about this movie is the setting in beautiful vancouver wonder why bollywood is going through a slump it's because of movies like this i miss the good days when hindi movies were actually entertaining i couldn't even finish this movie because it was so bad i think bollywood needs to stop trying to replicate the style of hollywood because it's just not working out they need to stick to their roots because that's what makes indian movies entertaining
<START> the rating is not necessarily a smear this movie was done on a low budget but done well within its limits br br a usual pot boiler plot ship carrying a prisoner is destroyed in space people and prisoner escape in pods land on unknown planet where their presence wakes something up mayhem ensues a lot of ammo is expended br br the special effects were spare and properly done emphasizing future technology with holographic displays and controls instead of relying on bulky cheap looking plastic props plus the pacing of the story moved without allowing the viewer to lapse into boredom where they start picking things apart br br i peg this one as a lite saturday afternoon flick you can get up and hit the fridge without pausing it and it'll still be enjoyable even better your girlfriend can talk all the way through it without damaging your enjoyment and she'll be happy after all she got to talk to you it's that type of movie br br anyways the actual story line has s few holes in after they hit the planet but hey this is a guns 'n' ammo action movie cohesive story lines are not necessarily required so long as you have beer and chips at hand so don't get get yourself into a brain cramp over the ending
<START> found a copy in a bargain bin sale of this old time classic i played it with on a vista machine without any issues it's graphically dated heavily but what do you expect for a 12 year old game the game is a fps adventure game hybrid it's what i call pseudo 3d you can't look up or down just spin in 360 think game play can get tricky with a very limited supply of health pots and a somewhat average interface tip press i but on the whole it's passable br br one main strength of the game is the mood there game heavily uses full motion video and whilst the acting is b grade and the plot is very choppy the game as a whole feels genuinely creepy it also does a good job of making you question the 'good guys' are they really helping or are they just waiting to stab you in the back the other major selling point is the games length there are from memory 18 chapters which range in game play time from 10minutes to potentially hours my first play through took me a week with some serious devotion of time br br dated yes but if you missed this years ago and can find it for 5 give it a look cheaper than a movie and more entertaining than most movies
<START> this is based on michael's life from 1983 4 till 2004 flex alexander did a good performance but looked nothing like michael i feel michael was portrayed as a stupid person which i don't believe he was even though he trusted the wrong people at times i thought flex alexander looked chinese when they made michael look white i think should of been portrayed in this she was always pictured with her brother in the 80's i never thought any of the supporting cast looked like their counterparts there were some things that were inaccurate lisa marie presley's son looked about 4 in the wedding scene even though he was not yet 2 when lisa and michael got married also when michael says to his mother katherine he thinks he and debbie should marry if she is carrying his child it was idea for the two to get married
<START> this was a fantastic movie about two people one a young teenage girl and the other a middle aged man who are each looking for someone to help them fulfill a certain emptiness left by former loved ones br br both actors give brilliant performances that various audiences can relate to the script although written by seems as though it was written from a woman's point of view and at the same time men can relate to the male characters because of how well they were developed and described in the movie br br the end of the movie has an unusual but powerful and unexpected twist that leaves you speechless i would recommend this film to anyone who has ever felt lonely or abandoned by a loved one it is clear in this film that you are not alone
<START> i was looking for attack on precinct 13 there the film is that memorable who is the star of this ethan hawke or matt dillon i can't tell who the lead actor is that's a pretty big point against the movie right there gabriel byrne who could't have needed the money this badly could he drea de matteo is stunning but only because of her amazing body it took me ages to finally work out she's joey's sister off friends i agree that the so called swat people attacking the station are pretty crap as far as tactics go we were even taught better basic skills than this in raf basic training br br avoid this even the snow doesn't want to fall on a bus full of prisoners very bad continuity indeed br br avoid like the plague
