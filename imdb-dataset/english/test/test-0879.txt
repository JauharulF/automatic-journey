<START> pilot mitch jeff morrow sees a ufo while test flying a plane but nothing shows up on radar then planes and ships start disappearing and reports of a ufo increase it turns out it's a giant monster bird that is attacking and killing but what is it and why is it here br br this has all the right elements for a classic it has an actually pretty entertaining script i was never really bored the acting is good for a 1950s monster movie morrow doesn't overdo the macho hero act and mara is quite good as the requisite female love interest she's also strong and takes care of herself even though she is off getting food and coffee for everyone all during the movie the problem here is the monster dear god it's terrible it looks like a deranged turkey it has a long neck a hilariously stupid beak some teeth a few strands of hair on its head and claws and oh yes it squawks not roaring squawking the actors had no idea what it looked like it was added after production actors morrow and were horrified when they finally saw it in a theatre morrow said his audience burst out laughing and he left the theatre quickly before the movie ended producer sam katzman was responsible for this he wanted to save money and gave the world the stupidest monster ever and you can see the wires moving it too this gets 4 stars only because morrow and are so good and the script is well done it gets no stars for the pathetic monster wait till you see it attack what is obviously a toy train worth a look if you're a horror fan to see what has to be the stupidest monster ever
<START> i was quite impressed with the narration by martha and how it pulled on the emotional heartstrings of the audience as well as how it must have impacted the family the forward backward motion of the storyline was well done and normally i don't enjoy movies with the flash back flash forward effects i felt during the whole evolution of the movie that surely tommy did it it leaves you with a sense of how these people lived their lives almost totally devoid of each other and the consequences of not having any desire to answer the question it's 10 o'clock do you know where your children are and furthermore what the heck are they doing or do i care rich spoiled brats literally getting away with murder or so they thought
<START> i had heard news about this film from anime legend hayao miyazaki and i so wanted to see it but i was lucky enough to the film online at youtube after watching the film i knew that it is another miyazaki studio ghibli classic br br this film inspired by my favorite fairy tale the little mermaid is about a 5 year old boy named and his relationship with a goldfish princess whom he named who longs to become human and be with i won't give you anymore details you'll have to see the film for yourself so overall one of the best animated movies ever made with plenty of fantasy adventure and humor i loved it
<START> i am huge movie enthusiast and also an active rugby player who believes that rugby is the greatest game ever played forever strong is a mix of coach carter and sloppy rugby this movie is full of great acting well developed characters and in action shots that will have you ducking and dodging in your seat but with more arm tackles than pee wee football and almost every shot cuts away as soon as a player touches the ground its filmed to almost seem like football if you want to bring your kids to see a movie that will build character from within and could inspire a blind man to see again i can easily give it 9 out of 10 if you want to see a great rugby movie that truly shows the sport your going to have to wait for the next one because forever strong is mostly practice running and a one ruck film for this i give it a 7 75 out of 10
<START> big spoiler right here this film is b a d but enjoy it's good bad br br bugged is the kind of film you can't believe exists with dialog plotting and direction so ineptly handled that uncle ned's cavern home video looks like an imax experience since it's a troma flick there's plenty of gross out gore on tap but its even sillier than usual br br most of the production money seems to have gone into buying soda and sandwiches for cast and crew the brilliant dialog is best summed up in the immortal what was that which is second only to the oft screamed now what br br any knowledge of how people act in a desperate situation is alien to ronald armstrong the writer director when one of the friends is found being eaten alive by a grasshopper termite thing armstrong has the survivors immediately making time with cute but dumb as a doorknob divine while she's being hit on divine is cooking up a big steaming pot of a rat poison oatmeal mixture on the stove stirring smiling stirring smiling never falling over dead from the fumes br br the killer bugs are as frightening as which they too closely resemble the effects used to move them include dragging them across tile floors real fast with their legs dragging behind br br the highlight for the film would probably have been the house blowing up but they were either out of cash or never had any so instead of seeing even a miniature go up in flames they simply let the screen go black eat you heart out ilm br br the cast is virtually all black how can the naacp consistently censor something truly funny like amos and andy which depicts characters certainly no less similiar than those on 99 of all white comedy shows but says nary a peep about something like bugged oh well it's best they don't know about how demeaning this film is to all involved as it would be if it were played by any single ethnic group frankly before they put the kabosh on bugged get some friends together and get ready for the plan 9 of bug exterminator movies
<START> well its ten year's on since this film was released and the sands of time have not improved it one bit again like the other comments made the aussie film makers should have a little more drama rather than middle class aussies riding around beautiful places on there bikes with not much in the was of dialog middle class is not funny nor is rich there is also a mish mash of cast why is a young woman going to marry a man old enough to be her father it escapes me it's such a shame about this film looks like a wonderful place to holiday thou anyway its an hour and thirty mins of my life i will never be able to get back lifes to short to watch this movie
<START> cates does a wonderful job depicting a conflicted bride torn between the challenges that await her professionally the memories of the freedom she thought she would have when in college inspired by a famous author and the safety of her pending marriage to a man she really doesn't love this movie is definitely worth seeing as predictable as it may be the acting is inspiring and real chemistry exists between cates and malcolm warner
<START> separate lies is such an elegant intelligent and thought provoking film and i could have watched tom wilkinson forever on the screen the locations in the english countryside the marvelous london locations the interiors smart wardrobes and of course the writing and dialog made separate lies a thrilling adventure br br with that said and perhaps this is just an american viewpoint as the british are so much more sophisticated in handling sexual escapades i found it hard to watch tom wilkinson just stand by as his wife goes merrily on her way in a sexual journey that really brings her very little joy creates much despair for her husband with the cad that is rupert everett yes i saw the failings of character his aim for perfection the desire for everything in its place but in emily watson she should have looked deeper into his true character and solid goodness to realize what she has thrown away br br tom wilkinson makes separate lies into a powerful film by watching him experience all the pain embarrassment and despair on the screen as his wife goes off with another man and he himself makes the journey in separate lies by understanding his faults embracing his wife despite all that has gone on and leading her back to london bravo tom
<START> any fan of russian cinema will have great difficulty in believing the sub par performances phoned in by and bodrov jr and will perhaps be utterly perplexed by bodrov sr 's hackneyed and confusing script which is coupled with uncharacteristically weak direction most of the characters wander through the movie as though they have no idea who they are or what they are doing it is also sad to see that jennifer jason leigh's acting skills have not advanced one iota since fast times at ridgemont high and her screen exposure is mercifully limited this is a terrible mafia movie so much so that it makes the godfather iii look like a winner in the genre to see the key russians at their best check out bodrov sr 's work on prisoner of the mountains which also features jr turn in the thief and bodrov jr 's new criminal in brat
<START> how can anyone even begin to like this film is really beyond me br br the idea it has none a guy fell apart that's the idea wow an environment was slowly killing him now that's original and worth watching br br this is the first film i've seen i've heard that he's a genius of mise en scene but i've seen student films with more attention inspiration idea and craft than this this this nothing it has nothing br br each and every shot is too long there's so much emptiness in them the acting's horrible you can see the actors had no preparation at all no understanding of their roles not even an attempt at showing emotions it's so superficial the lines are so that you could removed 90 of them and still have the same crappy film tempo who cares about it atmosphere dynamics that's for pussies one shot per scene 80 of the time people staring unrealistically having no idea how to represent emotions and importance of the moment besides hollow staring at the camera or one another editing all rules of editing have been disregarded with no pa pay off of any kind photography half of the shots have reflection in them and crappy lighting with no stylization of any kind shadows play of shadows who needs that we need a guy pissing drinking hitting his wife like he's like he's acting we need a bunch of close ups of a not so beautiful woman we need an amateurish climax of his capture by an unconvincing arabian torturer this film has so much wrongs that it isn't worth the no budget it had br br frankly i haven't seen a film this bad since american pie 5 yup that bad br br i've just started watching his veronica movie which seems much better based on the first 15 minutes since it does have a hint of directing and artistic idea unlike this crap so i won't argue that clueless but this this film sucks
<START> it's possible to have a good time with this film while at the same time regretting all that it isn't in the 1980s a u s congressman tom hanks engineers support for afghan partisans resisting the soviet union br br hanks is in breezy hail fellow well met form as roguish politically incorrect charlie wilson first glimpsed sharing a hot tub with three deeply available looking women if only the film had the same air of insouciance but apart from philip seymour hoffman's turn as a cynical cia agent it tries to be perceived as patriotic too aaron trademark staccato dialogue serves its purpose but the story is no more plausible than one of wilson's tall tales and there's an oddly unspoken subtext wilson's afghan pals later mutated into the taliban and other anti western groups leaving the world worse off than it was when these events occurred
<START> first off the editing of this film consisted of one major flaw which i don't understand how was missed you consistently see the overhead microphones bobbing in and out of the film the first time i saw it i just said well mistakes happen and brushed it off after about the 10th time it began to get incredibly irritating and distractingly funny if you haven't seen the film yet try counting how many times you see the microphone might make for pretty interesting game br br now about the film this movie started out with the makings of a pretty solid ghost story however the plot twist at the end just ruined it completely you begin watching the movie under the assumption alluded by the tv commercials that the haunted house consists of ghosts which can only be seen by children particularly young children which makes it even more freaky as they will be unable to effectively warn the family of the impending danger the opening scene did a good job of misleading the audience that this would remain the premise of the film spoiler the movie starts with the family being stalked and ultimately killed by an unseen force in the home the idea that only children can see these ghosts is set in motion when the daughter at the beginning of the movie asks her little brother to tell her where it is right before it grabs her and drags her screaming into the cellar the young boy also witnesses this supposedly unseen force kill his mother after she tells him to hide under the bed after his family is killed the boy attempts to run and hide only to be snatched away as well br br as i said this movie started out with the makings of a pretty spooky movie in which the family would be stalked by an unseen force with their only hopes of survival resting on sightings by a two year old this began to be ruined less than halfway into the film as the daughter began to see the ghosts as well completely ruining the only children can see illusion set forth by the commercials and opening scene br br regardless of this the movie didn't actually get ruined until the plot twist at the end in which the man who had been helping the family cultivate the farm turns out to have been the man responsible for killing the family at the beginning of the movie all of a sudden after being attacked by a swarm of crows the man snaps and tries to kill the mother daughter and son while having a psychotic breakdown in which he believes them to be his family which he killed at the beginning br br the whole plot twist at the end just created a whole list of unsolved questions and left me going wtf first why was the family's souls trapped in a house if the director was going for a ju on the grudge approach in which the family after dying in a fit of rage would haunt the house and kill whoever enters why did the haunting stop after the father was captured by the ghosts of his family if the ghosts only wanted to kill the man that killed them why were they attacking the new family here's another one for you it takes several months from the time you sow seeds until the plants fully blossom in time for harvest this tells me that the man who killed his family at the beginning the man that the ghosts apparently had a grudge with the whole movie was living on the property for months during all this time why didn't the ghosts just go kill him br br this movie included a lot of clichÃ©d horror movie scares as well as an obvious combination of ideas from other horror movies however i'm telling ya this movie still could've pulled off okay if not for the plot twist at the end it's like they just ran out of their budget and just threw together something for an ending for this movie to have been a success they should've stuck with the only children can see them premise and ended with either the family barely getting away or being killed off like the family at the beginning would've opened the door for possible sequel too
<START> i really liked this one spoilers it had a really good plot the main female in this movie is really kewl br br despite the fact that she's the only one left alive and her lover dead it seemed to be much like ninja scroll another kick ass movie br br watch it in japanese with subtitles i don't know where the idiots who learned to speak english are but for some reason all dubs get an f in translation techniques the subtitles are more correct br br 9 10 br br quality 7 10 entertainment 10 10 replayable 9 10
<START> i was a fan of buffy and hoped it would come to a proper end when angel got only one more season but when the end came closer i was exited to see that and what did we get this episode called not fade away was the very last one br br i was so disappointed by this episode this is absolutely the worst way to this series why couldn't it get a happy ending why did have a few of the main characters to die why did angel not become a human and was reunited with buffy again no angel has to sign this piece of paper that he'll never become a human how stupid br br and the end is a cliffhanger br br what could have been worse the began so great such as angel but the hole universe ended so crappy somebody should put a spell on the man who wrote the screenplay to this episode and make sure he get's lost in hell br br so don't bother watching this it's so bad it hurts totally 1 out of 10
<START> to be fair i didn't see a lot of this show probably because it wasn't as good as the original m a s h but i seem to recall them moving it around on the weekly schedule some shows just aren't worth the trouble of following around every week but i really did try at first so it wasn't all bad maybe i just kept expecting it to improve but i can't give this show a 1 in all honesty i can't give it any more than a 2 either br br it wasn't mash i'm not going to type those stupid 's every time and it was trying to be mash without putting forth any effort like it would just magically happen well guess what no magic the best i can do here is to compare it to other shows br br trapper john m d was a much better show by far however they should have called it b j m d because pernell roberts looked exactly like an older bj but nothing at all like trapper john keep everything else the same just change his name and the name of the show presto after mash wasn't the only sequel to completely bomb and dishonor the original archie bunker's place was a lame follow up to all in the family it had no heart no conflict no depth Â all of the things that made all in the family so memorable likewise mash was funny because the doctors were reacting to the impossible absurdity of war remove the war and you remove the drive for 99 of the humor potter can't yell at for wearing a dress because isn't wearing a dress because he's not trying to get kicked out of the army because he's already out of the army because the war is over breathe all of the jokes became forced because there was no motivation for anything the least motivated was the viewer to stay around and watch the show br br and from what i remember the whole show seemed to be potter and mulcahy just standing there unnaturally facing the audience like a trio of vaudeville performers it was reminiscent of good times where they spent 90 of the show standing behind that couch and talking to the audience trying to make it look like they were having natural conversation they weren't and it felt even less natural on after mash br br another random tidbit i recall is that the people who made mash never got any royalties from the spin off the studio used the absurd excuse that after mash was really a spin off of the movie mash which they owned and not the tv series nice try but mulcahy was the only one of the three in the movie and he was never deaf i guess studio execs will do anything for a buck anything other than make a worthwhile sequel that is
