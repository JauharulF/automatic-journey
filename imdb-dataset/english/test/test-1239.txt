<START> great movie oh yeah full of energy full of fun presenting our generation our alienation a hymn to positive thinking despite this world we live in a tale of a great party a tale of a bunch of friends who desperately must do something in a week end and the only thing to do is the club but fun and keep boredom away very funny nicely grotesque in a few points nicely shot and great soundtrack
<START> the lavish production values that you generally find in a merchant ivory film are all here but this is an exceedingly dull take on what could have been a very lively affair i agree with an earlier poster that it makes no sense for the story to be unfolding through the eyes of an african american family and yet their own ancestor sally hemmings has barely a role to play in the proceedings there is not much clarity to be found in helping the audience understand the motivations of any of these historical figures and i was very bothered by the accents of a number of the characters nancy marchand sounded very british for what one assumes is a french nun and both gwyneth paltrow and greta scacchi seemed to be trying out different accents in various scenes in fact gwyneth is very poorly served in this biopic her role as thomas daughter martha is written in such a manner that we never get a handle on who she really is one moment she is slapping a slave and another moment she's the whole system of slavery nick nolte performs the role well enough but doesn't ever make us truly care for jefferson or any of his exploits very disappointing all in all
<START> a good old fashioned flight and revenge western given a twist and a touch of gravitas by injecting a little black social history into its plot lead by mario van peebles who does ok the gang of misfits on the run from billy zane's seemingly unstoppable army bigwig all acquit themselves well their adventures plausible yet fun and exciting there're some nice moody flashback scenes setting up the hero's character and backstory a good shoot out ending as our heroes defend the town from greedy white and even stephen baldwin isn't bad in this enjoyable quite powerful western
<START> a gut ripping baby t rex is on the loose in a small western town prompting sheriff eric roberts and animal control agent melissa who walks through her role in a very disinterest fashion to get to the bottom of things they discover that a mad scientist corbin bernsen is unbeknownst to the government sponsorship continuing on with a long abandoned us research project called operation jurassic storm ha by creating an army of dinosaurs in a secluded underground lab facility before long our heroes become trapped inside the marines are called in the power goes out and the dinos are set free to make a quick lunch of everyone they can get their claws and jaws on br br despite an often infuriatingly inept script full of plot holes character inconsistencies and loose ends this direct to video copy of jurassic park and carnosaur is fairly digestible trash thanks to good production values passable fx the occasional laugh and plenty of brainless action br br someone pointed out that an opening scene in this film was stolen from carnosaur but anyone used to watching roger corman productions knows he allows directors to liberally reuse clips from his early films to save both time and money br br score 3 out of 10
<START> too often screen adaptations of musicals compromise but this is one of those rare occasions when every ingredient perfect in itself comes together and perfectly midler was born to play this role and her performance will most likely be remembered as definitive she is supported by an ideal cast and the direction and design are tops it doesn't get any better than this
<START> with the nazi rise to power in eastern europe in the late 1930's charles chaplin turned his attention to creating a reaction to it the catalyst may well have been a propaganda publication referring to chaplin as a jewish sympathizer in the great dictator chaplin created a dead on parody of hitler that is as funny as it is frightening at times the film traces hitler's experiences in the german army from world war i up to the present day simultaneously chaplin plays a jewish barber who dresses like the tramp who comes out of a hospital after a long long time only to discover how different the world is under nazi rule br br goddard chaplin's wife at the time plays a young jewish girl whose family is oppressed in a jewish ghetto jack oakie has a great oscar nominated supporting role as a mussolini look alike who gives chaplin's hitler character a lot of fits henry daniell is his usual staid self as chief adviser to chaplin wrote and directed the film and received oscar nominations for his screenplay and his acting the film was also nominated for best picture br br chaplin made the film under tremendous pressure for some obvious reasons and some not so well known he financed the entire film himself at great risk because of the subject matter and there were no other major films made regarding nazi germany up to that time the film spent about twenty one months in production with chaplin even rebuilding a set and re shooting a scene to get things right by the time of the film's release in october of 1940 the war in europe was well under way with hitler conquering one country after another so the film became much more topical at its release than when production first began br br there isn't much plot in looking at the film in retrospect the film seems more like a series of comedy sketches and or mishaps strung together to get to a purpose independent of the film itself several examples of this occur in the last third of the film with the meeting between and the scene is very very funny but it leads no where in terms of the plot likewise the escape of both the barber and schultz simply leads to the mistaken identity of the barber for in order to give chaplin through the barber character an opportunity to pontificate to the audience at the end of the film on the other hand what better way to make a point about the misplaced narcissism of aryan superiority than to have a jewish barber mistaken for br br still the film contains many high comic moments such as the rally speech the new war developments bulletproof uniforms etc the dancing globe scene the coin in the pudding scene and the entire scenario between and including the barber chair scene to highly recommend the film one can also not forget the risks chaplin took in making his first talking film an anti nazi film and financing the film himself 1 2 of 4 stars
<START> i watch a lot of vampire movies i know vampire movies hammer films have always been my favorites christopher lee will always be the best dracula br br vampire effect is a fun movie from the beginning to the end the dubbing is not great but i also like godzilla movies so i am used to badly dubbed movies anyway i liked this movie very much the sfx are great even though jackie chans part in the movie has nothing to do with the plot and seems to be added to sell the movie he is enjoyable in it the fang work is excellent the acting is not great but this could have something to do with the bad dubbing maybe the actual language would sound better with the movie if i could understand it i am sure the movie gone with the wind sounds worse in another language br br i own this on dvd and would not part with i have it sitting on my next to my hammer films dvds
<START> okay here's the thing i've read through the comments of other viewers some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest darkest blackest comedy ever made whiffs of tarantino etc well not exactly but guess what it's still an enjoyable and ultimately funny film not brilliant not trash liv tyler gives a great performance and you absolutely cannot take your eyes off her she's a woman with very strong decorating ideas matt dillon a greatly underrated and under used actor is wonderful as ever he always manages to stride that delicate line between and soul and he pulls off the comedy beautifully ditto john goodman though the religious overtones probably funny in the script really don't work paul reiser is very good definitely better than he was on tv br br the usually unbearable michael douglas is actually great in this role as for his coif well see the film between this and wonder boys you're actually reminded of the fact that douglas can act the movie will make you laugh in parts okay not exactly belly laughing but definitely in the i'm amused i'm very amused category if you're renting this expecting to see another pulp fiction forget it but if want something kinda hip and kinda fun this is a damned good choice
<START> the first two bring it on movies were both quite good in their own ways the first was fairly serious the second was successfully satirical and the third opted for the usual idiotic low brow comedy that we always see in the utterly brainless teen movies that hollywood has coming out of the woodwork the entire point in this movie was that cheerleaders are total airheads who hardly know enough to carry on a common conversation and that's the extent of this movie's comedy ha ha not br br there is no shred of cleverness in this movie no theme no subtext nothing for anybody with half a brain to be entertained by and sure enough i could not sit through all of it if you're the sort of person who're entertained by fart jokes this movie is for you congratulations br br 2 out of 10
<START> slayer is a mindless vampire movie with a few twists on an ancient plot special ops team is sent into south america to hunt down blood sucking natives their leader is a real old man who has aged well there's an environmental twist as the vampires are attacking villages because their rain forest and old diet of wild animals is disappearing because of the greedy corporations and farmers lost of fighting and so much blood they just never bothered to wash off the cast for the whole film it looks like they slept in the bloody clothes and caked on blood while each member of the cast brought their own talents it really didn't all click as a film the effects were ok except for the vampires dangling from the buildings on wires if you're looking for lots of blood and violence this is for you
<START> so far miguel career it's been one of the more dreadful of recent spanish cinema he's made nothing but rubbish until now has been quite a surprise it's a serious film with rhythm with a great cast and very entertaining br br the art of robbing that's what is about a film much alike to david mamet's house of game and stuff like that a thousand of twists in the script and a story where nothing's like it seems br br the weak points in latest movie may be the so american language that makes some of the characters look rather unnatural especially victoria she's a hell of an actress but in she looks a little bit forced ernesto alterio is not that bad but he's not half as good actor as his father and what to say about well he's the man br br in short a good movie the best that miguel bardem has ever made i hope this is the beginning of a brand new stage in his career br br my rate 7 10
<START> even though this movie starts off with the usual something goes wrong spacecraft crashes people are stranded etc it still pulls off and introduces the viewer to some new ideas riddick is somewhat of a bad ass convict and has modified his eyes so he is able to see in the dark which is a much sought after ability due to the situation the ship crew and he gets in the cutting in the movie is very good and emphasizes the mystique that around the anti hero and male protagonist riddick the story in pitch black is as already mentioned to some extent very unoriginal and dissatisfied but the clipping and cutting in the movie blended with some surprising elements which has been added to the story helps it to still support itself very well and one is afterward left behind with a hybrid feeling of satisfaction and hunger for more vin diesel acts really well in the role as riddick and even though his character is a hardcore tough survivor he still takes morale decisions almost on the verge of good but that does not mean his decisions do not turn in his favor at the very end why destroy an already perfect reputation all in all this is a very good movie though not perfect the story seems very unoriginal at the surface but underneath it shines with enough originality to entertain some scenes has that wow factor while it as a whole is a bit better than average it could maybe be described as a cult movie and it is definitely a recommendation for people who wants a spiced up sci fi story blended with some minor psychological moments and an intriguing protagonist namely riddick
<START> this film was utterly horrible stupid premise and horrible acting by all whoever wrote this trash should be hanged reminds me of a hack student film but worse who ever produced this should give up now i know opinions are subjective and all and some may think this fantastic as some think dune 1984 was fantastic well get off your horse and watch some real films ok the acting was tolerable and with better direction could have been far better but it didn't so it suffers i don't know how much more i can say about this waste of film other than to totally trash it anyways it was horrible and i recommend to avoid it like the plague if you come anywhere near dreamland rent the movie beside it instead
<START> remember that this came out before gulf war i which gave us werner herzog's lessons of darkness br br le dernier combat is not sci fi it's more like judgment i've watched it at least a dozen times it really is a fitting companion to herzog's lessons of darkness and in that time men will seek death but they will not find it for death will flee from them br br that someday alas may be today in iraq br br but back to le dernier combat make sure to watch thru the very last second of the film i wouldn't call it a surprise ending but it is something you'll miss if you just assume the end won't be anything more than what you will already have seen
<START> i saw this movie and was bored out of my mind i am a fan of peanuts but i can't understand why charles schultz let this disaster be made spoilers ahead br br i can't believe snoopy would let his friends sleep on the ground outside in a dangerous situation and go out to a bar and swig a few cold ones without standing watch the story was complete nonsense even for comic strip characters it takes them toooo long to get to france plus once they get to france i had a feeling that the writer i still can't believe it was schultz didn't know what to do once they got there br br peanuts is best made in 30 minute episodes not 80 minute movies br br go home charlie brown you are at your best there br br
