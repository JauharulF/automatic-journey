<START> i remember ignoring the tv series when it first debuted because of its 'look' with the jim muppets however recently a friend let me borrow his farscape dvds and i am just now realizing what a terrible mistake that was br br as with any tv series there are episodes that shine and those that don't i ride the adrenaline and emotional rush during the great episodes and suffer through the lackluster ones however i endure regardless because of the core storyline that ties all the episodes together what i'm talking about is the growth of the main characters and their love for each other let me warn you it is something that is absolutely irresistible to watch i cannot recall any other tv series babylon 5 buffy angel etc that smartly and intelligently put together such a heartbreaking at times and suspenseful ride br br i think that at the end of the fourth season things were finally becoming tightly focused and i am shocked at the decision to cancel the series i wait anxiously for the release of the miniseries and invite others to discover this incredible gem
<START> oh my lord what were they thinking about with this one it not only is frantically unfunny but worse a very good original was trashed in the bargain jane fonda believe it or not actually turned in the performance of her life in that one even better than where she plays the whore in the other so called performance of her life maybe she is just flat good as a crook any other time wow what a waste of time but she and segal team up beautifully so if you even remotely got a glimpse of anything funny in this baby catch the anvil upon which it got beaten into a pulp from br br because very very very little of that one remains to this ones horror nothing in this baby is remotely funny except for maybe a couple of moments when dick and jane are bulging lipped up as lepers and cant kiss and uhh oh my lord that's it well looks like it br br it truly is that bad a film
<START> unfortunately many great films on imdb such as this one have their scores adjusted by imdb this is truly a fine and intriguing film by the accomplished director of bonnie and clyde little big man night moves mickey one and the chase br br if you click in the user rating area you'll see that the actual median for four friends is 7 6 however imdb has adjusted dumbed down the rating to 6 4 br br per imdb imdb weighted vote averages rather than raw data averages various filters are applied to the raw data in order to eliminate and reduce attempts at by individuals more interested in changing the current rating of a movie than giving their true opinion of it the exact methods we use will not be disclosed this should ensure that the policy remains effective in other words we won't disclose our methods so you can't question how we arrived at the score what a shame to see fine thought provoking films like four friends fare no better than lame formulaic comedies due to imdb's filters
<START> where do we start with an offering like this i nearly said film but that would be going a step too far the only thing hellish about this film is that it is certainly a marriage made in hell between nothing and nonsense baloney and these films should carry a physiological health warning so as not to damage one's spirit to the point where one might believe that all good film makers have left the planet and their resources have been handed to the dunderheads who have make this classic piece of trite garbage just like it's sister in arms league of extraordinary twaddle they are neither science fiction nor fact entertaining nor thought provoking humorous nor weighty but lay in a twilight zone devoid of any and all that entice people to give up their valuable time sit in a darkened room and generally be more enlightened enlivened or happy at the end of it if we could award turkey points for films like this this would be a turnip as we would gone through the turkey ham potatoes sprouts gravy and all other embellishments before reaching rock bottom
<START> congo is based on the best selling novel by michael crichton which i thought lacked crichton's usual charm smart characters and punch well sorry to say but the same goes for the film br br here's the plot br br greed is bad this simple morality tale cautions a megalomaniacal c e o joe don baker sends his son into the dangerous african congo on a quest for a source of diamonds large enough and pure enough to function as powerful laser communications transmitter or is it laser weapons when contact is lost with his son and the team his daughter in law laura linney a former cia operative and computer freak is sent after them on her quest she is accompanied by gee whiz and a few eccentric characters including a mercenary ernie hudson a researcher with a talking gorilla dylan walsh and a a nutty indiana jones type looking for king solomon's mines tim curry after some narrow escapes from surface to air missiles and some african wildlife they all discover that often what we most want turns out to be the source of our downfall br br the actors in this movie were not talented dylan walsh acts like a pathetic crybaby especially at the end ernie hudson is unconvincing is it no wonder he went on to star in tv films and laura linney is nothing special i think i can safely say the only talented actors in this film had very small roles joe don baker and tim curry an always enjoyable actor although sometimes scarred for life by constantly being reminded of his rocky horror picture days br br this movie also had some other problems including awful direction style cheesy dialogue and a just plain boring plot which was completely hashed when compared to crichton's novel br br not even stan winston's creature effects could save this movie from being a disaster i am deeply disappointed in this movie there was not even a campy quality to redeem itself with it was just plain awful cheesy boring and ridiculous and proves to be one of the worst crichton book to film productions br br 2 5 stars br br john ulmer
<START> i've seen the beginning of the muppet movie but just the half because i only watched it at mrs kelly's friend's house the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious they learn that if they believe in the end of the rainbow anyone can make it no matter how small no matter how green which was included in the trailer br br kermit is my favorite protagonist which means it describes the main character and so are the other muppets mel brooks was amazing when he played professor max the scene where miss piggy saves kermit by doing kung fu on those guys it was so cool br br the muppet movie is the best jim henson film with the most hilarious characters and people will cherish for his successful film
<START> yes why among the filmmakers that came out in the 80's and 90's gus van sant is one of my idols there are others a few steven sodebergh pt anderson tim hunter danny boyle martin donovan harmony wes anderson idiosyncratic infuriating some times but consistent surprising unpredictable their names make me switch on the tv go to a video store or even buy a ticket and go to a movie theater van sant's psycho however gives me pause why i wonder a shot by shot massacre of one of the perennial classics the color was jarring the performances atrocious what was vince vaughn doing was it a parody a bad joke what the hell was it anne heche as janet leigh who dressed her viggo mortensen with a cowboy hat viggo is a superb actor but in this case he couldn't make us forget john gavin and if julianne moore had been introduced to the world through this performance there wouldn't have been any the hours for her the minutes maybe so here i am bad mouthing the work of one of my idols the crashing question remains why mr van sant maybe in the words of president clinton because he could i'm afraid that's no excuse
<START> i thought that this was the most interesting film that has done in a very long time i loved his character and the whole thing with the rabbit set a different tone for this film imho may really be on to something going forward a little more light heartedness some obvious homages to other films mixed in with some great fights i would like to see more this style of film making from him one of the other posters thought that the bar scene was a desperado rip off i immediately saw the r rodriguez connection also but thought it was very clever and made me want to see the film again to look for more subtle cues from other films rocks br br other stuff after reading other comments br br no music in the dungeon fight at first i didn't like that at first either but then i thought it was interesting because it threw me off balance a bit by giving us something that we didn't expect made it seem more real br br i also always get a laugh when directors cry like 2 year olds that their film was stolen from the studio directors are paid to do a job the studio is the boss and they want the product that they want very few directors have absolute final cut on a film in this case is the talent and the only reason anyone is watching this film i am sure he got a film that he was happy with i have a relative who works at a post house who knew a little of the story presumably the director worked on and delivered his cut of the film everyone who saw it said it was a disaster then and the studio re edited the movie this stuff happens all the time he also did see the final cut which he claims he didn't and his delicate genius ego was severely bruised because they hated his delivered cut if this director was smart he should have taken credit for this one as it would have been his best
<START> personally the book was a very well written amazing thrilling piece that was not brought to justice to the movie watching the movie at 12 01 in the morning to see that major parts of the book were left out frustrated me seeing that it affected the different outcome of the movie there was something to be desired out of this movie but all in all it lacked in plot br br for someone who has not read the book i could see how this movie would be seen as inviting and entertaining with its controversy and suspense however to a dedicated reader who has read it seven times i did not see the strong connection between the two both the movie and the novel br br with major characters missing such as maximilian kohler and the abrupt turn in plot with the survival of the last cardinal in the the plot of the movie was slightly strewn thus leading to a different take in the conclusion of the story the too was portrayed as a common white man compared to that of in the novel where he was portrayed as a muslim his motives in the book are predominately based his ties with the however in the movie his motives are based on money and seemed more like work than some personal tie to the task at hand
<START> i had a bit of hope for this hour long film made up of footage from old poverty row movies certainly it had the possibility to seem like more than a home video mass marketed to the world unfortunately while funny this movie still feels like a home movie but with stock footage spliced in br br the plot concerns the planned reading of a will on a liner at midnight somewhere in the tropics the ship sinks and well thats the movie br br the film promises karloff lugosi chaney and others being lifted from old movies to interact with new footage we get that alright but mostly we get lots of new video footage made to look like scratchy black and white film in which new actors prance about old footage is inter cut mostly to set the scene but very little of the old and new actually matches so its clearly just a put on its not very convincing and is very disappointing for someone like me was looking for a better constructed film br br still if you know and love the old poverty row films its very spoofy this might be worth a viewing i would warn against buying this but it can be had for about five bucks the price of a rental so the choice is yours though if you can get away with not paying for it do so br br disappointing
<START> are you crazy or what this movie has talent who are you to criticize a movie that was made by famous directors and producers i mean you must be watching some crappy version because if you had a proper version you wouldn't think its some low resolution game graphics br br this movie is for people who enjoy hongkong cinema the other side to what asian people enjoy watching you are such a sellout hongkong cinema is totally different to that of hollywood hk cinema is in a class of its own br br so if you don't enjoy watching movies from hongkong producers don't go and ramble on about how its a waste of time to watch just let other people enjoy the movie br br and personally i've seen this movie and i love its story and the way it was made
<START> i first saw this film two years ago in the cinema and fell in love with this dark tale of two brooding teenage sisters coping at home in their large country house with their father and step mother their relationship with their step mother is strained to say the least with the step mother appearing to be increasingly becoming unstable in her battles with the younger girls the film though slants with oriental style ghost effects and horror which adds a strange and unsettling aspect to the story that on first viewing is not clear but is all the more intriguing br br the direction is incredibly good and the acting is stunning with the step mother in particular incredibly good swinging from one mood style to another in the film the large house adds eeriness and there are enough points in the film where you will jump out of your seat this film to me clearly shows why korean cinema is possibly the best most original in the world at the moment you simply don't get anything like this in the western world sadly and really i can see it being influential on film makers around the world in the next decade br br highly recommended viewing in my opinion a real joy and scare
<START> classic excellent good fair tragic br br review br br oldboy is not for everyone it's pervasive violence its live octopus eating and it's story br br the film focuses around a man who's been kidnapped and is imprisoned for 15 years oh su is released only to find that he must find his captor in 5 days now the story though may seem gripping to start with but once watching this bloated and un original blood fest it develops into a mash of bitter blood and a forceful film br br it's directing is on par of average and by no means the standards of what a south korean thriller should be acting scenes are paralleled with dull humour and a poorly script br br oldboy is presented with thin straw performances that one could only feel shameful about br br verdict br br not for everyone but it's scope and vision isn't clear enough to see further than the grey abyss of fog br br tragic
<START> i think we are supposed to think what wonderful salt of the earth characters unfortunately this is lame and laboured br br as always with any production set in newcastle there are numerous shots of the tyne bridge and frequent attempts to show what great 'characters' geordies are the viewer is never allowed to forget where the film is set as though the rest of the world cared about newcastle and its inhabitants br br if you like well observed literate and original work stay well clear
<START> this is the worst movie i have seen to date 85 minutes of utterly bad acting half the cast seem to be suffering from syndrome ghastly wigs strange make up including tide lines around wig areas and holier than thou characters with holier than thou dialogue that makes you want to puke one comical aspect of this film if you have the patience to watch it is the sheer overwhelming number of costume changes the unfortunate cast appear in from scene to scene was this film backed by a catalogue manufacturer of desperately dodgy pastel casual wear were the cast paid in clothes for their efforts they certainly did not deserve paying with anything else this appalling effort of a film delivers a rambling plot in the first half blending into an equally confused arch christian in the latter the entire cast and production team should be burnt at the stake or at the very least crucified
