<START> possible spoiler br br if you were making a serious movie involving a powerful but aging father with three apparently ungrateful daughters featuring actors of the highest caliber with great cinematography and a beautiful midwestern setting now where would you go with it why you'd fashion a modern tragedy after king lear of course br br that's what i was expecting that certainly wasn't what i got what i got was 105 minutes of feminist tripe one long harangue about man's inhumanity to woman why there wasn't a decent male in the entire story br br you see early on where this film might be headed but you can't believe anyone would waste all these fine actors and craftsmen on that trite scenario you just want them to get on with the king lear theme but it never happens and there's the real tragedy if you ask me br br aside from the panorama of glorious rural heartland about the only thing worth watching in this film was that wonderful chameleon british actor colin firth practicing his midwestern accent now there was a treat br br 3 10
<START> a long time ago in a galaxy far far away sound familiar water has become the most precious commodity this has got to sound familiar and a small minority control its distribution what a surprise just have a heart attack and die from that surprise a group of ice pirates water bandits oh wait that last one's been used try to discover the route to a fabled unlimited supply of water with a lovely but spoiled princess en tow and a group of villains in pursuit br br this movie has the potential to be a really great comedic parody star wars david lynch's dune but was just not handled correctly it goes for i believe the term is low brow humor it doesn't really succeed in being all that funny which is a shame since it has angelica houston ron perlman and robert urich hence the three stars who aren't exactly slackers in the acting department br br definitely a rental and definitely have a drink straight up
<START> one of the most poetic narrative films ever made is nonetheless a difficult film to immediately like i love this movie but i recommend seeing some of john ford's other westerns before taking a look at this one the first time i saw it i was 18 years old and i hadn't seen too many other westerns and i hated it i thought it was incredibly boring i kept waiting for something to happen it took several years for me to love this picture first i fell in love with westerns in general the traditions characters landscapes ways of talking etc and that made me realize when i saw again that a lot is happening in it after all br br i also was simply a more experienced moviegoer at that point and had learned to appreciate visual storytelling and to listen to what each image was telling me is a very visual movie by one of the most visual of directors working near the peak of his career br br the movie is a celebration of a way of life and its subject matter is more emotional and interior than other ford westerns actually that's not really as accurate as saying that rather it has a lot less exterior action than the other westerns the other westerns have exterior action and interior emotion it quite beautifully places its mormon pioneers in the context of nature there are many shots of animals and children not for any surface narrative purpose but for illustrating this idea that is why the movie can be called a poem it isn't about the surface story which barely exists nearly as much as it is about an emotional idea and it gets this idea across through composition editing sound and music in fact one could argue that this is a purer form of filmmaking because the images directly express the emotional idea of the film rather than having to first service a story br br give this movie a chance and allow it to exist on its own terms not the terms of other westerns or other movies
<START> it seems like if you are going to post here it going to be a 10 star rating nobody ever seems to dislike anything well i am honest some don't like that but here we go rachel ray show is just plain awful this show reminds me of the snl character linda whatever if she had a cooking whatever show i must say i liked rachel on the food network on 35 40 a day but i am sorry she does not have enough life experience to make her interesting day in and day out give me ham on the street anthony interesting folks but most of all i find her annoying she actually told a member of the studio audience to shut up yes in a kidding way but shut up is shut up and who cares about her pet stories sorry rachel you been cancelled
<START> all right there's no way to this the plot was ridiculous the premise was ridiculous the acting was unconscionable the effects were laughable and all of the outdoor scenes appear to have been filmed in new york's central park that having been said there was something about this movie that i couldn't walk away from maybe it was the atmosphere or maybe it was the evil super vixen or the amazon br br anyway i'm not one to sit on the margins and criticise without pointing out a few redeeming qualities so here they are br br a violent off shoot of the women's lib movement is portrayed in a wilderness setting central park of course and all of the masochistic young men out there will be very impressed furthermore some of the scenes in which certain characters lose consciousness are amusingly dramatic you'll note that i write dramatic rather than convincing br br all i can say is that some people like b movies and i'm one of them if you're one of them too then give it a go cheers mr kincaid this is one for the ages
<START> i'm so happy i recorded this on vhs tape when it was featured on master piece theatre this is a movie i can watch again and again like living in the early 1800's in england isn't hard enough is born with a hare lip and is outcast from birth the people in her village accept her somewhat but always fear that she is from the devil's and are quick to turn on her especially when a lot of bad luck befalls her family she is strong and courageous but shies away from a traveling weaver who catches her eye partly because she fears rejection and also because she thinks he is so virile that he should have a wife who is as lovely as a lily is a modern man who does not believe in the superstitions of the time and he speaks his mind and follows his heart the movie stays true to the original story by mary webb and is riveting from beginning to end
<START> alfred hitchcock shows originality in the remake of his own 1934 british film the man who knew too much this 1956 take on the same story is much lighter than the previous one mr hitchcock was lucky in having collaborators that went with him from one film to the next thus keeping a standard in his work robert did an excellent job with the cinematography and george editing shows his talent ultimately bernard herrmann is seen conducting at the magnificent royal albert hall in london at the climax of the picture br br james stewart was an actor that worked well with mr hitchcock in this version he plays a doctor from indiana on vacation with his wife and son when we meet him they are on their way to in one local bus and the intrigue begins his wife is the lovely doris day at her best she had been a well known singer before her marriage and now is the perfect wife and mother the film has some good supporting cast brenda bernard miles daniel alan mowbray among others do a great job in portraying their characters br br although this is a light hitchcock one can't dismiss it as a failure the man who knew too much is a change of pace for hitchcock's fans
<START> this film had it been done properly has so much potential parody films are always funny and people tend to like them because they're light hearted stupid and silly but fun this film was funny in some parts but it could have been a lot funnier the acting itself was ok from all the actors but i wasn't satisfied it seemed a tad empty and my summary title says it all about the effects proper green screens weren't used for this movie backgrounds were added in after which just looked terrible no wonder this film went straight to dvd lol it wasn't all a total loss it is funny and will give you a good laugh at it not with it most of the time
<START> this is basically a goofball comedy with somewhat odd pacing due to some dramatic elements for michael j fox and paul reubens it was their first film fox had previously been in a short lived tv series and a tv movie br br since the movie is basically a race scavenger hunt type movie like cannonball run it's a mad mad mad mad world or more recently rat race there are no main characters instead there are groups of characters splitting the screen time and allowing for tons of mini plots usually these kind of movies are a way to cram the maximum amount of stars or semi stars onto a film br br this one has teams with one being the primary team which fox belongs to who are the only characters to be developed their plot is more of a stereotypical disney about a college boy not paying attention to his younger brother who he thinks of as a lazy punk since they are forced on a team together along with the older brother's girlfriend they are forced to work together since this is the main plot it gets the most screen time br br some of the other silly plots stand out the blue team is about an overweight rich kid whose dad just wants him and his misfit friends out of the house they end up with a cool custom van which had an on board computer in 1980 to instantly solve the riddles plus play video games with the time saved one member stephen furst went on to play dr on st elsewhere and later was on babylon 5 i'll also admit that i still laugh when barf while trying to a word a'la scrabble comes up with this is much funnier than bart simpson's in my opinion br br the other three teams have plots that are somewhat linked together the green team is a bunch of frat boys with mostly beer jokes which climaxes into a breakdown for one when the hunt leads to the pabst blue ribbon brewery they get a chance to harass the red team with two feminists and two fun loving twins the white team of nerds are lead by eddie who was previously in grease but went on to play a critical computer geek role in wargames and later tim sidekick in some of the dorf series br br if you grew up in the 80's then there are some classic moments in the movie that bring back memories the early video arcade from back when they were cool is always a plus in my mind look for paul reubens and his quarter shooting guns there is also a miniature golf course and a roller disco br br the movie is actually an okay family movie simply because profanity is almost non existant and the small amount of sexual humor is completely innocent the odd pacing thanks to the yellow team's cheesy dramatic moments will put parents to sleep while their kids can giggle at giant melons at fat burger oh they actually have a special melon platter that must be it right
<START> they must be i'll list them so that you can check them off one by one br br police regularly leave tens of millions of dollars of cash and drugs just lying around because they don't have evidence facilities br br when you get shot you always grunt the same way and fly back the same way even though there's never a mark on your body br br police are not able to identify the sound of gun shots and don't think anything is suspicious when an undercover policewoman's phone call during a high level drug and money deal is cut shot by that gun shot br br bad guy gunmen can hit mannequins with one shot but can't hit a big bulky martial artist with 100 br br if you rocket launcher a car in a car park the next three cars in a line will blow up evenly in 15 second intervals br br further to the last point all the cheap cars are always parked next to each other br br the smoke that is caused from the firing of the rocket launcher is much greater than the amount of smoke caused by four cars blowing up br br virtual reality games that are a long long way ahead of anything any other gaming company can produce fit on five floppy disks br br virtual reality games that are a long long way ahead of anything any other gaming company can produce have graphics that look like windows 3 1 screen br br floppy disks can be read even after they've been shot up br br semi drunk guys in bars attentively watch the news when they're at the pub and have a deep understanding of american modern military history agent orange and the family trees of high ranking military officials however they're only able to articulate their points using dialogue that sounds silly coming from anyone over the age of seven br br even though fights appear to break out almost hourly in a bar that bar has only one staff worker who both pours the beers and handles security of course he knows martial arts br br gold medal regularly make the simple transition to corporate ceos of software companies in a matter of years br br a woman who works for a computer game company knows everything about how to beat a game she's never played raves constantly about her great games and can rattle off facts and figures regarding her company's rivals but she didn't know that they overtook almost all the other companies in the field in large corporate br br bad guys always die in slow motion always br br wives tell their husbands that they're pregnant by raving about their man's bravery in killing bad guys br br wives do large amounts of their husband's police work this might explain why she whines and complains so much every time he has to go to work although it doesn't explain why she adores him so much every time he gets up in the morning and she can read about his murderous escapades br br it's fairly typical for a police officer to be involved in kidnappings kill tons of people on three separate occasions and stop a variety of multi million dollar illegal deals in a week br br when trying to lose a car that's following you it's wise to continue driving under the speed limit and if you're following a cop subtlety is not important you can him for miles then park right next to him he won't notice br br all cops are experienced martial artists br br it is possible to kick a guy four metres in distance br br people scream or grunt in pain when they are punched or kick yet when they have their arm broken they don't make a sound br br bad guys clean their bloodied axes with their handkerchiefs and then leave them in their pocket for many days br br pieces of wood when swung with one sharp blow shatter sturdy ladders in six or more places simultaneously br br the photo and listed special features on the back of the dvd case don't necessarily have to be on the dvd the advertised interactive menus why not no menu at all the advertised scene index why not have the whole thing as one scene chapter and not need an index likewise it's ok to use the font and title in the tag line and not be a rip off in any way br br with all of this i'm in shock that 12 out of the 15 top credited actors never acted again
<START> while not for everyone crackerjack is a delight to watch with tongue planted firmly in cheek the likeable character of jack simpson played by mick is scamming the local for free parking and making a couple of dollars on the side selling the parking space to work colleagues when the bowling club members need to raise some money to save their club they call upon jack to join their bowling team and play competition bowls br br filled with aussie charm the laconic wit of mick is showing through he also co wrote the script reminding this viewer of his earlier work in radio perfect aussie casting with bill hunter as jack's bowling mentor stan john clarke of the games fame as the ruthless businessman and rival bowls club owner bernie fowler with samuel johnson as jack's flatmate dave and judith lucy as the jaded journalist nancy br br initially i figured only fans of would like this flick but judging by the number of the blue rinse set exiting the cinema chuckling this is a film for everyone
<START> i would like to start by saying i can only hope that the makers of this movie and it's sister film the intruder directed by the great unheralded stylist auteur that is know in their hearts just how much pleasure they have brought to me and my friends in the sleepy north eastern town of jarrow br br from the opening pre credit sequence which manages to drag ever so slightly despite containing a man crashing through a window on a motorbike the pitiless destruction of a silence lab the introduction of one of the most simultaneously annoying and anaemic bad guys in movie history and costume design that jean paul gautier would find ott and garish make no mistake this is a truly unique experience early highlight an explosion get used to it plenty more where that came from followed by a close up of our chubby heroine and the most hilarious line reading of the word dad in living memory and then the theme song br br yeah this deserves its own paragraph sung by aj written by people who really should wish to remain anonymous it makes the songs written for the rocky films sound like schubert this is crap 80's hero motivation narcissism at an all time high with choice lyrics such as its only me and you its come down to the wire and much talk of having to cross the line it'll make sense in time our hero cares little for the boundaries of bona police work abounding not to mention the indonesian supremes the film's title seductively at this point anyone wishing to switch off officially has no pulse br br our hero is semitic cop peter essayed brilliantly by intruder star peter o'brien the of the title the man's bull in a china shop approach to crime fighting and particularly his less than inconspicuous undercover work truly leaves much to be desired but he is without question an entertaining guide through the mean streets of downtown jakarta with local sleaze ball connection captain johnny in tow as well as peter's own waste of space partner in fashion crime sylvia nash who does little so many highlights so little time the slide please arrogance of peter's not all too convincingly argued case against chief baddie greg rainmaker intruder fans will know hirsute slimy bastard craig gavin as the monstrous john white helluva name eh no oh well the x marks the spot location map stupidity our hero taking horrible advantage of heroine tina during a moment of weakness on her behalf the latter turning up at a sting operation dressed like a member of a particularly flamboyant dancing troop and believe me that barely covers it br br there wasn't even time to go into the plot revolving around the hunt for a drug detection system and a kidnapped professor with an alarming but commendable amount of national pride or our hero turning up at a funeral dressed as if an extra on boogie nights or the absolutely hysterical between captain johnny and two guys have never made more heavy weather of buddy buddy shtick than these clowns the trowel was possibly too subtle me thinks br br ah it tails off people and you never thought scenes of wanton destruction and general mayhem could be so unbelievably boring but the character interaction is stupendous the dialogue truly priceless and the incompetence on show somehow endearing oh and the shoes people watch out for the shoes
<START> tv newscaster kimberly wells jane fonda and her radical richard adams michael douglas are at a nuclear power plant when a serious accident happens the plants managers play it down but adams has filmed it all wells and adams try to get it on the air but the corporation that runs the plant prevents it plant executive jack jack lemmon realizes there are serious problems and tests have been he tries to get executives to believe him only they know it wells adams and find all their lives are in danger br br i saw this in a movie theatre in 1979 i was only 17 and it scared me silly to make matters worse the three mile island accident happened around this time making the movie all that more real seeing it over 20 years later it doesn't scare me but it still is an excellent film it works as a mystery a gripping drama and an expose on the nuclear power industry fonda with red hair has one of her best roles as wells she perfectly conveys her character's growing suspicion and horror when she realizes a nuclear disaster could happen lemmon is as always excellent he starts out believing in his company and the job and slowly starts to unravel when he starts finding things out he was rightfully nominated for an academy award for this douglas is good but he has a small part and is completely overshadowed by lemmon and fonda br br a really great film one of the best of the 70s don't miss this one
