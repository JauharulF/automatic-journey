<START> although this series and the mini film in particular were very important at the time of release i feel that the series as a whole was actually fairly poorly written with a weak cast the issues at heart are extremely well portrayed yet it is difficult to relate and understand the problems within the film when the acting and script isn't convincing enough especially when looking at the mini film br br i also don't believe that this mini film or series has stood the test of time as now many of the scenes are quite laughable the issues are still crucial but boys from the cannot fully aid the cause of understanding the problems in britain in the 1980s
<START> this has got to be one of australia's best productions i completely disagree with the comments made by br br this series shows the depth of australian and the lengths they went to to help each other out episode five is a great example of this and it really captures the australian spirit br br the music used throughout the series only emphasised the situation that the men were faced with their longing for home and their loved ones the numerous amusing renditions of the road to captures the spirit of the men and the fact that they never forgot home and that it was little elements such as the singing of a song that took them home for a short while br br as for the comment about it being racist towards japanese people the only thing to be said is that you can't change what happened the japanese did treat the australians very poorly in and to represent it as otherwise would be very misleading indeed the comment about the screenplay being in accurate is also false these six stories that are told in the series are composed from real p o w experiences br br the actors were superb the best being in my opinion matthew newton his performance as david in the first episode was gut wrenching from being a city boy to being another nameless face to his captors we see him change dramatically in the first episode because of his violent attack in the jungle and in further episodes we can see how that one event has changed him he is more aware of what is really going on and is always one of the first to help out the other members of the secret nine br br stephen curry also deserves a mention his performance in is amazing going from the larrikin of the group to being sick weak and unable to take care of himself the displays of in this episode touch you on an emotional level and make you proud to be australian br br i study wwii at university level and have found this series if not physically truthful spiritually truthful as it captures the true spirit of what it was to be an australian soldier br br well done to john doyle for capturing the spirit of
<START> we also found this movie on the discount rack and made the mistake of purchasing it because sandra bullock was featured on the cover the cinematography was terrible and the back of the dvd box told more about the plot than the movie itself oh and i love the uzi cam not br br
<START> based on book this second cinemascope movie ever made is full of rich color beautiful music and panoramic spectacle the plot sometimes gets muddled in contrite wording but all in all it has a strong social content man is ruled by his emotions and that every action has an equal consequence but to truly enjoy this film first see the movie then read the book although different it sheds light on a whole lot of things that were not seen on the screen and gives breath to some more of the depth of
<START> i am from texas and live very close to where the actual deaths occurred so i might be a bit biased in saying that wasted is a film that you just can't get out of your head br br stahl phoenix and paul all play their characters very realistically you truly believe that they are everyday high school students who just happen to be heroin addicts the drug content is handled very graphically as well although everything that happens in the film serves a purpose and each moment the characters spiral further downward is heartbreaking i definitely recommend this film to anyone once you watch it it sticks with you
<START> batman returns is more gothic and somber than its predecessor and i like it a lot also the scenery is more darker and the entire environment is saddening along with the soul chilling music composed by the so talented danny elfman br br however i didn't like the idea to make the penguin a monster unlike to the comic books where he's human even if he looks like a monster he shows well that he possesses a human dignity and i felt very sorry for him when he saw the tombstones of his late parents but still he was a dangerous villain in fact and he needed to be stopped br br michael keaton made a tour de force with his return as the dark knight and this time he's powerful as in the original batman it's not difficult to understand why he's called batman in public sometimes br br also michelle pfeiffer is so sexy and well fitted in her role and she gave a faithfully performance as the female villain crimefighter dressed as a cat really the actors did all a masterful work with batman returns which made it a successful movie br br if you liked batman watch its awesome sequel cause it's very worthy for all the dark knight's hard core lovers br br steve
<START> i had to get this movie since it didn't come to where i live i waited patiently and it was worth the wait i totally fell in love with this movie the chemistry between walters and you could see since they also worked together on the harry potter movies the woman who plays his overbearing righteous mother really had me convinced all right and how much of a hypocrite she is i think she did a great job playing the role i only wish we could of had seen the actually sex scene or more of it lol but of course we just have to use our imagination on how it went down snickers i totally thought the movie was worth the wait and if you want a good movie to watch rent this movie i do have to say that rupert really did a great job and it's nice to see that he's doing movies outside of harry potter even though i totally love him as ron the whole cast did a great job and i hope rupert continues to act outside of harry potter to broaden his skill
<START> spoilers spoilers there's not much that can be said about this early talkie era flick i'm hesitant to call cimarron a film because i feel that the word is too esoteric but what can be said about it mainly speaks against it br br take for example the overuse of portraying indians as bad folk in one scene the little boy of the flick's lead character an overbearing and over ambitious family man who wants to set up a newspaper business is playing just outside of his father's office an indian kneels down in front of the child hello the boy says to the indian in a very polite manner the indian gives him a feather stands up and walks off br br yancy cravat jr excitedly runs inside the office mommy mommy he shouts holding up the gift look what an indian gave me br br how many times do i have to tell you she snaps at the boy you aren't ever to talk to those filthy indians br br yancy yates sr richard dix comes across as a man who speaks with a forked tongue at the start of the story he seems to have a definite plan for giving his family a better life but we soon enough discover he's no great over much less a totally good moral minded man his slave child isaiah eugene jackson is one tell tale sign of this br br upon his family's first trek to a sunday morning church service one br br at which curiously enough cravat is to give the sermon isaiah tries to come along dressed up like cravat long tail suit holster gun and all cravat tells him to go home ya' all doesn't want me to come with ya' ta church isaiah says with a pout br br no cravat corrects him patting him on the shoulder you don't understand i want you to stay and guard the house and if anyone at all comes along you shoot him dead br br the characters not to mention the actors in cimarron couldn't br br act their way out of burlap sacks despite their obvious efforts and nothing in the script was any too commendable either granted the incomparable edna may oliver notorious for playing the red queen in alice in wonderland also released in 1931 actually manages to look good pulling off her portrayal of a pompous old woman which is what she's also been best known for but aside from that well br br yancy yates isn't popular in town from the first week he arrives br br and one of the outlaws decides to shoot white hat off as he and his wife irene dunne are casually walking by despite her anger with the man who fired the bullet cravat just takes it completely in stride br br not only was this story not shooting for realism but it was very br br lacking in several key areas e g newspaper isn't ever really seen bulletins and posters yes but not any newspaper br br perhaps strangest of all though this is set in a small town in br br kansas yet for some reason or other yancy cravat is dead set on br br calling his paper the oklahoma wig br br really good westerns have always been very few and far between the only exceptions being clint eastwood's so called spaghetti westerns of the late '60s to early '70s cliche westerns on the other hand are a dime a dozen br br if you like cliche westerns cimarron will do you proud but as for me it did me embarrassment br br
<START> i was so disappointed in this movie i am very familiar with the case having read not only mark book but also the far superior a wealth of evil the true story of the murder of martha in america's richest community by timothy dumas anyone who watches murder in greenwich should be aware they're watching the mark story not the martha story this film is nothing more than an ego trip for just watch his character strut around as if he is the second coming yes even being by women the actors playing the kids look way too old for their roles and the flashbacks to the 1970s are totally unconvincing if there is any hero to this story it's martha's family her mother dorothy and brother john they kept this case alive for two decades before walked into it in order to make a name for himself they and martha deserve to have the true story told
<START> this is one of the funniest movies i've seen in ages i watched for about 20 minutes slightly puzzled by what was going on then i started to laugh and didn't stop 'til long after the movie ended such deadpan satire is rare indeed christopher guest has a true eye for the humor inherent in those who have no sense of humor about themselves about 90 of white heterosexual males to start with as in waiting for guffman guest nails middle america's idiotic self importance to the wall i can hardly wait for his next film
<START> this movie was the biggest piece of garbage i've seen in a long time br br it's marketed as as sci fi when in fact it's nothing more than a christian recruiting tool br br it tells you quite a bit about the state of the christian church when they have to resort to deception just to get you to listen to their sales pitch but then again what do you expect from an organization that would go through such great lengths to help protect such an enormous amount of child in their organization br br religion is full of nothing but sexual deviants hypocrites and war mongers let's not forget our bumbling former president actually came out and said that god told him to invade iraq and nobody questioned if he was hearing voices or seeing things br br anyway going of the subject here no this movie has nothing to do with ufos whatsoever it's nothing more than a religious production
<START> this movie was just plain bad i can forgive low budget films for being low budget but it wasn't funny it wasn't smart it had no redeeming qualities at all unless you really like looking at fake boobs i don't know what this genre is classified as possibly erotic horror but if so well it's neither sexy nor scary tying it into the slumber party massacre movies was useless i'd never seen the previous movies myself and except for one scene that attempted to tie it together i had no way of knowing who the escaped psycho killer in was or why they were bothering with including him especially because and i don't think i'm revealing anything here it was really obvious that the cheerleader killer in this film wasn't him as for the actual murderer all i can say is lame really lame when you find out why the killer is offing the cheerleading squad and the coach and two stoners who happened to be on the bus trip they're taking and the bus driver just for the heck of it apparently you will sit there and go wtf worst excuse for a murdering spree ever the actors two guesses why i added the quotes generally looked like low budget porn rejects which they most likely were those poor people trying to break into legitimate film one of my friends had this to say about the actor who played buzzy the bus driver he looks like the guy who you know gets really into it and his face gets all red and stuff we had a good at that half of the other actors had all the skill and subtlety of the actors in the sixth grade production of annie i just saw the other half pretty much seemed bored to death especially in the deleted scene this one redhead and by ten minutes into this movie i was too br br a note the dvd contains one deleted scene which would've put the movie from r rated to nc 17 if it had been left in it was entirely gratuitous and as adult entertainment goes of no quality whatsoever the only reason to bother with it is to laugh a lot at the badness
<START> the commercials for rat race made it look too juvenile for me to enjoy but since my boyfriend adores this movie and the soundtrack i finally relented and watched it with him tonight i make him watch david lynch films and all sorts of obscure indie stuff i recently forced urbania on him so i felt i owed him an innocuous hollywood product br br i didn't want to hurt his feelings so i saved my bitching for yeah rat race has its moments but a great deal of it irritated me let's start at the beginning rat race was marketed as a family film so i was a little surprised to discover that the first scene centered around a porno movie i can hear it now mommy what does afro whores mean this scene has no purpose in this movie other than to cram some naughtiness into a pg 13 movie br br and while we're still on the segments in the casino it's pretty convenient that all the characters happened to play within the same time frame the slots that held the gold coins what would have happened if they didn't would those millionaire gamblers just sit around and wait and how did they get those gold coins in the slots in the first place br br but i'm a plot point that's necessary for the movie to exist so i'll press on about whoopi and her long lost daughter they're meeting for the very first time yet throughout their whole ordeal they don't discuss with each other anything about themselves why make their relationship such a presumably complicated one couldn't they have just been say a mother and daughter on vacation together why the business concerning a long ago adoption and why portray the daughter as a hard driving career woman chained to her cell phone who never again needs contact with her business did the screenplay just forget about this subplot and character trait br br this illustrates the main weakness of this movie the characters are inconsistent and interchangeable it's exhausting when everyone is equally zany and with no identifying traits and another thing the events aren't plausible oh sure the characters can do some quirky things but the characters themselves have to be believable take the naked gun another jerry zucker movie for example frank has some pretty exaggerated moments but everything he does is in theory possible in his world jane is also funny but it's a different kind of funny which makes all the difference a character in rat race defying natural laws by leaping onto a speeding train destroys any plausibility the movie may have these clearly aren't real people so why should i care about them br br another problem i have with rat race is a moral one the characters obtain their modes of transport almost totally by theft i know i know this is just a silly comedy and the same actions didn't bother me fifteen years ago when i saw million dollar mystery but there's a lot of in rat race and it bothers me now and i won't delve into the whole airport sabotage sequence other than to wonder if the screenwriters didn't consider the real life implications of such an action was that scene funny before 9 11 br br i'll skip over the distasteful bits concerning the heart the drugging of one's family and the nazis whose buildup and payoff worked better in an episode of seinfeld and move on to complain about the acting rowan atkinson started out annoying and ended insufferable i don't know when i liked a comical character less and the three oscar winners need new agents whoopi came off best but she didn't have much to work with loved the copper perm and purple lipstick though kathy bates' part was shrill but mercifully brief cuba was oh man cuba babe please fire your agent following instinct and chill factor this is your third strike be glad i haven't seen pearl harbor or snow dogs it's time to give your '97 best supporting actor oscar back to its rightful owner edward norton for primal fear an actor of your stature has no business running half naked through the desert and being checked out by a transvestite lucille ball impersonator do you even read the scripts to your movies anymore or are you reaching into a bag and pulling your next project out at random br br there's other small points that bother me how did grisham and the hooker get to the loot so fast but basically rat race amounts to little more than your basic batch of character types being hindered by arbitrary obstacles on their way to a rather underwhelming and inexplicable ending they give the money to charity what kind of ending is that yeah it's the noble thing to do never mind the probability of cross promotion licensing whores smash mouth do they ever say no to selling out putting on a benefit concert in the middle of the new mexico desert but who would honestly do such a thing yes they say it's the journey not the destination that makes a trip worthwhile but there's no journey without a destination if there was ever an example of a wrong happy ending this would be it what a bummer end to a movie that despite my nitpicking here i did enjoy parts of i confess to enjoying the bit with the cow and some of the lucy stuff along with the character with the tongue piercing at first i thought his indecipherable speech would run me up a wall but he grew to be my favorite br br but as far as my boyfriend knows i found rat race quite funny and charming br br
<START> warning may contain spoilers let rosalina help mario lead the way and smile because this game will brighten your day br br 120 stars will require luck and skill but 60 will bring you as much of a thrill br br blasting through stars show mario and luigi and what travelers they now are br br walking upside down has never been more fun especially a final battle with near the sun br br this is truly a super awesome game and it absolutely deserves a place in nintendo's hall of fame
<START> what on earth like watching an episode of neighbours after drinking two bottles of cough medicine nightmarish and making no sense at all i was waiting for the clever part where everything fits into place and saves the film maybe it was there and i just missed it or was lost on me br br my strongest suspicion is that it is a thinly veiled attempt to market a new drug thats about to hit the streets i wouldn't say don't watch it but i will say its pretty poor on every level like am in high def whack unless you drink two bottles of cough syrup then it's just dandy
