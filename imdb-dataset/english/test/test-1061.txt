<START> i thought i had seen this film before as the plot summary sounded familiar however when i watched it one afternoon in need of some mindless but amusing entertainment i didn't recognise anything if i had seen it before i must have blocked the horror of it from my memory br br this film is dreadful and it shows its age in fact it looks older than it is more like a mid 80s moronic comedy whilst i am a fan of toilet humour and can see the funny side of many things this is comedy at its most puerile and homophobic the plot is as thin as a supermodel which wouldn't bother me if only the film were funny br br there is only one amusing line in the whole film spoken by the character louis looks like somebody threw away a perfectly good white boy in fact louis is the only likable character and that's not saying much james and carl are the type of irritating immature men that a sensible woman would run a mile from their practical jokes about as humorous as the war in iraq the character of susan wilkins is colourless looks like julia roberts but lacks her charisma and there is zero chemistry between her and carl though it may be unfair to blame the actress as i don't know what she could have done with such a poorly written part and the villain is neither funny nor scary nor memorable br br there is good trash and bad trash this is trash that definitely should not be recycled
<START> i saw teen in 1993 in doordarshan on a friday night and could scarcely believe that such a remarkable film was ever made in bollywood it was mind blowing Â a film with a modern storyline superb music three lovely ladies and my fave superstar dev anand in this unusual storyline dev falls in love with three women Â the simple the ravishing and the sophisticated simi they too are enamored with him and want to marry him this puts dev in a dilemma which is the crux of the storyline whom to marry he consults a hypnotist who asks dev to gaze into a crystal ball dev finds the answer and marries beautifully directed most probably by dev himself not by the official director the b w classic has evergreen music Â some of sd helped generously by rd burman best compositions uff hai yeh ruth is the probably the most sexiest song ever composed in hindi films credit should also be given to for penning the memorable lyrics teen is a breezy musical which completely suited the style of dev anand and he did full justice to the role unfortunately teen has never received the recognition popularity it richly deserves br br a must see for any hindi film buff i will rate the eternal favourite 9 5 out of 10
<START> it's rare to see film that strikes out in every aspect but caligula surely must hold this title i'm not sure what is more horrendous the violence the sexual perverseness the acting or the plot or severe lack thereof br br the two and a half hours basically follows the ascension of the infamous roman caesar caligula to to throne in and shows the atrocities and perverseness he supposedly committed whilst in power the acting is lifeless and dull but that's just the tip of the iceberg obviously knowing that this film was severely lacking of anything legitimately interesting the directors decided to throw in as much nudity and orgy scenes as was conceivably possible but don't be fooled these scenes don't ease or take focus away from the hideousness of this film the camera work is shoddy dialog is laughable in fact you'd have to congratulate malcolm mcdowell playing caligula for keeping a straight face through such farcical lines and then there's the violence br br if you are about to see the film be prepared some atrocities are committed in the film not just through the writing but through disgusting violent acts which are of little point or purpose other than to repulse the viewer this is only objective this movie achieved one must wonder how the makers of this film thought that bestiality necrophilia and castration just to name a few would be appealing to anyone when it belatedly ends after two and a half hours you take nothing from this film other than some disturbing images and the knowledge that you may have witnessed the worst film ever br br you've been warned
<START> meryl streep may be the greatest actor working today her portrayals never fail to astonish she seems actually to be the characters she brings to the screen in one true thing she gives life to a deceptively straightforward profoundly complex woman doing her best to play the hand life has dealt to her surviving with cancer is no easy task and not just surviving but actually continuing to live one's life is even harder and this is precisely what kate streep means to do renee zellweger jerry maguire not only holds her own in this exalted company but shines as streep's daughter who learns to see in a new light her parents' lives as well as her own streep is a powerhouse and deservedly received an oscar nomination for her work here her i'm only going to say this once dialogue with zellweger will leave you devastated zellweger though is the real revelation her face conveys every emotion every conflict as she begins to learn the many truths about her parents' strengths and weaknesses director carl franklin devil in a blue dress handles the extremely difficult story material with and delicacy
<START> chan wook park you have to hand it to the guy in my eyes he's not only a brilliant director but a brilliant director who can turn his hand to any genre and often provides something refreshing yet still ultimately satisfying br br thirst is essentially a vampire tale but one that plays fast and loose with some of the rules of the subgenre kang ho song plays father sang a man who unselfishly gives himself over to a research program and then unselfishly kind of catches the disease they are trying to cure dies and comes back all thanks to the blood he was transfused with being the only one out of five hundred to survive he becomes quite the celebrity to those who know him and all he wants is to get back to normal normal however now involves being able to leap great distances without injury wanting to drink blood and getting severely hot under the collar when rays of sun get on his skin it's not long before he's living with a rather dysfunctional family unit who knew him in his childhood and while he hides his new strange lifestyle he finds himself drawn into a complex love triangle becoming more acceptable of darker thoughts and sliding down a slippery slope that could lead him from man to beast to monster br br deftly blending a number of genres park's movie felt much fresher and more original to me than let the right one in to use a recent example and genuinely impressed me with it's approach to material that could easily have felt as well worn and rehashed as any number of other vampire movies we've seen over the years it's a mixture of horror melodrama and comedy while also pondering ideas such as strength of faith the power over life and death the downside of immortality etc etc br br some people have complained that this genre blending approach weakens the movie but i personally found that it was a lively entertaining and always enjoyable movie helped by a great central performance from song as the tortured priest and fantastic turns from a supporting cast with no weak links many characters get to move through a range of emotions and all do so with skill and believability especially the young woman played by ok vin kim who becomes the object of the priest's love lust and affection br br fans of asian cinema and park in particular and also fans of poe's the tell tale heart watch and learn should lap this up it's yet another classy movie from a man who seems to take everything in his stride and always manages to put out nothing less than solid entertainment br br see this if you like near dark aka cemetery man
<START> and i still don't know where the hell this movie is going i mean really what is this movie about is it about demonstrating sean connery's complete lack of arabic is it about showing that if he could play the role of a moroccan warlord then he was a natural to play the role of ramirez in highlander why was teddy roosevelt even in this movie why was there so much sand that was put to so little use where was there so much table slapping why did teddy ignore the japanese guy who he was shooting archery with did he realize the man was japanese why was no no credible excuse given for connery's accent at least jean claude van damme has an excuse for his french accent whether it be being raised by french nuns in hong kong double impact being raised on the bayou in louisiana universal soldier or having a french mother and being raised in indochina i cannot even remember the name of that movie can anyone explain this
<START> an absorbing exploration of virtual reality although it is not yet clear how much the director himself intended this film deliberately takes you through several layers of artificial reality leaving only subtle clues about which layer of virtual reality you are in an confusion for the viewer to ponder br br also can be seen as a satire of video games the whole movie though may fall into the fallacy of form here it seems unable to escape from the video game genre which it imitates thus the satire becomes problematic br br a number of interesting ideas throughout though the biological mutant is one the interface of technology and biology the cyborg urge to transcend reality and philosophical allusions such as the title's to along with existential questions i e the game characters are partly scripted or determined and yet partly free to alter their fate and they wonder at how strange that feels in the game one character then notes that this existential confusion is just like real life thereby erasing again the distinction between the virtual and the real likewise with the observation that it is unpleasant to stumble around in a world where you don't know what will happen next and you're not sure how to play since you have to stumble around just to find out the goal and the unknown rules a virtual game within the game is titled also a critique of how virtual violence makes us unable to feel the effects of real violence even the heroes at every level of existence find themselves confused about violence they don't like it but it is thrilling and part of the game which then they fear is real br br the game creator the god of the system is assassinated in the end yet that very scenario is played out in direct parallel to a video game we've just witnessed and the onlookers believe that it is still just part of the virtual reality in the end the film does not resolve the doubt about whether or not this is real but the point is clear to me anyway means da you are there you are thrown into a set of rules and mysteries at every level virtual reality recapitulates reality and its common game motifs express like a royal road to the unconscious our own fascination with violence br br nevertheless while cronenberg affirms these philosophical allusions in an interview about the film he claims that he is very much against the reality underground name of terrorist group portrayed in the film both in the game and in the 'real' level seems that cronenberg himself did not put that much thought into the film though his impressive education comes through the interview in cineaste gives the impression of a middle brow intellectual who's trying to be avant garde by inclination cronenberg is simply on the side of free imagination the clichÃ©d bourgeois modernist credo despite the acknowledged ambivalence there my impression here might be due to one limited interview still seems to miss the point that his film betrays the fallacy of form here imitating computer games while doing a satirical critique of them but a critique that is unable to transcend the same form probably because he actually thinks that it is imaginative and radical yet the film's imaginative world is less bearable and more jejune than our own all too real world it remains trapped in the computer game worldview
<START> this film was my first acquaintance with the talents of chris cooper i was deeply impressed with the character he played i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor he plays a union captain who along with a couple of enlisted men are foraging in eastern kentucky they happen upon the farm of a woman whose husband has chosen to go off to the confederacy br br the portrayal of eastern kentucky and its seriously divided sentiments during the war is so very accurate if you are looking for a war film with a lot of blood and guts this would not be it if you are looking for a drama that explores the psychology of peoples at war actually and philosophically then this is the best study of how divided loyalties affected the interaction of peoples in the border states during america's civil war
<START> i just saw this wonderfully filmed movie that captures the essence of br br high brow nyc or any big city of mid century america the colors the br br cars the clothes and the coming of the womens movement it reflects the br br cozy attitudes of relationships between men and women in the br br corporate world in some ways things gave changed and in others they br br haven't changed at all women still want what men have today but they br br now have all sorts of laws and equality mandates to get it for them in br br my opinion beautiful women will still throw themselves at men in br br pursuit of thier goals the laws we have now against and br br all were passed by unattractive women who wanted an equal chance to br br compete with prettier women who might be getting the positions br br based on thier looks and out the real competition isn't between br br men and women but women and women i liked the look and feel of the movie but the world hasn't changed as br br far as what real
<START> i originally saw this several years ago while i was sitting on the couch and got stuck watching it on hbo with the remote out of my reach i decided to go with it and was awaiting a miserable movie that i had been avoiding for a year so it started off and i wasn't very optimistic about it but after about ten minutes i found myself laughing the complete opposite as i was expecting the comedy was smart the acting pretty good considering the cast worked very well together and the story though slightly awkward and fake was actually quite entertaining br br three convict brothers manage to escape their sentence and eventually go in search of their fortune the movie is set in the 1930's so along the way they encounter a number of funny and interesting all have a different story or achievement they are striving for really the majority of the movie may seem random some may say it was pointless and boring but if you look for the smart comedy and occasionally stupid that is integrated into the movie i'm sure you'll enjoy this one br br i liked the performances given by george clooney john turturro and tim blake nelson all of them did very well in their roles an they worked great together but to finish this off o brother where art thou is a smart funny and a movie adventure that i wouldn't let pass up
<START> turkish culture is complete with lots of different cultures different cultures have different styles of music istanbul is like the mixture of turkey it has mostly the same language but different dialects this documentary shows us these different kinds of music with different dialects and different instruments you can watch with singers and groups their performances their daily life and learn their thoughts of music the movie includes not only the music of istanbul but the life in istanbul how people communicate and what they eat and drink the surprising part is although i live in istanbul i learned lots of things from this movie
<START> asia argento has never done a film so far as i know and this includes ones directed by her own father dario where she fails to show all of her anatomy at some point sure enough in the most boring opening dialogue scene ever poor madsen has her coming into his office and right there reminding us that even though her hair is up she can still stick her fingers in her crotch at any given second which she does but in such a random what am i really seeing that kind of way the dvd box packaging makes this look like a femme fatale film so you keep waiting to see her turn into a sleek and minimalist killer no such luck she's verbose hung up on some aging has been and even worse has no credible skills in physical agility other than surprise taking off all the clothes when any scene allows it her accented english would be cool if only she didn't try to make it sound so affected and try to talk like a 12 year old how about this plot weak minded but simultaneously nymphomaniacal woman is suddenly driven to kill while she already has another affair on the go and is running some cheap drug deal huh what does anyone have motivation in this movie to do anything other than buy a hamster the screenplay seems to be oriented by letting everyone talk a lot about the same things over and over i was expecting to see the worst acting on this appear as a producer who dumped money in it just to have some screen time there is nothing going on sub the obvious flaws of asia's character that at any point in the movie delivers what the dvd cover promises she's weak but she knows how to kill she a lot she naked she half dressed she even in a dead woman's clothing she is very floppy and unmotivated in fact floppy would have been a great name for this movie and a shot of asia passed out looking angry on the cover would have been a better representation there are actually shots of her eating airplane food what's that about br br the ending makes 0 sense everyone is just annoyingly wishy washy in their intent and their execution of all objectives the wife of lester doesn't deliver any real vengeance taking someone to bad is life threatening but not really valid and lester just floats around without really making much of anything totally misleading key art yeah we know asia lost the baby fat of her first born but really a whole movie trying to pretend like that's interesting enough to drive a film about a passive aggressive chick is not worth your while see point of no return instead
<START> so it has come to this in the top rated comment on this flick somebody says is an honorable man really this is a guy who mainly kills and maims people in the movie he takes a short break to rob a bank honorable how would you like your kids to go to school with the kids of someone who calls that honorable wait there's more the person also says we can tell he's constantly thinking how can we do that well do you know that joke how can you tell when a ceo politician lawyer is lying his her lips move well lips never move so i guess that means he is thinking br br of course this is existentialism to warm the hearts of the cult of victimization supposedly stresses that an individual take responsibility for the consequences of one's acts not borrow money from the yakuza what they want it back kill them the cops find out kill yourself and your wife br br really honorable
<START> i have seen this movie twice and it's theme is an invigorating one i have been into computers for many years now and this movie inspired me in a technologically sense as does a fresh love which stoked the furnace of my poetic passion in the heat of infatuation very original idea great allurement in the way it holds you as it tells it's story to minds that need a release from the every day realities of this life
<START> friz freleng's is one of the lesser private snafu shorts a warning of the importance of studying your field manual makes it point rather clumsily the story in which technical fairy first class makes snafu into a superhuman in order to help him see the error of his ways is predictable and unfunny freleng's earlier snafu short 'rumours' had been bursting with ideas and laughs but here the director is lumbered with a rather boring topic and he struggles to make an entertaining short from it even at around three minutes long seems to drag and unlike the best cartoons in the series it feels like an instructional film first and entertainment second though they were knocked out more quickly than the usual warner cartoons the snafu shorts largely maintained a surprisingly high standard is a reflection of the sort of quality you'd more reasonably expect from a less talent bunch of creative minds
