<START> oddly enough it's fred macmurray who plays the more screwy part in this screwball comedy carole lombard shows a fine performance combining lighter moments with and undercurrent of drama and seriousness br br as usual fred macmurray remains a mystery to me the camera is no fan of his he's not that attractive and he doesn't have the style and panache to pull off this very cary grant like role br br ralph bellamy is excellent as the kind friend coming back to life through his relationship with lombard's character one can only wonder why her character wouldn't want his gentle reassuring love instead of the almost certain doom of macmurray's ineptness but that's hollywood br br the picture almost works but misses the mark primarily due to macmurray's performance it would've been lovely to see grant or even clark gable in his role lombard and bellamy are largely believable and likable macmurray is stiff and makes you want to keep him at arm's length
<START> you can take the crook out of the joint but it seems exceedingly more difficult to take the joint out of the crook we've seen this kind of character in this kind of situation before and since in movies like bob le elevator to the gallows pas au the anderson tapes etc too many times to mention what helps make this one one of the more notable is of course the heist itself which plays out in real time and the demeanor of the lead bogart would think twice before crossing this guy the ironic ending is perfectly suited to this story it almost demands it all around one of the better films noir
<START> this movie shocked me it was so realistic and the story was incredible touching they talk german and russian which makes it more believable and real this is a must see movie the actors are great too really a good piece of work the plot takes place within a german troop in wwii they have to go to stalingrad sovjet to fight against the armies you get more connected with every soldier in this group and follow them through all the perils as they get captured within stalingrad they get face to face meetings with death blood grief and the coldness of russia this is a must see movie and you cant afford not to see it
<START> i was surprised by how great black snake moan turned out to be being a fan of christina ricci and samuel l jackson id figure id give this a try well when this was over i was just left stunned by how great this film truly was i mean everything was dead on great and very accurate for that matter this film shows how the great director and writer craig brewer who made hustle flow another great film can just take anything even something that seems and make it into this well i like how it is just a good time like its a film that just makes it there own in a good way also i love that it doesn't show big of the south and how its been portrayed in things as the most repulsive place to be but not this film it makes very accurate and because of that very the in this was just phenomenal especially from christina ricci who deserves an oscar for this role the always great samuel l jackson and even justin timberlake did a great job as well overall almost everything is great about this and while its not everyones type of film its definitely worth a viewing from anyone who can enjoy a good time three cheers for black snake moan br br 9 3 out of 10 stars
<START> motivations of the characters was completely unbelievable many times throughout the movie you find yourself thinking that the characters' actions were totally illogical making it impossible to identify with the characters possibly the writing direction were completely out of sync making the movie painful to sit through i wanted my money back from the video store
<START> this movie is available as a special bonus feature on the double disc of horror 101 horror 102 endgame it has nothing to do with those movies except it does show that producers directors and are in a rut like those other movies this one features young people who go to a building where they get trapped inside and run down the hallways a lot while they get picked off one by one in the end one or more characters are revealed to have another identity this is by far the worst of the three br br here people are invited to a halloween night only opening of the museum of the dead the museum doesn't have very many exhibits and they're all sort of ancient central american related there are also flesh eating infection spreading zombies in the museum as well as an ancient cannibal warrior and two female warriors br br the movie is very repetitious it kills people off fairly quickly to the point you wonder who they're going to have left to kill off at which point some more people show up without explanation so that they can be killed br br amazingly one of the characters does have a cellphone and is actually able to call the police who actually take it seriously and show up at the museum when one tries to pick the lock to get in the other tells him that would be forced entry if you've got people trapped in a building who are injured i think that's irrelevant the cops are also stupid in that when they shoot a zombie in the head it goes down but then they shoot other zombies in the chest and they don't go down they happen to shoot another zombie in the head and it goes down they continue to shoot the rest of the zombies in the chest stupid br br the opening credits and a nightmare sequence are done in a sort of animation effect over video a poor man's waking life sort of thing but not so cartoonish it is sort of interesting however parts of some of the attacks are done the same way so there's no logic to it br br dreadful
<START> it'll be a blue christmas indeed if you subject you're family to this i loved the original movie and this one was not worthy of being its sequel actually for all intents and purposes it is not its sequel only one character from the original cast returns granted that character happened to be the hilarious cousin eddie but he simply is not hilarious being the protagonist of a movie his niche is that of the wacky relative who performs zany antics alongside chevy chase chevy chase was needed in this film for it to be a success and he definitely was not there as far as i am concerned a movie is not a vacation movie unless good ole' clark griswold is at the helm
<START> this movie features several well known actors which i usually like so i had at least modest expectations when i rented this on dvd i was highly disappointed in fact i walked off for some snacks somewhere during the last half hour and somehow i ended up in the kitchen rather then going back to the tv the actor performances where poor pretty much all across the board and none of the atmospheres in the movie felt very convincing virtually all scenes had that just a movie feeling to them i just sat there waiting to hear the director calling cut followed by the crew having a little chat about the scene before moving on to the next br br since the movie is about gangsters most characters are tough and mob like the problem here is just that this whole bad boy attitude is played out so poorly that it just feels like a joke the constant guitar drilling soundtrack really tries to emphasize this atmosphere too but when the same track is played the 18th time it just adds to the already strong feeling of the whole thing just being fake br br maybe it was just a really really bad script maybe it was just poorly executed i'm no movie critic in fact i consider it rare to see something that's really good but this was just plain bad no matter how objective and forgiving i'm trying to be not recommended not even as a rental
<START> this movie is excellent not because it does anything special or new but because it is consistently great in all of its parts no part stands out as being ground breaking or stellar but all parts are far above mediocre and that makes to me an excellent movie br br i own several copies of this movie and may acquire it on collectors dvd or blu ray someday holding off right now due to high blu ray prices and of course the face that i don't have a blu ray player but that's beside the point of this review br br it stars off sort of ordinary but quickly turns into a drama filled with tension some action strongly portrayed characters and a well though out plot which keeps you interested until the very end br br wait no it does not start out ordinary br br it starts out sort of like what a tar movie wishes it could be with an awesome scene where an attempt to buy coffee and a donuts goes very very wrong br br by the end of the movie nothing was as it seemed and a few people are dead and a few people are very rich i won't tell you who watch and enjoy overall rating 10 10 a excellent
<START> dramatic yes historically accurate not quite this movie twists the bibles details of the deluge by placing lot meeting noah during the building of the ark fascinating time travel for lot made in part by nbc being lot had not been born until years after the thats like having george bush meet with william shakepeare and whats with this guy floating around selling items to noah br br you can make a movie based on historical facts dramatic but don't twist it around placing people where they weren't especially when it comes to gods word
<START> okay so it starts very unimaginatively with a narration from the lead character justine played by laura fraser an amazing actress in her own right but it goes on to become something miraculous it has silly little things that you really shouldn't find funny but do every time there is an especially memorable moment that sees your jaw dropping to the ground the first time you watch it when the male body of jake containing female mind is trying to get used to her new anatomy i wont spoil it for you but the second time i watched it was with friends seeing their faces was brilliant it makes you cringe but laugh at the same time i am also a big fan of the music used there is a beautiful small band that appears randomly on the street or on a pathway every now and then but also some gorgeous yet unknown often the best pop songs it has the feeling of being written for an english cast by an american writer which does annoy me only a couple of times overall this film is hilarious i am a massive fan of laura fraser's now after being given his film for my birthday and expect that even though some of the cast are little known to most you too will enjoy every bit of it
<START> like another ticket buyer i saw a nice cute poster about this film it's five star review and awards won thought what the heck let's by a ticket for myself and my two sons bad idea the movie was not a family film it was gratuitous and it contained nothing worth watching
<START> well this stripped my nerves raw they got that right i first rented this movie back in the 80's when my friend opened a video store that carried every rare movie he could find he also carried all the shock horror and exploitation movies he could dig up and i went through almost of all them previously i had seen blood feast and 2000 maniacs and the wizard of gore they were gruesome especially for the time period and the wizard of gore got pretty nasty the gore gore girls however was the one i remember as being the most disgustingly gory br br i rented it on dvd a little while ago because i wanted to hear the commentary and thought it might have some cool dancing and clothes i forgot that it was made in the early 70's so fashion had kind of gone downhill by then i also realized this was a movie i didn't really need to see more than once it had amusing parts but it was much more disgusting than i remembered i'm very jaded to movie gore but a couple of times i just got too grossed out and had to look away this wasn't a good choice of movie to put on dvd all crisp and cleaned up with better sound and picture quality the commentary is amusing in parts and interesting i think hg said the budget was 00 maybe hg lewis wasn't feeling well that day but he sounded tired overall and also had the nerve to get offended when the interviewer from something wild compared him to ed wood jr sorry pal but you're not exactly martin scorsese yourself br br the extremely thin plot is about a series of murders of topless go go dancers in strip clubs a cute reporter and a really unattractive private detective team up sort of he can't seem to stand her to try to solve the crimes henny youngman owns a strip club a bunch of really ugly murders happen br br i'm going to apologize in advance because i don't want to sound like i need to lighten up but this movie was so misogynistic it p ed me off more than company of men mainly because the main character's and the director's extreme dislike for females and the audience just oozes from every frame it's not just the murders the highly unattractive detective goes out of his way to treat the female reporter like dog dirt at every opportunity for no apparent reason he's not exactly a threat to george clooney like i said and she still follows him around like a puppy she faints upon seeing a horribly mutilated body and he looks distastefully at her then pours cold soda from a can onto her face to wake her up later he calls the police to report the crime no no hurry she just seems to have lost face this guy is the hero you can imagine how the other characters feel about women i could go on and on but you get the idea please note that i am making this movie sound much more politically correct and much more fun than it actually is br br most of the cast are the type of actors you pray will never take their clothes off not too easy on the eyes so don't watch the movie just to see the nudity unless you're not too picky the go go dancers all look like they desperately want to have the scene end so they can get their 10 or whatever the going rate hg paid them was and get their drug fix ok it's not quite that bad there was one dancer that looked like she might have been a pro and also one other cool dancer with a huge afro that didn't look as miserable as the rest but still not too thrilled the only slightly entertaining things were a couple moments of brief unintentional humor such as when a policemen in charge at a murder scene angrily yells get outta here before i have you all arrested not to a bunch of reporters but to some other policeman calmly going about their work they mutter and stroll off though henny youngman is kind of funny though like lewis says he said his lines so fast that they almost needed subtitles i'm sure he was trying to get the whole day over in a hurry so he could get paid and get the hell out of there though he doesn't look like he minded watching some naked chicks br br might be worth seeing just out of morbid curiosity for the era the movie was made it was probably the most gruesome thing on film at the time or if you're really big hg lewis fan and find him or low budget film making by anyone fascinating otherwise if you've seen it once you've seen it and can move on to other disgusting but much more entertaining low budget movies from the early 70's this movie doesn't even come close to say pink flamingos when it comes to the skip the popcorn factor if you've never seen an hg lewis movie i recommend you try blood feast first instead you'll have a much better time br br
<START> you know the old saw about a train wreck the one about how you can't look away this movie isn't that good the only reason you're still there is because you brought your kids and you can't leave them alone in the theater you might catch a nap br br tim hill should never work in film again after delivering this awful piece of junk he manages to take a decent comic actor in jason lee and turn him into a robotic unsure actor in this production br br i didn't have much hope for this movie in the first place i admit if it weren't basically the only family film i could take my son to around christmas my wife and i wouldn't have gone god i wish we could go back in time and stop ourselves i leaned over to my wife about 10 minutes in to tell her what a stinker i thought it was but she beat me to the punch br br i'm not kidding it's putrid only david terrific as usual work saves this review from being only 1 star br br the story is cloying insulting and stupid as might be expected for a movie in this genre although the recent curious george was blissfully intelligent and enjoyable the acting is mostly poor the decision to update the chipmunks songs for today's audience was inadvisable at best and boneheaded at worst it does not work br br the chipmunks of old were clever mischievous and sly these chipmunks are dumb somewhat mean spirited obnoxious and in a surprise needy to the point of uselessness br br either as a retrospect a tribute or as a completely new production this film totally fails the final straw my son couldn't wait to leave spend your money renting curious george instead
<START> i must admit i did enjoy the earlier episodes but probably because i was younger and stupid at the time i was sorta excited about the return of family guy until i saw the new crap they were putting out no surprise it was exactly like the old crap all the lame jokes were there including the flash backs except this time they added a joke about a old creepy pedophile who seems to be in every single episode this is just one of the annoying gags family guy lives off of and for some reason people keep watching its no longer funny its just annoying let it die br br maybe family guy was funny at a point in time and the cheap laughs and gags were original and fresh but now its just not funny anymore if you actually do find family guy funny than you must be retarded or borderline retarded
