<START> the cure is a very touching and poignant drama the film focuses on two neighborhood boys who become good friends one of the boys has aids the boys become good friends despite erik's at first the film shows the boys journey to discover the cure which is in ohio according to the national examiner and how it affects their relationship the acting is wonderful i have never seen annabella sciorra do better and the movie is just plain touching i couldn't stop crying with the shoe scene this is a good tearjerker keep the kleenex nearby 8 10
<START> it's initial premise is based on the american civil war but it's ultimately a love story we start at the beginning of the war where the main characters kidman law are obviously aware of each other and there's an obvious attraction they have a passionate kiss on the day he leaves for the war the main thrust of this film is for law's character to return to kidman's and his struggles to achieve that and her struggles to survive until he returns the reason it fails to convince is that we don't see enough of this relationship before law's character leaves for battle it's difficult to believe the premise that 2 people yearn for each other so much given they've had so little contact everything else is just about fine renee zellweger and her incumbent father and his entourage are lovely additions as is the threat from the gang chasing sure it's a long film but it does hold the interest and the cinematography is great an honourable attempt that doesn't quite make it but worth a watch nonetheless
<START> wow i'd hate to sound opinionated but anyone that rated this movie any higher than i just have must have an i q that reaches unimaginably low depths which reach out beyond time and space and connect at planet hopper is a retard for making this movie wow this movie stank fred ward's haircut looks i actually considered mailing fred ward some money in compensation for that miserable haircut he owned in this awful film jodie foster of course didn't have much to work with but still manages a terrible performance throughout joe pesci oh my joe pesci who mysteriously is not cast plays the ultimate stereotypical joe pesci movie character complete with mob killing and constant use of the f word you won't believe your eyes dean stockwell watching him in this mess made me feel bad for him because i actually thought he was either intoxicated or temporarily retarded throughout the course of the film jon turturro must have been intoxicated himself when he agreed to be in this along with vincent price bob dylan and charlie sheen i know what you're thinking great cast i know and it was the worst great cast film i've ever seen dennis hopper directs and stars and does equally bad in both areas how the man could have directed easy rider and then this is far beyond my excellent imagination his outrageously bad hit man character accent is beyond the realms of horrendous and only is equaled by the hilariously bad ending they hopper and foster are the most uninteresting couple i believe that i have ever come across in my exposure to the world of cinema and you will be cheering for them to lose and then be grandly maddened by the ending what exactly are the two of them wearing at that action filled conclusion i don't know but i do know that if i ever meet dennis hopper i will make immensely make fun of him for being responsible for this waste of celluloid join me ian
<START> pretty darn good for a french film i have not seen any of catherine previous films and so have no opinions about this compared to her previous work french cinema usually sticks to the ultimately arty films and leaves the shoot em ups and star vehicles to hollywood that is probably a good business strategy as no other nation's film industry will likely have the resources to compete on those sorts of projects films about film making are often a bore as it has little resonance for people not in the business but this one held my interest much more than i thought it would in spite of the title oddly in english it really isn't much of a comedy in spite of a few droll moments i've only seen a few of anne films but she shows a generous amount of talent and range from the action psychological drama of la femme nikita to the wry comedy of innocent blood this film also extends her range as she plays a more or less ordinary woman yet is still compelling on the screen kudos also to mesquida with whom i was unfamiliar she plays a very inexpressive actress for most of the film whose talent is drawn out at the end if you don't have to have car chases and explosions to be entertained check this one out
<START> los angeles physician tom reed vincent ventresca survives a tragic auto accident but ends up going to prison in the high desert of california when his time is up he lands in a small wind swept town named purgatory flats his first stop is a bar where he quickly slams a beer and gets hired as a bartender so much for ex cons having a tough time finding work this is the first in a long line of absurdities that make up the plot of writer director harris silly attempt at modern desert set film noir br br his first night on the job tom meets a sexy femme fatal named sunny alexandra holden who hangs out with a family of bad boys the consisting of uncle dean gregg henry and his two nephews the drug addicted owen kevin alejandro who is sunny's husband and awol soldier randy 90210 s brian austin greer after his shift is finished there's a shooting and dr tom just happens to be nearby he agrees to treat one of the wounded and most importantly not tell the cops i'm not sure that's a good move for a guy fresh out of the pen but this script co written by diane fine has very little to do with logic br br tom makes a series of poor decisions that get him further and further entangled with the criminally inclined boys including stealing medical supplies and hopping into the sack with sunny everybody in the theater is screaming don't do it walk away but tom does it anyway br br in a classic film noir like body heat or double indemnity we root for and empathize with william hurt and fred as they get sucked into the web of bright sexy devious femme like kathleen turner and barbara stanwyck it's not their fault we'd probably be tempted by all that money or that particular dame too but dr tom's weakness seems to stem from stupidity more than circumstances sunny is sexy but not a very compelling character and there's no money to tempt him you're left wondering if he attended the same medical school as dr nick riveria from the simpsons br br the silly script would have you believe that a rural home has almost everything you need to treat a gunshot to the stomach and that one so wounded could easily hop to attention and effectively participate in a fist fight it gives us an implausible car chase with one of those the club things to the steering wheel oh that oil tanker that just exploded no one noticed that br br i wonder how such a ridiculous script ever got green lighted perhaps brian austin greer has more juice than i gave him credit for it's obvious that he took the relatively small role of randy a hot headed murder to show producers that he had more acting range than he displayed on 90210 br br it's also sort of sad to see nicholas turturro playing a stereotypical hispanic drug dealer he deserves better than this br br if you have an iq over 50 purgatory flats will have you shaking your head in disbelief i'll give it 3 stars for the unintentional laughs and the scenes with the sexy miss holden running around in her red panties
<START> sophisticated sex comedies are always difficult to pull off look at the films of blake edwards who is arguably the master of the genre and you will find just as many misses as hits for if a film of this nature ever fails to work it can never fall back on the tried and true toilet humor of a teen sex comedy i e american pie or warm the audience with the sentimentality of a romantic comedy i e julia roberts' entire career it can only maintain a push to the end and hope that the audience can appreciate the almost required irony of it's resolution br br written by husband wife team wally and maya forbes seeing other people opens with engaged couple ed alice jay mohr julianne nicholson only seconds away from rear ending the car in front of them as the frame freezes we unexpectedly hear the thoughts and fears of both characters from here on out we welcome that the story about to unfold will enjoy a point of view from both sexes br br two months shy of their vows ed alice already look and act like an old married couple in an early bathroom scene their actions alone show us just how comfortable they are with each other and how long they have been together so when the line to propel the plot forward is uttered expectedly from the least likely of the two it is as if the very relationship itself is calling for a change even if it means it's own destruction br br once all the ground rules are set ed can not sleep with her mother or for that matter salma hayek the two head off in their separate directions in the hope of finding some meaningless sex to strengthen their relationship at first everything seems to go as planned as their daily trysts only help to fire up the passion between them but predictably as the deeper emotions of regret and jealousy begin to emerge they soon find themselves growing apart and on the verge of breaking up all of these actions leading to a resolution you may or may not like depending on your own degree of cynicism br br for a comedy like this you need a solid cast with supporting characters just as strong as the leads and director does not disappoint here he has cast two of my favorite actresses as sisters julianne nicholson lauren graham and allows them to play to their strengths for nicholson who has always reminded me of a young shirley maclaine she brings an air of naivete and vulnerability to alice even when her actions seems less than so and as for graham an actress who has proven she could outperform an entire howard hawks ensemble she steals every scene she is in with an edgy no bs persona br br as for the guys jay mohr is serviceable here as is josh charles malcolm in the middle 's byron cranston has to be applauded for taking on a british accent and letting it all hang out but the real treat here is andy richter and his sub plot involving single mother helen slater while his scenes almost seem to belong in another movie they are by far the funniest and his dead panned delivery steals the show br br for an independent production seeing other people has a more personal and introspective feeling something that would be noticeable absent from a big hollywood film of this kind not to mention that this film also has some genuinely funny moments unlike say most hollywood comedies in general br br rating on a 5 star system 3 1 2 stars
<START> i thought the movie started out a bit slow and disjointed for the first hour however it became more absorbing fascinating and surprising in its last two hours so while it starts out like a cheap horror film it evolves into a beautiful and wonderful fantasy film br br bridget fonda stands out as the snow queen this was her best performance and it is sad that this apparently was her last performance as she has not acted in the last 7 years she absolutely personifies both the beauty and coldness of winter br br my daughter age 14 found the film a bit frightening so if you are showing it as family entertainment please stay with your child and reassure her or him that it is just a fairy tale fantasy and not to take it too seriously br br it is really one of the best fantasy films that i have seen in a long time slightly better than eragon or any of the lord of the rings it is about as good as the golden compass
<START> the breadth height of the scale of this movie overwhelm me about a week ago i posted a commentary on the 1926 silent epic maciste in hell referring to it as staggering then i encountered the bros blood red planet wow br br it's all about the scale of the thinking behind it the bros and colleague john mcbride were thinking so big that the musings of arthur c clark stanley kubrick's 2001 a space is lucky it was released thirty two years before this sweetheart as a matter of fact kubrick had it easy with a budget actual actors and major studio backing for his little star trek ripoff and all that arthur c clarke had to do was write the damn thing what's so hard about muscling around a typewriter the brothers on the other hand had to think radical outside of the box and quickly they recruited a half dozen of their friends colleagues including a hot lookin' chick bought a bunch of colored raided old office supply dumps for every keyboard monitor and hands free phone headset they could find got everybody identical black made off with every tin in the county learned enough 3d modeling texture skinning to animate a couple of space ship fly bys spent a couple hours drumming up a script executed what is easily the most frightening space monster puppet since that horrible little monster jabba the hut carried around with him was fried by r2d2 spent literally days working with a vhs camera and an to shoot edit their film and came up winners this is the best d i y direct to home video fan movie space epic i've ever seen and in proportion to the amount of talent resources at the disposal of the filmmakers dwarfs even logans run or battlestar galactica the original series as being a chilling look at our future right down to a newscaster wearing a mis matched ill fitting 2nd hand suit as a species we are doomed br br seriously for a minute though it is a vast improvement upon such later epics as the dinosaur or alien predators which is funny since it was made before either of those masterpieces somewhere along the lines the started taking it easy on themselves this film is executed with a certain conviction that gets you to believe that you really can breathe in a vacuum wearing a dust mask and two biker squirt bottles and the scene where the alien beast consumes a miniaturized crew member made me immediately think of where i'd seen that before godzilla vs the sea monster where the giant rampaging monster crab skewers two and eats them on camera that made me cry when i was a kid br br this made me cry as an adult because here i am wasting my time trying to be some sort of critic or writer or writer critic and these guys get to have all the fun actually making a real feature length sci fi epic with lots of cool colored lights a hot chick and a talking slide projector named kal one of the flight crew even gets to wear his black space baseball cap backwards glower with his goatee like that clown from metallica is this supposed to be a joke no it is an epic statement about humanity from humanity and for humanity that deserves to be seen by anybody who has the capability to not take any of it too seriously look for it on a 2 disc box set called galaxy of terror in your favorite discount cutout dvd bins which is probably where it belongs but how many of us can say yeah they have a couple box sets of our movies for sale at best buy br br 4 10 anyone lacking in a sense of humor might want to try silent running or maybe tron but someday an alien civilization on the other side of the galaxy will intercept a transmission of this movie and decide that we actually are not to be messed with good work guys
<START> i unwittingly walked into this trap of a movie br br if i could turn back time or simply get a refund i would be happy br br it was 7 30pm and cinderella man didn't start until 10pm so i rushed into the theater to catch the movie that started at 7 and i dare say god reached out his hand or retracted it and allowed me to punish myself for my film gluttony by sitting in for this film br br it may be unfair to criticize a movie that was not targeted at my heterosexual male cohort however there is no excuse for lousy sound and video editing this movie was at most worthy of a highschool project budget and i think i've seen better in those play acting french shorts that we used to do about louis br br maybe it's because i'm canadian and this film was for the la fudge packing crew and their sympathizing dames woe was me when i realized that then entire audience save me cracked up at all the jokes and entendres i fully understood the hinted humor but i just could not relate br br this show did show me supposedly how gay men date and build relationships however even if it was their purpose of the movie i feel that the gayness was focused on too heavily the humanity seemed lacking but again maybe that was the point simply to be avant gard and to make a splash br br i guess with a low budget and poor equipment you have to make your movie as loud as possible in order to get crowds and cash return i really wish i had simply read my sheldon van instead hehe i was totally the wrong audience
<START> what a refreshing change from the pg movies that have teen girls jumping in and out of bed young high school boys counting how many girls they can hook up with kids drinking doing drugs etc etc etc carl has written so many books that are enjoyable but hardly classic literature but he has finally written something that middle school kids want to read and this movie sends a message to kids that maybe they can make a difference that maybe their voices can be heard filmed in south florida the scenery is beautiful and natural and real who cares if its predictable and a little corny so was free willy and look how well that did this is a good family movie a rare breed
<START> the first time i saw this movie it didn't seem to go anywhere when i watched it a second time though it made a lot more sense give it a chance watch it more than once there are a lot of key elements that shape the story that could be missed the first and even second time watching it the cohen brothers brilliantly weave actual happenings of the early 20th century into this story to make a believable setting and storyline the combination of clooney's leading role blends well with turturro and nelson's supporting acts john goodman's appearance in the movie is hilarious the soundtrack is great as well this movie has become a household favorite for my family 10 10 for sure
<START> i watched this movie based on the comments of a few that said that is was bad but funny but you need to be warned that this movie has the worst special effects ever produced they make 1950s science fiction movies look like works of art this is funny at times but annoying for the most part and to compound the problem with the seriously pathetic special effects is the total lack of logic that characterized a majority of the events depicted one of my favorites is where three of the characters drop hundreds of feet into a tunnel created by the and arrive to find it fully lit the have also managed to hook into the power grid very impressive but this is just one example and for what its worth the music sucks the acting sucks the two cute girls are annoying the obnoxious guy is annoying the so called handsome lead man is a geek and the black girl who fall for him is a fool her father is the worst actor i have ever seen i am not sure the brief moments of humor can possibly make up for the experience
<START> it doesn't matter whether you've experienced the plight of the elderly in america or if you're just plain clueless uncle frank and matthew give you that clue in a straight forward funny wake up and smell the roses sort of way by the end of the film it is obvious that while being totally entertained somehow you've also been educated a terrific film by a terrific up and coming talent in the movie field matthew is a name to pay attention to
<START> i watched this film with a group of nazis a french archaeologist and my ex girlfriend on a small island in the br br when the tape was started myself and my girlfriend were tied to a wooden stake at the far end of this cave like area i told her to close her eyes and no matter what happened not to open them the nazi's and the archaeologist didn't close their eyes and after a few seconds started screaming the nazi's faces melted and the head exploded br br after a few seconds the video tape popped out of the vcr and landed back in it's box and the top snapped shut myself and my girlfriend were left unharmed br br consequent to this experience the video cassette was put in a wooden crate and stored in a huge warehouse of identical wooden crates never to be see again
<START> wow what a bad film not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible the plot doesn't hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling what's that line from a famous critic she runs the emotional gamut from a to b yup that about sums it up not even good for camp value i wasn't expecting oscar material but this and gosh her friend's a ghost you'd have to have the iq of particularly stupid not to see that one coming br br this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the movie going public if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because there's nothing lower on the bright side at least it's not a full two hours long
