<START> how do you take a cast of experienced well known actors and put together such a stupid movie has the answer armored six co workers at an armored car business decide to steal a large shipment of cash themselves but just as they get to first base with their plans everything unravels quickly with a plot like this you'd think it couldn't be too bad at least for an action movie however in the first 40 minutes or more of this movie we see what appear to be 6 normal everyday kind of guys they joke they laugh have a few drinks together etc then we suddenly learn they're planning to rob their own business the hero ty columbus short is sucked into the scheme because of the cold cruel world even though he's a decorated veteran nice guy and reliable employee oh my oh my then in the last 40 minutes of the film these former regular guys nearly all turn into money crazed psychos willing to butcher each other for cash in the last scenes mike matt dillon goes on a suicidal rampage for no other reason than to kill his former friend the viewer has no hint before this ending that these men are this ruthless and bloodthirsty it's utterly unbelievable and b movie is almost too kind for this sort of cheesy plot i would say don't waste your time too bad no one gave laurence fishburne jean reno or fred ward the same advice before making this picture
<START> well if you set aside the fact that this movie features abysmal acting and if you set aside the fact that the story is muddled and wanders off in about five different directions without ever deciding which way it really wants to go and if you set aside the fact that i didn't find a single scene in this movie that was remotely interesting well if you set all that aside this is still a really terrible movie br br i take it that this is supposed to be a love story about rich guy poor girl i never really understood for a moment how this romance between kelley chris klein and samantha leelee sobieski ever got started the inexplicable romance is made worse by a complete lack of chemistry between klein and sobieski the screenplay by michael is dull to the point of stupefying how managed to write the thing without falling asleep is a miracle that he would think anyone would want to pay to see this is unbelievable br br did i mention that this is a really really terrible movie br br i'd give it a zero but the imdb doesn't provide for votes of zero so i give it a one while holding my nose
<START> it's dreadful but br br cat stevens fans are given the opportunity to see the woman who inspired the lovely song lady d'arbanville on his album mona bone before cat turned into a supporting religious zealot
<START> for sheer quality of performance and the theater of the absurd this one is hard to compare to anything else with the world melting down in the early '70s this film made perfect sense then and still resonates george scott could never be typecast
<START> the recent documentary the adventures of errol flynn is an in depth look at the ultimate hollywood hero bogart cagney wayne and the like were basically blue collar types in their screen images but flynn was an aristocrat in his style and manner the younger son out to carve out his own for a sword thunder and romance analogy that ironically he found himself trapped in if he hadn't been under contract to warner bros he would've of been perfect in the cary grant role in suspicion the good looking charmer whose 1000 watt smile blinds one to the fact that he's a predator and he could've starred with his best leading ladies sister joan fontaine that was flynn's trouble he was the ultimate screen hero until his own habits and bad timing caught up with him grant and flynn in a way are similar but flynn was the more macho of the two it is possible to see grant as captain blood but flynn in the philadelphia story mr blanding builds his dream house or monkey business or operation petticoat would've turned those roles on their collective ears because he's too damn sure on his feet and the sexual tension he would've brought naturally would've made the story lines wobbly but this wobbly biography is just a plasticized view of flynn and his era there are times when i half expected a laugh track or an audience to go ahhh at some point it doesn't go deeply into flynn's life just the screen magazine view it also doesn't delve into his struggle to be considered more than a derring doer like the cleaned up biographies of lon chaney the father not the wolfman or lenny of mice and men and buster keaton done in the '50's this is just a time killing piece of fluff
<START> i first saw this film when i was in the 8th grade and i remember that it had a profound affect on me then i saw in again about a year ago i am now 29 and it still moved me in similar ways this is a great movie that personifies the struggle of principle vs voight's character is the idealist teacher that won't give in to any racist leanings of the superintendent mr that story also personifies the struggle of how older people often resist change and more specifically cultural change often at the expense of children when these battles finally come to a boil pat conroy loses and pragmatism reigns triumphant or does it the children that he has to leave are better off for knowing him more exposed to the real world and to classical music the other teacher at the school gained respect for him and he learned much about himself a great film with a heart breaking ending i recomend that anyone who enjoyed the film to read the book the water is wide by pat conroy it will stay with you
<START> the first time i ever saw this movie was when i was four years old i remember loving it and everything about it 13 years later i am now 17 and decided to watch it about a month ago because i am taking a 1960's class in school i didn't really know what to expect since it had been 13 years since i last saw it but i was completely blown away by it the actors were amazing the music was so fun and i now find myself singing along to every song treat williams is great as berger the leader of the hippie group who always gets what he wants one way or another except for at the very end of course john savage is actually very convincing as claude the oklahoma who falls in love with sheila beverly d'angelo d'angelo is lovely as the prim and proper rich girl who eventually rebels against her upbringing and joins the hippies the other hippies are played by annie golden don and dorsey wright annie golden is just adorable as jeannie the girl who is pregnant but still as cute and innocent as a child don and dorsey wright are good as woof and hud the other two members of the group and cheryl barnes who plays fiancÃ©e has an amazing voice br br the only problem i have with this movie however is that the relationship between claude and sheila is not very convincing they are barely ever shown together and when they are they fight remember the skinny dipping scene it seems as though their relationship is very weak and by the end of the movie we are supposed to believe they are madly in love only based on the few meetings they had i also see that many people writing reviews here are upset by the pg rating this movie has i personally would raise the rating up to a pg 13 only because there is some drug use but remember in 1979 pg 13 didn't exist i don't think the nudity is bad at all it is in no way sexual in fact there isn't really any sex at all in this movie and it is only to show the childlike innocence that the group maintains in most european countries nudity isn't regarded as something bad and i don't see why it is here in the us anyways i give this movie a high rating and i'm glad it was made back then because in the insanely politically correct world of today they wouldn't even think of making it and even if they did it would be a very watered down version and i'm sure you wouldn't get the full effect br br in conclusion this is a very underrated film that is definitely worth checking out
<START> i went to see this movie today with hopes that it would involve an at least half intelligent story i was extremely disappointed as it did not the plot and the decisions by the main character were so far fetched i was hoping for a dog day afternoon type movie but instead got something totally unacceptable i actually found myself totally hoping for the hero to be knocked off and i nearly walked out of the theater on several occasions when this should have happened but didn't heist movies are to be feel good flicks and this one tried to be just that every couple of minutes during the second half of the movie i found myself saying no way without giving the whole story away it revolved around an armored car guard who was financially down and out and whose house was going into foreclosure he was invited in on a heist and accepted only to back down once the action began weak
<START> i had no idea what i was going to see when i decided to view this film and to my surprise its just an extremely well made horror film that is easily one of the best of the 1970's film is of course low budget and this is an excellent example of how the story and style of a film creates chills not special effects martin is one of the great character actors of all time and he has a rare starring role here and the film also stars martins good friend l q jones and green acres moore jones and moore helped produce this film as well tv veteran charles bateman is the star and enter the dragon beauty capri is his girlfriend capri is in a bikini at the beginning of the film and she's just gorgeous to look at film does a terrific job of staying with the story and not adding a phony feel good ending and i really liked the way the film ends great atmosphere interesting story and well directed by bernard martins performance is top notch also as he doesn't hold back at all and really throws himself into the role of doc good and underrated film
<START> we've just watched the last of the series shown on the sbs network and will miss our weekly dose of danish delight my wife and i picked up the show after the swedish show the eagle finished and it seemed by comparison to be a very poor substitute for our then favourite show on tv week by week however the show grew on me and whilst not as glossy as the swedish show and definitely grittier in terms of their investigations of everyday crimes it certainly provided a very satisfying weekly viewing meal indeed br br prior to these 2 shows i had not really been a fan of the cop genre and can't say i am now but the 2 scandinavian shows really provided us with an insight into life in those northern countries through the eyes of their special policing units
<START> jess franco makes exploitation films and he has made tons of them franco is responsible for some of the most shocking films in cinema history and god bless him for it unfortunately the diamonds of is a truly awful movie that is not up to his usual standards br br exploitation films should be judged on story sex and gore what else is there this film fails on most of those benchmarks the plot is paper thin placing a nubile young girl in the jungle among cannibals we really don't get information on why she and her father were there in the first place as expected her father is the big white chief and she becomes a goddess sitting in trees naked add fortune hunters and precious stones and you have your basic rescue the girl for greedy intentions plot line the characters are stock not adding an ounce of believability to the proceedings br br gore none or at least very little this film is often mentioned in the same vein as the classic italian cannibal movies those seeking that type of gore need to run the other way save for one cheap be heading this movie features surprisingly little blood and guts br br as best i can tell the only reason this movie exists is so katja mess and mari carmen could run around naked actually lita mari carmen does the full frontal heavy lifting while the two jungle ladies are bare chested throughout yes there are love scenes probably the most sterile franco has ever supervised the women are beautiful but nothing here to really make this movie an erotic classic either br br this movie just reeks of low budget buffoonery the sets are laughable the acting is horrid and the editing is confusing there is no real story to hold this together and not enough of a budget or effort to shock or titillate i think franco fans have come to expect more out of the master of exploitation
<START> it's not funny it's not interesting it's not well shot you don't care about the characters not one single one of them there's nothing that engages you in the narrative flow you really could care less what happens big big waste of time and talent
<START> this flick is strange but i liked it a lot its about a good girl who loves her bad boy and their messed up honeymoon he doesn't love her back and he's a mean son of a bitch he starts to love her after some really whacked stuff happens on their honeymoon i wont give it away its weird yeah but different than other movies in a good way i think i don't know what to compare it to but its a love story but has lots of funny stuff too like get to see james franco in a wig i liked the notebook a lot and it kinda felt like that because of the love story but the rest is way different nothing like that sienna miller is really good i saw this movie at a test screener because i like her a lot and her fashion i liked her in factory girl but this is a better movie than that was her and james franco look really in love in this movie and i hope they are together in real life but don't know br br see it
<START> i disagree with the imdb com synopsis that this is about a bisexual guy preparing to get married it's more about all the crap we go through self induced and because of our parents that we have to get over when we grow up like the linda poem says childhood is the barrel they throw you over the falls in this movie is much more like a narrative poem it's about life and the mistakes we make and hurt we inflict and experience over the years and how in the end it's all about love i'm not trying to be hyper sensitive or and finding and being with one special person
<START> one only has to read the cast list and credits to salivate in anticipation of this david copperfield but alas alas how so much major acting and directorial talent could have turned one of literature's richest tales into such a monumental bore is totally beyond me it's pretty to look at with lovely photography particularly the sequences but just plain dull no need to go on skip it and check out the selznick or the marvelous bbc mini series from the 1980's
