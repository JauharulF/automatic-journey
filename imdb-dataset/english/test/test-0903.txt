<START> i saw fame when it first came out it deals with the high school class of 1980 which was coincidentally my year of graduation i saw the movie in the summer between high school and college and being a performer myself it holds a special place in my heart br br the biggest criticisms of fame usually have to do with continuity and there are definitely some story lines that either are not completed or don't make sense however those problems are more than made up for by the passion and emotion of the characters and the incredible music br br i saw it again recently and was surprised that i still loved it as much as i did the first time fame is often compared to flashdance which i don't think is fair although flashdance has some great music and jennifer beals is gorgeous i think fame is vastly superior in the development of its characters and the complexity of its stories for anyone who truly loves the arts this is a must see movie
<START> i've been studying brazilian cinema since 2004 when i stumbled onto de deus city of god let me tell you something this movie is probably as good or better than city of god br br the acting cinematography and music supervision make this movie a unique experience i have not been to brazil yet but this movie presents the harsh reality that is beset before the citizens of sÃ£o paulo br br i recommend this movie if you enjoy good cinema this movie is disturbing and you may feel a bit despondent after watching it br br something you want to watch but nothing you want to go to sleep on
<START> if it is true that the movie only cost 150k to make it explains a lot but it doesn't explain why it has no real plot midway through the movie i honestly didn't care if they made it out or not i just wanted to finish the movie and go to bed the ending was really dumb and made me wish i would have just shut the movie off and gone to bed early pretty good acting considering there wasn't much to go with if you enjoy really bad movies with horrible lighting even for a cave and bad camera work even for a cave then you'll really like this movie by the way if the boy's plane crashed in 1980 when he was about 10 years old or so how could he have forgotten how to speak and built up so much anger wouldn't he have wanted to get help from the first people he had seen even if it was 14 years later
<START> that's how burt reynolds describes this film which happens to be his best ever he plays tom sharky a vice detective who's on the trail of an international mobster vittorio gassman and the man he's financing to be the next governor of georgia earl holliman in the novel by william diehl the story is more complex because the guy's running for president this is a very long movie that feels more like three hours instead of two the filming in downtown atlanta and the plaza hotel sets the mood just right for the story reynolds doesn't do much laughing in this one compared to his comedy films he's very serious here especially in the beginning of the movie because he gets for a dope bust that goes wrong at times though the movie plays more like a voyeuristic drama than a crime film with burt trying to get close to the mobster's woman only towards the end of the film does the violence get cranked up that leads to the bang bang climax just like the great jazz score in dirty harry by lalo schifrin sharky's machine features an excellent urban jazz soundtrack with many guest stars including chet baker julie london flora purim buddy de franco the manhattan transfer doc sarah vaughan and joe williams al handles the score with magic this movie has become one of the best crime dramas ever check it out br br score 8 out of 10 stars
<START> i wish they would just make a special section in the video rental stores for movies like this the section would read movies for lonely older men who like to watch young girls being naughty and wearing fetish clothes i guess dominique swain after lolita nd now this is establishing herself as the queen of the dirty old man genre
<START> unfortunately i've never seen the full version of this movie i did see the 87 minute version twice back in the 1950s even more directed than is the norm with julien duvivier this is a wonderfully out of the ordinary piece replete with sweeping tracking shots through over and into magnificently atmospheric sets beautifully lit too by photographer andrÃ© thomas black jack is nothing if not a delight reinforcing this imaginative visual style is a script that allows a roster of our favorite actors including agnes moorehead and marcel some brilliantly bizarre full blooded characterizations george sanders gives a polished performance whilst an eccentric who turns out to be a rival racketeer is admirably played by agnes moorehead also realizing the most from her role patricia roc the film was made on locations in spain in 1949
<START> this movie is about a group of four friends who wreck a car while driving they build a campfire to get though the night and wait for help to pass the time they tell each other scary stories to tell about it would ruin the movie so rent and enjoy it br br i will say it starts out a little slow but each tale get better and better this movie stars some of today's hottest actors christine taylor the brady bunch movies james marsden disturbing behavior and ron livingston office space so you can see there are big name stars just not the really big ones go rent or buy it asap this movie is awesome
<START> take a look at those faces alongside the entrance to the jail they're not the faces of hollywood extras somebody in production was really smart to take filming to oxford mississippi because you can't get that kind of authenticity from a studio backlot scope out the narrow dusty roads the frozen earth beneath and the skeletal trees just barely hanging on no wonder those faces look hard and unforgiving they're just reflecting the soil from which they spring old man lucas hernandez better fear for his life but then he springs from that same hard earth br br the movie works because it tells a good story that neither preaches nor and even has some suspense old man lucas is not very likable he's a victim and we sympathize but he's also haughty and unfriendly wisely the script refuses to sweeten him up that way we're forced to recognize the effects of racism and injustice on even the less sympathetic the script also wisely avoids dealing directly with racism since that tends to become preachy and less effective instead we're shown how easily prejudice can convict an innocent man and condemn him to a horrible death so it's through our common instinct to see justice done that the effects of racism are exposed a much more effective pathway it also makes the actions of the sheriff and the lawyer more understandable since they are otherwise part of the jim crow system br br note how the movie doesn't attack segregation it's doubtful that old man lucas would want to mix with whites anyway and there's no hint that even lawyer stevens brian wants to cross the color line except to see justice done no the possibility of reconciliation lies in the future as symbolized by the kid jarman whose head is not yet filled with notions he's not exactly friends with lucas but he has glimpsed the common humanity of being befriended after falling into the frozen creek the last line of dialogue also shows him siding with his uncle the lawyer instead of his more hidebound parents the dinner table scene is important and easily overlooked the lawyer might not join a future civil rights march but the kid might that's the movie's realistically hopeful side br br there was a bunch of racially themed movies during this brief 3 year period 1949 51 the well no way out home of the brave lost boundaries even famously detached mgm got into the mix with this little gem unfortunately the mccarthy in hollywood put an end to problem films that might not serve cold war ends even so each of these is worth catching up with not only because they're good movies but because even with the passage of 60 years and jim crow they're still relevant
<START> a ridiculous badly acted mini cooper infomercial includes cameos from pepsi dell etc br br absolutely nothing worth rescuing here particularly bad are donald sutherland the music score scene transitions etc an embarrassing production br br hey they should pay you for watching this one
<START> i'm always interested to see neglected movies that appear to have good credentials but in this case the film's neglect appears justified evidently based on some actual incidents during wwii the film just doesn't connect with the viewer for some reason that it is not quite clear to me one very likely reason is that in the print i saw on tcm anyway none of the scenes where the germans talked among themselves were given titles this interesting directorial concept to let the non german speaking viewer just guess from context what the germans are saying to each other is in my book an utter flop and helps to lock the viewer out also the way the movie begins just dropping us into a very confused situation without much setup is disorienting brian keith is pretty good here but the reputations of the great escape and stalag 17 will not be challenged by this flick
<START> once upon a time theresa russell made a few halfway decent movies so i keep hoping that one of her efforts from the past decade or two will merit a rating of at least 6 or 7 out of 10 however dark world is just the latest in a string of disappointments the first 90 minutes are very hard to watch the lines are delivered by the lead actors as if they are being read at a first rehearsal or even a casting session in which the actors are doing it for the sake of their agents but do not really want the parts for which they are perfunctorily reading the sets and props seem off somehow what kind of a police department would allow a detective to have a whole living room wall shelved full of case file holders the screen is constantly cluttered with meaningless time and which appear with no rhyme or reason now if the scriptwriter were standing here after the lights go up from a film fest screening they no doubt would crow about how all these shortcomings are really clever clues to the plot turning topsy turvy in this final five minutes well for those audience members whose only other movie experiences are tv the movie and surfer dude they might be bamboozled into nodding their heads in agreement but it is hard to believe that anyone who has seen 10 or more movies in their life and is not a close friend or relative of a dark world cast or crew member could fall for such a lame despite what the d v d box might lead you to believe this movie has about as much resemblance to sunset boulevard dead narrator device or hitchcock schizophrenic protagonist device as a drained jim beam bottle with urine has to booze
<START> the movie starts in mexico where a girl has been cursed she spits on snakes thru green jello and her friend tries all these crazy spells to lift the curse he does nothing but chant horrible language that does nothing so they decide to cross the border get on the train to make their way to l a to see his uncle to lift the curse comic hilarity ensues this movie has the same snakes over and over it has garden snakes and pythons that will never bite they all make the sound of rattlesnakes which makes no sense the whole movie has some funny lines some weak effects but most important a great ending that leaves you like wham bam what the heck just happened the whole movie is about a 1 but the ending is a 10 so by my crazy math it gets a 3 overall when blockbuster has nothing else you want grab this for mindless entertainment
<START> time has not been kind to this film from the transition days of sound from silent the plot has a gangster falling for a socialite who wants to help the down on his luck violinist she loves there are of course complications the problem with the film for me is that it hasn't aged well performances are all over the place with some emotional scenes seeming so over the top as to be laughable one late exchange where carol lombard throws someone out of her room had me howling with its sing song delivery there are other times when the film becomes static a sign of the limitations of the microphones its not a bad film its just that the technical limitations of the film get in the way of real enjoyment normally i'm forgiving but this time out i just couldn't go with the flow then again the copy i saw was absolutely horrible worth a shot in a forgiving mood and to be reminded that robert armstrong actually did more than play carl denham in king kong
<START> this movie was childish in its writing and laughable in its visual effects scenes where father is tossing in his bed and his glimpses of a native are signs of bad acting and poor imagination nothing seems to fit the story jumps from scene to scene the elementary writing leaves no fact to the imagination and leaves no room for suspense the lady doctor at one point states that she thinks the town is going to explode soon from all the crazy happenings there was in fact nothing in the movie to make that line relevant from the terrible job the movie had done i would have never known that there were any tensions in the village if you are into cheesy movies go ahead and rent this but if you want to see this done right check out exorcist the beginning
<START> one of the worst movies i've ever seen when i was trying to watch this i had flu and i was pretty open minded for any brainless entertainment unfortunately this was too much how so many totally ungifted actors can be in one movie this movie makes porn look like european art movie cast just speaks out their lines without any emotions special thanks to charlie baldwin soon to be ex wife who talks about her divorce like the rest of us talk about the weather just horrible and funny br br with lots of booze and friends this might just make it as a background entertainment and few laughs just like ed wood movies the plot is a joke and soundtrack straight from some cheeky soap opera br br hopefully nobody paid to see this movie br br
