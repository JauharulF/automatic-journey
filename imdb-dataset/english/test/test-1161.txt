<START> garden state is another of these indie type pictures that supposedly skimp on production values for the sake of giving the audience some real true to life human drama oddly enough the production is very good so are the performances by some fairly big name actors as well where the picture is lacking is in zach script which seems mostly culled from situations taken from other movies br br when you're as young as is you haven't really lived enough to use the experience as film fodder experience looks to be from watching movies then repeating the same trite clichÃ©s in his own movie in garden state he plays andrew a semi successful hollywood actor who returns to his hometown in new jersey to bury his mother who took her own life after suffering in a wheelchair for many years he appears to have no feeling about any of this he has no relationship with his father who blames him for causing his mother's paralysis in a freak accident as a six year old and has no particular despondency over losing his mother in fact he attends a party right after the burial to which he was invited by a friend of his who works as a cemetery grave digger it all smacks heavily of beautiful girls also about a guy who returns to his hometown to find himself and hang with his old friends with a little ordinary people thrown in on the side br br it's really a miracle could accomplish anything at all in his life given his father and his useless friends i'm surprised he didn't kill himself who are still living their lives as though they're still in high school partying with dumb bimbos drinking and drugging etc none of them even recognize him from his tv role as the retarded quarterback natalie portman's character the most aware person in the movie does and say things like hey i remember you from junior year these guys are such losers for them watching television would be a cultural leap forward even one friend who made millions inventing a silent has no real reason to live because his whole frame of reference is high school and partying and you don't need big money to party like a high school sophomore br br it is revealed is heavily medicated which keeps from feeling and dealing with anything really like an adult would then he meets sam natalie portman a sort of lost girl who gives pet funerals and lives with her mother like a 10 year old in a bedroom that looks like a pink doll house blown up to life size anyway they fall in love and learns to feel again the clichÃ©s come fast and furious has a long delayed heart to heart talk with his cold distancing father and tells him what it is and the name of the game in one scene and portman are in the millionaire kid's house playing touchy feely is front of a giant fireplace and the bit is so routine so standard movie schtick i swear i half expected somebody to walk up and throw a sled into the fire in another visits a doctor ron liebman to get his junk and liebman tells him in easily the worst line in the movie the body can play tricks on you i once found my ex best friend's in my wife's purse and i didn't have an erection for a year and a half obviously no licensed physician would ever say that but it's dirtbag poetry a nod from to i guess his loser friends to let them know he's still thinking of them just as the 37 joke in clerks was kevin smith's nod to his dirtbag buddies br br anyway finds true happiness and gets off the dope the story plays itself out predictably but if you're going to have a movie that's wall to wall clichÃ©s at least give it some charming performances to breathe some life into it and does he has the right sort of vacancy of casual acceptance to make his role as the zonked out andrew both real and poignant and natalie portman also of beautiful girls gives the movie a big lift with her tiny features and flickering expressions of mood she just about steals the picture as his traveling companion jean smart is surprisingly good as portman's mother and peter saarsgard though much better in shattered glass is notable as the gravedigger friend i would recommend garden state if you can't get enough storybook romance out of movies but when people start hailing it as a masterpiece they're just clueless thinks you can take the same old tired plot write in a few f ks and and slap on an acoustic rock soundtrack and that the material it doesn't
<START> i was very lucky to see this film as part of the melbourne international film festival 2005 only a few days ago i must admit that i am very partial to movies that focus on human relations and especially the ones which concentrate on the tragic side of life i also love the majority of scandinavian cinematic offerings there is often a particular deep quality in the way the story unfolds and the characters are drawn character building in this film is extraordinary in its details and its depth this is despite the fact that we do encounter quite a number of characters all with very particular personal situations and locations within their community the audience at the end of the screening was very silent and pensive i am still playing some of those scenes in my mind and i am still amazed at their power and meaningfulness
<START> let's just say that it might be the worst movie i've ever seen on the front of the box of the movie it says something about it resembling reservoir dogs i fell for it hook line and sinker this is just a warning message to anyone who might read this it's not even worth renting when you want something to laugh at
<START> this movie has everything typical horror movies lack although some things are far fetched we are dealing with quality snow man engineers the only preview i can reveal is that i cant wait for dare i say oscar winner this is a perfect date movie i advise all men for a nice romantic surprise see this movie with that special person
<START> so when bob and marion see a guy at a hotel marion believes it is her long lost brother brian but when she approaches him he appears to be someone else just with the exact same face marion manages to get his fingerprints and takes it to the police and when the identity is confirmed that it was in fact her brother brian she and bob leave for new york after tracing his whereabouts they get a hold of brian but still he doesn't know what they are talking about but all the couple really want to know is where brian has their 8 maybe 9 year old son joey and even when they see joey he doesn't know them either the plot thickens and they find themselves one day thinking that they are someone else as well experiments made out on people only to make the perfect assassins yet the question of why they would bother putting bob and marion in the same building as each other is beyond me personally gregory harrison played his 2 parts great but i have no clue what was wrong with the other actors they seemed bored and lost 3 out of 10 a little suspense yes but that's it
<START> now i myself had previously seen a few episodes of the of gentleman which i found hilarious when i brought the film i was not sure if i knew enough about the series to get it boy was i wrong this is one of the best comedy films i have seen ever and the clever acting of the makes the film it has a very good and funny plot as well as using only a few characters at any one time helps because it doesn't make it too confusing which would have wrecked the film even if you have never seen the of gentleman get this film it will make you laugh and this is a film that can be watched more then once and is an excellent film to watch with your mates it truly deserves it review a definite 10 out of 10
<START> talk about awful do not waste your time i wish i had seen the other use comments first br br i have to admit i didn't watch the whole thing it was just too horrible the worst dialogue i could go on and on but what really made it unwatchable was the direction the poor actors you can't even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action if you check the director's filmography on this site you will see why this film didn't have a chance br br this would not even be good as a made for tv flick br br ouch
<START> this review contains spoilers i didn't have any expectations about this movie i pulled it off the video store rack with the movie white noise br br first the credits for this stupid movie run about 5 minutes into it the pacing from start to finish is slooooow the main heroines don't like to wear a bra and the director appears to enjoy the jiggle effect as anna paquin descends the stairs if you like movies for boobies this one has a low level buzz factor br br second it's nice that the movie rips off elements of lovecraft and other horror genre mechanisms but in better movies there is at least some rational or consistently irrational behavior this stinker tries to establish some sense of modernity and reality but then you have situations where no one calls the police even though they've uncovered a treasure trove of potentially incriminating forensic evidence and otherworldly rituals are nicely spelled out in a comprehensive book on otherworldly rituals like on buffy i was waiting for miles to show up and give some consultation on how to slay a certain demon type of so and so br br the premise is that it is possible to open up an age of darkness where creatures that crawl on the ceiling can cut your throat or turn the meat grinder effect on you ho hum to do this you need to have a sacrificial circle and then have seven kids who must have their throat cuts by people who love them this opens the world to the age of darkness at least that's what it says in complete detail in the book of ancient occult rituals which raises the annoying question of uh well how did the ones who wrote the book know and if this is what happens would you really leave this information in a book you can take out from the library much less get it from a library in a world that is not covered already in darkness an age brought on by lunatics who could have performed this like much earlier using the occult practices to bring the world to darkness for dummies 2nd edition it turns out the father in the story is the 7th child the one that ran away from the ritual 40 years ago he was released by his father who is the doctor grandfather in the movie who wanted to try the ritual with presumably other stupid parents who just wanted to see if dumb sh t like this opening the world to darkness actually works the grandpa let the father go because he didn't really love him stupid stupid movie written by a moronic director who appears to think he's some kind of auteur there's also a scene in the movie where the kid appears with big on his face and the mother grabs him and has this total lack of reaction the whole movie is like this people seeing really weird sh t going on and not reacting to it in any sort of normal way must be bad plot and direction br br anna paquin does her best to play her character realistically without cracking a smirk and she does look smashing in a halter top but at several critical moments in the story her character doesn't bother to call in for back up you know more of the same i will walk into a likely demonic evil situation without any knowledge of defense or help from others carrying flashlights or firepower even though i sense impending doom and even dumber as it may seem even if you bring on the age of darkness these creatures who make you bloody can't attack if you have a light source but they appear as people you know and tell you to turn off the light source reminds me of the video game alone in the dark maybe this movie is a rip off of that game's concept br br the best actors in the film are the young kid and anna they both die at the end the entire family dies the darkness creatures lead them to their death but really the stupidity of the characters in the family was the main cause of death the other adults could be interchangeable with any other actors from the red shoes diaries series of fine cinema br br so to wrap up the worst things about this movie are the stupidity of the characters in bumping around blindly in an obviously abnormal situation the really crap plot there is an old architect in the story who designs a house with a sacrificial altar hidden in it the architect has suspected from the beginning there would be occult sacrifices in the house but doesn't tell anyone because well no real reason they couldn't find the kids but he didn't bother to tell authorities about the hidden rooms which he designed into the house but he does like to hang around the house for a 40 year period because he worries about what is going on inside the hackneyed use of scare mechanisms more children standing around in the dark or only showing up in photographs and blood on the wallpaper and the egotism of the director which when you see him in the dvd features describing his crap work as a new and original rendition makes you understand where the real horror of this movie lies br br is it entertaining at speed on a dvd player with the subtitles turned on it can be entertaining until your reach the end and realize the movie is crap otherwise it on the cinematic equivalent of a fatty shake the empty are horrid br br the movie gives the feeling the director must have seen the ring and wanted to attempt to create something similar in mood which in this respect the film fails miserably and so also in this respect it is my opinion that you suck at what you do
<START> 1st watched 10 28 2007 8 out of 10 dir jesus simple sweet story of a homeless couple and their daily adventures surviving in the everyday world without a roof over their heads the movie starts with the woman in the story played by isabel being released from prison but we don't know what she was in for or how long she was there she runs across the anti hero of the story and her boyfriend played by sebastian as he's parking cars for change they shack up together underneath an old dilapidated building with nothing but each other's warmth and a small mattress to their possession he is a drug addict who just tries to make it from one fix to another but she has a strange obsessive attraction to him as a person which we eventually accept he also has some sort of sexually transmitted disease so sex for them is out of the question but this doesn't appear to be a problem for either of them she loves this man as he is without question and without him having to change which is a rare find anywhere she earns her keep by carrying a bucket around and washing shop windows they eat a bakery roll every day and consider it a feast isabel's character dreams of a normal life but doesn't expect it to happen and doesn't expect to fit into that role so doesn't think much of it both characters come from extremely broken homes and therefore the audience has sympathy for them despite their imperfections without giving up much of the story isabel's character continues to persevere while the man gets worse and worse in his drug obsession there is a nice melodramatic conclusion to the story that lifts it up for the masses to enjoy but overall this is a wonderful independent film about a relationship between un worldly misfits that keeps you interested until the end
<START> death machines takes a fairly decent premise for an action movie unstoppable martial arts killing machines sent out to eliminate a crime boss' opponents and turns it into an unwatchable mess i have rarely seen such a breath taking combination of tiny budget bad acting and incoherent script released as a so called movie it's easily the worst martial arts action oriented movie i've seen in years eclipsing even ninja holocaust which at least had some good energetic fight scenes br br the actual star of the movie is the white death machine it's basically his vehicle so he is featured prominently in many more scenes than his two cohorts he's in good shape and he's not bad looking but as an actor he's barely there think chuck norris in the octagon only without any energy or emotion this is obviously a deliberate choice on the part of the actor and director but you have to be arnold to pull this kind of thing off and this guy is no arnold br br the movie and the director can't seem to find the time or the budget to film the scenes that would have answered the basic questions that it originally posed like who was the shadowy figure giving the mouthed asian lady her orders how did the gang war end why did the mush mouthed asian lady decide to have her zombie assassins killed and what the heck happened that left her assistant dead and her wielding a katana like a broom stick br br it does however find the time to film a completely extraneous bar fight in which a sailor well he looked like popeye destroys a bar because the juke box didn't work it's only related to the rest of the film because in the process he also k o 's the movie's hero a bartender karate student who was a victim of the death machines first major assignment he got his hand chopped off while they were killing his teacher it follows this up with one of the most un called for love scenes between the hero and his girlfriend i have ever watched the segue makes no sense at the end of the bar fight she's grimacing over his splayed limp body and the next thing they are in a tasteful shadow montage of sex and love that looks like it came from a hallmark card btw we never see the sailor again br br and wait until you see the showdown between the homicide detective and his captain it plays as if the director and screenwriter never actually saw a movie scene placed inside a police station but had heard of them second hand and decided to include some without really knowing how they worked br br the movie is a textbook case of poor casting and community theater level actors floundering without decent direction the three death machines come across as clods the hero knows his lines but can't carry the movie given that his character is an ineffective wimp his girlfriend is a charisma vacuum and all the other minor parts are barely watchable all this makes for a fairly poor movie but the dragon lady does more to drag the movie into subterranean stinker territory than anyone or anything else she looks ridiculous her tiny inexpressive face is overpowered by her ton o hair skyscraper wig she wears her red silk dress like a and she talks with a terrible mush mouth delivery that screams needed time with a dialog coach poor lady she was obviously way out of her element and as far as i know never appeared in a film again br br add to this a low budget one synthesizer soundtrack that never shuts up and never plays anything appropriate or interesting crappy film stock and lighting fight choreography that is strictly from hunger and a general all around dreariness and lack of energy in the blocking and the stage business and you have one lame movie br br i got this as part of a 50 movie dvd compilation so it probably cost me about 50 cents to watch it it wasn't worth it feh
<START> ill tempered verbally abusive movie studio chief runs his male assistant ragged with nit picking requests keeping the young man firmly under his thumb with constant threats of unemployment after a year of office terror the working stiff finally cracks writer director george huang has possibly bit off more than he can chew here his swimming with sharks isn't a diatribe against hollywood nor is it a tribute to the hard working underling instead it's stunt film making with a twist a one trick pony with tunnel vision the surroundings don't look or feel like tinsel town perhaps due to a limited budget and we never get a sense of this stressful environment as a movie making entity it could be a office in the valley for all we know lead kevin spacey who also served as one of the film's producers gives a controlled and focused performance as the power mad mogul whose ego is out of control he does good work and yet the character doesn't ring true we learn so little about him and his acquaintances that his important position and high ranking status fail to jibe with what we do see who does this man answer to what drives him beyond humiliating others for sport what projects is he juggling aside from the one script we see passed around the film is so emotionally stunted and underpopulated it begins to seem like a stage play padded out for the big screen and yet one without enough characters or motivations in it perhaps huang wanted to keep things simple but instead his movie looks like a half baked project which needed a lot more insight humor and atmosphere from
<START> yes i realize that half a dozen other reviewers have called this movie copying amadeus but it cannot be said enough scenes seemed to have been lifted directly from milos forman's script with only superficial changes you can expect to see br br the maestro's arrogant scene i am the voice of god everything else is meaningless br br the maestro making fun of the mediocre composer's work complete with raspberries simulated flatulence just like in amadeus br br the mediocre composer's dialogue with god why do you instill me with music but deny me the ability to compose br br the musical from the deathbed scene common time begin with the violins cough cough br br and the list goes on br br the problem is even worse not only were these scenes shamelessly copied they weren't even done very well jeepers if you're going to rip off an original at least you should try to improve upon it in your own creative way br br no wait there's something even worse than that it's the fact that the director tried to beat the story of mozart into the story of beethoven folks beethoven was not a crass vulgar slob the way this movie portrays him furthermore beethoven was not a babbling idiot who takes pointers from his copyist a 23 year old music student unfortunately films like this are responsible for butchering history br br and another thing beethoven in real life never called it the moonlight sonata the way he does in the movie that name was given by a confused critic some years after beethoven died and unfortunately it stuck but beethoven's original title was quasi una fantasia br br and another thing when beethoven in the movie yells b flat b flat b flat and hits the note on the piano he's hitting a white key br br and another beethoven in real life was completely deaf for several years before the composition of his 9th symphony this movie shows him as having barely a minor disability saying what every other line just enough to be annoying br br the american accents oh never mind just never mind i've wasted enough time on this already go see amadeus again then if you want to see an interesting biopic on the life of beethoven see immortal beloved which takes poetic liberties but at least they're interesting ideas lastly if you want to see something on the lighter side check out impromptu a film about chopin but aside from those three i've never seen a good homage to a classical composer
<START> there's only 2 reasons i watch this show i invested the time already in previous episodes and col for all you supposed sci fi fans out there who love the new bsg give me a break go read some classic sci fi novels by the true greats or watch some of the milestone films and tv shows from days gone by and you'll see what hacks these bsg writers are their only gimmick is who is the fifth cylon poor writing and really truly no sense of character development if adama or tries to take power or cries again or discovers the inner father he should have been one more time ahhhhh and roslin is as annoying a character that's ever been put aboard a starship out the airlock with her i could care less if it's six more months before they conclude these wannabe writers were out of tricks in season one if you don't know that you just don't know writing
<START> if you want a complete waste of time because pulling lint out of your belly button or cleaning the wax out of your ears or your tile is your idea of a carnival thrill ride then you'll not want to miss this one br br for one thing forget the vhs cover no body in this movie looks that attractive ie the indian girl someone else commented that whoever posed for the cover is not the same girl and i agree the cover is the most exciting thing about this movie br br to put this in perspective i bought this vhs for 99 cents at k mart and three minutes no 40 seconds into the movie i knew i had been ripped off br br i finished watching it because 1 i did pay 99 cents after all and 2 there might possibly conceivably been a hair of chance some scene in this turkey was worth more than a pinched loaf br br there wasn't br br good grief fonda i know you were hard up for roles when you did this but this is beneath you
<START> to regard the film as nothing more than a documentary about skateboarding would fail to recognize several important aspects of dogtown peralta a well known skateboarding figure himself has crafted a film that not only deals with the birth of what we know today as skateboarding but also examines the socio cultural and economic circumstances in which this sport emerged and gained wide appeal in addition his film is rather personal peralta's first hand association with this cultural phenomenon serves as both the informed cinematic investigator and the involved participant subject in this role he is a quintessential participant observer while gathering together a wide array of personalities whom were integral to this movement and those who were profoundly affected by the advent of skateboarding as a competitive sport and subculture the film employs a uniquely stylistic form of film and sound editing and the narration by sean penn and interviews adopt a rather genuine unrehearsed form that is akin with the anarchic nihilistic spirit of sidewalk surfing the film exhibits the kinetic appeal of a protracted sporting music video tempered with an sensitivity to the importance of time place and circumstance
