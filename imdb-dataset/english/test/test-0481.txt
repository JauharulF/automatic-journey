<START> watching john cassavetes debut film is a strange experience even if you've seen improvisational films before br br the first thing you notice is it's roughness right off it's obvious some of the characters are screwing up their lines but then you step back from the situation as you sink deeper into these people's intimate exchanges and you ask yourself do i ever stumble over my words the answer of course is sure we all do it's unfortunate that most of the gaffes in this respect come early in the picture because by about twenty minutes you've sunk so deep in you wouldn't know it if a bomb went off behind you br br the next thing you notice or maybe you notice it hours or days after the film ends is that you never saw any substantial plot yet the themes and the poetry of the dialog and characters never leave you in fact the treatment of the role race plays in the everyday lives of these characters is always there but it's so ephemeral that even they aren't aware of how it's informing their opinions of themselves their self consciousness their perceived status or the fate of their relationships br br the title is appropriate because you get a full spectrum of blacks whites and grays and not just in the skin of the characters leila goldoni truly remarkable here is an afro american caucasian her two brothers are white and dark afro american the irony is that they exist in what is undoubtedly the hippest most tolerant atmosphere of the time beat driven upper east west manhatten and there are still conflicts within and around themselves br br i don't think i've ever seen a movie with such a subtle delivery or technique it's a lot like absorbing a really great piece of gallery art and then just nodding off in bliss as you think back to the images it evoked days later br br great mastering and extras on the criterion disc arguably the first truly experimental independent film ever made
<START> on more than one level i can relate to what happens in this movie in a very personal way and all i can say about it is that it's true what dexter's mom tells eric at the end of the story he actually did her son by taking away his sad feelings and his loneliness br br this movie emphasis a philosophy i can very well agree with we are all going to die one day sooner or later in the end it is not the amount of time we live but the fun good times happiness we have during that time it is not the quantity but the quality that counts br br i guess all other words used here would only keep you any longer from getting to see this movie if you haven't already i really would like to see it released on dvd definitely it would be added to my 'all time right away
<START> grave robber is sitting in his cell awaiting execution is visited by a monk wishing to take down his last words for posterity and as a warning to others about the horrible life he lead at first reluctant but with his tongue loosened up by drink the young grave robber is soon telling his story which is full of the dead the undead and things that go bump in the night br br new york lensed horror film filmed in part on staten island which no doubt brought the spirit of andy milligan lurking about is one of the better horror comedies to come around in a while this is an often very funny film that just spins its story out in every which way the cast is first rate dominic monaghan plays arthur blake the grave robber telling his story ron perlman is father duffy the monk taking the statement and perhaps getting too involved in the tale both men are clearly having a grand old time and it shows the rest of the cast is equally as good the music by jeff grace is excellent the effects are perfect for this sort of ghoulish silliness the film is a great deal of fun if there is any trouble with the film its that perhaps it throws its net a little wide so as the result has way too much going on i don't want to give too much away but i don't think we needed the alien body in the mix still this is a great deal of fun and its one i'm pretty sure i will revisit on the ifc in theaters where i saw it the first time and later on i'm sure i'll pick up the dvd br br worth a look
<START> jack frost 2 is probably the most cheesiest movie i have ever seen in my life the complete title of the film is jack frost 2 revenge of the mutant killer snowman horror movie fans that have a taste for campy story lines will be delighted to watch this this film was straight to video and for good reasons here's why the acting was so atrocious and so terrible that it could cause one to cry the main character had no personality and the actor's bad acting made it all worse the screenplay was was also atrocious each character always says a cheesy line and add the cheesy lines to the bad choreography then you have something bad second the story line isn't really all that impressive but since this movie was straight to video it is forgiven the director and writer could have turned the idea of a killer snowman into something cool but they didn't they story has lots of plot holes in it in the beginning a cup of coffee gets knocked into the fish tank with the melted jack frost scientists try to restore his life but they couldn't once the cup of coffee fell into the tank jack frost was completely restored now he is immune to anti freeze in jack frost part 1 the main character's dna got mixed up with the anti freeze that was used to kill jack frost since the main character is allergic to bananas jack frost is too hence here's my point they say that sam's dna combined with jack frost's but one of the scientists had some saliva on the cup so when it fell into the tank the scientists dna would have been combined with jack another thing the special effects weren't very good either here's the good points jack frost 2 has lots of blood that looks pretty realistic even though this movie is flawed to hell it is still entertaining overall jack frost 2 is an enjoyable horror movie the first one was better though 7 out of 10
<START> slasher sequel fourth slumber part massacre film concerns a group of nubile cheerleaders stranded in a mountainous cabin in the snow being offed by a deranged killer typical slasher elements for hardcore slasher fans gore wonderfully gratuitous female nudity no plot though it wears out its welcome eventually even at its short length br br original star brinke stevens makes a cameo which only seems to be there for the sake of including her in the movie
<START> this is one of my favourite films dating back to my childhood set in the remote wilderness of siberia at the turn of the century a small community is stirred when an extremely cold winter forces two tigers to come down from the mountains in search of food preying on farms in this atmosphere we are introduced to a hermit fur trapper who lives out in the wilds as he comes to the village to sell his annual catch to boris his close and rather only friend in the village who runs a store at boris' request accompanies his friend's arrogant son ivan on the hunt for the menacing tigers personalities crash and tempers flare as the older more experienced criticises amateur methods an encounter noticed also by the other members of the hunt on the second day the hunters sight their prey and give chase in a thick wood ivan wounds one of the tigers which then attacks the hapless man seeing ivan with the enraged beast fires but accidently hits ivan he kills the tiger as it flees the other hunters arrive on the scene suspicious br br back in the village the doctor works to save the wounded ivan attempts to leave the village but is confronted by friends the trapper brushes them off however and speeds off with his dog drawn sled the young villagers swear after him that they'll come for him if ivan dies which he later does but before dying explains to his father that it was an accident old boris upon learning of his close friend being run out of the village straightens out the gathering lynch mob and goes out after to find him and set things right and so the main story begins br br a simple film it raises the conflict of man and civilisation versus nature mainly struggle to survive alone out in the wilderness the winter landscape is very well filmed perhaps the strongest element in the film is the soundtrack by jimmie haskell very sentimental and evocative the main theme reminiscent of adagio other movements reflect russian styles as well as a couple of folk music type tunes br br unfortunately this film is not available to buy to my knowledge which is rather a shame the copy i own recorded off tv nearly twenty years ago is slowly deteriorating this film is a must see for those who can appreciate it if they can find it 8 10
<START> forget all those people who tell you it's not as good as the book so what this is a film after all it is a sheer joy to watch made entirely on location in gorgeous photography but with dark disturbing moments as well the only problem i have is with the obvious miscasting of nicolas cage as captain apart from that the film was a very pleasant surprise
<START> this movie was pathetically awful the sound was terrible the action was ridiculous and the effects were nauseating if you have a life don't see this movie cause you will want to kill yourself this movie totally rips off blade which is undoubtedly a really good movie or trilogy i should say br br i don't care who the actors are this movie is just horrible i watched 10 minutes of it and had to come to my computer and comment on how absolutely just bad this movie is i actually don't know why my family is still watching it oh wait yes i do they are laughing almost non stop at the stupid action dialogue and acting
<START> one of the funniest films i ever saw in the theater back in the early '70s and sadly it's only been on tv a few times since this movie should be released on video it's sellers at his sleaziest slimiest best as a crooked hospital administrator great cast great movie if anyone has a good vhs copy i'd love to buy it
<START> okay granted i am a fan of low budget horror which along with it does come the occasional piece of garbage that even the most diehard fan of campy flicks can not bare to stand witness to trancers 6 directed by jay br br first of all the trancers series started back in the mid 80s by charlie band and his empire pictures is basically the franchise that it is because of tim thomerson and his excellent portrayal of trancer hunter jack deth well low and behold due to the sinking budgets of full moon features which despite what people have said have actually brought along very high quality features such as hell asylum and dead rotting thomerson did not return for the sixth installment br br full moon writer courtney joyner returns once again and delivers another below average screenplay which features jack deth played by thomerson in flashbacks which are extremely poorly inserted he has a different hair style like every time he is shown and some laying on a table going down the line into his daughter's body well from here on out you have jo deth acting like jack but its a shame that she really doesn't give off the same screen presence as jack deth did br br the film shot on 16mm is simply put an embarrassment to the trancers name no offense to anyone at young wolf productions i mean i respect you guys for actually wanting to jump forth and do a trancers film without tim but with a little more time despite it being filmed since december of 2001 it could have been better br br however check out full moon's dvd of it which is a double feature with the original trancers and features trailers for the last 10 plus full moon features br br overall i would probably have liked the feature more if it wouldn't have the trancers name but like anything you can judge it by someone's opinion and you must check it out for yourself
<START> i see that c thomas howell has appeared in many movies since his heyday in the 80s as an accomplished young actor br br i bought this dvd because it was cheap and in part for the internet related plot and to see how much older c thomas howell is i do not recall seeing him in any movies since the 1980s br br in just a few words what a very big disappointment i give some low budget movies a chance but this one started out lame within the first 15 minutes of the movie this elusive woman is chatting with an asian guy in a they basically stimulate themselves to their own chat she then insists on meeting the participant in person she meets him has sex ties him up and then murders him in cold blood the plot then deteriorates further br br the plot is thin and flimsy and the acting is very stiff do not bother renting it much less purchasing it even if it is in the 1 dvd bin i plan to take my copy of the dvd to goodwill i am truly amazed that any of the prior reviewers here gave this movie a bad rating
<START> don't ask me why i love this movie so much maybe it came at a time in my life i desperately wanted to fit in maybe it is the amazing monster effects maybe because i enjoyed the novel cabal but it's probably because i love clive barker i think it's fair to warn you the movie and the novel have no true resolve and like me you'll probably have a wtf moment at the end at least two sequels were planned but never came about due to the fact the movie flopped for a few reasons the studio made drastic cuts to the film cutting a good 30 or so minutes out of it and they did a horrible job promoting it the adverts made it look like just another cheap slasher showing mainly the button face mask decker character this is a movie about the monsters about fantasy about a place called it's a story where the monsters are the good guys there is truly nothing else out there like it it's not a movie for everybody i suppose but it stands as one of clive's many great works sit back and be prepared to be taken to where the monsters are
<START> i give this piece of hollywood trash 1 out 10 seriously i mean i like comedy as much as the next guy i also can take just plain stupid comedy and actually sit back and laugh with it but this film had nothing to laugh at or with br br i like nearly all of the actors in this film so i thought i'd overlook what many people told me about it my fault for not listening i was just mortified at how stupid this script was just ridiculous and not even in a funny way the only funny scenes were in the previews that everyone saw in the theater when seeing other movies or on tv i was very disappointed and i really would like to know why these otherwise relatively good actors would read this script and then still sign up to be in it bad decision on their parts br br major spoiler br br okay here's my biggest question on this film if the characters are looking back on this story of jewel liv tyler after the fact then how can paul reiser have gone to a therapist remembering the past he dies in the last scene by being crushed by the dumpster can anyone answer me that major goof on the part of the film makers nobody noticed this
<START> in mississippi the former blues man lazarus samuel l jackson is in crisis missing his wife that has just left him he finds the town slut and nymphomaniac rae ricci dumped on the road nearby his little farm drugged beaten and almost dead lazarus brings her home giving medicine and nursing and nourishing her like a father keeping her chained to control her heat when her boyfriend ronnie justin timberlake is discharged from the army due to his anxiety issue he misunderstands the relationship of lazarus and rae and tries to kill him br br black snake moan is a weird tale of faith hope love and blues the gifted christina ricci has an impressive performance in the role of a young tramp abused since her childhood by her father and having had sex with the whole town where she lives it is amazing the versatility of this actress and probably this is the most mature work that i have seen christina ricci perform samuel l jackson has also a fantastic performance in the role of lazarus the soundtrack is one of the most beautiful i have ever heard in a movie with wonderful blues my vote is eight br br title brazil entre o e o inferno between the heaven and the hell
<START> that's right the painter and the main character is an exceptional person what strikes me most is the message this film might address to all of you people there and the message is sad it says that it's very difficult to do anything that's amazing or maybe even genius without having to obey the governments establishment and other of this world and even if you try you might not be able to bear it it is about the battle of a single person with a system with many systems br br a great film of this wonderful korean director please see it if you do have an opportunity
