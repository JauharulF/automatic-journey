<START> i was suckered in by the big names rob lowe mario van peebles burt reynolds and the fact that it was an independent film unbelievably slow beginning 35 minutes two dreary songs and a botched rip off i didn't care about the characters and the plot never tempted me to even pretend it could be realistic i can't believe this is what makes it to the screen i loved watching this film because it felt so good when it was over
<START> watched this months ago on netflix instant and left a review there br br let me say most of the other reviews are very accurate this movie was bad writing bad acting and bad directing i too had liked russell and pare back in the old days and was very hopeful for them in my netflix review i mentioned that i lost interest in the film and proceeded to wash the dishes and make a sandwich yet still watching the movie from the kitchen when i did return to the living room i was very confused as the last 5 minutes of the film unfolded i even rewound it to make sure i was not missing anything this film totally crapped out on how to do a twist ending i suspect that the idea sounded good maybe the script was intriguing but the budget was so non existent that sets were really lacking and yes i suppose all those bad sets were an effort to give the viewer a clue all it told me was low budget br br anyway the reason i came here was because over the weekend i saw a review of shutter island and with what the reviewers were saying or not saying lead me to believe that shutter island is the same deal only with a budget 50 to 60 times more actually i have no idea how much dark world cost but i hope they didn't spend more than 1 million br br so that being said i kinda thought that if someone reworked the script a bit got a bigger budget for a better look whether that meant a better scenic designer or better post coloring just someone with a vision they could remake dark world into a passable product now it sounds like shutter island is doing that looks like they got the vision right but the scripting could still be off money can't buy everything but it should in hollywood br br ps my 2 star rating is for russell and pare
<START> although this film has had a lot of praise i personally found it boring there are some nice sunsets and the characters are believable but the story of how they even if very unusual by our standards is not interesting enough to sustain a movie this long the central woman takes up with one man after another in a close knit way and putting the interests of her children first as the tolerance of the various men is stretched we see their characters develop the story unfolds with dignity and aided by excellent acting it is a rare glimpse into the hinterland far from the city but hardly exciting enough to keep one's eyes open for
<START> great movie about a great man thomas kretschmann is first rate as in all of his other movies i would never have envisioned him as pope john paul it speaks volumes for the casting director why do they keep casting him as german officer in the movies and he only came to universal attention after the pianist of course he looks so hot in the uniforms i know a lot of girls drool over his handsome face but this guy is a great actor and has such great potentials if you don't believe me go watch stalingrad i hope he will get a lot of excellent roles in the future with more diversity otherwise what a heartbreaking waste of great talent
<START> i have seen and enjoyed all of the chameleon movies and i must say they keep getting better better with each one bobbie phillips is fantastic and my granddaughter wants to be just like her i'm glad they brought in a brother character for bobbie kam so we can expect to see more exciting shows bobbie is beautiful sexy and sweet and independent at the same time and everything any female could desire to be
<START> not really all that much to this movie either a stunt racer or a stock car racer has a flaming car in the beginning of the movie goes to bar is approached by a biker gang who ruins his chances with a very lovely lady offer him a job he goes back to their place refuses the police ask him to accept their ya go what plays out is a very annoying little film that sees the hero not really do all that much and a biker gang that can kill and for some reason the police can not pin a crime on them i am not sure why the female biker did what she did at the end but hey it is a bad movie you always get scenes that make little sense i am still trying to figure out if i misheard it when they said the hero of the piece was a stunt car driver they may have said stock car driver because why would a stunt racer be racing and i wouldn't think it would be all that uncommon for a stunt car to crash the actors are bad and all the bikers are pretty annoying and the hero is kind of incompetent really this movie is not full of kicks but it is the pits
<START> meatballs is a classic comedy with so many laughs that it's impossible to count br br in what was merely a precursor of what was to come murray rules the screen in what can only be described as comic mastery harrison is one of the greatest comedy characters in the past 50 years sarcastic all the time smart when he has to be stern when he needs to be and caring when it suits him murray infuses with that snl glint in the eye br br the c i t's are merely in awe as they cower beneath the comic genius that is mr murray br br summer isn't summer without a viewing of meatballs one of the best comedies to ever grace the screen
<START> another oldie but goody from about the same time as out of towners is cactus flower with a great cast goldie hawn in her first film appearance pre ingrid in one of her later ones and the ever funny walter matthau the story is about a dentist who pretends to be married in order to have an excuse for not marrying his girlfriend leading to the need to come up with a fictitious wife for proof he his spinster receptionist bergman into taking the role leading to multiple comic disasters and surprising romantic turns it's in the same vein as the doris day rock hunter comedies fans of those as i am will like this movie if not don't bother
<START> produced by nott entertainment this movie is nott very good at all i sat through the first 15 minutes of the film before judging that the acting is bad the casting is bad and camera work is bad as i hear that there is a download of this film floating around on the internet it is nott even worth the bandwidth br br up until the time i wrote this review the average vote for this movie was an 8 5 which prompted me to view it and there was an average high majority of 10's for it obviously voted on by liars and shills this movie is nott for everyone or parents if you want to punish your kids with this awful film have them sit through this one for halloween
<START> a wonderfully thoughtful and involving movie that leaves an imprint well beyond it's initial liftoff based on a true story one of the many small stories prior to ww ii that lend an understanding to the mindsets of the majority of common man cultures impacted by others perceived as former enemies and perhaps future foes with the darkening of war clouds on the horizon viewed at the stony brook film festival the film was enthusiastically received well written and expertly cast the characters were most believable and drew one in to experience their trials and tribulations
<START> i've watched the movie actually several times and what i want to say about it is the only thing that made this movie high rank was the incredible performance absolutely nothing but that not even those silly model named deniz and some of these popular names at times in the movie is definitely very talented i've seen a few jobs he made and been through even though this is kind of horror movie he's doing really good job in comedy movies and also in dramas too i bet most of you all saw the movie and tv series those two would go for an example all i'm gonna say is you better watch out for the new works coming out from then you'll see keep the good work bro much love
<START> and i am afraid that i cannot imagine why it really is a genuinely dire and exceptionally boring film in some ways it is reminiscent of early science fiction when every set had been knocked up on a hollywood back lot out of whatever was lying around from the minuscule and unconvincing set snipers seem to be about ten meters away apparently made of plaster to the actors who are also apparently made of plaster with amusing stereotypes painted thinly on top to the oddly warm pool in a frozen cave to the survival of the cast uninjured when medium artillery shells burst a few meters away on open ground and finally the awful script that reads like a training manual more than a film i really cannot say how dull this is even the opportunity to see whether the young james dean survived wasn't enough to keep me watching for more than an hour this really is one to be avoided at all costs
<START> this is a fantastic film is a very old guy with a very young heart he knows how to live his live fully everyday by teaming up with his friend making pranks on just about everything even his own death while his wife can't deal with his irresponsible behavior she also knows that it's exactly why she loves her husband for almost half century i would love to hang out with this old guy because he knows how to enjoy live and never fear of death he is joyful witty mischievous and never boring brilliantly played at the age of 79 every look from his eyes and every move from his aging muscles deliver so much about the character to the audience this is a film that leaves a big smile on my face afterwards and it makes me look at my own live a little closer tomorrow i am gonna go and buy myself a mansion and have some fun if can so can i but i think i will skip the smoking part
<START> but george and gracie's are not among them the movie is fun and the pool table scene with wc fields has to be among the funniest i have ever seen but gracie and george are more irritating than comical in their roles partly from script deficiency and partly from their interpretation i gave it a 7 out of 10 for the rest of the cast wc is a treasure of comedic timing and energy in this one
<START> i saw this movie in part because of some positive comments here on imdb after wishing i had those 90 minutes of my life back i feel it's my duty to get on here myself and say please don't bother watching this movie br br i can't argue with the actors efforts they did what they could given the material but that material is dreadful the pace was deadly slow meandering and you saw everything coming about an hour away and then it took forever to happen the dialogue was boring pointless not funny at all the characters were all completely unsympathetic and the cinematography was in my opinion very low quality the clichÃ© of character uses home video machine was used to very bad effect br br yes jeri ryan is a cool person don't let that sucker you into wasting your time on this film
