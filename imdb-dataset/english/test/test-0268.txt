<START> i love this movie i think i've seen it 5 times already it was quite a success in france and they often play it on tv ok it's a thriller and there is great tension but mostly and specifically in the second part it is absolutely hilarious and very original the directing and photography are just splendid
<START> george hilton never really grabs me like franco nero or clint eastwood but this is a great outing for him basically off the django man with no name and doing a damn good job the opening sequence of this gem is a classic and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch fans of the genre will be in heaven
<START> i watched it because my friend said we could try it when my father asked if we'd watch it i didn't want to because it was such an old film how could that be good i finally did watch with that friend and my father my friend and i loved the film the songs are great the actors were cool and we were crazy about it i guess this shows even though it's from dad's time that doesn't mean it can't be a good film i bought the film not so long after seeing it on tv i put it on a lot and sang along with the songs i even watched it with my classmates on my birthday party it's a nice good and sometimes funny film br br if you don't try you can't say it's bad even if you think no i'm not going to watch a film from dad's time try the first part of the film you can always stop watching if you don't like it i really recommend it it's great
<START> the creative team of jim abrahams david zucker and jerry zucker had their roots in improvisational theatre in madison wisconsin i believe it was they had a group called fried or something similar they put a bunch of their set pieces onto celluloid fried movie' 1977 which was long irreverent sophomoric and really funny br br they followed up with the very popular airplane 1980 which really put them on the map in it they took some rather well known veteran actors in robert stack and especially leslie nielsen and putting them in prominent roles proceeded to parody every clichÃ© of every aviation film since the days of john wayne's production of the high and the mighty 1954 pockets stuffed with cash and now having been noticed the trio worked out a deal with television and the american broadcasting company tv network to do a half hour comedy spoof of the nearly countless police crime drama show that have come and gone on our television screens over the years remembering the fine job that mr leslie nielsen had turned in on airplane he was cast in the lead br br as sgt lt captain frank the rank designation switch being one of their comic bits he presided over a great series of successive puns sight gags non and overblown police crime clichÃ©s all of these strung together by some seemingly standard scripts added to this is overly dramatic opening narration voiced over information contradicting the visual printed info they always used this in giving the title of the episode titles where voice and printed titles never matched br br they had a great musical score which even though being somewhat exaggerated would have passed as theme and incidental music in a straight drama the musical score the opening titles and format of having the episodes divided into act i act ii epilogue etc were all part of obvious but affectionate ribbing of q m quinn martin productions they even had the same announcer as did the real q m 's br br one thing that this all too short of a series did not have was a technically augmented audience laughter and boy they sure didn't need any phony tract the nature of the spoof was such that it demanded the viewer's close almost undivided attention and that proved to be the ultimate reason behind police downfall br br in regards to the series cancellation an abc executive explained that the episodes called for too much attention on the part of the viewer so isn't that what one would want br br so after only 6 wonderfully wacky hilarious episodes off to the afterlife of series cancellation went police squad only to be reborn in the naked gun trilogy made for the big screen in movie houses once again they did quite well at the box office oh well tv's loss is cinema's gain thanks to you mr idiot tv exec br br the high and mighty was produced by the duke's own productions and released by warner brothers it was unavailable for quite a number of years and finally mr wayne's family made arrangements to release it to television and to video
<START> when the word presents finds its way into a title preceded by a famous name the work is usually immediately for some reason people who are capable of creating good art don't seem to be able to see it in others however i've always been willing to give the second installment of the demons trilogy a try for one thing the soundtracks are absolutely to die for most american directors would have sacrificed small animals to line up the kind of talent on the soundtrack of demons 2 for another well two words asia argento of course she was eleven when this film was made and a number of years away from her seeming decision that she would style her acting after early helen mirren steamy looks and little clothing as well lamberto bava comes from one of italy's finest dynasties in that odd horror sub genre known as giallo he's the son of mario bava who may well have invented the genre in the sixties and the original demons is an absolute must see for fans of eighties b horror films so how bad can this be right well bad the demons continue their assault on italian media as the movie opens in a modern italian high rise where many people going about their lives have their televisions on in the background they're all watching a kind of combination news report mater video of some investigative reporter types trying to get proof of the events of the first film which would seem to put the time frame of this one no more than a few days after the first film through the usual horror film extra inability to concentrate the reporters manage to bring a demon back to life and he comes through the tv screen to start the plague anew br br yeah it's that bad about the only thing good one can say about the film is that the soundtrack when you're not being buffeted about by the likes of the smiths the cult gene loves jezebel etc is stunning it comes from the keyboard of simon boswell who got his start as a part of the argento dynasty and has since gone on to score such films as lord of illusions and hackers br br makes a half decent free rental if you're planning on drinking heavily but it's certainly nowhere near the fun the original was cronenberg's wonderfully funny high rise nasty creature romp shivers aka they came from within is a whole lot better
<START> the quick and the undead is finally the first movie to actually render its own storyline null and void it is essentially one gigantic plot hole br br aside from that the acting was quite bad character motivations nonexistent or unbelievable and there wasn't a single character worth hanging our hat on the most interesting cast member who had great potential to be a dark horse protagonist got snuffed halfway through the proceedings br br what the quick and the undead does serve as is an excellent example of how to do good color timing it looked excellent when you take into account budget considerations br br unfortunately it plays out like a guy got his hands on a hundred grand and watched a few westerns most notably the good the bad and the ugly and then just threw a bunch of elements haphazardly into a movie you know they have movies where characters do this does it fit here no but who cares they do it in other movies so i should do it here br br maybe a good view for burgeoning cinematographers and first year film schoolers otherwise a must miss
<START> now i know that a lot of black humor pokes fun at typical black things like for example gold teeth but that doesn't mean that they always are funny don't be a menace is an example of this the urban movie certainly lends itself for satire the problem is that wayans and not only try satirize the typical culture they also belittle valid statements that are made in urban movies such as boyz 'n' the hood or menace ii society personally i think that the makers of this movie should get their heads away from the bowel movements of their white masters besides this the movie in itself is terrible it's absolutely not funny the jokes are racist instead of satirizing the urban movie genre the moviemakers show their views of the urban ghetto blacks now there are some other jokes in this movie but i believe this to be the main fare br br in conclusion this movie is crap and the makers should use their talents to make a constructive comedy satire movie they have examples in men with black hats which was made before this movie and friday
<START> this movie i would like to say was completely great i can see how many people would think that it's just a shocker film this isn't completely untrue but it's as much of shocker fiction as chuck books are one of my favorite movies of all time no is a certain type of crudely made movie that you can have just about any reaction to it's scary funny silly gross full of off the top material and to some people arousing the fist time i saw this it was with my friend and his mother had brought it home for him to see it he said it was just some screwed up japanese movie but i saw so much more of it it's badly made yes but it has a certain type of poignancy as to be beautiful too as the director says himself this is a shocker movie made for a certain reason its like atrophy if you leave audiences soft then the entire human race is going to be soft i think this is a good philosophy and i agree with it one hundred percent no is the type of movie that gang rapes the hell out of fitness yogurt and all of this new wave stuff
<START> whether one views him as a gallant cavalier of the plains or a glory hunting egomaniac debates about the life and military career of george armstrong custer continue down to the present day they died with their boots on presents certain facts of the custer story and has taken liberty with others br br he did in fact graduate at the bottom of his class at west point and got this overnight promotion on the battlefield to brigadier general his record leading the michigan regiment under his command was one of brilliance br br it was also true that his marriage to libby bacon was one of the great love matches of the 19th century libby and george were married for 12 years until the little big horn what's not known to today's audience is that libby survived until 1933 during that time she was the custodian of the custer legend by dint of her own iron will and force of personality her late husband became a hero because she would not allow him to be remembered in any other way br br i think raoul walsh and warner brothers missed a good opportunity to have the custer career told in flashback olivia dehavilland should have been made up the way jeanette macdonald was in maytime and be telling the story of her husband and her marriage from the point of view of nostalgia and remembrance even then the cracks in the custer legend were appearing but if done from libby's point of view they could be understood and forgiven br br sydney greenstreet gave a fine performance as general winfield scott the only problem was that scott had nothing whatsoever to do with custer he was retired and replaced by george b in late 1861 while custer was still at west point i'm not sure they ever met but greenstreet does a good characterization of the ponderous and powerful winfield scott a nice mexican war story should have been what they gave greenstreet instead for his very accurate portrayal of old fuss and feathers br br the film though is carried by one of the great romantic teams of cinema errol flynn and olivia dehavilland this was the last of eight films they did together the last scene they ever did for the cameras was libby's farewell to george as he leaves to join his regiment for what will prove to be his last campaign both their performances olivia's especially was a high point in their careers at warner brothers we know through history that custer is riding to his doom that and the fact that this was their last screen teaming give this scene such a special poignancy if your eyes don't you are made of marble br br as history they died with their boots on leaves a lot to be desired as western adventure that successfully mixes romance with the action you can't beat this film at all
<START> crash is supposed to be a film about racism in los angeles but in fact it's just a bunch of coincidences between several characters that connect each other during one day in one of the biggest cities of the world who the hell is going to believe that there are unrealistic situations one after the other on the other hand this film pretends to show racism between asians iranians latinos blacks and whites but the big error relies on a pre establish racism coming from the writer mainly because the white characters in this movie are usually portrait as people with a better social economical status than the rest of the other races iranians are poor just like the asians and latinos as always are portrait as housekeepers police officers or with a very low profile job like a jesus don't you guys think it's about time to change these stereotypes same with blacks portrait as gang members with the exception of a black tv director who was the only fresh character for me this movie sucks so hard that makes me so disappointed about the kind of cinema coming out from hollywood these days always with stereotype characters no realism whatsoever nothing to identify with it's simply a big waste because this could have been a great opportunity to show latinos koreans iranians and blacks from a different perspective
<START> heather graham married carl luke wilson and about five hundred and some days later carl is very depressed and leaves her expecting to clean the fog' in their lives faces her marriage as an important commitment to the end of her life and decides to look for carl in texas she is very supported by her brother jay casey affleck who meets her in the border of mexico there meets the confused carl and realizes that she can not change his decision while jay knows carmen patricia and starts dating her and in the end life goes on' this movie is very unpredictable having a very different story i believe it is an independent production in some parts it is a little slow and boring but there are certain dialogs that makes this movie worthwhile i liked it and my vote is seven br br title brazil atÃ© o rebels until the end' br br
<START> i have watched grand champion all the way through at least twice now i enjoyed the movie's story the characters and the actors were not bad it is refreshing to see a g rated movie this is a feel good movie the story is mostly from the view of the children the interactions between the kids and the adults makes the story interesting i recommend this movie if you are looking for a family film if you liked the little rascals you will probably enjoy this i viewed this movie on cable either on encore or showtime family this is not a movie that i would have gone to see at the theatre but i only go to the theatre for the effects of the big screen so most comedies romantic films or dramas i do not go for big screen i wait for tv cable edition get your kids together pop some popcorn and enjoy
<START> only light spoilers in here br br stealing sinatra is a half slapstick comedy about dimwit kidnappers dimwit victims and a few other side stories thrown in to eat up some time br br you will see some poor performances all around in this movie the drama is forced and the humor makes no sense whether you're watching the kidnappers threaten the victim who won't shut up or a victim's father responding to the criminal's death threat with care for some tea none of it is believable this quite comfortably fits into the wannabe movie category br br you will also be listening to a repetitive goofy music track throughout pretty much the entire movie it's quite unprofessional and adds nothing it's really just a sad attempt at making an achingly unfunny movie seem somewhat witty br br however if you're able to look past all of this and suspend a lot of disbelief you might be entertained by the adequate storyline br br i voted 4 10
<START> linda arvidson as jennie and harry as frank are enjoying a romantic tryst when in walks her father charles inslee furious he chases mr out of the house he goes to her balcony and begs her to elope ms arvidson is agreeable and goes to pack then burglar george arrives to rob the place though he doesn't get much in the way of booty thieving manages to use trunk to escape from the br br a contrived comedy note during the balcony scene goes off camera so burglar can enter the house undetected and arvidson travels very light since there appears to be nothing in her heavy trunk perhaps she just wanted to buff up beau director d w griffith robert harron and florence lawrence are illustrious extras br br a calamitous elopement 8 7 08 d w griffith george linda arvidson harry
<START> this representation of the popular children's story on film is pretty pathetic to watch i know it is one of the earliest efforts at moviemaking but this 15 minute picture is unimaginative and poorly shot the great train robbery 1903 which i also commented on is much more creative and exciting to watch br br we see little long haired jack trade a cow 2 men in a cow suit for a of beans from a merchant and later a grows from where his mom throws them in the yard i guess poor jack attained the wrong kind jack dreams of a goose actually it seems to be a chicken and golden egg and the next day climbs the stalk into heaven br br there is no effort made to be creative in this film the stalk looks like a rope with leaves on it the giant is just a tall bearded guy in a home with nothing abnormally large in comparison to jack and the climax to the film where jack makes his escape with the goose chicken and its golden egg is miserable as a stuffed dummy falls from out of in place of the giant and then the actor takes its place rising up on his feet in a exaggerated death dance like in most early films the leaf covered rope comes trailing down from above and coils neatly on the giants forehead br br watch something else
