<START> movies are something you see on saturday night and forget by sunday morning motion pictures are works of art that stick with you forever mishima falls into the latter category this is the type of thing that should win academy awards a brilliant visual peice of film that is both depressing and uplifting instead of doing a straightforward look at the life of yukio mishima director paul schrader interweaves three adaptations of the author's stories into a look at his past and final day on earth the day he tried to lead the japanese military into rebellion in the name of the emperor failing to do that he commits ritual suicide in an ending that hits you like a ton of bricks the three short story adaptations allow a look into what led him to this and are presented in an experimental way that makes them appear to be filmed stage plays ken is magnificent as mishima despite his eccentricities he comes off as very sympathetic a man who is quite willing to die for his beliefs and does this makes the ending that much more devastating and the sense of loss more meaningful of the three story adaptations temple of the golden house and runaway horses it is the last that is the strongest and most emotional it also is the story that most closely matches mood in his final years and illustrates what truly led him to the events of november 1970 this review cannot be complete without a mention of philip glass' striking musical score not since 2001 has a film score been such a perfect compliment to it's visuals paul schrader crafted one of the most beautiful movies of the 1980s or any other decade for that matter have the hankies at the ready because the ending will leave you in tears mishima a life in four chapters reminds you that sometimes film can still be an art form and as art it is brilliant
<START> 'night is about an enormous barrier designed not to keep enemies out but to keep its own people inÂ br br 'night is about a very long border fencer equipped with silent alarms and automatic firing br br 'night is about the denial of the basic human rights of life liberty and the pursuit of br br 'night is about the fear and pain that afflict so many br br 'night is about one attempt to risk a crossing through the border br br 'night is about a loving father whose only desire is to give his boys what should never have been taken away from themÂ br br 'night is about a disturbed mother who wants her babies and her husband br br 'night is about a caring husband who wants his family to be together but in a better placeÂ br br 'night is about children who want to be free to reach at anytime the br br 'night is about a hot air balloon handcrafted and built by two br br 'night is about a balloon which could go just high enough to crash or catch fire and br br 'night is about two determined men who want their family to climb into a hot air balloon and float away to br br 'night is about the fear of getting caught by an evil br br 'night is about a sensible man who can't let bad dreams stop himÂ br br 'night is about an icy policeman who wants every lookout tower on full br br with exquisite music by jerry goldsmith delbert mann's 'night makes us realize the true value of freedomÂ br br final thoughts br br there are a few moments in everyone's life certainly in public lives that can define a person br br for those of us old enough to remember the reagan presidency seeing the clips again in the wake of his death makes it seem like those events happened just yesterday or last week the voice the expressions are all so familiar but for a large percentage of people these events might as well have happened fifty years ago if not more they are part of the distant past president reagan is a name and not much more president gorbachev is another name and not much more so how can we remember these two men who had such a huge impact on their country br br reagan and gorbachev worked together to tear down the berlin wall and to steer their superpower nations away from nuclear
<START> this is truly one of the worst movies ever made and i don't mean in a so bad it's good kind of way eddie murphy is a great comic and it is a testament to how bad this movie is that it nearly killed his career the writing and direction are inept the sets and staging about as imaginative as a brady bunch episode and the acting shows just how bad a great cast can be when they have absolutely nothing to work with if it weren't for the costumes which aside from eddie murphy's ego seem to account for the major part of the budget you would swear this thing was slapped together by a bunch of high schoolers wasted on peppermint that anyone could find this travesty in any way funny or entertaining is mind boggling it's probably no coincidence that the misguided souls who are praising this stinker are barely literate but if your idea of hilarity is della reese getting her pinkie toe shot off then by all means put aside your drool cup and go rent this movie
<START> this was shown on a premium channel so i didn't realise it was made for tv even so i like some of the movies on lifetime lifestyle here in uk but this was awful the family were so cheesy love you mum love you even more honey then after they were broken into for the second time 10 mins later they were at it again love you mum big cheesy smiles etc she phones her husband and tells him not to bother coming home they were only broken into by a guy that wanted them dead have a nutter living next door who needs help she has her teenage daughter and a cat not for long to look after her br br however as a comedy i'd give it a good 7 i might even show it to my friends next time i have them round could be great fun after a bottle of vodka or 10
<START> this is quite possibly the worst sequel ever made the script is unfunny and the acting stinks the exact opposite of the original
<START> if we consider three films with a similar subject which are this one which was made in 1930 'the covered made in 1923 and made in 1950 the distance between 'the big and 'the covered is only 7 years whereas the distance between 'the big and is 20 years this is amazing because it shows how much movies evolved in those 7 years and how in the next 20 years the changes were slow to come 'the big trail is technically close to but ages apart from 'the covered the story is about the pioneers going from the missouri to the west in oregon tyrone power sr is the man leading the caravan he is a rough and mean guy john wayne is the good guy and the film makes too much of a point of his good looks not giving him a chance to be the wayne that we are used to marguerite churchill is such a proud lady that you wonder why wayne just does not forget her raoul walsh was a master at showing caravans and cattle moving through the west he directed 'the tall men' in 1955 which has a lot in common with 'the big
<START> it's schmaltzy but then what else did you expect the heroine is cinderella's younger sister complete with wicked mother sister and brother in law the hero if you can call him that is an ineffectual putz and the rival love interests are full of melodramatic villainy br br the cast settings and wardrobe were all very attractive and i thought the actors did a superb job considering how weak the material was the movie was prettily filmed and boasted a soundtrack that was carefully crafted to cue the viewer about what emotions he should be experiencing throughout mcdonough sang sweetly and provided the film with some of its best moments br br if you love danielle steel you will love this film if you love archetypal romance you will love this film i did not i was able to sit through it but it was close
<START> i walked into the movie theater with no expectations for the film i was about to witness everything is illuminated i walked out with a joy i have barely come to feel with american films the directorial debut of actor schreiber the film follows a man on his journey through the past accompanied by an eccentric group including a brake dancing barely english speaking punk from the his grandfather who believes he is blind and their crazy dog the first half of the film is funny and smart with an extremely european flavor in the usage of small but wonderful characters while the second half of the film descends into a somber story of discovery and the holocaust this little movie brings out so many emotions and so many colors with such a wonderful conclusion and is more than just a story of illumination but also of relationships and connections the acting is incredibly powerful the story mysterious and interesting and the artistic appeal of the cinematography to die for with some brilliant and absolutely touching scenes everything is illuminated managed to capture my heart
<START> i was very willing to give rendition the benefit of the doubt when it came to all the negative press i had read concerning it even about three quarters of the way through i still thought it was jumbled and a bit incoherent but otherwise a solid tale reaching its conclusion and then the bottom fell out not wanting to necessarily ruin the film for anyone but the conclusion flips everything you held to be fact about what and when things have been happening on its no particular reason whatsoever except to maybe tell the world yeah i'm cool and i know it i love a good twist i love a good ah ha moment but only when it is relevant to the story at hand the complete on the part of the filmmakers serves no purpose on the overall tale timelines didn't need to be parallel and they didn't need to be separated by a week all the revelation did was destroy any merit i was about to give director gavin hood and screenwriter kelley sane which may be a good thing because looking back it wasn't really as solid a movie as i initially was going to blindly give it credit for br br it is an admirable thing to try and get the term rendition out into the film going public's consciousness but it needed a story that delved deeper into the connotations and politics involved rather than gloss over those issues for a tale of a woman in distress over her husband's disappearance and the angst filled rebellion of a daughter against her interrogator father i understand that the bottom line film needs a human quality to grasp onto and for that reason i don't fault it for going that route my only qualm is that we don't get enough of what the title says we should be getting instead we are shown numerous plot lines all confusingly brought to the forefront before being sent back into the nether regions of our consciousness never to be returned to so much is going on that you forget what you are supposed to be caring for the wife the interrogator the cia agent the victim the senator the middle eastern daughter and her zealot boyfriend at the end i really just gave up and let the film take me where it would which ended up being someone totally different than what it first laid out br br everything that occurs happens as the result of a bomb explosion this bomb is at the center of every story thread and finally ends up being so innocuous that you can't believe how huge the waves it spread were the old butterfly wings flapping quote is in full effect because one boy's mission for revenge ends up destroying the lives of so many whether by death destruction physical and emotional abuse or career suicide no one really escapes unscathed however at the end of the day only the story about the man who has been excised to egypt for torture is really interesting we are led to believe he is unequivocally innocent from the start yet he is electrocuted etc in order to extract any information he might have when those in power include a man with no compassion or reason to stop until something is spilled whether true or not and an observer without the guts to partake or stop it the situation lends itself some intrigue as to how it could possibly end the three actors involved all are the best parts of the film and prove once more that the movie should have concerned itself with them for the entirety br br i don't want to belittle people like reese witherspoon the victim's wife or her senate employed ex played by peter sarsgaard because they actual do a good job with what they are given even meryl streep her kooky accent and alan arkin don't detract too much however it is the trio of jake gyllenhaal's cia agent interrogator and omar victim that truly shine is brilliant as the egyptian trying to stay sharp as a razor during working hours yet compassionate and worry filled as a father attempting to locate his daughter this man is brutal but he is because that is what his occupation calls for and why he is relied upon to find answers never gives a false second during the pain and suffering inflicted upon him whether he is lying or truly knows nothing about the terrorist who has been calling his cell phone we totally buy into his plight and desperately wait to see how the situation turns out as for gyllenhaal someone who seems to have one performance recycled throughout his career with varying degrees of success he finds a part that suits him the demons entering his soul throughout the ordeal he is forced to be a part of wear on his body and mind causing both ambivalence and a need to intervene the two feelings wrestle with each other until he makes a final decision and his stoic boyish demeanor suit that battle perfectly br br it is just too bad that the one plot line working never finds itself as the main focal point despite being the namesake of the film with all the clutter around the edges we as an audience get bounced around too much lulled into a sense of time and sequence and then slapped in the face as it all unravels in more of a laugh on us then a bet you didn't see that coming i felt cheated and unfortunately that is the lasting effect i have taken from the movie had it been more straightforward i might have enjoyed myself more but as is one can still take some positives from the severely flawed whole
<START> so here's a bit of background on how i came to see this movie as you probably know this is the original french film that was then remade quelle surprise by hollywood as wicker park well i avoided that movie like the plague when it was first released simply because a i knew it had absolutely nothing to do with wicker park and living in chicago i didn't see why they called it that it was filmed in canada for a start b i have a very hard time bothering with pointless remakes done purely because hollywood thinks we're too bone idle to read a few subtitles i am dreading the remake of infernal affairs by the way and c i can't stand josh hartnett 'nuff said there br br however i came across on tv the other day probably about half an hour in and i have to say initially it made no sense at all until about half an hour from the end when it started coming together by the end i was really surprised to find myself really into it and then the ending just seemed so good a perfect combination of story passion and ending with possibly one of the greatest musical choices i've ever seen heard br br since then i've heard a lot about the l'appartement vs wicker park argument and looking at i still say it has bugger all to do with chicago but there seemed something about it that i liked so when it was on again i watched it again unfortunately still missing the first chunk i've still yet to see it and i still thought it was pretty good heck even josh hartnett seemed good but i was curious about l'appartement and wanted to see what all the fuss was about so i waited and waited to catch l'appartement somewhere somehow netflix let me down so i ended up getting a copy from some website in ireland and i've just watched it br br it's really kind of weird but a good weird a classic french film great acting is an absolute gem sorry but she acts monica bellucci off the screen in every scene vincent cassel was a weird choice for the lead but by the end he works and i've seen jean philippe in a lot of movies and i just love him the scene where alice dumps him in the restaurant and he just looks like someone's told him his been run over was excruciating but i can honestly say having seen and pretty much expecting that to have been a scene for scene copy as about 75 of the rest of the movie had been maybe in a different order but come on the scene with the coffee in the glasses word for word you can imagine my surprise when i watched the ending of l'appartement i can literally say i was blown away hmm a bit like poor old lucien was through the cafe window really so be prepared if you've seen wicker park and you fancy taking a look at the original like i did do not make the mistake of expecting an identical movie because you'll either be disappointed or exhilarated at a piece of french movie history a prime example of how you can watch a movie think you're going to watch a pithy happy ending and get whiplash from the total spin in the opposite direction right at the end definitely catch this movie oh and while you're at maybe not too near the same time but down the road take a look at wicker park it'll surprise you too
<START> have you ever wondered why these guys seagal stallone willis et al manage to survive all those gunfights in which they're outnumbered i think i've got it figured out the enemies always miss and the hero doesn't br br here seagal has a pistol and a half dozen heavies firing at him from a few feet away one of the heavies has a shotgun or maybe two of them have it doesn't really matter there could be a thousand shotguns blasting away at him and seagal would still emerge with his ponytail intact br br and when it comes to mano a mano combat forget it the evildoers may or may not be armed with swords or knives or blunt object but seagal with his skill in aikido or or or play do or whatever it is brushes them aside with a few dismissive blows not only is he a master of these outrÃ© skills but his physical strength is herculean more than once he snaps somebody's long bones as easily as we would break a toothpick one he breaks a guy's spine over his knee br br i'll tell you something i'm getting into the spirit of the film here because seagal uses that line i'll tell you something several times along with what's that supposed to mean these guys are fully deserving of extinction in any good handbook they are all black speak with unintelligible may can accents wear dreadlocks that look in dire need of a shampoo they torture and murder with aplomb and here's the worst part they're unchristian that's right they practice voodoo br br actually the voodoo element comes close to being the most interesting element of the film they got the constituents of the ritual pretty well cigar smoke rum spitting the sacrificial chicken they only left out the possession dance in which the spirit rides the dancer they should have read on voodoo br br otherwise the plot adheres to the usual conventions what was done to bissett by the voodoo practitioners in the deep is done here to a friend of seagal's what was done to john wayne when he was stuck between trucks in is done here to seagal himself at the movie's very opening when seagal makes a brief speech about having seen too much pointless violence in his dea career so he's now happily retired and when we are introduced to his friends and family i tried to keep track of his to see if i could pick out which ones would be horribly murdered or maimed to generate his quest for revenge br br the acting doesn't really require much comment but charles the jamaican cop played by tom wright is really pretty good wright has considerable range here he's an associate of dubious allegiance rather sinister but in the pentagon wars he has a comic part that he underplays perfectly br br the never flew as movie villains i don't know why exactly it's a small movie market and if you go to stick to bay however if you want to see jamaican voodoo drug dealers as heavies and if you're in the mood for another typical standard action flick this should be a satisfying view
<START> steven seagal is a thief who specializes in robbing drug dealers giving to the poor and unfortunate heh harlan the robin hood anyway harlan wants to go straight for his girl jada mari morrow so he takes on a job as the driver of an armoured car for a max stevens kevin tighe wasted in an underwritten role max intends to have the millions for himself and his unscrupulous associates with the intent of using his loader bruno robert to bring him the money but harlan has other plans escaping the police hiding the money and ditching bruno who had a loaded gun pointed at head threatening to shoot him if he didn't drive after evading capture by ramming a huge dump truck harlan passes out charged with the murder of police among other things as a result of the damage caused by the high speed chase harlan is imprisoned and many wish to know where the money is harlan joins forces with an inmate ice a leader of one of the many gangs in the prison breaking out with the plans of finding max and eliminating every member of his corrupt entourage soon dea agent rachel knowles sarah becomes part of this scenario thanks to her boss saunders nick mancuso who claims there's drugs involved also injected into the plot is desire to save a children's hospital about to close and jada has mysterious dreams regarding max br br seagal and cut up with each other speaking in gangsta while spends time trying to help harlan uncovering the possibility her boss is in cahoots with max character is an odd duck allowing rachel much leeway despite the threat she is to his career tighe shows up for five or so minutes tops which is a shame seagal's harlan escapes prison and finds each and every rich associate of max's inevitably discovering his whereabouts after cracking a few skulls snapping some wrists and breaking some bones speaks in his rapper speech and seagal tries to answer him in kind providing some unintentional laughs as you'd expect a lot of people get shot and seagal doesn't break a sweat it's interesting seeing seagal in prison among the convicts helping out when a group of plan to take him out
<START> br br this is the best mock documentary of a dog show that i have seen in a long time a very long time well lets face it ever isn't that part of the charm the idea of actually going to the trouble to make a movie mocking a documentary about an event that most people would find odd in the first place even if there were no big laughs one would still be smirking at the thought any movie that attempts something new scores highly in my proverbial book i loved the dogs too
<START> the opening of morte a venezia resembles a duran duran music video with classical music and this is the highlight of the movie br br in terms of what theo br br in terms of everything but especially excitement i doubt if there's ever been a more sluggish slower moving movie than this one yeah okay it's a european art house movie so i wasn't expecting charles bronson to massacre hordes of bad guys but even so i did expect some substance if not an actual plot br br the film revolves around professor gustav von visiting venice gustav visits venice and goes on a gondola gustav eats in an expensive restaurant gustav looks out of his hotel window and if it's excitement you want gustav has a flashback br br bad enough if this was the entire movie but it gets worse because gustav notices a pretty boy teenager so you've got a middle aged academic lusting after some teenage boy he has seen some old queen is becoming obsessed with a stranger great idea for a movie i don't think so either and thank gawd it remained a yawn fest instead of some sleazy precursor to gay porn br br i notice a lot of people who praise this movie have tried to it i can only be monosyllabic and unpretentious in my view and say that the only subtext i could relate to was the physical and emotional disintegration of gustav but it wasn't caused by the effete beauty of the teenage boy it was caused by watching such a boring and ostentatious movie
<START> a ragtag collection of western tourists in africa suffer the misfortune of their plane breaking down so they're compelled to hop on a bus to travel across the desert to reach the nearest jumping off point back to civilization not surprisingly the driver's compass ends up not working and they find themselves way off course coming to a stop at a deserted ghost town that had been a barracks during the fighting in wwii they find some kerosene useless in terms of re filling the tank of their bus a storage room full of half poisoned carrots in tin cans and a native hermit who views them with indifference the one fellow amongst them who appears to have something on the ball in terms of survivalist techniques goes off to get help they are to remove the tires from the bus and burn them if he's not back in five days hopefully someone will see the black smoke br br does this sound interesting well sure even if it sounds a lot like the flight of the phoenix or any number of films in the deserted island genre which is why it's surprising that the king is alive is number 4 if anyone is still counting in the ongoing dogma 95 series which if i remember that ridiculous dogma 95 vow of chastity correctly proclaimed that genre films are strictly verboten oops well anyway you can tell it's gonna try and be all arty and stuff in order to compensate for the fact that it's a genre flick yep it doesn't take long for one member of the group a wizened old stage actor to start scribbling down from memory the various roles from king lear on well rolls of paper the idea is that performing the play will help while away the time all of which really goes against the absconded advice to stay optimistic didn't the old actor ever do a dinner theater performance of the odd couple just once in his life quite apart from such an activity being a colossal waste of precious time and energy br br this movie is so bad i really don't know how to continue it's so monumentally stupid so full of absurd situations and characters that it beggars rational criticism it may be a timely moment to offer full disclosure i despise this so called danish film movement to an almost irrational degree i think my face even turns slightly red at the mere mention of dogma 95 first of all if the name of your movement has the word dogma in the title you've already lost me secondly in this particular instance the insistence on the of individual artistic achievement is a recipe for arch hypocrisy when you consider that the filmmakers here are plundering one of the greatest works of the greatest individual writer who ever lived but doubtless the dogma crowd believes the works of shakespeare were actually penned by a of elizabethan bigwigs like the earl of oxford francis bacon walter raleigh and the queen herself br br hell i may have forgiven the whole enterprise if it had played the scenario for farcical purposes attacking the precious dogma now that would be subversive but the movie takes itself very seriously and soon devolves into the clichÃ©s attendant upon the genre in which it unmistakably belongs people turning against each other the men growing beards the inevitable deaths of a few of the principal actors all with a straight face is this the promised end well not quite we also have to endure the abysmal transfer of dv for this is another rule in the dogma 95 vow of chastity hand held digital video only some friendly advice to the danes your movement is in trouble when your finished product has worse visual quality than an average high school graduation home video professionalism belongs in an artist's bag of tricks right alongside his own individuality artisan and artist are kindred words mr von trier not every jackass with a 100 hand held can be a filmmaker pass it on and by the way allow your dogma directors to be credited for their films while you're at it the fact that the writer of the king is alive receives credit while the guy or girl actually filming it doesn't is just a wee bit hypocritical br br contemptible 1 star out of 10
