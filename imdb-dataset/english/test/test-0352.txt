<START> a lot of people in the cinema enjoyed this film but it only made me feel misanthropic if smug intellectuals bantering about their irritating sex lives sounds ok to you watch it i felt bored but glad i did know people like that the premise of the film was that as with all societies or great civilizations they are eventually doomed to fail according to the female historian character who bores us with this fact america is showing signs of it's decline admittedly she goes into greater detail than me the next part of the film is concerned with the vacuous fatuous and asinine behaviour of her friends and colleagues and the various miseries caused by their libidinous behaviour with a vague attempt at humor a lot of people liked this movie where i watched it i could not relate to it
<START> cyclone is a piece of dreck with little redeeming value even on the so bad its entertaining front a friend of mine took the tape from an overflowing st vincent clothes bin okay that may be a little bit dodgy but it was meant to be a clothes bin not a crappy old vhs bin something the less fortunate members of our society don't really need to make their lives better it could be considered a mercy watching a movie like cyclone would really only add to their problems anyway the basic premise of a woman with a super powerful motorcycle that it armed to the teeth with rockets and lasers isn't even properly exploited the two 'high speed' chase sequences involve vehicles travelling at less than hair raising speeds of around 40 and a super fast motorcycle that is in danger of being overtaken by a crappy old station wagon is not that awe inspiring when you get down to it there is only one scene where the bikes goofy weaponry is used at the film's climax and it is laughably ineffectual or just laughable when it is this includes laser beams that look like they should be coming out of the hands of an evil wizard in a cheesy eighties sword and sorcery that produced large bursts of flame which seem to have no noticeable effect on their targets even when they hit directly the rest of the movie is just tedious hard to watch filler lots of bad actors yes even combs and landau suck in this most of whom seem like they have been lifted from the set of a porno movie stand around exchanging really bad dialogue in a desperate attempt to pus forward the barely coherent plot there are a few badly staged fight sequences and some excruciatingly unfunny comic relief scenes with some cops and the owner of the motor cycle repair shop comedy of the sub benny hill horny old man can't stop staring at the female leads chest variety basically the scenes involving the bike actually doing stuff are few and lame and the rest is clunky filler material skip it
<START> wynorski films are always this is just another case in point out of the five naked women shamelessly flaunted here maybe one has real breasts and that's a strong maybe no humor no gore just boobies boobies boobies and some tepid softcore lesbo action but know what for fifty cents less than this video rental i could have rented legitimate porn do i feel cheated with wynorski always so i prepared myself for a letdown as one must always do
<START> give director stanley tong of jackie chan's super cop and rumble in the bronx and what do you get you receive a series of kung fu fights and a lack of magoo like madness br br the limited plot has magoo leslie nielsen put into an international plot where he steals a world renowned gem of course he has no idea what he is doing in fact he has no idea that he had the gem br br within thirty minutes you could get very bored watching this there are some very funny moments though like when he is cooking the chicken you will wish that you were as as magoo its a fun movie to watch but its quite a disaster you have to love leslie nielson because he was made some very funny movies this isn't his best but he does a good job playing magoo i thought it was a funny film and it should be recommended to young children because they will probably think that its very funny
<START> this is really one of the worst movies i have seen in a while it's not funny at all it simply portrays a lower class northern british setting i find it a very sad film at parts at others cuts are where they shouldn't be one thing that really annoyed me was the close ups of pointless objects it really slowed down the pace of the movie i only made it through the movie because i fast forwarded certain sequences towards the end br br this movie completely loses the attention of the audience it's main problem is that it makes multiple reasons for one action which in turn tends to weaken that action however if there is one reason for one action it makes it more passionate all in all this movie is all over the place i didn't learn enough about the characters to care about them because of the shifting plot lines and stories where as i would have maybe enjoyed exploring the life of one character br br for example at the beginning when the guy meets god in the bar god seems like a cool guy the movie could've elaborated on that moment and i think it would've been a lot funnier br br anyway enough if's watch it if you want but i'm warning you this film is crap i respect the makers for trying to pull it off with such a low budget but they could've done a much better job i guess it all lies in the camera movement and editing the acting was decent but then again that's just my opinion
<START> for me the best most memorable movies are often those which on first viewing i know nothing about american movie is a perfect example of just such a gem watching tv late one evening i spotted the one only good review among the dross thankfully i settled in for a real treat american movie is a documentary following the unforgettable mark pronounced orchard i believe a highly articulate charismatic lad as he struggles to write direct and produce midwestern a gritty low budget horror movie on which he has been working for years in mark we discover a young man filled with contrast his appearance is of the classic trailer trash stereotype skinny bum fluff mustache '80s heavy metal styling mullet hairdo etc to camera however mark reveals startling wit insight as he philosophizes upon life love movies the american way as the movie unfolds it sadly becomes clear that mark's lack of discipline heavy drinking are relentlessly sabotaging his creative efforts american movie is a charming watch filled with hilarious moments vivid characters chief among these is mark's lovable buddy mike a soft spoken reformed stoner who having conquered an addiction to scratch cards is now dependent on soda pop i absolutely loved american movie it generates real empathy between the viewer principal characters and provides hilarity without feeling exploitative i would wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone
<START> i did not know what to expect when i decided to watch this documentary i knew it was about an ex viet nam pow in who escaped but i didn't know much else in reality i wasn't expecting too much oh what a surprise the story of this man's life is very interesting in itself but what sets this film apart from other biography type docs is that dieter himself tells most of the story himself dieter is very comfortable in front of the camera his personality really shines he tells his story about his life growing up in germany during wwii and the hardships we are there with him in that same small town as he describes his family inspirations and struggles we follow him to america and his path to fulfilling his dream to be a pilot then later dieter describes his story of capture escape and survival in the jungle we are again with him in that very jungle as he describes and re enacts his imprisonment and path to freedom with great detail we see the same primitive huts villagers and forms of he dealt with that really hasn't changed for 30 years we see the thick jungle mountain terrain and rivers dieter faced during his escape it helps us to understand his emotions pain and plight i enjoyed the man the story and the style job well done
<START> a new wrestling show paves way for the most feared wrestler ever imaginable the giant zeus network president does everything in his power to draw wwf champion rip into the squared circle to face off against zeus for the championship of the 'battle of the tough guys' but zeus is unlike any competitor rip has ever faced br br normally i would give hogan some leeway as a wrestler crossing over into a movie role however this film didn't ask the to make very much of a stretch it simply asked hogan to play himself which he failed at miserably 'tiny' lister made a good effort as the mighty zeus but even his work left the film lacking something namely acting br br watch this movie if you so desire with a grain of salt and a sense of humor otherwise you will probably have to turn it off a little over ten minutes in
<START> after being off the air for a while columbo returned with some new made for tv mysteries that while not being as good as the original series are better than the shows that were done in the later '90s br br murder can be hazardous to your health used the then and i guess now if you think about it true crime shows as the situation for a murder the murder is committed by a very successful egomaniacal true crime show host george hamilton in a nice bit of casting his chain smoking nemesis who lost the job to him played by peter haskell attempts to blackmail hamilton when he discovers a porno video hamilton made with an underage actress in his salad days hamilton uses haskell's cigarettes to deliver the death blow via poison giving himself an alibi as well br br columbo is brought in to find out what happened you know the rest highly entertaining
<START> like i'm sure other people have said this guy isn't a very worthwhile subject sure our society has a morbid fascination with death and it's funny hearing him talk about how much he smokes and how much coffee he drinks but he's into giving himself an unworthy mystique anyway the bottom line is that he's a moron racist using feeble methods to try to disprove the mountain of evidence of the holocaust and as such he should be forgotten by time but morris is in love with any kind of which normally i wouldn't fault him for
<START> this film attempts to cash in on the success of richard curtis movies particularly love actually which i loved a series of disparate scenes following the love lives of various couples br br it's a great idea poorly executed the script tries to be a little too clever and simply doesn't resonate most of the acting is stilted which is more a reflection on the director than the actors br br the version i saw on a plane was called scenes from a park which is a more appropriate title as not all the scenes were of a nature' br br i was so looking forward to this movie but ultimately it is disappointing don't bother
<START> the is a hilarious film that not many people have seen clearly not that many because it only got a 6 8 there is nothing wrong with it at all it's my favorite of the disney classics which have tons of fantastic films already made like beauty and the beast snow white and peter pan the reason why the is so high on my list is because of how funny the film is i hate to say this but i don't blame edgar for what he does i probably would've had them taken care of too i'd be devastated of some old bag who i'd been working with for so many years just decides to give her will to the cats i'd of killed them also i don't even like cats so i wouldn't give a damn i think that the is so funny and cute there are many characters that are hilarious like edgar the is my favorite of the disney classics and that's final the cat's out of the bag br br the
<START> film noir meets anime brilliant this was one of the highlights of the surprisingly creative animatrix shorts this was one of my favorites if not my favorite i also loved world record this is basically a reference to those classic film noir detective stories and movies of the 40s except it's animated and involves the matrix but by being animated it is able to take the extreme camera angles the detective life style the shadows and everything film noir to an entirely new level the femme fatale trinity the detective in this story seems to be living in the 40s in his mind but stuck in a modern world and everything becomes too much for him when his case suddenly involves science fiction and agents when a mysterious woman in black walks into his office br br my grade 9 10
<START> i'm sorry but i just can't help it i love watching iron eagle now do not misunderstand me i am not saying that this is a great movie no rather i would put it that this is an endlessly entertaining movie for people who cut this movie to pieces for not being realistic are kinda missing the point of course iron eagle's plot was ridiculous but i believe its target audience was kids and i sure remember finding this cool when i was little now i just find it amusing as a guilty pleasure kinda like road house this movie is part of the great pantheon of 80's kids taking on the stodgy adult power structure movies you must remember d a r y l real genius e t etc if you ask me just watching doug and ride the snake in the beginning is worth the cost of the dvd that whole sequence was so stupid but at the same time it was hilarious funny totally 80's all that good stuff so bottom line iron eagle is a great 80's guilty pleasure the hairstyles the dancing the music the dialogue its all funny as hell i have iron eagle on dvd and to me it was totally worth 9 99 at best buy if you love laughing at dated unrealistic action movies this one is a must see oh yeah and i think its plot was only marginally stupider than 1986's other fighter pilot action pic top gun
<START> as with so many modern us films there has to be a supernatural element to the plot but if you just let that go this is a tale with heaps of charm and a kindly heart cased in a crab shell br br we are presented with a scene of a town in an economically depressed area struggling to find anything to be happy about beau bridges' character is really up against it with a family on the increase a nil bank balance and a brother in law who's sold out to a big business chain which he secretly hates but in which he is willing to rub nose d'onofrio finds his rather surface bubba lifestyle cramped by having to look after his baby brother joey and is itching to escape the shackles of this dead hick town their boss's business is closing down much against his will because of a lack of new customers and he is haunted by memories of his father as he builds up the tension towards his own attempt at self destruction br br joey who had seemed to personify the curse on their lives is lost at sea believed drowned in a freak accident his miraculous restoration to them by the portuguese whose boat they had just built and launched perhaps symbolic of an angelic crew is the sign they've been waiting for and they all decide to give life one last throw of the dice br br there is a beautiful brooding mood throughout this work which excelled in holding our attention as brilliantly as 'the shipping news' there are other parallels with the later work too which lead one to suspect a touch of a remake i like of life' for its simpler less contrived story and star performances from actors working at their craft rather than to be noticed as stars
