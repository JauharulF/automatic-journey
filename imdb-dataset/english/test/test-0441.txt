<START> ok maybe posse can't compare to other popular cowboy western movies but that's because it didn't have the funding those movies had obviously whenever you want to produce a story such as this one focusing on african american historical involvement and no servants and are not historical involvement hollywood isn't going to be too supportive and believe me they weren't the producers and actors sacrificed a lot of 'out of pocket' expenses to make posse just so that the story could be told i think that alone is commendable posse may not be oscar material and they don't like black media too much either but it is a start it is entertaining and it introduces us to the black cowboy a character most of us are unfamiliar with
<START> less a thriller than an colorful adventure with suspenseful elements the man who knew too much should not be really be compared with such hitchcock masterpieces as vertigo rear window or psycho it is instead more akin to such enjoyable romps as to catch a thief and north by northwest shot largely on location in morocco and london the film tells the story of a married couple james stewart and doris day whose holiday is interrupted when they innocently run afoul of an assassination plot and when their young son is kidnapped in order to insure their silence br br james stewart and doris day are quite effective in their roles of the all american couple and the characters are given an unusual twist stewart a midwestern doctor is outgoing but has a touch of the ugly american abroad about his personality day who plays a popular stage and recording star who retired upon her marriage has a suspicious nature these qualities of personality and background play extremely well into the story br br the man who knew too much contains a number of famous scenes both the scene in which stewart drugs day before telling her of the kidnapping and the very complex albert hall sequence involving what seems hundreds of cuts are very powerful less often noticed although to my mind equally if not more satisfactory are the more subtle scenes in which hitchcock combines an edge of suspense along with perverse humor as when stewart attempts some detecting at a taxidermist shop and day belts out que sera sera written for this film in a most unsuitable way at an embassy cocktail party br br although the man who knew too much lacks the depth and impact of hitchcock's greater work it remains an enjoyable film and one that compares very well with his work as a whole it's hitchcock light but recommended br br gary f taylor aka gft amazon reviewer
<START> the ruins is to as deep impact was to armageddon a worse version of a mildly entertaining movie except much much worse one of the characters is supposed to be going to medical school so why are they all retards you can't keep cutting best line form this movie this is an awful movie i like horror movies but fully appreciate that most of them are terrible but had a bit of high hopes for this movie after seeing the reviews on imdb the situation they are in is stupid and how they handle it makes them stupid it is awful the one thing that makes it somewhat palatable is its cool australian backdrop despite the fact that they spend the vast majority of the movie in one place
<START> i am very interested in animal children and i have read many rice burroughs novels but this awful movie couldn't keep me interested nor could i stomach all the absurd unrealistic scenes i only managed to sit through the africa part and john's first few days in scotland let's talk about and the actors in ape suits looked like extra large chimps rather than great apes there is a difference they did not move with the grace that a wild animal would for comparison see some of the better planet of the apes movies where they trained their actors to move in simian fashion the apes eat large of meat not a common ape practice as far as i know i am a sucker for animal stories but the script did not make me care about the apes the great white hunters of the expedition that finds john clayton are entirely the parents of clayton were shipwrecked on an ocean beach but somehow it is a very long trip down the river to get to the coast give me a break let's talk about 'slow' even the folks who think this is an excellent movie admit that it is not an action movie far from it it tries to be a character study unfortunately the downright silly part predominates i did not read burroughs' tarzan books but many of his other series they were packed with meaningful action and heroic purpose this film just isn't there
<START> for the 1980s this is a very dark movie at this point filmmakers were beginning to operate under the assumption that all films require smarmy comic relief which of course is taken to the extreme today flashy action scenes even more overdone today or steamy sex scenes br br hutton and penn are stupendous in their roles as childhood friends turned soviet spies penn in particular is brilliant as hapless drug dealer lee br br what you have here is a true thriller drama there is no eye candy to speak of but the story is so compelling and the acting so superb that hopefully most people wouldn't miss it there are a couple amusing scenes in particular the one where penn tries to get his soviet benefactors involved in a major deal br br well worth watching
<START> recap simon leads a little team of special agents that has specialized in finding and returning missing people against all possible odds their latest mission is about the granddaughter of a friend of them she seems to have been caught in the web of a particularly brutal criminal and everyone that has gone looking for her has gone missing but now the librarians are on the case br br comments this is pure b action through and through the key phrase for this is unlimited supply there is unlimited supply of ammunition they don't have to reload once there is an unlimited supply of bad guys so the heroes have something to shoot at there is an unlimited supply of breasts many of them bare in an vain and as always failed attempt to distract from the plot holes and there is an unlimited supply of bad acting it is almost like erika eleniak's performance shines in this what about that and actors that don't seem to care more than the paycheck and why should they when no one else seem to br br and as in most b action movies there are an unlimited supply of bad gunfights but these almost seem to be of a ridiculously bad kind i think i saw more realistic gunfights when i played cowboy as a kid br br but then again i didn't really expect much either how could i from a action movie named the librarians and it actually delivers about what could be expected 90 minutes of more or less bad action with some scenes to connect the dots between but i am unsure if i can call it entertaining it didn't keep my interest very long br br 3 10
<START> some may think imaginary heroes is a movie exactly like goes down but it isn't in imaginary heroes the director lets us feel for the travis family and the people around them br br the movie itself is great and the acting is extremely well done weaver's and hirsch's acting is believable and helps make the movie what it is the actors director writer dan harris has made a movie that many people should see don't think this is just another teen movie it is a movie about a family and their problems br br i gave this movie a 10 10 because i believe it isn't the best film which no film can be but its the closest it can get to perfect
<START> most lorne michaels films seem to fail because they're essentially just extended versions of skits that barely managed to make people laugh in five minute segments tommy boy is a character right from snl a big fat lovable in their opinion goof who doesn't know anything br br david spade gets the thankless overwhelmed everyman role he's paired with the annoying overweight slob and they endure miserable misfortunes as they travel cross country to save daddy's business br br the plot for starters is really faulty the whole premise daddy dies and rich stupid son has to save the family biz can be traced back to just about any movie you want like any snl style film it is reduced to a simple motivation empty shallow just a reason to see a fat guy and a thin guy be funny together br br the movie's biggest influence is the 1987 comedy classic planes trains automobiles that movie is great because the plot isn't stale and recycled it's basic yeah a guy traveling home for thanksgiving gets stuck with a slob but it's real dammit it makes all the difference the characters are real the situations are far more real tommy boy is pure slapstick and its ridiculous situations undermine the characters we feel nothing for them and we don't care about what's happening on screen pta walked the careful line between outrageous and utterly believable and relate able tommy boy is simply absurd with jokes like a simple deer in the headlights turning into a crash turning into a struggle with a dead deer that really isn't dead then awakens and wrecks their car br br the whole wrecked car thing is stolen completely from pta and it's eerie how much stuff in this film actually does resemble the steve martin john candy movie br br farley is simply way too obnoxious to find likable i've never enjoyed watching him in any movies and this hasn't changed my mind spade's given very little to do serving as the movie's most thankless character br br dan aykroyd is wasted as the evil baddie who plans to destroy daddy's business the ending is a joke and not in a har har funny way more like a oh god are they serious way br br some people dig it that's cool but i just can't get into it nor do i appreciate all the stuff it borrows from not just counting pt a without any credit whatsoever
<START> this cheap grainy filmed italian flick is about a couple of inheritors of a manor in the italian countryside who head up to the house to stay and then find themselves getting killed off by ghosts of people killed in that house br br i wasn't impressed by this it wasn't really that scary mostly just the way a cheap italian film should be a girl her two cousins and one cousin's girlfriend head to this huge house for some reason i couldn't figure out why and are staying there cleaning up and checking out the place characters come in and out of the film and it's quite boring at points and the majority of deaths are quite rushed the girlfriend is hit by a car when fleeing the house after having a dream of her death and the scene is quite good but then things get slow again until a confusing end when the male cousins are killed together in some weird way and this weirdo guy i couldn't figure out who he was during the movie or maybe i just don't remember goes after this one girl attacking her until finally this other girl kills him off hate to give away the ending but oh well the female cousin decides to stay at the house and watch over it and they show scenes of her living there years later the end you really aren't missing anything and anyway you probably won't find this anywhere so lucky you
<START> despite the title and unlike some other stories about love and war this film isn't too sticky and pink because love is as a rose with thorns that is the four leading actors set their characters realistic and with a good sense and balance between the tragic and the down to earth br br the music and lyrics of the cabaret chanson esquire songs sung b keira knightley herself drag the viewer deeper and deeper in the film from one place to another between the brutal war and amongst the peaceful love some people may find it too much a biopic but it Ã­s mostly a romantic story even though it consequently follows the life of dylan thomas and the triangular relationship which is steeped by joy and jealousy br br london gets visualized from another angle for once the bohemian life of dylan during the bombings of the germans is set in a floating atmosphere of small bedrooms pubs and bars the independent women the soldier and the charismatic poet are constantly swept in both feelings of love and anger br br maybe the end is too twisted and hangs somewhat loosely to the rest of the film but all in all this is a great romantic story
<START> east side story entertains and informs about an unknown part of cold war history what is the purpose of any documentary to inform the reader through commentary and footage this one succeeds at both you will never find many movies whose clips you get to see in here because some of them have been destroyed and some are br br you get to see and her music from musicals made in east germany russia and other countries under soviet control it shows you that the people who made these movies and the people who watched them all look for same things a westerner would look for which are pretty women and men singing and dancing on the streets with smiles and hopefully white teeth
<START> lost oasis a place for food fun and murder after a guy disappears on his way to a gas station a group of her friends head out on a trip to search for him they come across a wax museum where they think their friend might have ended up unfortunately for the friends however the owner of the roadside attraction possesses the power to control his wax mannequins and use them for evil one by one the tourists are stalked down and killed by and his legion of wax dummies can the friends escape or will they fall to the same fate as their lost friend following in the footsteps and twisting them around of the great classic wax films house of wax mystery of the wax museum tourist trap takes the slasher genre to a whole new level of strange and fascinating with its bizarre story and style as far as character development action dialogue flow etc it seems to be just a basic slasher flick but it goes far beyond that as the director takes control of the plot and moves it to the supernatural thriller it is the acting ranges from acceptable from the main cast to very good from backwoods showman mr played by western legend chuck connors the writing moves well and the dialogue is well structured but there are some flaws in logic as the film moves deeper into the story also some scenes are a bit silly like the moaning mannequin attack on becky it's nothing however that would detract from the effect of the film as one would expect from a film about wax dummies it is full of the endless creepiness supplied by the mannequins it's strange that a mostly inanimate object can just sit still and somehow be so unsettling perhaps it's the human likeness or the blank stare or the fact that you know it's about to spring an attack whatever it is the dolls are extremely spooky and that effect is used very well throughout the entirety of the film as far as slashers go it's one of the best and it stands as one of the creepiest films i've ever seen br br obligatory slasher elements br br violence gore the film is full of some cool deaths the gore isn't excessive but it's done well and leaves it as being realistic br br sex nudity there is an extended skinny dipping scene with the very attractive lead females though 'very attractive' barely begins to describe the ravishing future angel tanya roberts but it's all a tease as the girls remain mostly underwater they do remain scantily clad throughout the film however br br cool killer s creepy is just the beginning of and his mannequins one of the best killers in the slasher subgenre br br scares suspense from the opening scene on the film maintains a great blend of the creepiness of the mannequins jump scares from the attacks and a strong level of suspense in the stranded situation it's all very well done to make for a genuinely scary film br br mystery well mystery wasn't really the point of the film just the meaning behind all of it is what matters br br awkward dance scene all these cute girls and not a single dance shame br br final verdict 8 10 see this creepy slasher br br ap3
<START> i may be a but i found this movie truly moving it was the first movie that reduced me to tears and it did it more than once i recommend it to anyone both gay and religious or not supporting co star jackie bisset stole the show especially with her one liners the nude scenes were superbly crafted as well and all in were good taste most shocking was the portrayal of the orientation reversal instituted by the mormon church to the lead character it shocked me that this still goes on in the world nevertheless i enjoyed this movie tremendously this is definitely the best gay film since torch song trilogy and much better than the other gay movie offering that year the fluffer
<START> this film is worthwhile despite what you may hear the performance of marie dressler i hope i am spelling it right as a drunken old sot is reason enough to see this film it is an amazing performance she is in a drunken stupor in three scenes for a good long while and she never does the same thing twice you can actually smell the alcohol when she is done amazing and greta of course speaks her first lines on film and shes great the eugene o'neill story is solid and like most o'neill stories very deep and intense this is not light entertainment but if you appreciate those great character actors from the 30's and 40's you will like it some of the film is technically fuzzy but all in all worthwhile
<START> but memorable because it includes an actor i actually recognize james is by these types of movies' standards lawrence olivier he's given some decent performances on stuff like highlander and various star treks so it's kind of amusing if mildly depressing watching him degrade himself here okay yeah there's a plot character and his wife are fighting he's having an affair with a movie reviewer while trying to do his masterpiece film and their guest decides to enjoy the wonders of stripping but watching is really the only enjoyment to be found here
