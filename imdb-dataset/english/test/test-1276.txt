<START> when i first saw this movie i also expected our boys to be cute and more like an extended version of the tv show i didn't get it back then but years later at a party years later at a 70s' type par tay where certain substances had been smoked inhaled and with plenty of tequila head was on late at night we watched it and finally realized what head was all about it spoofed their own show as shown in one song that called themselves a manufactured image as davy jones wrote in his they made a monkey out of me he openly admits that everyone in the film had been up all night smoking weed they made fun of themselves society everything great film tho as a 52 yr old granny i no longer i still watch this film when i want a good lol
<START> when a hardworking entrepreneur is rejected from a prestigious country club he starts a battle between the members and eventually buys it from ty webb chevy chase and turns it into a theme park golf course in which everyone can join br br this is by no means a good movie but it is still slightly amusing at times almost all of the comedy is cheap slapstick and bad jokes except for chevy chase chevy chase plays one of his greatest roles as ty webb for a second time and plays it great he is not only the funniest character in the movie he is the only funny character in the movie even dan akroyd fails to bring humor to this film which aspires to be a great sequel to a classic comedy but falls to rubble with others shown on comedy central the movie might have been better if ty webb chase had a larger role but instead he was reduced to a minor character and the star became jackie mason who they should have brought back all of the cast and made a sequel the right way this is a perfect example of what not to do when making a sequel to an already great movie overall caddyshack ii is humorous but a large mistake br br i do not recommend this movie
<START> what is the deal with all these ethnic crime groups copying italian mafia related movies we all know the godfather as in don vito corleone now we have this mexican one which is just a strait out copy i cant see why other ethnic groups have to mimic and imitate italian mobsters but it sure makes them look silly they sure seem to be italians i would much prefer to see mexicans perform there own ideas and like to see there own culture and the way they do it instead of copying ideas from the godfather trilogy apart from that the movie was disappointing seeing mexicans acting and trying to be italians is not my thing after watching this i'm now going to watch the real godfather so this movie can be erased from my memory
<START> the jazz singer is one of a number of films made in the late 1940's and 1950 about the jewish experience in the united states other than crossfire 1947 and gentleman's agreement 1947 which dealt with anti semitism they usually had a musical theatre background these films included the jolson story 1946 jolson sings again 1949 the eddy story 1951 the eddie cantor story 1953 the benny goodman story 1956 and morningstar 1958 the leading actors in these jewish films were always played by non jews for example larry parks a non jew played al jolson and gene kelly played noel airman in marjorie morningstar this casting was probably done to make the jewish theme palpable to a mainly non jewish audience the jazz singer 1952 is no different danny thomas was a devout catholic and peggy lee was certainly not jewish although she plays a non practicing in the film the clue to her background is when she attends the family meal before entering she says i haven't been to a service since i left home br br the film is about a son who has just left the service after seeing action in korea his dilemma is whether to become a cantor a family tradition or to be a singer in musical theatre his choice of theatre leads to an inevitable conflict with his father br br however there is much more to this film than this this film was made after the rosenberg trial during the mccarthy and the hollywood blacklist therefore in this film the jews are shown as good loyal citizens and br br are american the synagogue choir would rather play baseball than practice the friends also talk about baseball in fact one of them is a major league umpire the synagogue itself dates back to and george washington is said to have visited therefore jews are presented as part and parcel of american society nobody in this film has a eastern european accent peggy lee appeared in very few feature films in this film you get to see her sing lover and just one of those things wonderful danny thomas is quite credible and he acts and sings the part very well the comedic routines could have been left out yes the film is schmaltzy and sentimental but it is well worth seeing i enjoyed it very much
<START> the toxic avenger br br the idea of this movie is that a person that the common population would call this person a looser and then after being thrown into a barrel of toxic waste mutated into a superhero that is completely disfigured sounded ok even for 1985 this movie is listed as a horror i even have read of a cult following with this series br br now this movie even given when it was made was so bad that i couldn't stop watching the acting is horrible even for an independent film that i think was to be the horror part of this movie br br drug dealing sumo godzilla entrance i'm all for movies that promote anti drugs heck i even like godzilla and well sumo i'm not into it but even still i think that the heights of sumo would love to give this movie the 1000 hand slap and ground salt into the eyes of the people that made this movie br br personally i am almost ready to write to the film company that made this and ask them for the or so of my life back br br to me 1 out of 10 is too high it's too bad that there isn't a 0 zero or even negative to place on a movie here br br in other words this movie is j u n k would rather watch paint dry and deal with explosive diarrhea then have to watch this movie ever again i would be the first person that would use not only the packaging of this movie as kindling but i would be up for a movie and script burning
<START> apparently this movie was based on a true story i'm not sure how accurate it is though but it really reminded me of how when i see that someone has been murdered on the news it's amazing how much it doesn't affect me sure i think it's terrible but i honestly don't care i move on it seems that murder is trivial now this is what river's edge shows nobody really seems to care about this girl and her death not even the killer then what's the point br br the killer in this story is john and for the large amount of the movie he hides out with another killer named played by dennis hopper is older and you can see the generational gap he says he loved the girl that he killed when he asks john if he loved the girl he killed he simply replies she was okay the movie only seems to offer one solution life is more important than death a character's life is spared people get second chances and one hopeless case is killed br br the acting is really good after watching this movie i could only come to the conclusion that crispin glover is either a brilliant actor or a terrible actor i still have no idea he was my main reason to see this movie though but the best performance is clearly given by dennis hopper br br even though the fashion is really 80's and characters sometimes mention then current issues i still think river's edge is as relevant today as ever br br my rating 10 10
<START> the narrative was clear and concise but overall the film never caught my interest scenes felt flat and uninspired khan historically speaking had a very interesting epic life but the film failed to capture that instead focused on small skirmishes as a youth and a love story i think i've seen disguised in a slew of other films i never felt sympathy nor empathy for the lead yes he had to overcome slavery but then seemed to have an easy ride to khan pillaging killing and double crossing his way to the top the one redeeming quality was the photography the landscapes certainly helped the bleak atmosphere of the film unfortunately combined with the bleakness of the story i left unmoved and disappointed
<START> this is the perfect example of how a great book is turned into a poor film the direction just gives the impression that the film was made up as they went along and patrick is so wooden you can almost see the puppet strings on his body br br spy vs spy films are not or should not be about car chases and shootings the bad guys in this movies are really bad shots and miss the main characters even when at point blank range br br even the action shots are just a clichÃ© with the usual mounting sidewalks and crashing through tables and chairs yawn br br i got half way through and switched off completely bored
<START> i try to be diverse in my movie watching i can get into pride and prejudice as easily as i get into disappearing acts love jones is my all time favorite it is the standard by which i judge any modern urban romantic comedy shot very well the shot of and darius riding up lakeshore drive on the motorcycle is one of classic 3 second movie shots of all time of course no one will ever remember it when it came out i though it would be a new paradigm for modern urban film making good actors no guns and so forth the movie industry has disappointed me to a certain degree you will have your occasional drumline or roll bounce or tyler perry's why did i get married so whenever i need to see my people presented on screen in a very professional and stylish way i pop in love jones there is no best movie ever made to many people and opinions for that but it is my personal best my favorite line from love jones baby i just wanna come up and talk
<START> this is supposed to be based on wilkie collins' the woman in white but the only resemblance it bore to that story were the characters' names the time period and the settings if they were going to change the story so thoroughly i don't understand why they needed to keep up the pretense that it came from wilkie collins go read the book it's much better
<START> i have witnessed some atrocities of cinema in the past couple of years it seems producers and directors are bent on making films that drive me closer and closer to insanity hannibal was not an exception i wasn't expecting much when i went in to see the movie the book was ridiculous and the saying the book is always better than the movie did not assure me at all that this movie would be anything but trash but what i came to see was a movie that made all other bad movies seem better in comparison br br usually when i see a terrible movie i find myself more amused than anything else sadly though i could not even laugh at the sad excuse for a film that hannibal is the movie was filmed with promise i guess it had anthony hopkins julianne moore and gary oldman and for directing there was ridley scott there have been movies with significantly less talent that have been tremendously better there was so much i would have cut from this film that i doubt anything would have remained it was pathetic the storyline was so ludicrous that it seemed like a complete idiot had written it what's worse is that the book was even crazier and there were some scenes that were too extreme to be included which is sad in the case of a movie where br br spoiler ahead br br ray liotta's brain was being cooked in pieces that scene more than any other made me want to cry because it tarnished its predecessor to such a monumental level silence of the lambs was one of my favorite films of all time but hannibal was a two hour plus joke this movie should only be watched if people want to learn how not to write a good movie
<START> the biggest heroes is one of the greatest movies ever a good story great actors and a brilliant ending is what makes this film the jumping start of the director thomas great carrier
<START> it is high time that american critics and fans alike start to debunk their unquestioned sloppy veneration of films like sergio leone's 'once upon a time in america' the checkered history of this opulent film and the grand fanciful myth associated with it's production and many versions belies its mediocrity on a narrative level the film lurches backward and forward in fits and starts its central figures adrift and seemingly out of place surrounded by the ersatz decadence of towering sets the minutia of production detail and the by 1984 cliche'd but gorgeous cinematographic confection on offer to the audience the plot's time frame is confusing gimmicky and laboured leading some critics to imagine the noodles figure's opium to be the antecedent of some future 'dream reality' as well as the sepia toned this ham handed overly fan boy apologetic interpretation glosses over the glaring narrative irregularities on display even at this full running time figures appear and disappear with alarming suddenness the deborah character is fleetingly established in child form a cold and unattainable female not even hinting at the gravity with which she will re establish her relationship with a post prison noodles the said re union henceforth rings completely false the deadening pace is somewhat to blame certain sequences drag along for far too long signifying very little hinting at a director with so little restraint and narrative economy that he often feels obligated to usurp every iota of screen time possible in order to show off his production fatal for a film that contains figures so sullen and aloof the trajectory of the lives is presented to us as a microcosm mirroring the historical trajectory of america's teens through prohibition and its spoils ending with the arguable ruin of its moribund central figures save deborah a make up department fumble or intentional one wonders this notion is commonplace even banal the cast of characters as imagined in the one note script written by seven italians no less are flatly and awkwardly played by all but the younger actors who at least venture a few variant facial expressions this is understandable given the almost unworkable material some critics state that the characters may seem so self absorbed but actively seek their own goals assuming the compliance of others e g when noodles gets out of prison max picks him up and offers him a hooker without asking him whether or not this is what he desires and later makes deals assuming noodles will comply this explanation of their abrupt abrasive dispositions is unsatisfactorily extraneous and merely serves to highlight the complicated ends the films unwavering supporters will go to to defend their positions regarding a film unfortunately short on sense although ennio morricone's score is much revered it is undeniably schmaltzy and repetitive it gushes with an emotional that the scenes themselves many violent just do not warrant at points it is questionable whether or not morricone was watching the same film i was so incongruous is his work as a paean to american filmmaking it succeeds in terms of mood helped by a few strokes of masterful editing segueing between time periods and visuals not helped by said score but lacks narrative cohesion and fluidity
<START> komodo vs cobra starts as 'one planet' environmentalist jerry ryan ryan his girlfriend carrie renee talbert hire captain michael stoddard executive producer michael parÃ© to take them to an island in the south pacific at first stoddard is reluctant since the island is a top secret military research base but soon changes his mind when a load of cash is offered along with tv news reporter sandra crescent jeri they set sail for the island once ashore find out that the military have been funding illegal dna genetic experiments which have resulted in huge komodo dragon's king that have eaten almost every other living thing there stoddard co are next on the menu br br co written directed by the ever awful jim wynorski under his jay andrews pseudonym this is just plain awful this is just plain hard to sit through is even worse than the usual rubbish 'creature features' the sci fi channel have the nerve to air if that's possible the script is terrible predictable utterly boring some giant monsters of some sort are created by scientists messing around with dna a group of people are trapped with said monsters have to try to escape being eaten that's it that's the whole plot of komodo vs cobra maybe this was trying to rip off alien vs predator 2004 with the title but all the ' bit amounts to is a rubbish thirty second stand off between the two titular beasts at the very end boring as hell surely a big disappointment to anyone hoping to have a full on monster mash the character's are poor the dialogue is awful the pace is slow the story is predictable clichÃ© ridden the whole film just sucks really with a lazy script that states wrongly that both komodo dragon's are amphibious which they are not hell komodo vs cobra isn't even worth watching for any unintentional laughs since it's so dull hardly anything ever happens although the sight of a woman hiding behind the smallest rock on the beach from the cobra is quite funny for the wrong reasons br br how does wynorski keep getting directing jobs he is probably consistently the worst director currently working how can he keep getting fun sounding films set on beautiful locations with half decent casts still churn out such an awful film i think this was cut to get a pg or for it's tv showing since every time someone swears it's masked by a parrot squeak there's zero gore or violence the monster scenes are limp people just sort of stand there the monsters just sort of stands there too hissing or roaring that's about it the cgi computer effects are terrible this is really poor stuff that just looks horrible br br with a supposed budget of about 450 000 this looks as cheap as it was the hawaiian locations are nice to look at but that's about it the acting is poor from an uninterested looking cast br br komodo vs cobra is an absolutely terrible sci fi channel 'creature feature' from jim wynorski films don't get much worse than this
<START> having long disdained network television programming i remember the first time i caught an episode of police squad it was totally by accident it was during the show's initial network run on abc in early 1982 i am a chronic channel surfer and was flipping the dial one evening when suddenly appeared police squad 's opening credit sequence on my tv screen i immediately recognized it as a sendup of the opening credits of m squad starring lee marvin one of my all time favorite cop shows i stopped surfing then of course came headquarters getting shot up followed by the immortal rex hamilton as abraham lincoln by now i was saying to myself what the heck is this then came special guest star georg stanford brown getting flattened by a plummeting safe i was hooked from that moment the episode was ring of fear a dangerous assignment with its comic references to on the waterfront and muhammed ali but most memorable of course were all the sight gags and non sequiturs leslie nielsen and alan north in their loose parody of lee marvin and paul of m squad were an absolute riot finally i said to myself a network television program truly worth watching wouldn't you know it would be canceled just a few weeks later leave it to the networks i should have known anyway i just bought the dvd collection of all six episodes and they are just as funny today as they were 27 years ago the naked gun movies were terrific as well but i really missed alan north he was so good as ed peter lupus as what were they thinking casting oj in that part and especially william johnny the guy great stuff
