<START> all in all this is a movie for kids we saw it tonight and my child loved it at one point my kid's excitement was so great that sitting was impossible however i am a great fan of a a books which are very subtle and hide a wry intelligence behind the childlike quality of its leading characters this film was not subtle it seems a shame that disney cannot see the benefit of making movies from more of the stories contained in those pages although perhaps it doesn't have the permission to use them i found myself wishing the theater was replaying winnie the pooh and too instead the characters voices were very good i was only really bothered by the music however was twice as loud in parts than the dialog and incongruous to the film br br as for the story it was a bit preachy and militant in tone overall i was disappointed but i would go again just to see the same excitement on my child's face br br i liked laugh
<START> fantastic documentary a movie within a movie i'm so glad block forged on after his mother's death makes one wonder about the time and money spent in therapy what might have happened if she didn't have that outlet did the therapist help her or just foster a dependency that kept his bank account flush the audience needs to understand that divorce was less of an option in those days she was a housewife went to therapy instead of going to college or job training she seemed to feel trapped by the situation i wonder if the therapist ever tried to get her to think about what she could have done to change her situation and free herself meanwhile wife 2 was just the opposite she was out there working with his dad ended her bad marriage supported herself and appears to be a very confident giving person whatever the state of the marriage the blocks did something right in raising 3 kids who could look at their parents' story be ok with it and share it with us and maybe lead us to start conversations with our parents and spouses
<START> for a movie that was pg this is one fun film i grew up on watching this film over and over its really fun i don't know how today audience would react but if you grew up on it or loved the 80s then this is a great film stephen furst is great as harold who i think is one of the best characters in the film paul also pops in for about 10 minutes i love nostalgia
<START> this crock of won a award they must have been desperate for giving out an award for something this movie reeks of teeny bopper stuff and it made me sick thankfully i watched it alongside mst3k's mike and the bots so it made it bearable horrid acting unsettling mother daughter moment silly premise if you want a bad movie here it is be warned though watch it with mike and the bots or you will suffer br br 1 out of 10 i still can't believe it won an award and the director is defending this piece of movie
<START> i saw this on zone horror and fully expected it to be compete crap like most of the films they play however i was pleasantly surprised the film revolves around 2 friends and a maniac in a monster truck who is chasing them i know it sounds crap but its actually quite good the film is creepy when it intends to be and is laugh out loud funny in parts and not in an unintentional way either it is well paced and is a lot of fun as well as being very gory there's some very funny black humour thrown in as well its not the most original movie but so what if your after shakespeare then this is not it if your after a fun movie then this should be fine
<START> im usually wary of movies hovering around the 6 10 mark on imdb id like to think people know what they are talking about and know what they like i guess the trick with reviewing is to take an approach of hey if i liked types of movies like these would i give it a higher score than i am about to give it now since i don't like these types of movies then again people judge differently basing more value on acting or perhaps story or directing anyway landing the plane here i had rented this movie out before and hadn't had time to watch it this morning i did br br wow see this movie i am personally interested in the paranormal have read a bit about near death experiences so automatically i was hooked i am unsure about some of the comments here saying that a quality cast here was wasted i disagree the acting here was superb from all i think this is the only time i didn't mind julia roberts it was good to see kiefer sutherland currently at the time of this review serving a jail sentence for dui and kevin bacon sporting an interesting hair style br br overall i liked the direction the atmosphere the acting and the story line most of all particularly the idea of karma and to quote nelson wright everything we does matters so true br br 10 10
<START> i was 12 years old when i saw the original film i lived in italy and the italian title was fbi operation cat that was a fun film and not just for kids this awful remake it's pathetic even for a 5 year old what possessed disney to ruin their reputation and the memory of a lovely film i don't know and i just can't believe it even the title song in the original film both original version and the dubbed italian version was extremely nice and creating the mood for the story on this remake the title song is even worst than the movie itself it was just nice to see dean jones even if for just a cameo appearance he was a regular on the great old disney's films i cannot honestly see anything else positive in this remade movie
<START> i can't believe that i let myself into this movie to accomplish a favor my friends ask me early this april 14 2007 this movie certainly a pain in your ass in theater and sickly boring i haven't even felt the gory impact of its daunting scenes which i deem to be complete failure to attract its audience the worst even trampled me cause my friend failed to come on time at the theater because she was busy assisting her boyfriend in looking for an appropriate lodge to stay in for one night i wasn't really disappointed with that matter but this movie is a matter indeed for me poor plot useless storyline naively created and i don't know what to say anymore br br the title doesn't suggest anyway the creeps and horror it failed to overture us viewers maybe the beating of the animals could get more the creeps if they show it in theaters the real situational play good luck to anyone who attempts to watch it anyway
<START> could someone please explain to me the reason for making this movie sad is about all i can say this movie took absolutely no direction and wound up with me shaking my head what an awful waste of two hours noth should be ashamed of himself for taking money for this piece of garbage
<START> thomas edison had no other reason to make this film except to show that film can capture the electrocution of an innocent elephant edison was not a genius but a man out for money and profit his love for life was measured by dollars not experiences as this film shows
<START> whoa this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen the packaging for the film is better than the film itself my girlfriend and i watched it this past weekend and we only continued to watch it in the hopes that it would get better it didn't br br the picture quality is poor it looks like it was shot on video and transferred to film the lighting is not great which makes it harder to read the actors' facial expressions the acting itself was cheesy but i guess it's acceptable for yet another teenage horror flick the sound was a huge problem sometimes you have to rewind the video because the sound is unclear and or muffled br br it holds no real merit of it's own trying to ride on the coattails of sleepy hollow don't bother with this one
<START> along with in the army this ranks as one of pauly shore's best movies if there is such a thing while the whole west coast meets midwest culture clash isn't anything new this film proves to make the story a little more entertaining with the wild and unpredictable antics of a then fresh shore while the change in values probably would have gone in the other direction the whole concept was rather entertaining not only was shore's interaction with the family hilarious it also had carla and tiffani amber theissen she'll always have the amber in my book in two ravishing and early roles one of those films i have no problem watching when it is on tv
<START> i've tried watching it twice though i haven't been able to make through either episode for me it's basically just not funny i can tell where i'm suppose to laugh but i can't i've never seen the original so i'm not comparing i also love comedies including off the wall comedies like married with children and family guy but this show just doesn't' do it for me the jokes are lame and flat and the acting is mostly annoying the commercials made it look interesting but it isn't they're trying too hard to be different and tying to force the humor that style usually doesn't work too well i don't think this show finishes the season of course i could be wrong
<START> i was prepared for a bad movie and a bad movie it is so i guess i shouldn't complain twentysomething tom gay poster boy robert has so many issues he doesn't know if he's coming or going i wouldn't have stayed but for the pretty girls serious anna no nonsense angie emma sarah as the star of the movie within the movie and then there's tom's soul mate wild eyed margarete jana she reminds me of bÃ©atrice dalle and gina gershon if you've got to remember these are fine memories she looks good even in the most ridiculous outfits and i mean ridiculous even by berlin standards i wonder whether i'd have liked this movie when i was the characters' age my guess is i wouldn't watch out for indie idols and max of der marie performing as street musicians feeling no pain
<START> this is fairly typical for the sci fi channel one dimensional characters a ridiculous plot and terrible special effects we've got some alien sock puppets loose on a train and lou diamond phillips does his best with what little he's given to eke out a performance and save the day everyone else in this is utterly dispensable the ex wife who goes through the time honored clichÃ© of first disliking lou then of course comes to love him again at the end the obnoxious state senator who gets munched early on and a gaggle of dull security guards who run around a lot then there's an eco terrorist who is in this movie for absolutely no reason whatsoever except to provide us with 3 more running around he spends the whole middle part of the movie hiding in a box br br the special effects really deserve their own paragraph we start with a meteorite that flies through the air trailing flames behind it at about 100 miles per hour according to the physics of this movie if you exceed the posted speed limit in your car atmospheric friction may cause you to burst into flames then it lands on the hood of a car coming in sort of like a ball landing on a floor i guess it really doesn't damage the car much just bends up the hood a little bit later on lou gets in a helicopter and goes chasing after the train even though the train only had a two minute head start it takes a good half hour to catch it the cgi is so bad that the helicopter looks like it's as big as the hills it's flying over then it flies into the side of a mountain this effect must be seen to be believed it looks like they took a jar of gasoline and threw it against a wall then superimposed the flame effect over the helicopter about 10 times too big no wonder the helicopter couldn't pull up in time it was carrying five tons of nitro then the eco terrorist eventually blows himself up but instead of exploding in all directions like most explosions do he explodes upwards like a cannon aimed into the air then there's the whole deal with not being able to stop the train because that would allow the little aliens to get off but it appears that the aliens can actually fly faster than the train is traveling so why this would keep them on the train i have no idea br br overall if you've got a couple of hours that absolutely need killing and it's down to this movie or reruns on the food network well come to think of it some of those chefs are kind of cute usually these movies have at least one or two things about them that make it possible to sit through them maybe there's a sexy girl some t a or a character that actually has some personality or some suspense or well something i really didn't see any of that here
