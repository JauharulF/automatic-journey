<START> it's a shame barry humphries infamous sir les patterson character had it's film debut in this under cooked spy comedy br br this film reminded me of the beatty hoffman stinker ishtar 1987 humphries should have learned from the mistakes that film made if your going to change gears on a concept don't use spies like ishtar the first 20 minutes or so offer a promise of something different it would have been great to see the anachronistic and boorish patterson around in the world of australian politics one of characters even point out that patterson is of date with the current times you'd think could of had a field day making commentary on the hawke government i can just picture a scene with patterson and in a drinking contest but instead of a film that might of been clever and even a biting look into that world we get patterson running around the world as james bond trying to save the world from bio chemical weapons that runs out of steam before the half way mark br br disappointing
<START> excellent drama about 2 alienated spoiled punks who go afoul of the federal government each for his own reasons one a druggie just wants to score some bucks for his next fix but the other has a far more sinister agenda fueled in part by a resentment of his father good performances and a hot script makes this a winner
<START> as a long time resident of western pa i have an intimate knowledge of this topic and found it to be so authentically captured on film kudos to the producers of this epic and what a great legacy to the school children for years to come br br the attention to detail and realistic depiction of this complicated web of events make it a one of a kind production br br viewers will find themselves mesmerized by the storyline and captivated by the storytelling br br grahame greene is magnificent as the presenter br br bravo
<START> the cavern 2 out of 10 blair witch meets the cave and gives me a headache br br i have something to ask all film schools could you please teach future directors how to hold a camera steady flailing the camera around like aunt betty with 12 drinks is headache inducing br br also film is primarily a visual medium directors may want to point their camera's in the general direction of the action film also requires light to work perhaps a light source should be employed so one can see the action on the screen i know it is a cave movie but there is absolutely nothing frightening about watching pitch blackness for minutes at a time br br for that matter showing the film upside down doesn't indicate confusion on screen it indicates confusion in the editing booth br br a last note to the director i'm sure there was a good reason to have a horribly fake cgi campfire i honestly can't for the life of me think of one br br now on to the screenwriter try to make at least one character likable i'd prefer two or more but one decent person i can root for or care about might help also if you are going to have flashbacks make them relevant to the story br br if you are going to have a surprise ending it is probably best if it doesn't contradict every single thing that comes before it and try adding some fancy spelunking terms to a cave movie you might have wanted to start with spelunking br br the cavern is a pretty bad film poorly shot with a confusing improbable and anticlimactic ending
<START> after i saw this i concluded that it was most likely a chick flick afterward i found out that keira's mother wrote the screenplay so that pretty much confirmed it however a chick flick can have some appeal to men this one does not and really seems not to appeal that well either to women looking at the dismal box office receipts one item that i believe both genders agree upon is the stupidity of the the scene in the movie whereby an analogy is made between the pain of childbirth to the pain of a limb being amputated w o anesthesia though men do not undergo the pain of childbirth we understand that it is a painful process yet it is a natural pain whereas an amputation certainly is not women understand this even better i suspect some woman was trying to make a feminist statement that is in poor taste in fact a lot of things in this movie are in very poor taste though movies nowadays are known for having poor taste this one really excels in that department this could have been a good movie that shows the struggles of dylan thomas during wwii and how strong the sentiment was against men who somehow managed to avoid serving in the military then keira's screen writing mother tries to show how this sentiment was used against dylan but really muddles this instead we get a chick flick about how two young mothers bond together sort of in a way perhaps somehow of note is the fact that a soldier the husband of the friend of dylan's wife is sent back home after serving in combat yet it is unclear if the war has ended a lot of things about this movie are similarly unclear and though i have stated that already i will do so again as it seems to be the central motif of this mess
<START> great subject matter director and cast somehow adds up to a truly abysmal film told in that flat semi documentary style that was so popular around the time this film was made and hello this is not a film noir the lackluster overly complicated over populated story has no arc no focus point little excitement and staggers from one scene to the next with no discernible purpose other than as a valentine to the supposed and highly doubtful cooperation between the american and mexican governments on the issue of illegal immigration br br the scene that made me hate this film is when montalban and mitchell make a daring escape from their captors race to presumably save injured partner from being murdered by a goon with a gun driving a piece of farm machinery montalban says something like quick we must try to save him but instead of doing so they lie on their stomachs and watch in agony for about 5 minutes of screen time as the machine bears down on murphy and finally runs him over or so we assume the machine simply stops another goon detects the presence of the two rescuers and shoots at them as they run off again scene over the whole thing is so horribly filmed and utterly anticlimatic there's nothing worse than a protagonist ostensibly montalban though he's off screen for over half the film who doesn't even try jeez ricardo do something br br i know it's anthony mann but hell not all of his films are classics people how bad does an old movie have to be around here to get anything lower than a 6 rating
<START> okay i'm sorry to the cast and crew for this review but this movie is by far the worst i've seen yet first off the acting was okay it could of been better especially in some parts but it was okay then there was the cheapest video camera which they used the violence was pretty good if it were paced faster it would be awesome but they didn't sigh scares the scares were well written in the script but not well done for instance spoiler here in the loft a girl is half way in it and the other half is in the dark bottom area of the barn house then she gets it the monster yanks her down and then you hear someones guts getting ripped out the scares could have been better if the music wasn't ripped from a cheap horror sounds cd the blood effects were pretty good but the blood was like that of kill bill k b pulled it off because it was meant to resemble old kung fu movies but when the crew can't tell the difference between red and pink it's sad the ripped up bodies in the movie were good but the scarecrow costumes were something you would see for 25 bucks at a halloween store don't let the cover fool you the costumes suck my overall grade is a 3 10 if you are interested in independent movies are easily satisfied or just have 3 bucks burning a hole in your pocket go to blockbuster and see the horror of failure
<START> i caught this during a brief run in a philadelphia theater despite its local provenance and its relation to a hometown tragedy namely the beating death of eddie in 1994 i really have to come down hard on this movie the director for reasons best known to himself decided to shoot the entire film guerilla style with nonstop handheld cameras and cuts such technique might work for the scenes of jarring violence but is utterly inappropriate for the rest of the material which makes up the majority of the film a stroll down the sidewalk a brother to brother discussion on a sofa hell even a kiss on a first date are all shot style distracting this viewer from ever being able to enter into the drama martin also undercuts his narrative by packing in far too many topics besides the birth of mob violence we get anorexia alcoholism divorce racism parental abuse did i miss anything no doubt a better cast and a better focused direction would have knit these threads together as martin surely intended to demonstrate how one moral flaw leads into and sustains a host of others but good intentions do not necessarily a great film make just a sprawling mess martin i know you're from my town and i'm down with you man i really am just do a better job next time like you did in two plus one
<START> i liked it better than house party 2 3 the cast was hilarious and cool at the same time chris who directed the film has a very humorous cameo in it as a car repairman look for his mom who plays the lead character john john's grandmother and you can hear her rap the title song down to the last minute at the end of the film as the credits roll she's very funny and a really good actress as well the young actors who star in it the main trio and who in reality are part of the music group did a superb job before this film i had not paid much attention to this r b group now i'm a fan the music number in the house party scene alone is worth checking out the movie i was pleasantly surprised i loved it
<START> gorgeous annie belle in her prime stars in this adventure sex movie she wears her hair in a buzz cut that is bleached platinum she and her boyfriend are visiting some tropical asian paradise they have decided to keep an open sexual relationship which is played out on their journey to find a secret society tribe where the people live one year and then are reborn in some kind of ceremony the scenery is gorgeous deep vast green gorges and jungles are explored the imagery is very similar to that of the movie black emanuelle it is rich and colorful recommended
<START> i completely disagree with the other comments i too saw this film at an early screening and found it quite enjoyable robin williams is in top form true the tone is familiar but it is williams of good morning vietnam smart funny on point after too many dark turns williams is finally back to what he does best the supporting actors give great performances especially laura linney and chris walken chris plays himself as usual but as the agent to the next president he was a delight each time on screen lewis black plays only himself basically but he is wonderfully well used here there is also a fun turn by jeff goldblum the movie is more than what the trailer suggests as well the movie is funny but it is not a pure comedy as suggested it has a bit of a thriller line which everyone should seriously consider especially if you pay attention to the newspaper
<START> betty sizemore renee zellweger lives her life through soap opera a reason to love as a way to escape her slob husband and dull life after a shocking incident involving two hit men morgan freeman and chris rock betty goes into shock and travels to la believing that she is destined to marry the show's main character greg kinnear br br nurse betty is that rare thing a lesser known film with an all star cast and a fluffy rom com plot that surprises with it's terrific script and spot on acting indeed such a plot makes one question the r rating but it's warranted all right the shocking incident that sends betty over the edge is a tad too graphic compared to the light amusing comedy that is to come and feels like something out of a different movie but at the same time it is necessary to believably show betty's transformation into the doe eyed lovable nut job she becomes br br as we go along with betty on her journey director neil labute works some extraordinary magic which makes the movie unique and high above your bog standard comedy of error an example of this would be betty's first meeting with her crush she pours her heart out to him and he plays along thinking she's auditioning for a part on the show even as we are aware of the ludicrous nature of betty's ramblings the music swells as she speaks giving us the audience betty's emotional perspective we almost believe what she is saying yet we understand that her mind is fractured whereas other filmmakers would try to accent the ridiculousness of the situation to wring every ounce of possible comedy out of the scene labute is sensitive to his main character and treats her with the utmost sympathy and understanding br br the banter between the hit men played by freeman and rock is priceless the excellent script doling out clever line after clever line for them to riff off of freeman in particular is excellent as always pacing himself as his character slowly and blindly falls in love with his own ideal of betty not even truly knowing who she is or what has happened to her aaron once again shows versatility in the thankless role of betty's no good husband and he is almost unrecognisable the other revelation here is kinnear whose portrayal of the star is not too overcooked there's a tendency to lay on the celebrity bastard clichÃ© as thickly as possible and kinnear resists instead imbuing him with a pompous yet restrained self importance despite simply being a soap star br br the soap opera is realised so well it could almost exist labute and co hit the nail on the head with this one and a good thing too if the soap opera had been too satirical a large part of the film would not have worked to do a days of our lives spoof as seen in friends would have been the wrong move for this movie the dedication to detail pays off as the style and feel of the soap opera begins to bleed into betty's reality more and more while keeping with the overall unintentionally comedic aspect of the genre the scenes on the set feel real as opposed to some films in which the atmosphere feels so manufactured you wondered why people who do it for a living can't get it right br br the neat resolution of the final act while being a tad predictable is wholly satisfying overall it's a shame that after labute directed this wonderful film the mainstream came calling for him to direct the abysmal remake of the wicker man a fine example of a man so totally above the material given to him unfortunately one cannot absolve him of all responsibility br br if you haven't seen nurse betty it's something to discover if you have it's worth a re visit there is a charm to nurse betty that is infectious even if it may not leave you thinking that much afterwards a hidden gem nonetheless
<START> br br very slow plodding movie with a confusing story line the movie's only hope of keeping the audience interested is the gratuitous nudity thrown in at regular intervals ellen barkin is miscast and her looks do not hold up when she is on screen with the much younger peta wilson not sure what this movie was about
<START> unimpressive and extremely low budget sci fi without any charm and appeal even the scenes related with the fall of the asteroids are stolen from other movies with the same plot it's just a bad rip off of asteroid with and deep impact with morgan freeman mr hopper seems to be anxious to slip away from this pointless and dull sci fi entry br br i give this a 2 two and don't say i'm not a good guy
<START> i would like to say that i absolutely loved campfire tales to me it was one of the original horror flicks with a twisted ending as if the contents of the movie weren't scary or weird enough you have the ending it's a very awesome movie and i'm so happy that it's being released on dvd on august 30th i will not hesitate to get my copy on that day i don't think the movie received all the credit or recognition it should have because all these other movies came out shortly after and was acknowledge but if it weren't for my brother telling me about the movie i wouldn't have known which stinks because in my opinion it's far better than any scream i know what you did last summer or any other horror for that time so i hope that you are able to see the movie yourself and at least be able to see the difference i loved it and being a horror movie junkie campfire tales was like dessert for me
