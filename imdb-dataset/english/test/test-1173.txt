<START> i attended a screening of fierce people at the 2006 woodstock film festival i hesitate to label it a premiere of any sort since it was shot in the spring of 2004 and had its world premiere at tribeca in 2005 it played several festivals that year release seemed imminent then it disappeared poof vanished or so it appeared to the film going public rumors of a theatrical or dvd release have popped up now and then but all proved unfounded then this screening was announced perhaps one can call it a re premiere it certainly felt as if i was witness to a buried treasure and what a treasure it was br br i suppose one could characterize fierce people as a coming of age drama but it also has elements of comedy and tragedy as well as mystery and a bit of farce thrown in in short real life that makes it hard to pigeonhole which puts it more into the category of an indie as opposed to a hollywood movie but its high production values big budget feel and star caliber cast seem at odds with the indie label so let's call it a hybrid and perhaps that's why it's been lost it defies br br meet finn earl anton yelchin 15 whose father is absent in fact finn has never known him but he sees him and hears him via the collection of home movies sent from south america dad is a renowned anthropologist and has made a name for himself by setting up shop with the the tribe of fierce people who live to kill and well procreate all their activities are built around those two tasks and finn is captivated by it mom liz diane lane is also somewhat absent although present physically she is lost in a world of cocaine and alcohol so finn becomes an adult in his little solitary world with his reels of film br br one summer mom decides to drag finn along with her into the wilds of new jersey a massage therapist mom has catered to a wealthy client ogden c osborne donald sutherland in a tour de force performance and he has invited her for an extended house call at his palatial estate tribe includes an assortment of eccentric rich kids servants and village idiots among whom finn will find himself part of his own anthropological study will his experience with dad's films help him survive life as a visitor to this tribe will he be accepted or will he be seen as an outsider concurrently struggling with his own identity as an adolescent such is the stuff of fairy tales and i suppose this would be if not for the dark underbelly which director griffin dunne and writer dirk wittenborn have infused into this magnificent story br br with anton voice over intercutting pieces of dad's home movies finn must learn to go back to being the teenager he never really had a chance to be stop being the parent to his mom allow newly sober mom to be parent to him and learn responsibility on the way to adulthood the way it should have taken place all along yet he needs to make this transformation in a dangerous dark world where playing with fire is folly to this fractured family br br this is first and foremost a story driven film and griffin dunne emphasized as much in the intro to the film he bought the rights to wittenborn's novel even as it was being written and wittenborn's own screenplay comes to life in the hands of the masterful dunne in a way that's a work of wonder br br this is also largely a character driven film and sutherland has never been better his star turn as osborne stunned those around me and will likely leave you amazed as well diane lane's character ultimately exhibits so many personalities that it's hard to imagine another actor pulling it off so well she is breathtaking but more than anything fierce people is anton film he has a long resume as a child actor but preciously little as a teen other than the little known house of d also a gem he is best known as byrd on tv's huff in january he will be seen in alpha dog also sitting on the shelf since 2004 a film i saw at sundance this year and in which he is the heart and soul his performance here goes far beyond what one would expect from someone so young and is nothing short of spectacular br br this complex quirky film has remained out of sight long enough fierce people is a treasure filled with light and shadow comedy and tragedy joy and pathos but mostly wonder
<START> surely this deserves to be in the bottom 10 films of all time pity it's just a tv movie rubbish that only we british can produce it perhaps has some merit in the so awful it's good scale watch out for scene where they start dancing
<START> there is a solid group of people that have lives like this girl going through the process at school the parental absence at all important junctures in lauren school search provide interviews only and draws the interviews with them at below transcript quality review that in 30 minutes sabotages four years of high school grading the incident of anger in her mother obviously block a mothers display of possible physical abuse of her or her disabled sister at one time or another thus masking her mother's truer involvement in family losses the daughter lauren really has done something big trying to make her mother fulfilled and then that plan itself somewhat heroic in light of the age she is still giving when everyone around her taking somersaults on her a heart not yet connected to her head something that age has never had a genuine answer to even to this day her replacement of a significant other not necessarily requiring a father image however a trusted authority nonetheless being imagined if not real a pure cup without a handler see the movie everyone needs a friend to see through understanding of a proportional world she made hers up on what she knew of life at the time she has all the mental capacity for higher learning though having no friends present for her time makes the ending a developmental tragedy in progress given a bird in a cage not a puppy that would a least get her walking two times a day ideas out of the roof she is under would be the developing on her sidewalk life sad is the looming psychiatric ending how could she be committed at a time when she has proved an important responsibility believe it or not taking of a dog is a better witness than taking care of a bird at this time of her life the symbolic cage of her in a cage is too much mental and self fulfilling of some of her writings within the story the neighbor college freshman is developed just fine he is as developed as the training education will allow for the mental maturity that dwarfs her eternal purpose compared to his fateful conditioning i myself eventually just went to the mensa magazine and got a 20 00 degree saying i was an it offered all the education that buying the truth would and independence to skip fecal content run the world or do not get your own home was the college offer who was freeing anyone for superior time for the learning the only sin is not having your pleasure right what fight on that she has been denied an act for life commensurate to her love for life what is college a reward for failing high school do you graduate with your class or without it what is the exchange a lifetime of youth with only questions could lead occur w o a question the loss followed as much for good as bad when was she given a mind for sexual intimacy or growth for her good self to be fulfilled why didn't good people treat her with good things if good people do not do good things for good people what is good for she is young pretty and walked on long before personal development is given a winning game her act taken in life with a closed door perhaps the title would be better as christmas doors not
<START> i never saw any of the work until early last year although when channel hopping one night i caught the end of one the series three episodes but last winter i fell in love with the show and its dark eccentric and sometimes downright sinister characters so when i learnt they had made a film in which the show's lovable creators met their own characters i couldn't order the dvd fast enough and near on tore it from my hands when he delivered it i was so excited to see what the gents had done and how they'd done it br br and it was excellent from the beginning where jeremy michael sheen is terrorised by edward tubbs and papa dyson why didn't you play yourself he's perfectly capable as viewers of the infamous house of horrors know to bernice berating yet another one of her flock to geoff herr and hilary discovering that they are characters which is a great scene the scenes set in are very enjoyable with the gents turning their hands to yet more characters and an all new plot david warner's turn as doctor pea is fantastic slightly camp and very funny br br the league have always been brilliant at blending humour with sadness and emotion and the climax of this film where herr is struggling with the idea that he and the other vasey residents are just fictional people who will never be able to change who they are or their purpose and to witness how it's breaking him down is really sad and beautiful to watch at the same time and that really shows the talent something for which they are terribly overlooked for to this day br br and then you have that rather clever ending where you sit in wonder with joby beautiful theme music playing and you know you've enjoyed a very clever and funny film
<START> grim instead of amusing mean spirited instead of playful boring instead of interesting it won't give you the willies but it just may gross you out or send you to sleep and it will certainly make you wonder what were they thinking 1 2
<START> i usually like hongkong martial arts fantasy movies but i hated this one once upon a time in china shogun assassin a chinese ghost story and even big trouble in little china are my favorites but this film sucked too much fancy tricks and stupid story br br 4 10
<START> i had just finished reading the book and was really looking forward to seeing this tv adaptation which was broadcast on the hallmark channel on monday night 5 30 05 the key to the whole book was the manifesto which was stolen by the man with steel teeth but i watched for an hour out of 3 1 2 and i saw the man with the steel teeth but i never saw him steal a manifesto i saw someone steal some virus but what did that have to do with the book it's too bad because this film had great production values and a good cast but isn't the idea of turning a book into a movie tv or film to get the people who read the book to be part of the audience they only kept me for an hour i thought the premise of the book was great and what did they do but throw out the whole premise this book had a great mcguffin to paraphrase hitchcock but they ignored it and it said in the titles that forsyth was involved in the production they sure must have paid him a lot of money
<START> although it doesn't seem very promising for a long stretch renoir's french cancan ends up being an effortlessly charming film the story is clichÃ© a laundry girl franÃ§oise is discovered by a night club owner jean gabin steals her from her baker boyfriend and drops his current girlfriend both of whom come back for their former lovers has to choose whether to go back to her humble life with the baker go on with the show with her employer oh or become a princess as a prince falls in love with her at one point too i'm glad the film didn't go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have the film ends with the opening of new night club the moulin rouge and a couple of gorgeous song and dance numbers the first of them de la butte which also provides the base of most of the film's musical score is simply one of the most gorgeous songs ever written and renoir himself wrote it if you're a fan of baz luhrmann's 2001 film moulin rouge you'll recognize the tune as it comes up near the beginning of that film sung by rufus wainwright although it isn't very prominent in that film everyone i know who owns the soundtrack loves it in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written french cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen it's hard not to fall head over heels in love with that girl 8 10
<START> so i give it one star for true quality but i'd give it an eight and a half for sheer enjoyability an incredibly strange hybrid of sex comedy and vigilante thriller young warriors is just the sort of bad movie you usually hope to find when poking around the video fringe yet so rarely do it starts off with about half an hour of wacky hi jinx sex jokes and juvenile shenanigans including an olive in the martini joke that has to be seen not to be believed then the main character's younger sister gets gang raped by a bunch of swarthy bikers an objectionable scene that keeps me from giving this a 10 for entertainment value rape is not entertainment and the main character gets the rest of his sex crazed frat brothers to help him in a quest to clean up the city find the responsible bikers and kill anybody slightly criminal they run into along the way br br it's hilarious non stop fun apart from the very unpleasant rape scene and is essential viewing to any serious bad movie fan trust me i've put my time in on these things and this is one of the best highlights include a wonderful visit to the library a great flickering slo mo shootout in a sleazy bar with a shot of a guy blowing his own foot off that's pretty impressive a couple of decent slumming actors richard roundtree ernest borgnine a couple of semi famous recognizable faces lynda day george scream queen linnea quigley and a couple of relatives of famous people chuck norris' brother mike van patten clan member james it even has one of those great what have we become type morality lesson endings although the turning point comes when the vigilante gun down a couple of kids robbing a store with a toy gun i've always wondered why that was the catalyst that got the hero thinking after all whether they were kids and not hardened criminals and whether they had a real gun or not they were in fact still robbing a store so as far as i can tell it was just another job well done for our vigilante frat boys right wonderful stuff highly recommended just don't blame me when you enjoy it despite yourself
<START> i want to say i liked this film i really do but when it boils down to it it was just far too boring it starts off looking promising and even once they get inside the mines the creepy atmosphere and mood is great the problem is the monster or lack of it as people have said it's a stop motion monster but that's not the problem stop motion can look great if done properly the problem is that we don't see enough of it and we don't get to see any deaths this is meant to be a horror film so a lack of monster and a lack of deaths equals boredom there were some scenes i liked such as when one girl is using her camera in the dark and the monster is coming towards her there are also a few other creepy scenes but they are far too few to hold your interest and definitely not worth watching the film for it's a shame because i can see that had it been handled correctly it would've been an effectively creepy horror flick the saddest thing is that films like this will never be made again because film makers over polish their films these days and rely on crappy cgi effects
<START> no it's just a cheap 1940s serial using the good name if you are a fan of the comic book you will be greatly disappointed they have radically changed the character no shield no no fighting the nazis no wings on the side of his mask and most importantly captain america is now a district attorney and no longer a gi br br dick purcell as captain america don't look too closely when he changes into his costume it is pretty obvious that he was not in the best physical shape when he made this serial can you say flabby it is also very obvious that a stunt man is performing most of the action here almost every chapter has an obligatory fist fight that is shot and performed in exactly the same way the villain is rather bland and although he uses an alias the scarab he doesn't wear a disguise of any kind the story is repetitive and very simple the effects are laughable and the action is average on the plus side we have sexy lorna gray as the d a 's assistant and the good captain gets to ride on a cool looking motorcycle in one early chapter overall ok but nothing special
<START> back in 1982 a little film called making love shocked audiences with its frank and open depiction of a romantic love story that just happened to be about two men br br i have been waiting for years for a good old fashioned romance between two men latter days is all that and more br br yes it is soapy melodramatic clichÃ© ridden and quite corny that is what makes it so wonderful there is nothing like a good romantic movie and this movie is romantic in the best sense of the word br br as to the issue of religion sorry folks but these things do happen and are happening to gay people even now it is not just the mormon church that rejects its gay members gay people in every religion have faced harsh judgment and rejection br br i loved this movie it has a perfect blend of a fantasy romance grounded in the reality of the day to day lives of the characters if i could give it more than ten stars i would good love stories never go out of style great love stories like latter days are unforgettable br br it's about time
<START> spoilers this movie called eaten alive here in the uk is quite possibly the worst film ever made and is brilliant just for that a sexy rich girl teams up with a rugged action man to search for her sister in the new guinea jungle what follows is an unspeakably crap mixture of cannibalism insane cults and religious maniacs that has to be seen to be believed the cannibalism scenes are quite horrific but are so badly staged and acted that they prove quite amusing the cast are awful except for janet as the female lead who is excellent look out for the scene where she is stripped naked and covered with gold paint my rating 1 out of 10
<START> i love das boot i hoped for something along similar lines a realistic war movie portraying and civilians on both sides as real people with both the joy and pain of combat br br unfortunately stalingrad appears to have been written by a third grader and directed by a fifth grade student major pieces of the movie simply appear missing leaving it completely disjointed the dialogue in translation is ridiculous but appears no better in the native tongue you only have to watch the actors' faces during the bad moments of dialogue to realize just how bad this movie is
<START> dorothy stratten is the only reason to watch this unfunny sci fi spoof and her appearance is a disappointment though she has the title role her screentime is limited and she only speaks a few lines of dialogue if you're not a stratten fan pass this one up
