<START> i hope from his seat on heaven's comedic throne spike milligan can see and can enjoy this film as terence ryan and ken have taken a book that the author himself said writing it nearly turned me mad into a joy to watch br br the film tells the story of the irish town of and the problems befallen upon it when the partition between northern ireland and the republic is drawn up cutting its way through the centre of the village and more worringly through the middle of the this causes some deceased buried in the catholic to now be in the protestant north and so the local priest assisted by a wide variety of eccentric locals aims to move the bodies back undercover of darkness and so avoiding the bureaucratic british border guards br br it was inspired work to cast the irish comedian and poet sean hughes to play the part of madigan he brings an innocence to the part especially in his to camera pieces which is normally where he interacts with the voiceover of richard attenborough playing supposedly the writer director of the film playing father is also worthy of considerable praise and the rest of the cast from the household names like elliott gould and rhys jones to people with what would normally be called such as spike's daughter jane who plays wife give 100 the credit for this goes in no small part to the wonderful characterisations given by spike in the original book br br i could argue that the film is slightly too long or that elliott gould's irish accent left a little to be desired but those would be only minor points and take nothing away from the excellence of this film
<START> even with only 6 000 bucks and a cast of part time actors christopher nolan was a master nolan is in my opinion the next great and our first taste of nolan doesn't contradict that br br none of the problems that constantly plaque and discredit the low budget independent picture haunt nolan and crew our actors are inexperienced and young but they deliver and engage us in this story in all honesty i think following is nolan's best screenplay because it is the one he had the most control over it's a beautifully imagined film it takes us into a world where we don't feel limited by the constraints of budget the dialogue and atmosphere is bold and intelligent br br nolan's trademark method of telling the story out of continuity is applied for the first time here and here it is done in a way that throws the story full out at you with memento and the prestige you have to think a bit to truly get a complete grasp on the genius but nolan doesn't try to confuse people with his prototype film we can distinguish time by the appearance of our protagonist this method of telling a story is both creative and engaging i am glad that nolan has had so much success with it because his films become more than what they could be with this method the pay offs in the prestige and memento would not have been thrilling at all if the movie was told in a conventional format this idea has been done with moderate success before but nolan has truly made it his own br br the script here is nolan's finest i had some doubts about his writing abilities i all ways imagined that his brother jonathon was the writing talent but he proves me wrong with following it is a thought provoking story which makes interesting observations of people and how they function assessments about burglarizing and how it can lead you to discover what makes people tick actually sounds plausible br br my only real complaint is the camera work gets shaky at times but it doesn't take away anything from the story or the acting br br following is the first film of the man who will personify 21st century film making at it's finest
<START> this movie starts out the way every movie should start out with a bunch of hot babes in a dorm walking around in their undies and or topless a couple of them take showers i'm liking it so far unfortunately we then meet or main characters they're just not particularly likable usually in these movies the actresses aren't really acting they give very natural performances and they're quite sympathetic fun and likable not here they don't have much of any personality and i didn't care for them much br br some of the girls go on a camping trip for school on the way they stop at a backwoods gas station and meet a biker gang the biker gang should really have been left out of the movie it was cheesy before but now it's just plain stupid the head biker looks like a middle aged guy dressed up as john bon jovi for halloween the girls go out to the woods and later the biker gang follows them br br i don't really know what the heck happens after that there's a bunch of stuff about the world ending because it's the end of the millennium then some of the bikers get killed by a mysterious indian dude who keeps disappearing somebody gets eaten by a cheesy lock ness monster thing as he's swimming across a lake some guy in silly makeup is apparently a druid and he needs to sacrifice some of the girls in order to forestall the end of the world or maybe cause the end of the world i'm afraid i wasn't paying much attention first he dresses the girls up in animal skin lingerie br br it could have been a really fun cheesy movie but the biker gang kind of ruined the atmosphere and the plot was so scatterbrained that it didn't even live up to my grade z schlock expectations they really should have eliminated half the plot elements and just focused on one or two things instead it's all over the place overall if you're looking for late '80 schlock i imagine you could do worse if you tried really hard there's plenty of nudity at the beginning but the characters are kind of crummy and the plot is too nonsensical to be even the least bit satisfying
<START> this film is great with some of the best songs preformed by bon jovi and kiss the film is about a man named chris mark wahlberg who is the biggest fan of a band named steel dragon and then when he gets the gig for lead singer his world changes upside down with great acting by jennifer aniston this film is a must see for rock lovers br br 4 5 stars
<START> when my own child is begging me to leave the opening show of this film i know it is bad i wanted to claw my eyes out i wanted to reach through the screen and slap mike myers for sacrificing the last shred of dignity he had this is one of the few films in my life i have watched and immediately wished to unwatch if only it were possible the other films being 'troll 2' and 'fast and furious' both which are better than this crap in the hat br br i may drink myself to sleep tonight in a vain attempt to forget i ever witnessed this blasphemy on the good seuss name br br to mike myers i say stick with austin or even resurrect waynes world just because it worked for jim carrey doesn't mean seuss is a success for all canadians br br
<START> before barton jumps all over my remarks let's all just keep in mind that opinions are like asses we all have them br br i loved sigourney weaver jeff daniels i loved the dialogue and thought the acting was sublime downplayed just perfectly and understated unlike some others i did not find this all predictable br br i found role refreshingly humorous and realistic especially her scene confronting the bully in the trailer br br i found it enjoyable and wasn't anticipating recommending this to all and sundry this is why there are different flavors of ice cream something to please everyone
<START> unfortunately this movie is absolutely terrible it's not even laughably bad just plain bad the actors do their best with what is the cheesiest script ever how scary can a movie be when the climax actually involves a roomful of millions of styrofoam peanuts
<START> the film begins with ingrid bergman and her two freaky servants arriving in new orleans from paris apparently years earlier her mother was involved in a scandal and ingrid returned in an effort to irritate kin who would have sooner forgotten she or her mother existed that's because she reasons if they are shocked enough they'll pay her off to get rid of her then with this money she will leave new orleans and seek out a millionaire somewhere else as she poses as a countess along the way gary cooper shows up and looks totally out of place as a love interest br br it's amazing that this film wasn't the reason that ingrid bergman's film career plummeted her performance and character were that bad instead of the classy and demure female she usually played in films she is probably one of the most annoying characters in film her fake contessa was shallow demanding unpredictable and stupefyingly dumb how she was able to vamp any man seemed a mystery as she seemed less vampish than just plain nuts i am not exaggerating to say that she behaved at times like someone with a combination of a severe mental illness and a personality disorder and all these together make me think who in the world would fall in love with this mess frankly i couldn't stand watching her histrionics and narcissistic behavior and she looked more like a guest on the jerry springer show than a leading lady confusing awful and overacted are words that come to mind when i think about her role br br the rest of the cast is frankly overwhelmed by bergman's ranting and hysterics while gary cooper is generally an excellent leading man he is dominated by her and just looks lost and oddly they cast two total weirdos as her entourage flora robson and jerry austin ms robson is best known for her portrayals of queen elizabeth i but here for some odd reason they coated her in makeup and the end result looked much like the love child of a cigar store indian and aunt jemima her face was very wooden she sported odd eyebrows and she dressed like a slave as for mr austin he was a dwarf and while this shouldn't be held against him his role was written like he was a court jester a very very thankless role for someone who is vertically challenged overall the rotten acting writing and limp direction make this one of the big stinkers of the age nearly as pointless and dull as such famous turkeys as parnell and swing your lady
<START> i loved all the other don knotts movies but i never heard much about how to frame a fig and now i know why i can't think of anyone who would find it enjoyable this movie seems to appeal to 9 or 10 year olds but even most of them would give this a thumbs down at best there are brief moments of mild amusement mostly from don knotts playing the same nervous underdog persona that made him famous br br after the movie finally finished i was curious if my teenager could pick up on this movie's fatal flaw we were in complete agreement the prentiss gates sidekick character was even dumber than the don knotts character br br be happy that mr limpet reluctant astronaut gun and mr chicken movies are around to enjoy
<START> i am a huge fan of the original assault on precinct 13 the ice cream scene haunts me to this day i'm 33 now and i still remember being horrified by it as a child when i heard they were remaking it i thought it might be good but when i saw the film it's 100 not the same film it's not a remake it's a bad stolen idea it was completely ruined the cast maria bello laurence fishburne ethan hawke gabriel john leguizamo and drea de matteo are all great actors but even they couldn't save this film it was just wrong even the setting was completely opposite and how in the hell did no one in that city notice that there was a war going on next door why didn't help show up sooner stupid no sense
<START> i love this movie at first i didn't expect much of this movie since i didn't hear anyone talk about it and it seemed like it went on video soon after it had just opened in the theatres i also didn't think david and minnie would make a good on screen couple i've expected a lot out of on screen couples since i saw you've got mail and sleepless in seattle with tom hanks and meg ryan personally i think joely richardson should've played part and vice versa i don't know i just think joely should've stayed in the movie longer with david they seemed perfect for each other but it just figures that in a movie the girl next door always gets the guy like in while you were sleeping i was very wrong though this movie was fantastic everything was done brilliantly bonnie hunt did a great job of directing the lines were perfect with the wise cracks everywhere br br warning spoilers ahead br br i love how everything intertwined with each other for example in the beginning elizabeth and bob were talking about going to italy and in the end bob meets grace in italy sydney the ape doing the hand thing with grace like he had done with elizabeth is an example too br br notice spoilers end now br br one thing i didn't like about the movie was it was a little well i just don't think a man could get over his wife in a year when she was the only woman he had ever been with his entire life you'd think he'd isolate himself from the world for years before even coming out of his house to talk someone instead he goes on a blind date a year later and falls instantly in love with a woman he's never seen in his life but feels a connection with br br over all it was a splendid movie it had me crying two or three times and it had me laughing countless times the scene in the restaurant with bob's picky date for bottled water was hilarious it is definitely up there with great romantic comedies like you've got mail sliding doors and while you were sleeping br br go rent it today
<START> this movie has some good performances as others have pointed out but suffers as others have pointed out except for the people who apparently are either friends of the filmmaker or the cast to otherwise explain why they would deem this a 10 from some self conscious and self absorbed film school padding and excess plots this is the type of plot that sex in the city could handle in a half hour episode so there was no reason for it to be even an 88 minute movie a perfect example of wasted footage is the fast forwarding montage in the first third of the movie some of the back story is merited but too much time for example was spent on daria character with the anal sex boyfriend and on the back story for paulie who was not a realistic character although the actor did a decent job with the lines he was given br br the worst aspect of the movie was the level of amateurish parts from typos in the typed material to bad jumps and edits poor camera positions angles lighting problems throughout and most glaringly a poorly written script with a badly developed concept if the writer also the director and lead had collaborated with someone he might not have ended up with a 100 rotten score on rotten tomatoes which further the ability of anyone to truly believe the people who gave it a 10 on the rating system here
<START> this is the first and as far as i can tell the only completed production of heart of darkness ever released prior to starting on citizen kane orson welles shot some test footage for a version of heart of darkness that was to be filmed entirely in what would now be called pov where we would see everything from the point of view of the main character charlie marlow he would be seen only fleetingly in mirrors windows water etc the film was never made the pov technique was used not too successfully in 1947 in the lady in the lake with robert montgomery starring as philip marlowe presumably the coincidence of the two marlow e characters is just that of course francis coppola's apocalypse now was based on heart of darkness br br the short novel heart of darkness by the polish born british writer joseph conrad first serialized in a british literary magazine in 1899 features one of his favorite alter egos ship captain charlie marlow who also narrates the short story youth and indirectly tells the story of lord jim marlow temporarily out of work decides to take a job a river boat for a belgian company involved in the brutal exploitation of the resources of king leopold ii's personal the cruelly misnamed congo free state marlow travels from london to brussels signs on with the company and is told that his mission is to take a boat up the congo river to a far inland station headed by one of the company's most productive agents in the colony a german named kurtz shipments of ivory latex for the production of rubber and other products from station have ceased and no word has come downriver from kurtz for some time there are rumors that he has gone native marlow is to investigate take any necessary action and make a report on his return he takes passage down the west african coast to the mouth of the congo is delayed for weeks while he is forced to repair his boat at the company station on the coast and finally sets out upriver to find station the river the heat the vegetation the wildlife the insects the people all take their toll on his endurance his imagination and his mental resources he finds kurtz ill half mad and close to death the final encounter and the death of kurtz are almost an anticlimax especially since conrad is so obscure about what actually happens that we are left to puzzle it out for ourselves this is a novel where you close the book vaguely dissatisfied with the ending but nevertheless treasuring the story for its amazing atmospherics br br this heart of darkness was filmed with guyana in central america standing in for west africa it is best where the novel is at its greatest disadvantage actually showing us first world urbanites what a boat trip up a tropical river would look like but the rest of the film was forgettable tim roth does his best as marlow but so much about the plot characterizations and character relationships has been altered beyond recognition that you wonder why they bothered if the aim was to make conrad's story for the screen why didn't they leave it alone it's unreasonable to expect that no compromises will be made when a book is made into a movie but so many changes were made that to me had no cinematic justification that you wonder whether we are simply dealing with incompetent screenwriters and cinematographers most disappointing of all was john malkovich as kurtz he was completely miscast and simply flubs the role everything about him is wrong his looks his acting style his voice his accent everything a vastly better choice would have been someone like bruno ganz unlike malkovich an actual german like the character br br this is a very disappointing production and i would recommend it only after you've read the book if you want to depend on more than your imagination to get a visual picture of a boat trip up the congo river circa 1900
<START> the brave one seems to indicate that the main character of course is brave i'd disagree the more brave thing to do in a situation like the one that happens to her getting brutally beaten along with her fiancÃ©e who doesn't live another day from it is to go after the criminals without resorting to a total distorted view of society jodie foster's character erica is a radio personality who's niche is walking the streets and recording what goes on we're given no real depth aside from 'she had someone she loved he died the police don't pursue it she gets a gun yada yada yada she gets somewhat but not really involved with the lead detective' into the character and so were left with something leftover from past movies the vigilante code of justice where taking the power in one's own hands is all there is but we're never too sure if erica is sane or not if the filmmakers take a position one way or another that is until the end which is such a stupid message to take anyway dog included as overbearing metaphor while making the new york city of today which has become significantly safer than say twenty years ago look like you'll get knifed or beaten if you go down just the right alley or just sit alone on a subway car br br there could even be a somewhat better movie in the midst of all of this perhaps just in the undercooked subplot with terence howard's detective who is involved in some custody battle of a child that isn't his and a woman who he's not linked to and a step father who i don't know what aside from owning parking lots and being a bad dude but we're left to a script that's both ham fisted and disjointed with logic it becomes laughable for example to see that at first the logical side of erica unable to really shoot properly as seen in her first shooting in a convenience store at the convenient moment of a robbery of a wife by the husband and then giving way to the illogical of her crack shot at shooting at a pimp driving a car head on at her and killing him and ducking just in time to not get run over it doesn't help that style with the camera becomes a little more than insufferable it's called a cam for a reason not because it can weave in and out br br ironically the script and direction become very good or rather work the best they can under the desired circumstances when looking at the actual beating scene under the bridge caught between a video taped point of view by one of the criminals by the regular film cam in a pace that is perfectly disorienting and when erica first comes back on the air to her radio show and she freezes up trying to do her old shtick and speaks out a 'from the heart' about how afraid she is this scene from foster's performance to the clear direction and script is the best scene in the film but aside from that there's just a lot of posturing into a psychology that's flimsy is she a de niro in taxi driver or a bronson in death wish we have her narration over scenes some of it doesn't have to do at all with her radio show observing how disgusted she is with walking around at night nothing to do but her self imposed task of cleaning up the streets but unlike death wish a movie that held more ambiguity and never held an answer at the end in a revenge scenario the path of endless violence just heeds to a message one that won't be news to anyone who's seen a second of lifetime movie of the week melodrama br br the actors make do with what's given and in the end it becomes much more frustrating trying to stay with the anticipated the hackneyed plot turns and the plain old inexplicable plus the unintentionally hilarious like a few expletives shouted by howard after getting shot in one scene and the temptation to walk out grows stronger and stronger it's a very problematic picture with only a few moments of genuine interest and clear headed convention bending
<START> with looks that could kill and a willingness to display her charms paget's sensuality leaves no doubt as to where her assets lay br br she plays a sultry innocent 13th century princess who rouses her people to save egypt from the ambitions of a powerful michael rennie and joins her forces with the son of the of baghdad jeffrey hunter to save her trembling throne she also finds time to fulfill a great deal of exotic dancing her luscious legs make her hard to forget br br the emphasis is not on the plot but on the visual pleasure of a great number of beautiful girls in sensual costumes
