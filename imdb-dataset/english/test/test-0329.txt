<START> fulci is one of my all time favorite italian splatter directors he is also a very good story teller mixing horror the supernatural and psychedelic themes altogether very well this film was truly his last great story before he directed such disappointments as voices from beyond the story is simple as fulci plays himself a horror director after years of filming splatter and gore films it seems that fulci starts to suffer a breakdown in which he starts hallucinating about people being slaughtered he decides to see a psychiatrist who only makes matters worse when he convinces fulci that he is killing people br br fulci used gore scenes from several pictures around the same time these films i don't believe he directed but certainly produced some of those films are massacre directed by andrea bianchi burial ground touch of death directed by fulci the murders secret and i can't remember the rest of the films br br nightmare concert is a very underrated film even by fulci fans but i loved this movie and have watched it many times already it is sad that fulci didn't get a chance to direct anything worth while after this but nonetheless this is a great film and i do recommend it to any fulci fan whether you like it or not 9 10 stars
<START> i never realized what a fabulous dancer lana turner was until i saw this movie she was only 19 years old and gorgeous what a pleasure to watch her dance with george murphy the story line was typical for its day but the dancing was really special i never tire of watching fred and ginger but lana turner in this movie was just as terrific i always thought of lana as a so so actress who tended to over act she should have done more dancing and less of the x and peyton place roles i had a new appreciation for her after seeing this movie and her wonderful dancing too bad the academy doesn't give an oscar for dancing
<START> it came from outer space ii is a very good film that has a good cast which includes brian kerwin elizabeth peÃ±a jonathan adrian sparks bill mckinney dean norris dawn zeek lauren mickey jones jerry and howard morris the acting by all of these actors is very good kerwin and norris are really excellent in this film i thought that they performed good the thrills is really good and some of it is surprising the movie is filmed very good the music is great by shirley walker the film is quite interesting and the movie really keeps you going until the end this is a very good and thrilling film if you like brian kerwin elizabeth peÃ±a jonathan adrian sparks bill mckinney dean norris dawn zeek lauren mickey jones the rest of the cast in the film mystery sci fi thrillers dramas and interesting action films then i strongly recommend you to see this film today br br movie nuttball's note br br i noticed this is the second film that dean norris and mickey jones were in a movie together the other being the classic violent epic total recall funny seeing them in another alien flick br br if you like alien movies and or the subject of aliens i also recommend the following films the thing from another world the day the earth stood still war of the worlds 1953 2005 horror express the ufo incident invasion of the body snatchers 1978 e t the extra terrestrial john carpenter's the thing krull the return of the aliens the deadly spawn time walker my science project howard the duck john carpenter's starman john carpenter's they live mac and me explorers invaders from mars alien seed the abyss communion suburban commando fire in the sky the arrival mars attacks contact men in black i 2 stephen king's dreamcatcher xtro 3 watch the skies battlefield earth a saga for the year 3000 stargate the puppet masters john carpenter's village of the damned independence day life form contact the x files fight the future roswell the aliens attack the faculty mission to mars pitch black evolution k pax signs silent warnings the forgotten alien hunter spaceballs alien aliens alien 3 predator predator 2 alien vs predator the entire star wars saga a new hope the empire strikes back the return of the jedi original and special editions the phantom menace attack of the clones revenge of the sith the entire star trek movie saga star trek the motion picture the wrath of khan the search for spock the voyage home the final frontier the undiscovered country generations first contact insurrection nemesis and stephen king's it
<START> what a great cast and what a pathetic attempt at a film the script is full of holes from beginning to end incoherent not cohesive utterly ridiculous one of the most talented beautiful actresses in the world and i'm talking about nastassja kinski is without a single memorable line here worse she supposedly dyes her hair halfway thru the movie but it's obvious she's just wearing a cheap black wig bought from a drag queen costume shop the best moments are given to a character actor and his dog in the apartment building that lead actor peter coyote lives in fairuza balk is photographed poorly to boot she looks like an overweight freshman who's out at too many all you can eat student cafeteria i was so looking forward to this film i wanted to like it but i think i'd rather watch nastassja read the phone book with her own hair
<START> now i know that sandra bullock produced this film but she needs to learn that sometimes you need to make certain sacrifices in order to advance the story like not trying to make the whole movie about her character br br the story is about two high school students one rich and popular the other smart and anti social who formulate a plan to commit murder and follow it by the number just to see if they can get away with it enter sandra bullock and ben chaplin as detectives trying to solve the case the boys have planted evidence created alibis and cleaned up after themselves so well that the cops fall for the whole act but sandra has a feeling that all is not as it appears to be br br this movie could have been a great little hitchcock style thriller but the movie spends too much time on getting to know sandra's character rather than focusing on the actual crime itself you see something happened in her past that keeps haunting her throughout the film and we get to know all about it all about it it just gets rather tedious after a while especially when you are right in the middle of an intriguing murder investigation and then have to stop that investigation to hear about what happened to her in the past br br ryan gosling and michael pitt are the real winners in this movie they play their characters convincingly and with just the right amount of malice if the script had spent more time focusing on these characters and kept the detectives there to just do their jobs this could have been an immensely entertaining thriller with the way it is most of the thrill is lost they should have cut out all the stuff with sandra's character and made that a separate tv movie for the lifetime channel but i digress it's still an entertaining movie nonetheless i do recommend this movie but wait for the video dvd
<START> not for everyone but i really like it nice ensemble cast with nice contributions from better known players like stockard channing and strong eye candy from sheila kelley what really works is the bond between the three brothers try it you'll smile a little
<START> a lot of the negative reviews here concentrate on the historical accuracy of this film ok it had about as much to do with the actual nfl as your average war movie has to do with an actual war or a western has to do with the true old west so i think we should give them an artistic license pass on that one br br the problem here is the director clooney apparently thinks that making a screwball comedy means a do stupid things b mug for the camera and c take stupid scenes full of mugging and stretch them out way too long screwball comedies need a fast pace not necessarily frenetic but moving briskly along at all times here things drag and drag and drag after you watch this movie it will make you appreciate how brilliant mack sennett was when he pretty much pioneered the genre with his keystone cops after 90 years you would think that directors would have studied the old masters and learned a thing or two maybe even improved on things a bit but no it's as if someone had watched an automobile pioneer build a and nearly a century later paid homage and improved on the concept by cobbling together a child's wagon with square wheels br br i've enjoyed several of clooney's movies i consider him a gifted actor but very few actors can competently direct themselves clint eastwood notably took a while to get the hang of it clooney is clearly at the bottom of a very steep slope the movie becomes more watchable during the very few times he is out of the frame but when he's in the picture he makes himself the centre of attention in the fight scenes his mugging is so obnoxious you wish somebody would thump him for real br br if you are making a screwball comedy and want some romance thrown in you need to develop some chemistry between the male and female leads clooney and zellweger have all the chemistry of pair of dumpsters sitting in a parking lot no spark no sizzle not even a post mortem twitch zellweger who has also turned out some pretty good movies must have traded her botox injections for oak giving a stunningly wooden performance she might just have pulled off the tough broad in a man's world act if just once while trying to out testosterone the guys she had looked into the camera with a little half smile and twinkle in her eye but no she kept her up tight to the very end br br of course the biggest sin here is that the movie simply isn't funny doing stupid things is not the same as slapstick doing stupid things very inventively like the stooges or very athletically like buster keaton can be hilarious but otherwise it's boring and well stupid i think i got one good laugh out of the entire movie br br avoid this one i saw it for free on cable and still wanted my money back
<START> two funeral directors in a welsh village english humour as opposed to that other stuff from over the atlantic how could i resist my wife and i saw it on march the 6th for our belated valentines day celebration and both of us enjoyed some good belly laughs we were going to see another movie later but decided not to because we wanted the experience of this movie to stay with us for the evening br br the mortuary scene in the last 20 minutes of the film is worth the wait it raises issues rarely talked about in the community but i know three funeral directors and the humour is right on the money br br highly recommended and congratulations to the writers without you all the actors directors and the others havn't a job on any monday
<START> overrated mob comedy director demme makes the actors pause after some funny lines to let audience laugh and not miss next line seems odd this director did silence of the lambs now there's the way to use pauses casting seems off mathew modine too young for fbi agent and love interest dean stockwell is doing a jack nicholson thing with a squint and he gets a nomination for it plus we have to accept pfeiffer and stockwell as italians charles napier as a hairdresser and al lewis as a mob lawyer are underused with only one line each they should be the bumbling hoods song score by chris is totally out of place better for a flick like pretty in pink re make this movie it's worth it but with proper casting and director and the satire will come through even the often repeated
<START> this is a wonderful movie and i still love it it just so magical and it is fun for the whole family i recommend it to people of all ages i promise you will not be disappointed the characters are always so engaging so real you will just love them the story of gerda and kai falling in love will really amaze you and put that little spark of magic into your life br br i don't see how anyone would care if the movie matched the book i mean the movie was amazing i haven't even read the book and guess what i don't care in fact if the movie and book are so different then you can just call them two separate stories and be happy with it br br i thought the acting was bloody brilliant bridget fonda plays the snow queen so evil and so cold you just have to hate her chelsea hobbs plays gerda a love struck girl who is determined to find her love no matter what it takes and goes on a wonderful adventure and i just love all of the snow queen's sisters the spring witch the summer princess and autumn robber they are so fun and different in many ways br br i haven't seen this movie in awhile so forgive me if i make a minor mistake but there's no doubt that i will always love this movie
<START> this is the story of a guy who went up to see a comedy and it turned out to be a horror movie the true story of a guy who's infatuated with pictures and got scared when he identified himself unexpectedly with one of them the unbelievable story of a guy who got scarier when the female hero was deluding herself as well as the male villain gosh is this what life made us be people deluding themselves about the perfect face imagining how that face should be perfect inside toto i think we're not in kansas anymore
<START> a waste of time talent and shelf space this is a truly abysmal film what are big leaguers like keanu reeves cameron diaz and dan aykroyd wasting their time being in such rubbish petty criminal reeves turns up to his brothers vincent d'onofrio wedding and ends up leaving with the bride a comedy thriller romance i honestly do not know reeves is wooden in the lead and casting dan aykroyd as a cop is so dreadful it has to be seen to be believed only bright spot from a dark dark tunnel is diaz and even she isn't that good rent out something else everyone involved with this mess should hold there heads in utter shame and prey that it gets lost in oblivion in the years to come
<START> this script was mildly original when it was written in 1935 but the poor performances and the inconsistent quality level make it impossible to recommend some of the vignettes are absolutely terrible and the dialogue is never natural a few of the plot twists were creative but i was very surprised to see it so highly rated here at the imdb a few scenes are worthwhile it's as a film that if fails completely to entertain if you like this sort of montage run don't walk and get tales of manhattan 1942 a marvelous film that follows the life and times of a topcoat
<START> the use of the term 'comedy' with relation to this documentary is an insult to the art of comedy and worse yet is the pain that is inflicted on the viewers of this production almost nothing was funny br br this documentary followed a small group of stand up on the road as they travel from town to town to perform in small clubs br br it's interesting to note that their conversations and behavior off stage and on stage are indistinguishable but sadly equally unfunny br br it's possible to understand the self delusions of grandeur which the featured possess but it's harder to grasp the sounds of laughter heard from their audiences these are the same audiences for whom the lame sitcoms on tv are intended br br this was possibly the worst film i've ever watched in my 50 years of movie viewing
<START> i felt that the film was rushed and the acting was full of holes arnold was good but the main girl was stupid and the guy who played the devil was awful the story was confusing and idiotic the film had no point and was unbelievable the movie is not the worst movie but is not too far away from it overall i was awfully disappointed it could have been alot better my score is a 3 out of 10
