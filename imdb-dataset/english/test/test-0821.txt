<START> major spoilers watchable only for the action sequences not the story or acting in it nature unleashed fire has one of the longest and excruciating endings in modern motion picture history we have the fearless ranger jake bryan leading this trio of hysterical bikers to safety in of all paces an explosive fume mine shaft this during a raging forest fire it seems that ranger jake with all his knowledge of the great outdoors didn't realize that a mine shaft that's leaking with dangerous and explosive methane gas is the last place to go when all the woods around it is on fire br br spoilers from this point on all this started some time ago when ranger jake in an effort to save the not that on the ball miner tiny chris aka the let him slip through his fingers and fall to his death at the bottom of the mine shaft or did he even though we were kept in suspense to who's setting the forest fires for the first half of the movie it wasn't a surprise at all the tiny was the culprit as you would expect in movies like these tiny seemed to be made of hardened steel in that nothing that ever happened to him fires explosions as well as impaling could stop the crazed miner br br before tiny's reappearance or resurrection ranger jake got involved in rescuing bikers chris mel sharon marcus josh cohen melanie lewis anastasia griffith ross mccall who were trapped in the woods with fires breaking all around them having the usual know it all marcus among the bikers things don't go as smoothly as ranger jake wanted them to go marcus not only eggs on the meek chris to do something stupid jump with his bike over a 10 foot pile of logs but has the guy break his leg this makes it almost impossible for ranger jake to have chris air lifted out before the fires consume him as well as his fellow bikers br br for the remainder of the movie ranger jake who put himself in charge makes boner after boner in his attempt to save himself and the trapped and lost in the woods bikers all this ends with jake's brilliant idea to hide in a dangerous and abandoned mine shaft with the rescue party just yards away from rescuing them if they only stayed put and in the open where the rescue team could find them br br even though he was supposed to be the life of the party or movie tiny for all his efforts in being another indestructible super villain came across as a man who spent too much time out in the sun the make up job on tiny was so outrageous that he looked like he dumped a jar of spaghetti sauce over his head instead of having it burned to a crisp br br ranger jake came across as either somewhat very naive or retarded in his being so taken in by the dangerous tiny in always trying to save the rampaging psycho who never hid his feelings about what he had in mind for the play by the rules forest ranger in fact ranger jake actually encouraged tiny to do both him and the bikers in by showing him how incompetent he was in trying to save them the fact that ranger jake was successful wasn't because he was so smart but because tiny despite his indestructibility was so brainless
<START> i don't really know when it was that tv stations began preferring to have handsome men as their reporters regardless of the mens' iqs but it was clearly a problem by the time that broadcast news came out and the movie does a really good job looking at it portraying a love triangle between pretty boy air head reporter tom william hurt intelligent but nervous reporter aaron altman albert brooks and producer jane craig holly hunter the movie pulls no punches probably the best line in the movie is when tom says something like i don't really understand any of what i'm reporting and in the era of fox news and such things a movie like this becomes even more important br br all in all definitely a movie that i recommend also starring robert lois chiles joan cusack and jack nicholson in a supporting role as the anchorman
<START> the previews were so funny that i couldn't wait to see this movie i just got home and i have to say i couldn't have been more embarrassed at this movie yes there were times where the jokes were funny but the stereotypical roles were painful joan plowright is a fine actress but the scene with the negro spiritual was just in poor taste needless to say the laughs were few and far between in the movie house for a largely white crowd i was one of a very small handful of blacks
<START> ms stowe is sensational in this power drama about a secret policeman who interrogates a children's author because he believes she is trying to plant ideas in her writings that are contrary to the state's this is an incredibly powerful film both performances are worthy of more recognition as is the message of this movie put this on your must see list if you can locate it
<START> for all of us american deneuve fans this little gem is a little tough to get ahold of fortunately i found myself so wrapped up in the short bits that i saw previewed on youtube com that i was willing to go to any lengths i found it on ebay com ordered it directly from france and changed my laptop so it would play region 2 dvds let me tell you that it was well worth it be warned there are no subtitles pathe shouldn't have released this on dvd koch should've they're good about the subtitles i don't speak a word of french i can utter a syllable here and there order a drink and whatnot that having been said this film was a treat anyway i couldn't fully appreciate the supposed bawdy humor or the witty dialogue watching deneuve and her cohorts was enough for me i understood what was going on without need of the dialogue it really says something about a film when those who can't speak the language enjoy it br br the cinematography is wonderful london is adorable as the smitten son on law loved the lesbian mom and of course what can i possibly say about our dear deneuve she is one of a kind those eyes that smile i could watch her films all day she really goes beyond beauty people always say she's gorgeous well yes she is but she is also very talented i believed her every second of the way her conversation about chocolate and vanilla with london is too sweet her character even gets arrested for smoking dope with some 15 year old in the street not to be missed fly to france and buy this if you have to great 10
<START> an enjoyable movie without a doubt and very evocative of both its era and that very particular stage in any boy's of but i have to say that having read the very positive comments here i was a bit disappointed the period was captured but the plot was desperately thin the whole thing revolves around the most egregious bit of miscasting in the history of school plays the idea that quack quack would ever be chosen to play not only one of only three star turns but a philanderer is risible and without that nada the sub plots bore no relation that i could see to the main plot all of them could be removed in their entirety without in any way affecting the main story which surely suggests a fundamental flaw when all your sub plots look like padding you know a central idea is being stretched beyond its limits nevertheless it's a benign movie with its heart in the right place there are some fine performances and you just get the feeling that everyone involved felt deflated at the final 'cut ' that good feeling permeates the film and that has to count for something a flawed really quite good movie 7 out of 10
<START> enormous suspension of disbelief is required where will's genius is concerned not just in math he is also very well read in economic history able to out shrink several shrinks etc etc no no no i don't buy it while they're at it they might as well have him wearing a big s on his chest flying faster than a jet plane and stopping bullets br br among other problems real genius shelving for the moment the problem of what it really is and whether it deserves such mindless homage doesn't simply appear ex it isn't ever so multi faceted and it is very rarely appreciated by contemporaries br br better to have made will a basketball prodigy except that damon's too short
<START> the decline series is amazing and director ps can't get enough credit for making these movies i'm slightly surprised to see that not very many people have seen this one or the other two but their worth unearthing if you want the picture of punk in the trans formative years between the late seventies and early eighties the film starts out with a blistering collection of clips played over music from the band x many interviews with bands and that offer an enlightening perspective as to what surviving was like on the low rung of the mainstream rock ladder no internet crappy jobs and all out hostility collide in this genre for new kids who haven't heard of these bands or are just starting one themselves this movie is a true lesson in how to rock all the band performances and there are many are awesome especially fear who never cease to amaze me this and the second installment are amazing time capsules offering those who care a rare glimpse into the lives of these crazy people it's true punk like in the interview with darby girlfriend when their recalling a painter who mysteriously suddenly died outside their house and it took a week or so for them to figure it out they take pictures next to the guy and everyone including the had a chuckle on this one and in true form the interviewer asks the girlfriend if she was sad or upset that this guy had died while painting their house the response no i hate painters how about black flag renting their apartment rehearsal space for 16 dollars a month my jaw almost fell off at that moment seeing as i'm renting a ten by ten closet to practice in for 400 between watching this and deadwood i feel like i was born in the wrong time period just missing those cowboy days and nights of the old way the people and bands associated with the movie paved the way for what harder music today is and they did it in their own unique way brilliant film ten stars see part 2 as well its equally awesome part 3 though i don't know what to say about
<START> i had heard about gaming and dungeons and dragons before but i had know idea it could be like what i saw in the gamers dorkness rising these guys are so funny and fun to watch especially the guy who plays the bard or minstrel or whatever he has a gift for physical comedy and timing there is so much background humor and energy in some of the scenes that make you really think that at least some of it was improvised there on set the special effects needed to be worked on a bit but i saw it at a convention last year and thats one of the things they said they were going to redo and make better so it's probably wicked now
<START> tired garbled dreck the chemistry between argento and madsen was as exciting as a wet doughnut their dialogue was dramatically uninteresting the storyline was a mess the acting forced the cinematography lingered on the uninspired lazy and pointless kim gordon and her character had no reason to be there nor did anyone else for that matter i couldn't have given two farts for any of the 'characters' their emotions skipped and jumped like a junkie who hates his heroin empty and dull why do i have to write ten lines of text on here to make my point i think i summed it up in the first three words but obviously it's not enough i think this is the last time i'll bother to waste my time critiquing a film anyway i saw 'clean' and thought that was quite ineffectual as well again i cared not for the characters whether they lived or died
<START> this whole movie is just so terrible it is a complete mess the story is just so stupid i can't believe somebody actually sat down and wrote about this and thought it would make a good movie the acting is quite possibly the very worst out of any b movie ever made i've seen a lot of sci fi type b movies before and some of them are actually pretty good some of them however like from venus should never have been made br br some movie makers think that just because they put something together and somehow got it on the shelves of a movie store that they have accomplished something that it is good and should be watched by people this is not always true and it is definitely not true of from venus this film loses on all accounts horrible acting stupid plot very weak special effects ugliest costumes ever non realistic dialogue bad direction etc you can just tell this film only took about 20 to make and i may be giving it too much credit there i urge you to stay away from this train wreck of a film for your own good
<START> combine good casting bad writing good orchestral scoring bad dialogue and good story idea with lots of potential but is never realized then you have slipstream br br just bought the movie for a buck it is worth it but not much more br br good to see mark hamill act again br br there should be a decent sequel made to remedy the damage from the original or at least give it the proper attention it should have received in the first place br br score gave demanded your attention from the opening credits however the long shots of slipstream planes and the even longer revealing of interesting plot points mutes his attention getting score br br it is really easy to dog a movie like this after all it is by the producer of and the director of tron and a tremendous cast but it is what it is and that ain't much br br favorite line we're going to make it ha ha boom
<START> in reply to state of confusion the dogs injuries do seem to disappear rather abruptly but that may have only been an error in continuity but as for the kids trying to build a plane out of junk it's just a simple matter of imagination these are two very young kids who have extremely active imaginations and they must rely on those imaginations to keep themselves from being exposed to the reality of the level of abuse that goes on in their home from their stepfather as for the stepfather it's very interesting that the director chose to no show his face that makes him seem more monstrous if you show his face then that character becomes a person and not just this monster who is terrorizing the childhood of these two innocent children by showing only the of his abuse and not focusing scenes on the abuse itself the children then become the main focus of the movie this film has no loose ends but runs just as a father's tale to his children would it has this is a fine american classic
<START> r 88 brilliant very entertaining show with spectacular effects any fan of these prehistoric reptiles has to see this the cgi blends in extremely well with the environment and it's just plain fun to watch these giants walk about their daily business as casually as on discovery channel this show was a stroke of genius and it blows its followers walking with beasts and the future is wild out of the water br br the greatest episode was definitely the last where we got to watch the final days of the tyrannosaurus rex and the meteor strike that became their doom this stuff is almost too awesome for television how about a theatrical release i would pay anything to see these dinos in the cinema br br if you're in the mood for a show that manages to be spectacular engaging and educational at the same time this is for you dinosaurs have never been cooler
<START> the plot in this movie is very thin and there is not much acting val kilmer i don't know why he agreed to do this movie plays a minor role as a gang leader in short the movie is tedious to watch br br one guy who sort of resembles an archeology religion professor is exploring a subterranean area of moscow that has some history connected to railway construction and the bolshevik revolution a church tragedy in that history makes the exploration spiritual and spirits of a malevolent intent haunt the underground ruins a friend of the professor decides to find his friend in the underground and hires a couple of russian guides the entire movie is based on this plot and contains much repeated footage of the underground and some camera effects much like those seen in day watch night watch etc
