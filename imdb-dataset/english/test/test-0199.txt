<START> the paul of death wish 3 is very far removed from the paul of the original film if you remember the 1974 film then you will remember was a during the korean war and that he was physically sick after he committed his first execution ten years later seems to have learned unarmed combat and how to handle anti tank weapons in his spare time but i ll overlook that gaffe because is the best of the sequels lowlife scum bags get shot dead burned alive their teeth smashed and thrown to their deaths by middle aged housewives armed with sweeping brushes yeah i know the gang members are multi ethnic and for that they deserve some credit but even if they re not racist they re still murdering scum who deserve all they get from and the innocent citizens who needs mayor rudy when you ve got paul an anti tank rocket and a bunch of old age to reclaim the streets from the criminal creeps paul i salute you sir
<START> the songs are fantastic and the story line is good like many other acting schools mine also produced hair for most hair production it's a golden opportunity to do nude but my production was fully dressed i don't think full frontal nudity in a movie or a play guarantees artistic quality and so did the creators of the movie the movie version is great with classic hits following each other while letting the plot develop to the chilling climax a great cast of actors dancers and singers
<START> i'd heard this japanese flick is edgy creatively interesting a cool new thang on the asian movie making scene maybe even something as innovative as hideo nakata's ringu or chan wook park's oldboy especially the latter br br you can imagine my disappointment when instead i found the movie disjointed both narratively and cinematically though not in a way that a film aficionado appreciates clichÃ© ridden even sadly silly instead of funny on the whole a very bad knock off of the pulp fiction style br br i stopped watching after 30 minutes when i gave up on it becoming something more than it is
<START> i stumbled upon this movie whilst flipping channels on the teevee late one night it has continued to hold my interest some twenty years later because of the important real life lesson it teaches us about the dark side of human nature and although it tells a true story that takes place in wwii it is amazingly apropos to the ugly things happening in europe today br br if you thought ethnic cleansing as it's called today has anything to do with race or ethnicity you'll think differently after viewing this story br br i guess i'd been pretty naive in thinking that evil follows any prescribed set of rules evil is as evil does br br this movie teaches a valuable lesson and i recommend it especially to e g church groups or civil rights organizations br br i don't expect it will be too easy to find and rent but i'd really like to see it again because there is one amazing scene in it which gives a totally unintentional yet interesting glimpse of the banal intricacies of race expertise in this scene the who was taken prisoner by the nazis at the beginning of the war is discovered by an ss race authority and ushered into a room there the two play a sort of guessing game where the ss officer is able to determine where our hero anthony quinn's character came from and where his ancestors came from well come to find out that quinn's character isn't a member of an inferior race after all but to the contrary he's a perfect aryan which doesn't mean a whole lot to quinn's character who is more interested in talking about the towns rivers and mountain ranges that the ss guy had just been naming nevertheless being a perfect aryan archetype has its perks among other things he gets to leave his job in a slave labor factory where he wears striped rags and into a slave modeling job where he gets to wear tailored nazi uniforms yeah it's a better gig for sure for a guy who always did appreciate wearing nice clothes until the allied armies arrive and recognize his face from magazine covers br br
<START> the movie the cave has got to be one of the worst movies i have ever seen there was no plot no story line and the lighting was terrible for most of the movie i was unable to make sense of the scenery as it was being highlighted by flashlights the persistent spaces throughout the movie were irksome the only scene that really came through clearly was in the cavern lit by what appeared to be a bad simulation of the conditions to be found in hell all in all the movie was not really worth watching if the producers cannot come up with something better than this they should find another occupation the underwater scenes were particularly awful being mostly made up of bubbles and flashlights with the occasional look at the actors in summation a really awful movie with bad lighting extraneous flashes throughout
<START> and i love it wonder will pick up a cult audience and once it's canceled the dvd sales will go though the roof this is a very funny show in it's own ways it's a parody of children's shows namely sesame street our puppet characters consist of a yellow furry monster with a hat whose our host clarence is a blue lizard like thing that does his own segments where he goes out on the streets him is a weird dog like thing that refers to himself in the third person is the smart one whose brain always shows then there's the newscaster and the pink puppet it's a very funny show not really as nasty as you'd expect but more the situations they take 7 year olds out on the street tell them what to say and have them make mean jokes that they don't understand my favorite segments are clarence's videos especially when somebody doesn't want to be filmed i prefer tv funhouse which was a similar show but this is still a very funny show that i hope lasts for years to come br br my rating 1 4 out of 30 mins tv ma
<START> i went to see random hearts with 3 friends and at first i thought maybe it was just me who wasn't enjoying the movie after all i didn't like as good as it gets and that movie won all sorts of awards well it wasn't just me none of my friends liked it either it was unbelievable slow much like getting teeth pulled the only action that is in the movie is what is in previews we didn't walk out of the theatre because we all assumed something more would happen we weren't as smart as the 7 or 8 people who did walk out i have never walked out on a movie in my life but i definitely should have this is all tough for me to write considering i am relatively easy to please when it comes to movies it takes a lot for me to think a movie is awesome but not much for me to just like it this movie didn't even come close in the like category not only was the movie about 2 hours too long but it was like two separate trite stories in one but they weren't smoothly sewn together plus the soundtrack if you could even call it that was so annoying like seinfeld has the same riff that is played over and over again difference being that i like seinfeld this movie had this jazz riff that it kept playing which sounded highly inappropriate at times especially when people were dealing with the deaths of the plane crash hard to explain what i mean but trust me it was awful i cannot say enough to make people not waste their money after i left the theatre i honestly wanted to write to the movie company and demand my 7 back sheeesh i could have gone bowling or something for that money
<START> i agree with all the mentioned in the other reviews but there are some beats missing here that keep it firmly inside the genre of crime drama or film noir and limit it from being a great drama beyond the limits of the elements that make up film noir not to say that the great film noirs aren't can't shouldn't be also great dramas but this one isn't br br one other note the music in the film is used sparingly but i would say is used to accentuate the action more frequently than the wife elements br br great set up to this film by the way with an abrupt sort of non ending ending that is either just right or a let down depends br br spoilers follow as to some specifics br br the big turn in the story involves the children seeing their mother die or it should be the big moment but the children are never shown to react one way or the other neither cries neither asks their father what happened the kids are good actors and the reactions of the father are i suppose what matters but this is a big misstep this is the heart of the story and the kids are kept mostly blank in their reaction they really just have none in the next scene they look as if nothing happened br br in like fashion there is a bond that forms between belmondo and ventura's characters belmondo says he knew the partner who was killed but this is never explained and has no impact dramatically on belmondo or anyone else the belmondo romantic subplot also strains credibility though it's convincingly acted ventura's character just lets belmondo involve a total stranger in their escape plan for no reason he doesn't even comment or seem to notice another gap br br the ending to the movie and i won't spoil it the ending happens off screen with a perfunctory voice over to tell you what happened i guess this tries to make it feel more true to life but again like these other missteps leaves drama off screen br br what's the point of not dealing with these issues i don't know other than maybe the goals of the film were limited to giving the audience what it wants from a crime melodrama suggest some deeper elements then move on to ignore them br br too bad there is much to recommend this film ventura is very very good but too bad it could have been a great drama as well as a crime story as with imdb favorite movie of all time the godfather this film had potential would make for a good remake though if done in the u s more problems would probably sink the film but in the hands of the right director this would be a good remake though it's doubtful ventura's performance could be topped br br so worth seeing but frustrating as a whole
<START> i was 19 in 1970 when it came out and having heard how funny it was when it came out and reading the reviews here i finally rented it and watched it i didn't laugh once a very unfunny flick and i usually love reiner i cannot for the life of me figure why this is seen as funny i had not one chuckle and i love comedies oh well at least now i know what all the shouting was about not my idea of a comedy go rent the navigator or the love nest by buster keaton now those are comedy classics if you rent this one have a back up rental so your whole evening isn't a loss score 3 out of 10
<START> luchino visconti has become famous to the world after his marvelous production the leopard movie fans got to know the style of the director who introduced himself as one among the post war new realists an aristocrat who developed his individual free thinking and consequently expressed them as an artist however when applied to this movie morte a venezia based upon the novel by thomas mann it's a slightly different story br br the entire film is at first view so unique so psychological and so much influenced by the various thoughts of an artist both director and main character gustav von that it seems to be unwatchable for many viewers therefore such opinions about the movie rose as being too slow unendurable or endless boredom why the reason seems to lie in a significant view widespread nowadays good movie is parallel to flawless action here it would be appropriate to say good movie is parallel to no action as a matter of fact everyone would be able to say one sentence about the whole movie's content and that would suffice all that we find in morte a venezia has a sense of vague reality filled with both and shallowness that appear to be significant for the sake of each single moment and it is so when we notice the psychedelic scenes in venice when we see gustav at the railroad station when we are supplied with his intensely emotional memories the insight into his decaying mind is sometimes so intense that the only way for the viewer to go on watching the film is to do his her best to feel and experience rather than see and think all is doomed to fade to wither like flowers on meadow when their time comes in other words all has a sense of loss and death without many events or even dialogs as a result it is quite unlikely that you will get the idea of the movie after a single viewing it must be seen more than twice with the mind that is constantly open if you'll like it or not that's a different story very personal one br br the artistic values are the factor that is noticeable at first sight and stays with us throughout beauty as something very meaningful for the main character that appears to come and leave rest as something he's heading for so badly and which comes to him in the most unexpected way feeling that he finds in a teenage boy who appears as a model of all the dreams and desires as a forbidden fruit of homosexual lust which vanishes the costume designer piero does a splendid job in this movie through lots of wonderful wardrobe he supplies us with a very realistic view of 1911 when the action takes place the cinematographer pasqualino de santis provides us with a terrific visual experience that can be called a real feast for the eyes and in the background comes gustav music the composer whose life inspired thomas mann to introduce the character br br the performances are top notch particularly from dirk bogart as the main character gustav von who wants a rest after hard artistic job and vainly attempts to find it in crowded venice for the majority of the film we have a great insight into his thoughts feelings and acts of anger exhaust and despair though sometimes depressing he keeps us on the right track till the end not losing hope for the less tragic end andersen depicts the model of decadent homosexual desire but also a model of beauty and purity that appears to last pretty short adieu it was all too short says the main character a great though very controversial job is done by mark burns as a sort of super ego alfred with whom gustav polemics about such ideals as beauty justice hope human dignity for alfred beauty belongs to the senses how freudian yet how dangerous the idea might be and ever present in artistic italian movies of the time here as an elegant lady from poland mother br br memorable moments indeed constitute the movie's strong points yet not all viewers will find them unforgettable they similarly to the whole odd movie require much effort to get onto the right track in director's individual ego and within the four walls of his psyche among such scenes i consider the beach sequence pretty important particularly the way gustav observes the physical distance accurately represents the lack of courage to come closer i also appreciate the shots when gustav is sitting in the gondola and the city's view moves in the background how memorably that may raise existential thoughts of transfer aren't we people a sort of in the world in the journey that life is br br in the end i must tell you one important thing i had found morte a venezia extremely weird until i started to look deeper at what the director is really trying to convey then every scene turned out to be meaningful in its interpretation with which you don't have to agree i hardly agree with anything the main character does but you should at least tolerate this as something the author badly wanted to say listen to his voice allow him for a few words in one page of reality br br therefore there is a long way towards understanding the film since not many movies like that were being made in 1971 and are being made now paradoxically it seems that we are all bound to have the right feelings about this film in the long run similarly to that we are all bound to experience once a strange unavoidable usually unexpected reality that death is 7 10
<START> this is a great italian shark movie probably not a full action type of shark movie but it has a great story about a native american in the form of a killer shark that attacks a small beach community the movie has actual scenes of real sharks and some not but how they made it is pretty good the cast are not that brilliant of acting in this shark film but it it shows better acting in some other italian shark movies such as e g cruel jaws last shark they show some pretty bad acting but most italian shark movies are good which means this votes best as the best italian shark movie ever some scenes in this movie show violence gore which makes this film good that it shows it so i would say this is the best film for all shark movie fans
<START> or fires on the plain is a film that is so excellent on so many levels that not enough good things can be said about it my only regret is that i was not able to see this 1959 film sooner br br being something of a film purist i tend to look at films for their artistic merits based upon dialog acting photography and even the efforts to remain true to the period in terms of costume ultimately i want to know if the film is truthful enough in revealing the human condition to make me think without oppressing me with what the director wants me to think br br fires on the plain is a great film because it crafts a portrait filled with realistic human reactions to the dying fires of a great historical catastrophe br br film is a condemnation of war on all levels as any good war film should be war is horrifying bloody destructive it is also murderous on the psyche however what is fundamental about fires on the plain is its unapologetic look at the japanese soldiers it shows them slowly collapsing under the weight of superior american firepower and their nation's inability to wage a war of its own making a fatalistic code encouraging death before surrender is at the heart of this madness br br i was astonished to see such an honest and brutally close look at the bitter fruits of japan's military misadventure made just 14 years after the end of what the japanese call the great pacific war ichikawa reveals what the germans called the war life the plight of the common soldier br br film is interesting since even today japan is having a hard time fully coming to terms with its wartime fanaticism its subjugation of conquered peoples the racism of its war against the chinese and war crimes which included cannibalism by soldiers and officers practiced not only against one another but against allied prisoners of war br br ichikawa produces a stark representation of the victimization of soldiers by a of bad political decisions and cultural pressures br br this stark examination is skillfully done by portraying the doomed soldiers as human beings who exhibit at various times fear brilliantly laconic humor dialog enriched by its and a plot whose complexity is belied by the grim wilderness setting br br portrait is a ragged and painful tapestry of defeated men the tubercular tamura played as a woebegone and gentle soul by is a good soldier who can't abandon his humanity though he is as frightened and lost as his comrades before he departs for a hospital that will reject him as too healthy tamura is given a hand grenade by a superior who recognizing the hopelessness of their situation advises tamura to kill himself br br why hopelessly ill supplied and militarily incapable unit was not ordered to surrender at the start of the film is telling ichikawa makes it plain that the war is over and everyone is merely waiting to die as tamura leaves his unit for his hopeless search for physical and spiritual salvation he sees his comrades pointlessly digging an air raid shelter they appear like corpses looking up from their own mass grave br br we later watch as the overworked hospital's medical staff abandons the dying patients to an all consuming american artillery barrage the pathetic patients who crawl from their huts in a vain attempt to survive appear like pathetic serpentine creatures dragging themselves from an omnipotent force you know they won't survive br br ichikawa makes it plain that the only thing worse than a defeated army is one that has lost its honor by abandoning its humanity and its comrades as tamura staggers through the jungles of leyte we encounter the noble the dying and the exploitive cannibalism rears its ugly head as soldiers begin to eat one another rather than surrender to american beef br br when the men do talk of surrender the propaganda of how americans kills prisoners is countered by a worldly wise soldier who reveals that the approaching americans feed and care for prisoners of war because they unlike the japanese respect brave soldiers who are forced to give up br br it is the japanese who intend to die fighting for the emperor long after resistance has lost all meaning those willing to fight to the death will be killed it is the calculus of war br br after shooting a murderous and cannibalistic comrade whom he earlier offered his own body to as food the fatalistic careless surrender also seems to be an intentional form of suicide his death is a lonely image was ichikawa trying to tell us of the internal conflict of the ordinary soldier who wants to live but who is still trapped by his nation's suicidal cultural codes br br if someone watches this film carefully he or she will see that and fanaticism is the enemy the americans are portrayed as a technologically advanced people willing to employ that technology in the form of inexorable military power a lesson that transformed japanese postwar society film isn't so shallow that it america ichikawa the layers of japan's destructive policies that created the war and then to continue it when all was lost br br ichikawa does not mention the nuclear weapons dropped upon nagasaki and hiroshima he doesn't have to the slow motion destruction of the imperial japanese army in the philippines reveals the seeds of japan's
<START> what can i say about this film other than the narrative is one of the most exciting in film history and based on a true story being old enough to remember the berlin wall when it was still used to contain a country this film gives you a dark insight into the grim incarceration of east and their desperate attempts to escape no matter what the cost the film follows the lives of two families who decide to escape using a hot air balloon manufactured by themselves forever fearing arrest by the authorities under scrutiny by neighbours they have to calculate a plan to reach the other side of the wall a tense thrilling story of courage and determination which truly pays homage to all those who succeeded and failed the treacherous journey to west berlin and freedom
<START> br br i rented this movie on 20 june 2001 and watched it for about 45 minutes i concluded that watching a blank screen would be delightful by comparison there was not a single person in the cast for whom i would have shed a tear if hell itself had opened up and swallowed the whole bunch of them br br so i e mailed all of my friends and relatives warning them and i am taking the time to urge everyone who may see this note to avoid this movie like the plague i have seen some really bad movies in my time but never one as bad as this
<START> after loomis gives a quick recap of micheal myers we flashback to 1989 where jamie is kidnapped by the man in black before the burning police station explodes micheal returns to once again to find jamie and his baby in this version the loomis character gets more scenes and seems much more pro active than he is in the final cut the score is much better more in line with parts 4 and 5 none of the electric guitar bs and the ending makes a tad more sense for these reasons coupled with the fact that this cut has more characterization and suspense and cuts back on the gore factor halloween unlike say the friday the 13th was never about blatant gore is why i prefer this bootleg producer's cut not to say that the cut magically turns a turd into gold it just polishes the turd a little bit and makes it more comprehensible the whole cult plot is still very stupid as is micheal fathering a kid br br my producer's cut grade c br br my theatrical cut grade d
