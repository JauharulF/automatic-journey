<START> it was september 2003 that i heard the bbc were going to resurrect doctor who and make it bigger and better but i'd heard these rumours in the press before and thought that's all they were rumours but it was then mentioned that russell t davies was going to produce and write the show and then one saturday afternoon in march 2004 channel 4 news interviewed the actor cast in the title role christopher eccleston yes that christopher eccleston an actor i've always been impressed by since watching his film debut in let him have it and if he was getting interviewed on television it must have been true as the months passed more and more information was leaked billie piper was being cast the daleks would be returning and the mill the hollywood effects company who had done the fx for gladiator were contracted to do the special effects for the show for several weeks before the first broadcast trailers galore heralded the return of the new series massive billboards in london informed the public about the return of the show tabloid newspapers carried massive photo spreads of the aliens appearing and christopher eccleston appeared on programmes as diverse as blue peter mastermind which had a special doctor who night edition this morning and friday night with johnathan ross in fact this new series of doctor who must have been the most hyped programme in the history of british television it had better be bloody good br br so was it bloody good undoubtedly it has been a major success with nearly every episode making the top ten shows in the tv charts to give you clue of its rating success only one episode the ark in space episode two febuary 1975 from the old series had made it into the top five tv chart the opening series episode made number three with two more episodes either beating or equalling the previous record and this is in an era where there's far more competition in terms of tv stations and choice let's laugh and cheer at the fact doctor who stuffed hit me baby one more time celebrity wrestling and mauled ant and saturday night takeaway of course much of the success is down to the breath taking visuals and the casting of a well known prestigious actor in the role for the most part everything you see on screen here equals anything you'll see in a spielberg hollywood movie there's a dalek invasion force numbering tens of thousands exotic aliens a 19th century cardiff that looks like a 19th century cardiff and night filming that is actually night filming and not done by sticking a dark filter over the screen i promise you'll be hearing a lot more from the directors who worked on this series joe especially will one day be in the hollywood a list br br there are some flaws to the new series of doctor who and all of them should be laid at the door of russell t davies it may be contentious whether the soap opera and post modernist elements are successful or not in my opinion they're not but what's not in dispute is that the weakest scripts are all written by rtd as i mentioned in my review of casanova he cheats the audience and he does the same thing here when faced by armed soldiers pointing their guns at him the doctor bellows attack plan delta which makes no sense to anyone in the audience but allows him to escape from a tight spot a naked captain jack suddenly pulls out a laser he's been hiding and rtd scripts are full of these type of cheats and deus ex machina type endings in fact the final episode is spoiled greatly by the ridiculous concept of what the bad wolf is which seems to have got rtd out of a tight spot more than the doctor and of the endings i'm trying to remember if any of them were actually down to the doctor more often than it's a supporting character or the doctor's companion who saves the day the show is called doctor who not rose tyler so can we see the title character save the day please just like he did in the classic series one final point about the portrayal of the doctor is the way he's written as a grinning loon eccleston is best known for his serious and gloomy roles and he's absolutely breath taking at scenes when he's showing grief like the tear running down his face in the end of the world but more often than not he's written as a tom baker on speed character it's obvious why eccleston hasn't done much comedy in his career he's not very good at it br br am i starting to sound like i hate this show sorry i didn't mean to but it's just that while some have been met or surpassed some others haven't and they're nearly all down to russell t davies who thankfully is contributing less in the way of scripts in the next series of doctor who let's see more traditional stories of a human outpost being under threat from monsters like we saw in the 1960s and 70s imagine a story like the sea devils with a massive budget directed by joe oh and one last request can we see these next time trailers scrapped they reveal all the best bits of next week's episode
<START> heart of darkness was terrible the novel was difficult enough to understand but when a production company decides to release a film loosely based on it then that just messes everyone up not only did those in charge decide to change certain characters and completely eliminate others but the acting was horrid and the overall impression i got from the movie was that it was a complete dud i watched the film in hopes of understanding the novel a bit better but it just threw me and my fellow classmates off completely i think the movie was a waste of time and i was disappointed to see tim roth in such a disappointing film especially when he has awesome flicks like pulp fiction and dogs under his belt same with the very cool john malkovich
<START> the grudge 2 is one of the films that makes me wish there were more synonyms for terrible in the english language with a plot replete with more holes than a net this film fails to make compulsive viewing for a fan of even the most inane films which i am i felt compelled to remain in the cinema until i had extracted Â£5 worth of entertainment from it though i feared that i would be there for some years a better film could be made from the out takes of the first installment of the grudge though i am not altogether sure this isn't the result of such an exercise as expected what passes for a plot in this dire example of wasted celluloid finishes with no resolution whatsoever thereby leaving the producers with the option of inflicting 'the grudge 3' upon the public when the time comes that they feel yet another pang of true hatred for civilisation
<START> now i loved lethal weapon and kiss kiss bang bang but i cannot believe shane black wrote this pile or that david morse and john c mcginley are in it i screened it for a film festival awful everyone was laughing it's preachy and heavy handed not to mention stupid also it's surprising how little l a looks like cambodia the entire idea of time traveling through post traumatic stress disorder is kinda dumb imagine born on the fourth of july mixed with the butterfly effect 2 i used to sequel as the example to really show how bad this movie is but directed by michael bay's 2nd unit director that bad the 2 stars are purely based on the production value
<START> in moscow the young couple veronika t and boris are in deep love for each other with the world war ii boris volunteers to join the army and is sent to the front on the day before birthday and they do not have the chance to say goodbye to each other while waiting for news from boris veronika is raped by boris' cousin mark a and they marry each other however veronika does not forget boris and keeps waiting for him br br is an impressive and heartbreaking romance in times of war the direction is excellent and uses ellipses along the story inclusive in the capital scene when veronika is raped by mark the camera work is amazing with sophisticated planes and angles and long traveling the scenes of veronika in the middle of the tanks or in the train station with many are awesome the magnificent cinematography is highlighted by the restored image of the dvd t has an extremely beautiful face and a touching and sensitive performance the speech in the last scene makes another great example of an anti war movie my vote is nine br br title brazil as when fly the stork
<START> i just don't get these reviews i can't help thinking they are written by the sort of l o g fan who would worship anything they ever do without questioning whether it is actually any good br br i'm a massive fan of the programme but thought this film was a pointless project i could forgive the ridiculous plot if i had come out of the cinema having laughed more than twice at one point i thought it might just me before i realised hardly any laughs were from the rest of audience br br i wasn't expecting much of a plot very few tv comedies stand up to being stretched over 90 minutes but thought the odd bit of classic l o g dialogue or visual joke like at the start of each programme would carry a film after 5 minutes of the 17th century plot i was begging for it to end little did i know it would carry on for the rest of the film it just wasn't funny br br i was just massively disappointed and can't see history being too kind to it even if a few die hard fans write enthusiastic reviews
<START> this is probably the best movie of 2002 regarding romanian cinema i do recommend it being an intense drama with no lack of action and thrills the movie concentrates upon teen life in the bucharest suburbs trough the main character not focusing so much on the character's shape or definition but more on the anger that he and other characters feel the title furia means rage rather than anger but could be regarded in the movie in both senses from the behavior of actors the rather odd love story not a typical romantic one but rather a modern suburban conception is well shaped towards the end it is a captivating picture and cinematography is pretty good in catching the suburban night life thus making it a nice movie to watch and br br you won't get bored for a minute i promise
<START> my wife and i watched this movie because we plan to visit sicily and stromboli soon fortunately or unfortunately the landscape and seascape complete with tuna are the only believable members of this cast we expected reasonable well written and well acted movie but were disappointed its only redeeming grace is an extended and remarkable fishing sequence full of authenticity thrashing tuna nets wooden boats with long and passionate if superstitious fishermen br br the movie's sequencing is stagy its dialogue stilted and the acting ranges from stiff to completely over the top one scene in which bergman stresses out as her macho native and naÃ¯ve husband sics his ferret on an innocent but apparently already deceased rabbit would be perfect grist for a monty python skit br br when the volcano blew we hoped for a merciful end to the suffering ours and the casts' unfortunately the movie continues to flail on staggering finally to a melodramatic and absurd ending unless you're really into old time tuna fishing pass this hokey effort by
<START> tv churns out dozens of true crime movies every year you can see 3 or 4 every saturday on lifetime and court tv can be relied on for a few every weekend so i started watching the morrison murders thinking i knew very well what to expect a more or less competent retelling of a real life family murder what i got was a subtle beautifully acted drama that engrossed me from start to finish br br both the brothers were totally convincing and jonathan was perfect in the challenging role of luke the look and feel of georgia was in almost every frame if i had any complaint it was gordon as the sheriff he just doesn't look or act like a small town southern lawman named byron calhoun he looks and sounds like and is not right for this part br br but this is a minor quibble the morrison murders is well worth watching and not just on a rainy saturday afternoon if you're going out tape it you won't regret it
<START> most of the positive comments posted here are as verbose as the movie it takes a long winded bore to appreciate a wordy and boring film one supposes some have merely called the film contemplative meaning slow and devoid of plot however one dutch reviewer hit the nail on the head this is an important event turned into a dull film whose tone is set in the very first scene here a young couple is being shown an apartment by a realtor who predictably talks non stop and regardless of what else is going on so does just about every other character br br the only silences in this picture are dream sequences 1930's soviet propaganda snippets and they are also its most interesting parts this tells you something about how watchable the rest of the movie is br br the device of filming most of the scenes in extreme closeup as if one were looking through a crack in the blinds gets old fast
<START> in this film the astronauts sent to explore a newly discovered planet must deal with several dilemmas and they do so intelligently the film approaches it's main plot theme in a unique way and unfolds it gradually though it can be guessed beforehand br br the acting is very good though sometimes stiff as some late 60s acting can be it can also be somewhat wordy and even melodramatic especially after the plot theme reveals itself visually it has a scene that resembles one in the previous year's 2001 a space odyssey and that tends to date the movie some of the actors went on to star in the 1970 tv show ufo which is delightfully campy and worth checking out on dvd br br despite these small points the space flight itself is realistic and considering this was 1969 the scenes inside the cockpit of the spacecraft also had a realistic look look for some 1990s 2000s video technology in use too one thing i suspect a love scene has been cut but i can't prove it it would have been a distraction anyway br br unlike most sci fi films this film will make you think about the plot and that's well worth a look i'm pleased to have this film in my video library
<START> please people do not bother with this poorly directed joke the direction was totally wrong from the outset where is the history of his mothers' emotional interference and the general madness in the original family why is ed portrayed as this large overbearing imposing figure full of anger and hate what is this crap the writer and director obviously did no research into the history and just wanted to cash in on the infamous gein name the fools who made this movie took so many liberties with the truth it's ridiculous if you want t see a brilliant gein film go back to the minor classic deranged to see how ed really was there is humor in that film and ed is portrayed as more of the sad lonely slight man he was according to history where is the background story here there is just poorly set up shocks that are not shocking that we've seen before and more accomplished as well take the worst texas chainsaw massacre ripoff and add this one to that list had to give it one out of ten because rating wouldn't accept zero i want my money back if anyone regards this film as is possibly getting a financial to do so
<START> i know that to include everything in the book the film would have to have been several hours long so i think they did their best to include things that were crucial and pivotal to the story i thought the casting was great the children who played amir and hassan were very good actors and the guy who played amir as an adult was great the scenes between him and baba were especially touching i thought the locations they used were interesting scenes set in afghanistan were shot in china and one scene that took place in ca the graduation scene was actually shot on treasure island in san francisco i worked one day as an extra on kite runner and it was that day the day they shot the graduation scene we reported to treasure island in the morning they checked everyone's wardrobe to make sure it looked like the late 80s an then we took our places in the audience they shot the scene over and over again until they were happy with it it was cool to see the actors up close and also to see the book's author who was on hand as a story consultant i thought this book was excellent and i recommend both the book and the movie to anyone this is a moving story about friendship love guilt and eventual redemption there is a way to be good again
<START> or at least you feel pretty high after this movie it's the kind of film that the word rollicking really can be applied to though it's rollicking in that entirely casual intelligent and open minded way that belongs to the french br br no catherine deneuve does not spend the entire movie high sorry to disappoint any puritans with an agenda but the one scene to which i refer involves all the members of a wedding party and it's a musical number anyway everything fits pretty seamlessly together and the unusual bright colorful family deneuve's mother is a lesbian deneuve her bon vivant daughter alternately entertain and annoy us as real families do but since it's a movie they mostly entertain br br don't want to say too much about the ending but deneuve ends up marrying a man about twenty years younger this is entirely believable as we see the relationship develop over time and as the two are naturally drawn closer and closer together the ending is a happy one and like the rest of the movie satisfyingly quirky as well as pitch perfect
<START> for anyone who cares to know something about the real diane arbus or who values psychological veracity this film is abysmal arbus was a brilliant talented restless and troubled person but this film depicts her as completely self involved and truly bizarre in her taste and judgment kidman portrays her as wan and vague whereas she was someone who knocked people over with her charisma the totally fictional relationship that is central to the film is quite unbelievable and robert downey is truly annoying in his smirking portrayal of someone who seems to think he's superior to the rest of the world simply because of his affliction the film depicts this encounter as being the source of interest in freaks which is a truly banal explanation for the inspiration behind some of the greatest photographs of the 20th century the mystery to me is why people of some talent and intelligence chose to be involved with this film in any way
