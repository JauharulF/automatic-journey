<START> i have no qualms with how the movie does not capture new jersey like zach i'm from there fine whatever i lived there way long enough i don't need to see a movie that captures the garden state br br what i do have qualms with is how bad this movie is let's make it easy on you we'll use some bullet points there are probably some spoilers that follow not that you wouldn't be able to predict the movie anyway br br the music placement was maddeningly forced and patronizing example large what are you listening to sam the shins ever heard of 'em no listen to this song it will change your life and then they proceed to play that shins song that was in a mcdonalds commercial don't you love when the characters in a movie blatantly tell you the viewer how to react to something i love that hey they should have put subtitles during various scenes instructing us to chuckle say cry feel inspired etc br br the scenes were so bad so clichÃ© so melodramatic example the entire movie but no really example they're in the rainy quarry by the ark large runs up in the pouring rain oh he's so tormented on top of a piece of heavy machinery and screams oh how moving but wait here comes sam and his buddy the annoying drug addict and they all scream but wait oh my god here it comes they kiss long deep in the rain br br the dialogue was so bad so clichÃ© so melodramatic example they're leaving the ark and sam says something like hey good luck exploring the infinite abyss and the guy says back you too oh oh my i never realized could it be oh my god it is large's life is like ohmigod an infinite abyss another example large and sam in the airport sam says something like is this goodbye not enough for ya ok says something like this isn't a period at the end of the sentence it's an ellipses and guess what happens when he tries to walk down the and go back to his life in la you know what don't guess it's a waste of your time br br it's a grade z wes anderson rip off movie when not busy being melodramatic and clichÃ© the movie spends lots of times with crazy kooky off kilter characters hey sam's brother thank you zach for including him because it really made the movie so much more textured also ripping off anderson the dialogue scene sam and are in a bar in walks friends vagina says one of them then they see him sitting with sam so one of the friends says sorry i said vagina and sam says it's ok br br inventive cinematography that's not inventive but pointless and annoying give me a break with the speed up slow down of film again wes anderson does it effectively in his movies and it was done well in donnie darko but really it was pointless wow a crazy party where people are taking x and snorting coke better roll out all the tricks br br you can count the good moments on one hand even if you're missing fingers that's what makes it even worse the retarded quarterback thing well that was good the little thing he says as they're about to enter the quarry something about huffing turpentine that was good oh wait that's about it br br you know zach is i think always a little too cute but he's likable but man this is forced pretentious melodramatic have you gotten that yet overly cute overly everything this movie is terrible apparently i'm outnumbered as this waste of time is currently rated an 8 0 br br please though if you're looking for something truly poignant and subtle and unique do not rent this movie
<START> oh my god this movie is incredible it's the baddest movie ever and i know what i am talking about i am a scary movies fan br br the story is totally silly a group of adults decide to make a party and a silly guy with an awful mask comes and kills everybody the dialogs are a kind of parody worst they're just talking about sex with a so bad accent the end is oh discover by yourself you will be really really surprised not possible yes it is and surprise the movie is just not possible bis yes it is worst than house iv and howling v br br to put it in a nutshell forget it forever
<START> geologist realizes a big earthquake is coming but no one will listen whats worse is his father in law had predicted the 1923 tokyo disaster and he's been called unworthy to be his successor of course the big one comes and tokyo is knocked flat br br a poorly dubbed japanese film that is pure soap opera for the first half the second half after the earthquake destroys a model city its an escape drama there are some nice moments but the film wastes them either by undercutting the action by too many poor miniatures or by having people do unreal things hokey and not very good it has an ending you won't believe
<START> this movie makes you think it shows how a woman's weaknesses can result in nightmares for others her physically aggressive behavior is more often seen in men than women so it made me feel even more uncomfortable to see the way the lead actress behaved i think that women might think about this behavior but i don't think they act on it the dark scenes added to the sense of evil that needed to be hidden i was relieved when the prisoners escaped i was hopeful that the end would bring a satisfying solution but it did not maybe that is more realistic life seems to run in the same direction instead of creating a new river bed running up hill
<START> first of all i think the casting and acting were excellent the problem is the story there is basically no story here worth telling and thus basically no movie here larry has done lonesome dove and i can't fault the original though it probably didn't need sequels he did hud with paul newman which is one of my favorite movies is supposed to be a country singer but the only song i hear him sing is an old buck owens song the movie makes a big deal out of chicken farming character has a good wife and it's utterly stupid of him to stray from her the incident with riding in the sliding cage is utterly stupid maybe people do that for fun in some parts of the country but i never heard of it

<START> this light heated for cassavetes love story is pleasantly conveyed by two wonderful performances by gena rowlands and seymour cassell rowlands was never more beautiful as a repressed damaged mid 30's woman who meets her match in seymour cassell is a of energy and romantic notions on his terms br br there is a great supporting performance by val avery as swift and an unusual as always timothy carey that's worth the price of admission made between husbands and a woman under the influence this is most accessible film that should touch the heart of anyone especially the cassavetes haters who claim his films are too long and ponderously heavy at times made my top ten that year and not seen by enough people an 8 out of 10
<START> terrible psychological thriller that is almost painful to sit through every aspect being awful br br the combined talents of top actors kevin bacon and gary oldman are totally wasted and though they give good performances one wonders why they bothered the script from mark kasdan is a complete mess and martin campbell has the narrative jumping all over the place but if you're unable to follow it take it as a blessing there are far too many pointless crazy scenes that just don't make sense jerry goldsmith's music is not much help either br br even if there was potential in the plot director campbell's approach has utterly ruined it avoid at all costs br br monday february 26 1996 video
<START> the girl in lovers' lane 3 out of 10 homoerotic subtext in the movies is a well known phenomenon plenty of dissertations have come out of film schools about the hidden subtexts in such films as top gun and spartacus the girl in lane certainly fits the homoerotic trope in fact it is so blatant and over the top even mst3k whom rarely notes such things in their riffing simply cannot avoid it br br the film is about two drifters one a rich kid lowell brown running away from home with a hundred dollars and no street smarts the other is a professional hobo brett halsey the hobo saves the kid from a gang of thugs and they end up in a small town consisting of a diner a pool hall and a whorehouse our drifter scholar gets a second look from the waitress joyce meadows as the titular girl in lovers lane who clearly is past the age of being and whose only other prospect is creepy jack elam doing a steve buscemi impression br br on the surface this seems like a strange film for the mst3k treatment while the cast are to old for the characters they are playing the acting is actually pretty good with both brett halsey and jack elam giving solid performances the story is slight but hardly the robot vs aztec mummy material and the production values are cheap back lot but relatively competent br br it is the strange batman and his ward homosexual undercurrents that make this film both awful and hilarious over the top objections to the kids attempts to get laid in the whorehouse are hilarious his inability to commit to the waitress or at the least get past first base are telling and the dozens of glances between him and the kid a hand on shoulder the sleeping arrangements blowing off dates with the girl so he and the kid can shave each other you have to be freud to figure out this undercurrent
<START> okay i like to give the benefit of the doubt i watched his show br br it isn't funny to me all i remember was a lot of weird noises and yelling i don't think i even cracked a smile the only thing that somewhat resembled humour was his jolie jennifer aniston bit i think you can get dumber by the minute watching it though br br also what's with the ask whitey section is that a ripoff of ask a gay dude black man from chappelle's show isn't it that obvious but when did it he was exposing the ignorance of the subject like borat but what's up with picking random white people and yelling stuff at them that's not funny its just plain dumb br br and i'm pretty sure i heard certain jokes of his somewhere else it seems like he's bits pieces throwing in some loud yelling br br anyway it wasn't funny seriously don't even waste your time
<START> it's 1913 a studio prop boy spies the actress who is going to become hollywood's next great movie star and he's the director that's going to make it happen after inventing pie throwing and the keystone cops his dream comes true being completely absorbed in his film making however he fails to notice that he is losing his leading lady to another man several over budget flops later he is known as nothing more than the director who turned down rin tin tin fortunately for him the loyal and compassionate residents of hollywood are untainted by ambition and ego he'll be okay as long as he still has his friends br br this movie starts out as a mad cap comedy typical of the time period and in the opening scenes it holds its own with the best of them it has a playful lack of self consciousness which is sorely missing in most of today's comedies shortly into the film however it moves away from this mode of comedy and instead attempts to entertain us using the films within the film these are silent slapstick comedies well done but nothing out of the ordinary and they go on for much longer than is necessary for any audience which has seen the originals upon returning the film takes a dramatic turn it's well written and the cast does an excellent job of making the transition but the movie really should have decided from the beginning what it was going to be br br by the end of the film it has transformed once again this time into a paean to the glitter of hollywood the small town of los angeles has grown up into the city which makes the movies that entertain the whole world br br in spite of its promising beginnings this film has not aged particularly well nevertheless it does have some strong scenes a certain nostalgic appeal and an entertaining sub text about the people who made it and the audiences it was made for
<START> 1st watched 1 1 2003 3 out of 10 dir henri verneuil sober drama about a well to do doctor who gets into trouble carrying on a relationship with a younger woman whom his family brings in to live with them as well as being married to another in the same household his searching for happiness is not clear but they do bring out the reason for his unhappiness rather well by displaying the overbearing trait of the females in his wife's line well played but predictable drama
<START> this is a classic continuation to bleu the likewise excellent film with juliet binouche as a main star moreover she is a cameo appearance here in rouge just for a second at the very end but this film truly red and very sweet although very sad is a real winner the main heroine played by ever great irene is a successful photo fashion model she leads a full active life only darkened by her traumatic relations with her weird friend mike who is in england by some lucky chance she gets friendly with the old judge who spends time listening to the private telephone talks of his neighbors the story starts to weave even further and we see him in court being almost universally condemned for his pastime she is the only one who feels sympathy for him for his cute doggy rita and her pups and for all the people who surround them we also witness the break up of a happy couple of a young lawyer and his lady and their quarrel is also fueled by that telephone scandal but the film is not about this even it is mostly about the loneliness and deep rifts between people far and near when she sails to england on a ferry with that lawyer as a chance fellow passenger as well as that earlier mentioned binoche who starred in bleu the ship sinks and we see the horrified look of the judge when he watches the news trying to guess if she survived she did and still we feel very heavy at heart mr managed to draw a grand subtle story about the solitude misunderstanding secrets and pain deep dark personal pain of those who are lost and lonely brilliant film
<START> when i first saw the trailer for the comebacks it looked absolutely horrible and i had no interest in seeing it but when it came out on dvd today i figured since there was nothing else that caught my interest i would rent it and give it a shot i watched it and it really wasn't that bad i think it was immature and stupid at times but there were a few funny moments that made me laugh i don't really watch many sports movies so i wonder maybe if i saw more maybe this movie would make more sense to me but it's all good i still didn't mind so much watching the comebacks i admit these stupid spoof movies are lame but what's the harm in a stupid joke every once in a while the comebacks isn't really that bad if you give it a fair chance br br coach fields is failing in life family and career both but when he is offered a chance to bring his career back to life if he can bring a looser football team into the championship but the team is really really terrible like beyond terrible but with a little work and team effort they try to give it their all even though that might turn into something more sad br br the comebacks over all isn't the worst film i've seen i think it's good for a couple laughs and giggles i know that this was stupid but i couldn't help but laugh when the coach comes in the middle of a fight in the locker room and he's beating the nerd's head against the locker just him and the nerd in general were so funny together if you have an open mind and don't take this movie too seriously i think you'll have a fun time watching it if you watch it expecting it to be oscar worthy material this is not the movie for you br br 4 10
<START> this movie was shot using a digital camera and it shows there were enough annoying digital tricks used to alienate the viewer also with the help of a terrible score as if that weren't enough the acting was also terrible now in hartley's movies the acting is always peculiar but here it was just bad especially by satan thomas jay ryan and harvey who thank god doesn't get to say much after all these external problems it is also very unfortunate that the story itself is not that good either the jokes are predictable and unbelievably straightforward and the events just rumble on from one incident to the next the so called book of life with armageddon inside isn't much more than an excuse to see actors struggle to say their lines all in all this movie is a waste of time and money and effort thumbs down
