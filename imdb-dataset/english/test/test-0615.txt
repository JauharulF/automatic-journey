<START> the movie uses random events of historical significance as its backdrop and willy nilly criss crosses the lives and time lines of its 3 central characters to what purpose one may ask the problem with this film is that the script becomes the 'story' not characters or their lives br br it starts off with a bunch of rich aimless college kids and a couple of not so rich too drawn into the movement affair rejection and separation follows people go their own ways seemingly only till the heroine forces herself upon them not once but twice after a pause in the the next hurdle for these 3 is the emergency imposed on the country by indira gandhi lots of political figures roam around for no obvious reason the sub plots are too contrived and don't add up to make a logical whole br br the movie tries to impose a false pace but never reaches a true rhythm barely coherent at times there is no maturation and growth whatsoever in the arcs of the 3 ex college buddies even after they are presumably married engaged settled or whatever they are ever too eager to just ditch it all and head off to a village to have sex with the ex lover or ex flame what fertile imagination the screen writer possesses so many 4 letter words are used without any rhyme or reason that its downright abusive br br singh has a horrible american accent that she doesn't try to hide its hideous hearing her mouth clichÃ© ridden dialog like up i didn't think you'd come' this after the hellish nightmare she's just been thru or in the beginning 'i appreciate your concern but i can take care of myself' yikes what kind of clown wrote the dialogs for this she invites her friend in to have a cup of 'south no less coffee wishes someone good morning and then is wished good night by someone else in the family now whats up with that br br the countless uncredited villagers and are the best actors the editing is really erratic with too many cuts obviously trying hard to make a bold statement sudhir misra screwed up big time on this one
<START> an excellent debut movie for the the director of batman begins comes the following a movie about a man who follows other people for inspiration of characters in stories he writes one man he follows he decides to go further and the man turns out to be more than he bargained for br br using a cast of non actors and his uncle writing directing producing and otherwise completely making this movie entirely on his own with almost no budget and produced independently this movie is much more than you'd expect br br for anyone who likes memento and complex twists turns shocks and messing around with time this is definitely a movie for you
<START> jacqueline susann wrote several novels all involving sex and melodrama and a few of them actually were made into films including this effort and they all have the distinction of being some of the worst films ever made story here is about robin stone john phillip law and his rise to the top of television by being ruthless and calculating to everyone around him he's a playboy of the worst sort using and then throwing away every woman he beds including the wife of the network president br br spoiler alert greg austin robert ryan is in charge of the television network and when his younger wife judith takes one look at robin she wastes no time getting into bed with him greg falls ill and has to take some time off and this is where robin steps in and starts trying to run the network but during all this a model named amanda jodi wexler who is in love with him kills herself when greg returns to his job he tries to get rid of robin by using the morals clause in his contract when rumors start flying about his relationship with jerry nelson david hemmings who's a gay fashion photographer br br this was directed by jack haley jr who went on to be a very successful producer in both television and movies but this was only his second film as a director and the material he was forced to deal with seems way over his head the script comes from novel and that would probably be why this resembles a cross between alfie and the valley of the dolls and i think the reason why her books never could translate well onto film is because the filmmakers made the terrible mistake of taking her stories seriously instead of tongue in cheek with that the laughs that come from this are unintentional especially during that totally ridiculous fight towards the end of the film which starts when cannon refuses to give back the slave bracelet to the gay characters hemmings was a very good actor but his role here is completely over the top and it has him wearing one of the worst beards in history and using the term chic in every other sentence law was not the original choice for the lead but another actor that was cast had a serious accident and law stepped in and delivers one of the more wooden performances this side of miles o'keeffe the film's script suffers in two different areas in that it's both completely silly and horribly dull and it will test a viewers patience if they choose to watch this one has to wonder what would be the outcome if a director decided to film one of novels and not take it seriously because the attempt here is ponderous and ridiculous
<START> this movie starts off as a college flick but turns pretty ugly after the main character's sister is gang raped by a biker gang driving a van it has a pretty good pace and james van patten does a pretty good job in this cannon tax write off movie this was the first movie i ever saw at the drive in here in toronto the main feature was alphabet city and young warriors was the added feature out of the 2 movies young warriors was by far more entertaining and memorable if you are a fan of blow 'em up excessively violent movies this one would make a great addition to any collection
<START> action packed with my favorite type of creature i won't give any of it away if you have'nt seen it cause it's worth taking the time to sit down and unravel in the mystery of things as presented in this film it did gets slow at times and those were the moments my mind wondered which does easily anyways but moist of it kept me quietly thrilled where you keep it in your head instead of letting it out probably the mood i was in at the time special effects and action sequences you could feel made up for the occasional lulls of course a of movies out there exactly like this the film still has it's own style and flavor which i respect from underground independent horror movies anyways
<START> no wonder a lot of us hate classical music and what are the children to think with educational pr like this serious music will soon slip from life support to the morgue kids know when they're being talked down to and this is no exception why can't someone good do a movie about classical music for kids i must admit i enjoyed the actor who played beethoven he took to the role with enthusiasm and a keen balance of the poignant and humorous aspects of beethoven's character he obviously did his research otherwise this is a third rate rehash of the old abc afterschool special format with none of the occasional charm those short films had sorry about the rant but this is an important subject for young people to know about and it could have been done well i wonder if musicians or filmmakers were responsible either way the kids are hipper than you think folks br br
<START> the first time i saw the poster i was stunned by its tranquility and beauty then the city of istanbul has been haunting in my mind ever since br br not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture it itself is a landscape br br actually there are a lot of things going on in the film but the director deliberately omitted most dramatic parts and leave them to our imagination thus creating a really flat life mild spoiler one can see ladylove crying in the toilet and then going out without a word but not their fight one can see accompanying his mother in the hospital but not her struggle from illness the most dramatic scene in the film to me is laughing out loud for the toy soldier he bought for his niece and that's when it almost broke my heart to see this boring lonely life bursting out in such a way br br with all the trivialities in life the story presents us with pure inner world of all the characters their sadness anxiety loneliness regrets and as the story unfolded i sort of finally grasped their desperate situation where their emotions were really no way out if no outer things intervened which is exactly every loner tries to keep at all cost especially for an irresponsible artist like br br i've just finished my second watching last night i into my quilt had some vodka beside my bed and went through the whole film in a trance i felt two real lives going on one outside the screen one inside the screen i felt free from all those loneliness and anxiety 'cause the people inside were experiencing it i just had myself removed from all those things br br we cannot deny the universal problem of communication and loneliness even puts us far towards it and it becomes a vicious spiral i bet still didn't figure out a way of living in the end that's why he stepped out of his room to try to find the answers from the outer world the coldness and landscape
<START> h g wells' war of the worlds by director david michael is a slightly less than average flick which isn't too bad if one considers the budget he had to work with only 1 million for this budget the production value wasn't too bad the best part of it is the visual effects i was thoroughly impressed with the cgi considering the budget and sound design the less then stellar parts of this film are the story which is very prolonged at best but again i think this is because of the budget they had they had to prolong certain scenes to create the feature length 97 minutes the acting again it's because the actors had no story to work with very few exceptional camera shots and the music however again i can let the negative parts go for the most part only because this film was made for a meager budget and still had good production value still you should d see it for the sake of seeing how a low budget version of war of the worlds can be made even with flaws 4 out of 10
<START> written and directed by hayao miyazaki is a little tale that speaks of respect for the ocean respect for humans young and old and respect for cultural differences it is a new tale of a little goldfish wishing to be a girl rather than a retelling of disney's little mermaid miyazaki has animated by hand a whimsical magical film for the young and the young at heart the film begins with a slow undulating blue green palette of sea jellyfish and scores of little fanciful goldfish with childlike faces there isn't any need for narrative the motion of the creatures and the music of jo tell the beginning released last summer in japan won the japanese academy's award for best animation film and best score jezebel com the fanciful little goldfish leaves her ocean home on a jellyfish upon reaching the surface she is caught up in a fishing net full of other fish garbage and sludge she is propelled into a jar which is rolled to shore where five year old voice by frankie jonas retrieves it he cuts his hand when breaking the jar open to free the little goldfish tastes his blood which heals cut and puts in motion her transformation to a human at the same time throwing nature out of balance puts the little goldfish in a green pail and names her noah cyrus meaning soft and jelly like mother lisa tina fey lets him take to school which is right next door to the nursing home where she works lisa's crazy driving down the picturesque winding road past a dry dock through the bustling fishing town and up a tree lined road to the nursing home is representative of miyazaki's wonderful sequence of action and illustrates perfectly a parent's hectic morning miyazaki has created another strong independent female character in lisa making her a loving sensible modern mother both to and lisa's telephone conversation with the not coming home again husband matt damon because the ship he captains must make another run is a typical wife's reaction later that evening intercedes using a signal lamp to speak to his father as the ship passes the cliff their house sits on lisa refuses to acknowledge apology and jumps up and signals bug off bug off bug off it is a hilarious scene but when takes the signal lamp and tells his dad good luck love you lisa hugs him and tells him he has a good heart it is a very poignant scene br br my personal favorites are miyazaki's elderly granny type women in wheelchairs at the nursing home betty white noriko cloris leachman and lily tomlin their over little goldfish is wonderful and reminiscent of the bickering between the witch of the waste lauren bacall and sophie jean simmons as they trudge up a long flight of stairs in howl's moving castle magical sea god father fujimoto liam neeson resembling the wizard howl arrives to take back to her ocean home fujimoto uses one of his elixirs to try and put nature back in balance but magical little escapes again upsetting more elixir in the process and causing a tsunami running on the backs of giant dolphins to get to this redheaded little girl reminds the audience of the stubborn adventurous little mei in my neighbor totoro is just as adventurous and curious as mei when fujimoto realizes what has done he calls for gran kate blanchett the goddess of the ocean to help with the situation this wise calming goddess arrives in a blue flowing garment that never ends she has a private talk with lisa discussing the future of the young children which helps the audience understand and relationship is not that of lovers but of brother and sister the life goes on quiet simple ending is typical of miyazaki films leaving the audience full of hope
<START> director nico has made a cynical cash grabber by his own admission that is too cynical to impress anybody but a sophomore genre fan br br the most extreme confronting genre pics to paraphrase a character in videodrome have a philosophy that is what makes them dangerous br br island of death's philosophy is to throw many shocking elements into a cinematic mix and stir slowly the result is a dish with no taste but an ugly appearance br br not to be confused with brilliant who could kill a child sometimes called island of death effort is set on a greek island which is a stage for various forms of slaughter a little bestiality and some wholesale perversion br br everything moves at a pace and the violent set pieces are poorly directed br br touted as the movie that the censors didn't want you to see i'd hazard a guess that the censors never saw it they simply read the until their knees jerked upwards
<START> i am easily pleased i like bad films i like films featuring attractive young women in small amounts of clothing br br this film gives all the above a bad name yes you know going in that what you're getting is not high art or anything like but even for the type of movie it is beach babes from beyond isn't very good br br some people have given it 10 i can only assume that these are people who have had the organs which enable rational thought to take place surgically removed br br it isn't very good it simply isn't very good br br 3 out of 10 solely on the grounds of a novelty value for the famous relatives and burt ward and b some of the girls are cute br br oh by the way did i tell you that it isn't very good
<START> chaplin is a in his final film of 1918 a who can not seem to get the marching down straight he spends time over there in world war one trenches several gags stand out limburger cheese as a makeshift grenade for one the cramped quarters of the barracks in the trenches and when chaplin and his mates are washed out of their bunks by flooding are highlights chaplin ends up capturing several german soldiers single handed and he the german commander for refusing a cigarette when asked how he did it chaplin replies that he surrounded them chaplin hides behind enemy lines as a tree of all things and those scenes are very very funny he escapes to a bombed house where he meets up with a french girl played by edna he's tracked down by german soldiers escapes from them again and is arrested for assisting him chaplin is able to pull a fast one by bopping a soldier and using the soldier's uniform he ends up saving of course and capturing the kaiser in the process along the way chaplin employs some sight gags and slapstick in turning back the german soldiers with this film chaplin explored the location possibilities in filming while maintaining the audience's attention for closer to feature length time something his contract with the mutual film corporation him the film also allowed him to poke fun at the enemy something he would again do to greater effect in the great dictator of 4 stars
<START> like a lot of the comments above me also i though this was the average scifi movie but unfortunately it was not i found it rather patronizing and indeed preaching br br but that is not the only comment the scenes are very not as in scifi as i will explain a in a few moments the next sentence is a small spoiler the movie more or less represents a discussion between two groups the physical setting of a discussion typically involves two or three men standing next to each other the middle one typically speaking in the worst case the other party is represented by one person br br also the interviews the reporters have are very artificial sometimes even unprofessional for example sometimes the discussion is between the reporters i mean from a point of the interviewed moreover the interview persons always stay calm they say everything without normal emotions i e you cannot tell whether they lie or not are mad or not they show almost nothing br br this is also very unprofessional the 'christian' reporters always believe everything they are told by the people they interview br br bottom line br br all conversations contain br br facts br br pro con arguments br br there are no lies nobody lies the next sentence is a spoiler ignore if you still plan to see the movie the only lie happening is to demonstrate how 'bad' non believers are br br this makes me conclude that the movie is a b movie it is very similar to 'plan 9 from outer space' from the 50's but this movie also has an annoying wrong set discussion about aliens and christian belief br br note i have no intention to insult christians people who believe in aliens or whomever else this is a thought i have about the movie not about people br br moreover i would like to note that i don't know whether the actors are bad or were just given terrible scripts
<START> if you're a child of the eighties like me you probably remember this 1981 disney movie one of disney's first pg rated films and michael j fox's screen debut i can remember watching this film over and over on hbo when i was on middle school and i only recently found a very old copy of it since disney stopped producing the movie several years ago needless to say this is a real fun movie to watch five college teams decipher clues in an evening race around los angeles trying to reach the finish line first watch for the cameo from paul reubens from the cheesy music to the disco scene with the fat twins this is a quintessential 1980s fun film that you'll love
<START> tourist trap is a bizarre great horror film from the '70s the film is about a group of young adults becky jerry and molly who are traveling in a jeep through a desert area their two other friends eileen and her boyfriend woody are in a separate car when a wheel goes flat woody takes it to a nearby gas station and meets a grisly fate to some bizarre telekinetic mayhem and some creepy mannequins the friends get tired of waiting for woody and go to a local tourist trap mannequin wax museum in front of the entrance the car randomly breaks down and the girls find an oasis area to go swimming in where they are approached by mr who runs the roadside attraction that is now closed down he takes them up to the old western wax museum and the girls stay behind while he and jerry go to fix their car eileen the curious of the two wanders to an old house nearby where she also falls to the hands of a mysterious masked killer and a bunch of life like mannequins after awaiting for eileen becky and molly go to look for her that's when the real horror begins and the telekinetic can move objects with his mind masked brother of mr begins to kill off the teens one by one while controlling his large amount of human turned mannequins br br sound similar to the 2005 house of wax remake well it is i'd heard of this movie but never seen it when i saw house of wax but now i can see the striking similarities the two movie share tourist trap was obviously a big contributor to the house of wax remake the mannequins in this movie are scary to begin with some with moving eyeballs some with no eyes at all and some with dropping mouths that sing too the singing was extremely creepy if you ask me and the mannequins were eerily designed mannequins are creepy to begin with they're so lifelike yet they really aren't the movie tightly blends elements from texas chainsaw massacre the masks the killer uses are similar to those of leatherface with a little bit of the original house of wax and the telekinetic powers that are displayed in carrie the result is quite satisfying the telekinesis was a nice touch to the movie it made the killer all the more menacing and inescapable the masks were terrifying and the scene was really disturbing br br the score for the film was really well done if not a little overused during some scenes the acting may not be particularly on key but it really wasn't that bad chuck connors was really good as the shadowy mr giving the character a shady but friendly feel a young tanya roberts is also in the film she's most known for her role on charlie's angels and more recently the sitcom that '70s show playing donna's mother robert a burns serves as the art director he did a phenomenal job on the original texas chainsaw and does a good job here as well creating a cluttered musty atmosphere to both the rundown museum and the old house filled with mannequins i found it a little odd that the original rating for the film was pg it seems a little too scary to have such a tame rating but the film really isn't too violent br br overall tourist trap is an eerily unique fast paced extremely under appreciated horror classic full moon gave it a decent 20th anniversary dvd release the commentary was interesting and the picture was clear and crisp for the most part better than the video versions if you enjoy older '70s slasher horror films tourist trap is an underrated retro gem 8 10
