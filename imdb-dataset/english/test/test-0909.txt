<START> this is the best television series for children and adults ever john hurt is a great actor with many excellent performances over many years but he was born to play the storyteller the scripts for almost every episode are superb pieces of craftsmanship and the productions run the gamut of the emotions being alternately funny sad happy exciting and always hauntingly beautiful it is hard to pick a best episode from so many excellent contenders but the soldier and death with its timeless pathos is unbeatable it is a series to watch with your children over and over again
<START> unlike http www imdb com title this movie provides no background information we are shown a snapshot of the fall of his mock process and execution but unless one studied the revolution quite extensively it is difficult to understand where characters come from robespierre and thus to appreciate them for what they are and joe could be the same person to the viewer for example robespierre were close friends since their youth and this explains how robespierre acts those who know the facts though will easily orient themselves and appreciate this good movie with actors delivering solid acting no useless subplots and good reconstruction of the times and are the best characters but all do a good job even the 'demented' saint just portrayed as sort of psychopath was a period of massacres whose importance hasn't been fully documented and that for the most part were driven by ambition greed and the settling of personal disputes fed to ignorant sans as the next epochal step against tyranny
<START> this film has a decidedly weird setting taking place in a school that's really old to begin with but it certainly doesn't look like any sterile medical school environment very gothic and atmospheric as for the film itself well ok the premise is a bit far fetched but hey that's why we watch movies isn't it and it's less far fetched than some of the garbage that's out these days that's for sure medical students are experimenting with 'short death as in allowing themselves to be briefly dead so they can experience what the afterlife is like it's kind of nice in some cases till parts of it come back with the voyager and start meddling in their earthbound lives i hadn't seen this film in years till i got it on dvd and i have to say that i'd forgotten just how good it was and it struck me that julia roberts looks truly beautiful in this film not like actresses of today that are supposedly gorgeous but are dressed and made up like cheap hookers ahh the good old days anyway this is a great flick perhaps not for fundamentalist christians but many others may enjoy it 8 out of 10 stars
<START> good animation nice character design and a light hearted story make no enjoyable to watch br br after my first viewing i thought that this anime was pretty good but but was much better on for a second watch br br this is because it is done out of chronological order and once you re watch it in correct order you notice connections you didn't see before or it may be that you see a second meaning to some events you didn't notice before you may want to read the original novels not manga by before after seeing this the anime is very good at visualizing every detail in the stories it shows br br however there are some short stories from the book that are not animated but are referenced to bamboo w wishes attached shown in episode 14 overall this anime is actually very good once after brief of the plot reading the book improves upon it as well it is a nice break from the shounen jump anime that seem to be taking over
<START> a young couple father ben solid charles bateman wife nicky the lovely capri and their daughter the cute of i dismember mama fame find themselves trapped in a small california desert town populated by hysterical lunatics worse yet there's a pernicious satanic cult that's been abducting little children for their own diabolical purposes director bernard working from an offbeat and inspired script by william welch and l q jones devil times five director sean macgregor came up with the bizarre story relates the compellingly oddball plot at a slow yet steady pace and ably creates a creepy edgy mysterious ooga atmosphere martin delivers a wonderfully wicked and robust performance as doc duncan who's the gleefully sinister leader of the evil sect the top rate cast of excellent character actors qualifies as a substantial asset jones as gruff no nonsense sheriff moore as friendly local toby and charles robinson as a shrewd fiercely devout priest jack john arthur morrill's bright polished widescreen cinematography jamie mendoza spooky score and the wild rousing climactic black mass ritual are all likewise up to speed the idea of having toys come to murderous life is simply ingenious the opening scene with a toy tank coming real and crushing a family in their car is truly jolting nice eerily ambiguous ending too a pleasingly idiosyncratic and under appreciated winner
<START> nothing dull about this movie which is held together by fully realized characters with some depth to them even the hooded torturers have body language jannings' performance is brilliant all will want and need a henry viii as he must have been henny is maybe nobler and purer than anne boleyn but she plays the part as written a victim caught in the jaws of a big huge baby br br cinematography is gorgeous in the restoration the tints sensuous lubitsch lets these characters breathe and reveal their corruption down to the tiniest of he takes his time which can try the patience of an audience accustomed to being carried away by action but the time is worth spending slow your heartbeat and watch this minor miracle of german silent film
<START> this was very funny even if it fell apart a little at the end does not go overboard with homage after to hitchcock owen danny devito was lucky he had strangers on a train playing at the local cinema so the movie flat out tells you that that was the inspiration br br devito is very funny but also a little sad he has no friends and all he wants to do is write and have someone like his writing his teacher billy crystal is going through some serious writers block of his own and his wife has stolen his book and made it her own success which also has him frustrated a great deal br br best parts are the book proposal by mr one hundred girls i'd like to pork and all scenes with anne ramsey who is so horrible that even mother theresa would have wanted to kill her too
<START> this awful effort just goes to show what happens when you not only use computers to generate the effects but also let them devise the plot and write the script someone somewhere has obviously come up with a new bit of software that asks a few questions then churns out four hours of loosely connected clichÃ©s lousy dialogue and a collection of stock characters that you end up wishing had all drowned in the first five minutes br br tom courtney took the prize for worst performance saying that he was wooden would be an insult to trees it's hard to fault robert carlyle in almost anything he does but the odds were stacked against even him in this one especially since he was for some unaccountable reason required to adopt a blimey london accent br br a complete washout
<START> being belgian myself i take interest in the history of congo it has been our only colony for many years rwanda was a belgian but not a colony and it is part of our country's history nowadays it seems to be very popular to say that all that the belgians did to congo was wrong especially in the 19th century i'm not saying that bad things didn't happen of course they did but back then this wasn't abnormal do you really think the french or the brits were that much nicer in their colonies no they weren't it was 'normal' at the time for our king leopold ii to use congo as a way to gain personal wealth it was his private property it didn't belong to the state then and he tried to make the most out of it of course gruesome things like hands being chopped off happened and yes to todays standards that's inadmissible but in those days it was common practice and it has to be said all this didn't happen anymore during the last decades i know several people who have lived an worked in congo for many years before the declaration of independence it's true that they had several black servants but they are very nice people and i really can't imagine they ever treated them bad for as far as i know they have always treated them with a lot of respect however i'm not saying all belgians did in fact if they weren't that old now almost all about 80 years old now they would love to return to congo br br the good thing about this movie is that it gives an historically accurate vision on what happened during the last years of belgian and the first years of independence the story isn't as black and white perhaps not the best words in this context but how else to explain what i mean as i feared it would be it doesn't say that all the belgians did was wrong and all the did was good it shows perfectly how the in their rush of getting independent from the belgians didn't mind to accept help from the russians as well as the americans who both had more eye for the raw materials like copper diamonds bauxite rubber and getting the in their political 'camp' and weren't all that interested in their independence it does not only give a good idea of how became more powerful but also how played a double role it shows the belgian reaction on some of our compatriots being violated threatened and even murdered my father was one of the who were send to congo to rescue the belgians it gives a good idea of the political problems encountered as the province didn't want to be part of the republic the role that the belgians had in the murder on it all gets it's part in this movie br br the story seems to be very accurate and the characters really look and act like the real ones this movie has been able to give a very good idea of what life in congo in the late fifties and early sixties was like and should be seen by everybody who is interested in the history of the country but it should also be shown in history classes especially in belgium because it's a part of our history that should never be forgotten i give it a 7 5 10 perhaps even an 8 10
<START> to sum this movie up it is labute carrying his sadism over into the realm of comedic farce the predictable result is that he is constantly stepping on all the jokes by insisting on surrounding them with blood curdling violence and extremely hateful characters there is also evidence of his continuing efforts to insult and ridicule everything in sight but then to apologize for it with weak gestures to the pc basically the movie just doesn't work its plot is beyond contrived the characters are one dimensional cliches there is no consistency or development of anything and the comedy where it is not totally out of place is the worst kind of high concept drivel br br morgan freeman and renee zellweger are completely wasted on characters that seem like parodies of studio driven audience pandering no matter what make them likeable neutral and neutered and full of moral platitudes crispin glover is in here just long enough to convince you that he doesn't belong in movies anymore chris rock actually has negative chemistry with fellow hitman freeman it's as if they are acting in different rooms even when they are two inches away from each other in effect chris rock seems like a digital insert at least he isn't as annoying as jar jar br br labute's 15 minutes may well be up by now it's already looking like he's overstayed his welcome
<START> unlike most people who've commented i was born after the last sylvester mccoy episode and so couldn't have compared the two centuries of doctor who at first i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series i have since then seen old episodes of doctor who and some where great but like the doctor the series needed to regenerate to continue the 21st century doctor who's are great i thought martha was great almost a match for the doctor and if jack's appearance is anything to go by she's going to be brilliant when she cameos in series 4 or 5 br br speaking of jack the spin of torchwood is also brilliant and you should watch both of these programmes though this is definitely more suitable for kids however if you insist that this isn't the same and just isn't doctor who please just stay in your basement br br 10 10
<START> very straight not happy with the movie br br the main center of the movie is the story where the lady is the mother of all the snacks and all the things br br if they can more explain that how this is happening and all the stuff then it was quite a fun and more rating for this movie br br the end was very short and sudden till now actor of the movie was to save her then at last he told sorry now we are late oh crap br br what was the story and how this all this thing happen i think they can put all these stuffs so the end user like us will be satisfied that yes we are happy with the movie br br any way but nice idea and nice try so i will say 4 or max 4 5
<START> sonny chiba as everyone knows is the man in this film he portrays mas oyama 1923 1994 a real martial artist who fought over 50 bulls with his bare won interesting him up anyway chiba only kills one bull in the film but it's a memorable scene and as the liner notes say right up there with the zombie vs shark scene in zombi the film also offers up loads of hand to hand combat and a decent plot to boot though i don't believe all of it is true this film is the first of the oyama trilogy chiba made and is recommended for fans of martial arts action finally three neat little tidbits part of the opening theme was used in kill bill volume 1 oyama himself appears in the opening sequences and that is because he trained chiba in real life for five years
