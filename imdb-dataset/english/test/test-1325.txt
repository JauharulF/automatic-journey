<START> as i looked at this movie once again i think it belongs among hitchcock's greatest films the first time i saw it i was just blown away by the suspense action and imagery it has the gripping ending the deranged murderer the innocent man framed or victimized by circumstances some great on location shots e g the jefferson memorial in washington and penn central in new york it also has great supporting actors with hitch's daughter patricia in the role of the younger sister to ruth roman and the stalwart leo g carroll in another of his hitchcock movies the merry go round episode near the end is one of the most nerve wracking in hitchcock's body of work br br robert walker as bruno anthony his last full film gives a great performance as the deranged stranger on the train who worms himself into the life of the unsuspecting tennis star guy haines farley granger granger plays the nice guy who is caught up in a messy divorce the movie opens with the camera showing the shoes of two separate men as they leave their taxis to board the train eventually they meet and the story takes over the stranger takes an unusual interest in the tennis star and as the movie continues the stranger becomes a stalker the action shifts from place to place including washington the fictional small town of metcalf the forest hills tennis championship and a passenger train taking the two leading men back and forth on separate missions towards the end the pace of a tennis game is woven into the plot as they race against time the camera cuts away to the faces of the athletes as they volley and serve in a remarkable series of shots when the closely fought contest is over the climactic chase takes place hitchcock has a love for trains and it is great to see penn station long since gone trains are featured in the 39 steps the lady vanishes shadow of a doubt spellbound north by northwest and this movie br br this classic hitchcock thriller took place at the start of a period of great creativity for the master of suspense the 1950's and i am convinced that one day it will be given its due in the hitchcock hall of fame
<START> disappointing film with walter pidgeon as a hunter who goes to germany to assassinate hitler when he is discovered he is coerced into signing a document stating that he acted on orders from england his refusal to sign the document brings us to the plot of the film br br pidgeon is pursued back to england by the evil george sanders and his cohort john carradine who speaks little but is again as always the embodiment of wickedness personified br br along the way of being pursued pidgeon meets up with joan bennett the latter displaying a wonderful cockney accent br br the story gets bogged down somewhat as love develops between the two but again as we approach world war 11 realism becomes the object of the day br br the near ending scene in the cave between sanders and pidgeon is nicely realized but we know where that arrow is going to go to br br very interesting that while pidgeon is fleeing nazi germany he meets up again with a young roddy mcdowall one of many co stars that same year in the memorable how green was my valley how green was man hunt
<START> spoilers below br br a dog's life' was most noteworthy for its excellent comic timing in charlie chaplin's other movie from 1918 shoulder the silent film genius focuses on an entirely different brand of humor his war comedy specializes in surreal exaggerated set pieces in which chaplin demonstrates unprecedented creativity and mastery of composition when the soldier's bunker gets flooded the water level reaches just the right height so that chaplin can execute his gags most successfully in a later scene the soldier dresses up as a tree a disguise that belies chaplin's much increased ingenuity and goofiness naturally when the enemy discovers his ruse the soldier darts straight for the forest the ensuing chase is a visual marvel chaplin not only hides the soldier from the germans but he uses the forest to mask the soldier from the audience as well such that the camouflaged soldier stands in the middle of the frame yet somehow remains invisible all the while we thought our little hero was pulling a fast one on the german army to our delight the joke is on us too br br rating 8
<START> this movie is pathetic not because it's poorly directed acted sung danced filmed etc but because it's really difficult to ruin a movie using an abba soundtrack yet unfortunately this is the only thing the movie succeeds in doing the musical presentations in the movie southpark was much better than in mama mia the director of mama mia is proof that you don't need talent to be a director all you need are abba songs br br just to give a sample of the awfulness an aging meryl streep is shot with close ups in the harsh sunlight singing and just ruining the song with all the distracting wrinkles on her face why do that to one of the most talented actresses out there
<START> i watched this movie at the first showing available in my area and it was quite clear that most people didn't get the movie even if you don't it's a good movie with some interesting character development it is a thoroughly human story about some very imperfect people in a backwoods southern town and really speaks to the root of the blues if you don't know what the black snake moan is by the time you leave the theater you didn't get it and no it's not just a song christina ricci does a great job and is thoroughly convincing in her role as is samuel l jackson i think this is his best performance since his role in pulp fiction and probably his best including that because of the range of his character in bsm the rest of the cast is solid with a few shining performances here and there particularly john jr as reverend r l i'm a very selective movie watcher and this film honestly rates among my favorites because of its candid look at race sex religion and neurosis in a rural southern town along with its cinematic genius in my opinion
<START> the planet is an astounding piece of film making for a mere production have turned out one of the most original sci fi films for a long time br br starring the physically intimidating mike mitchell the film is a mix of great special effects strong storytelling and well planned action from the opening space battle to the pounding finale everything about this film appears well above it's budget br br to start with the special effects while certainly not revenge of the sith standard they are on level if not above the likes of babylon 5 and farscape and for a snip of a price as well the detail and the movement is superb and captures the imagination from the off the design of everything ships weapons entities is second to none the imagination and creativity involved is a real surprise for a film of this budget br br another surprise was the strength of the story and the arc it takes there are a few twists and turn most of which are well written into the script surprising and well played out i was surprised that two years in the making and first imagined 15 years ago how relevant some aspects of the story are to today's society with the happenings around the world there may be a certain resonance with the lengths the mercenaries are forced to go to in order to survive br br even the sounds effects are spot on as is the atmospheric music the use of light and costume add further to the professional look beach in looks a desolate and lonely place br br in all honesty this film looks 10 if not 100 times the budget spent and that's testament to a creative hard working team of people from the director to the cast to the effects via the producer and sound team wonderful effort i recommend you get your hand on a copy asap
<START> i saw the movie in the theater at its release then watched the vhs tape over the years and while strolling through target saw this dvd bundled with pushing tin for the exorbitant sum of 5 50 br br there is something about this comedy that has really clicked with me how kelsey grammar with a tattoo on his thing is an unorthodox commander who inherits a rusty diesel sub and a crew of screwballs and misfits he's up against the navy's best a los angeles class nuclear attack sub and his old captain wm macy br br bruce dern plays the bad guy rip torn the admiral running the exercise if you don't laugh hysterically during the run silent segment with the cook well you have a different kind of humor from me br br towards the end the machinist says d b f with no explanation it is apparently some inside knowledge gotten from an old submariner consultant thanks to google i learned that with the advent of the nuclear subs the old salts would wear pins diesel boats forever br br a navy friend said that many of the technical aspects aren't correct but who cares it is one of the funniest movies i've seen br br i don't think it takes a clairvoyant to know who will win in this exercise
<START> the is one of the worst spoofs i have ever seen for one main reason it isn't funny i laughed a handful of times the acting is bad the script is worse and why those guys had baby in their hair i will never know and you can tell this didn't have much of a budget to work with and it openly hurts the film they had a good idea going in some parts but it never really came to past and what was the point about the lead being older than his dad 3 out of 10
<START> that someone could have conceived this nonsense and then got it produced is incredible that it actually aired on television and advertisers actually paid to be associated with it is mind boggling this stomach wrenching excuse for kid's programming is almost too vile to comment on i've burned yes burned any barney tapes that people have given my son to find this awful programming in my library was an unpleasant surprise and where tell me where do they get those smarmy kid actors have their parents no sense those kids will be on drugs before they're teenagers geez the final insult is that i have to add this extra line to the review to get it on imdb
<START> from the offset i knew this was going to be a terrific movie the pace the cinematography personalities indigenous to the dallas area the of characters not to mention the director oliver stone and of course eric the film starts out on a friday suggestively occult in the first place and begins with a radio station in dallas that is hosting their number one talk show the barry show based on the talk radio host alan berg barry eric is the abrasive radio talk show host and his job is such whereby it is compulsory to pontificate all of the sensationalistic nuances of the radio audience feeding into his show he attempts to commiserate with a bunch of societal deviates turned lonely vulnerable obscene phone callers who have the masochistic craving to be publicly vilified barry is effective in coping with this precarious ilk by socially them rather than simply subjugating them to mere new technologies serve a purpose for the dallas radio audience and paramount concepts take a backseat to perversion talk about baseball scores orgasms and people's pets br br the whole thing is a cacophony of drug induced diatribes and a for psychopathic paranoia this high profile cannon fodder is something that barry thrives on the convoluted pathos the deranged proclivities from and of pornography and the overall pop culture afflictions serve as volatile ammunition for barry stilted battleground br br the setting for this movie is perfect in that there is a two thousand foot drop in terms of ideology in the the center of dallas there is an overbearing sense of cosmopolitan awareness whereby 20 miles away resides a significant chapter of the ku klux klan the play is based in denver that is where the actual story takes place other small theater plays depict the cities of louisville atlanta and cleveland dallas is the city where the film takes place i thought it was an excellent choice this movie illustrates how people have a horrid and erroneous and deadly of the jewish people in america whereby they control the banks their agenda is different than everybody else's and their intellectual literature leads to perversion these preconceived notions compound barry overall dilemma barry personal undoing is whereby he is irascible and non responsive to his alcoholism and his abrasive and politically controversial nature is his ultimate undoing this is what makes the film so believable br br the characters in the movie were well portrayed dan the tailor made for middle management hatchet man played by alec baldwin who was constantly monitoring barry every move laura his girlfriend also his producer will constantly feel barry is someone who is always misunderstood ellen his ex wife is a recipient of barry's anguish and selfishness but cannot quite relinquish her feelings for barry regardless of the path of personal destruction he winds up resorting to the dallas radio audience is a melting pot of socially misplaced retro bates who are dementedly amused by their own real shortcomings in part everybody's hang ups including barry own hang ups are what do barry in his audience ogles depravity solicits and ultimately becomes barry pet project for prescribed sinners social culture conflicts become barry downfall br br this movie is superb in my opinion oliver stone's best picture including platoon and natural born killers that statement in of itself tells you how magnificent a film talk radio is the story consulting and acting and co producing of eric bogosian is simply compelling the camera angles the dialogue the haunting character portrayals all top notch the cinematography of the dallas skyline at the end of the movie is terrific dallas has the dubious distinction of being deemed a mega metropolis so now just like los angeles and new york there are crack baby cases too numerous to count low cost housing neighborhoods from hell and budgets cuts that will mean there will be a significant number of people who will be dead by this time next year dallas asserts it's status as a major metropolitan area in the precarious manner by which human debauchery prevails the city has it's lynching radio listeners who have given a pejorative spin to the marvel of nationwide air wave communication these are the culprits in the movie the ghoulish tabloid derelicts who want to meet the big bad wolf and their decadent curiosity has morally obliterated the last neighborhood in america
<START> i really enjoyed this movie it challenged my emotions and beliefs making it a true piece of artwork in my book the acting was unsurpassed i would never watch this movie with anyone i could not cry around i don't think i cry harder to any movies maybe because it makes me look at myself i dunno it is a must see
<START> in watching this off and on for a few seasons two things come to mind one wondering what kind of girl wants to be a model and two run to the nearest ice cream store and have a low fat sundae br br i tried to be a fan because i liked the idea of this reality show competition no other famous model thought of this and it is very admirable for tyra banks to do so but as the series goes on and on i've come to the conclusion that this is a sorry lot of folks trying to make a mountain out of a women shouldn't watch this teens should stay clear of it unless they're doing book reports on the subject br br many women try out for slots to compete for americas next top model they live together cat fight together cry together get put through pointless modeling shoots with pointless modeling people and and get eliminated and almost all of them claim you will see me again heck i'm trying to see what happened to the ones that did win actually br br this is the dream of some girls and good for them in watching this i hope the other girls that see this and run like hades the other way like to college br br i just happened to watch more of this recent season because of the ploy of full figured models joining the group that even made me think more of this as a sorry lot of folks the full figured models were no more than average sized ladies competing with what i think is the thinnest group of models they ever chose so of course that would make them look even fatter a ploy use all the time bad bad tyra and crew br br but to be fair americas next top model is not about full figured models it's about projecting an imagined image a beauty that can be mass marketed and sold as the ultimate in beauty and this show is just looking for the next fresh piece of meat to add to the mix hence the name of the show hence the sorry lot of judges photographers associations hence tyra and her consistent this was me plugs every camera angle you can get but then again that is the one thing i like about this show the ex model giving others who wouldn't have the chance a chance to enter the doors but after that everything else is status quo for that industry which is why there are no surprises or week to week interest in the program
<START> seriously sci fi needs to stop making movies they're all horrible and this one had john rhys davies in it and he couldn't help the movie dr pena giancarlo esposito captures the legendary goat eater of mexico the and brings it aboard a cruise ship captained by captain rudolf john rhys davies the creature then escapes and starts killing crew and passengers captain rudolf and the crew then go after the creature guns but they can't stop it so they call in the navy they can't stop it either then the thing kills all 5 or however many of them there are then the captain and his daughter along with some other guy figure out how to kill it stay away from this movie the looks incredibly cheesy the navy men shoot at the slightest movement throw grenades on the ship and the acting is horrible 3 10

<START> disappointing heist movie indeed i was actually expecting a pretty cool cat and mouse stuff going on through out the movie and it does have few of those cat and mouse stuff going on but it was just pretty stupid and it basically showed all the good scenes in the trailer as a matter of fact if you seen the trailer to this you basically seen the whole film cause it is just that predictable so basically the plot is about a few armored truck company workers that try to steal the 42 million dollars they are suppose to transport until one of the members grows a conscience i thought the movie would be better with it's cast of well known actors but i was wrong i mean this isn't necessarily a bad film but it just wasn't that good either or has any depth this is most definitely a rental at best just not really worth seeing it in theaters heist br br 4 8 10
