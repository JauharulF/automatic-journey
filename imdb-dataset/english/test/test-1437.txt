<START> not a bad movie but could have been done without the full frontal nudity of a 10 year old boy in one of the opening scenes this movie has excellent dialog which is certainly common among foreign films foreign actors still know how to act as opposed to american actors who let the cgi stunts and special effects do all the work for them this film is just good old fashion acting gerarde did an excellent job as always the costumes and scenery are accurate with the time my only complaint is that they should have dubbed the english words over the french instead of using subtitles this could just be because i hate reading subtitles
<START> i came out of dark blue world feeling sigh 'so yet it was definitely a film needed to be made and it's truly well done from czech republic it's entertaining in spite of the 'sad' premise it is full of feelings the bonding and undeniably true friendship between the two lead characters one mature lieutenant pilot ondrej as and the young ever so eager budding pilot as karel the inevitable love triangle and the now and then reminders of the grim prison situations in czechoslovakia in the '50s it's all in one film put together by the father screenwriter and son director team zdenek and jan previous achievement being the lovable kolya br br it's not as long as east west french est 1999 which was heart wrenching multi layered story about a returning russian doctor and french wife's ill fates after wwii in russia the plot of tmavomodrÃ½ svet title in czech is quite straightforward and has sprinkles of light humor music songs of wwii england sung in czech modest special effects of pilots and air crafts in the sky not elaborate like hollywood there's no need to be bing bang boom all the time when showing air battle scenes the sadness was explained up front in the beginning two paragraphs in english and wrap up with follow up paragraphs the film is not totally subtitled only when translating the czech conversations the rest are in english be it very british or in czech accents so it's a foreign film with english language and includes british actors br br the three lead performances especially of the two czech pilots were wonderfully delivered there are nuances between the two of them even though it's the steadily mature vs the eagerly young i always appreciate tara fitzgerald yes there's brassed off 1996 opposite ewan mcgregor and pete postlethwaite remembered her from hear my song 1991 opposite adrian dunbar and ned beatty opposite hugh grant in sirens 1994 and the englishman who went up a hill and came down a mountain 1995 besides her appearances in pbs masterpiece theatre mini series br br 'so the fact that heroes defending one's country can be so ill treated and for so long 40 years thank goodness for worthwhile memories and the imprints of friendship unforgettable hence the pause for a ray of sunshine through a stain glass window ironic or coincidental that it's of a church where the hard labor took place symbolic of hope never give br br other recent films that have stories needed to be told with as the canadian from afghanistan taking a journey to with a personal in mind more than meets the eye behind a by iranian director makhmalbaf everything put together with radha mitchell as a new mother facing sid sudden infant death insightful film by swiss director marc forster and his much talked about controversial film monster's ball i've yet to catch with halle berry billy bob thornton and peter boyle see the films without prior expectations or comparisons to films before just see it
<START> i spent three months living in the east end of london in the latter half of 1987 when the show had been on the air for almost two years it was considered a running joke there br br why because it had an all white cast every cast member and extra in the first couple of years was white br br the street where i lived was a long one with over 800 houses and to the best of my knowledge i was one of only three or four white faces living on that street we were on the corner of the indian and turkish quarters and even if you excluded those two races the asians and afro caribbeans outnumbered the white people twenty to one plus of course of the very few white people who did live in the area the vast majority were scots like me a cockney accent was never heard br br that wasn't a racist rant just a simple statement of fact the bbc either couldn't be bothered crossing london to do their research before writing this soap or else they only had white actors available and decided to bluff it out br br either way as i say in the east end of the time we considered it a comedy show
<START> there's a spartan unsentimental edge to this film that allows plenty of room for us to participate in the action without any stylistic telling us how we're meant to be feeling in everything was overtly sad sure powerful as hell but still in 'white' it was delightful whimsy but there are no such emotional clues or cues for that matter in this one it's as if he finally let the force of the tale work its own magic without razzle dazzle i think that's what makes it the most initially enigmatic of the three but finally the most transcendent and redemptive never has remorseless honesty been quite so beautiful
<START> tipping the velvet has just three weeks ago been released in the uk and already i watch as countless letters flood to the national papers and tv guides claiming that it possesses a thin plot weak performances and an even weaker script br br you find me incensed this is heresy br br i would really like to dispel all doubt by first congratulating andrew davies on enabling geoffrey sax to create this wonderful dramatization of sarah waters' novel by him with such a fantastic script kudos but i fear i must now change tack br br i saw one of the premiere tv guides here in the uk which shall remain nameless relentlessly describing tipping the velvet as a lesbian love story if they are and i assume they are trying to promote interest in the film then this is completely the wrong way to go about it aside from the phrase being a disappointingly inaccurate description by saying such a thing they are either a turning away those who would instinctively be repelled by that subject matter or b attracting a class of people who will only watch to see some serious girl on girl action buy a video through this display of serious this and other magazines are what is a brilliant adaptation of one of recent literature's greatest works tipping the velvet is a story of love of passion of moving on of loss and of heartbreak it's not a lesbian love story no br br the end result is a stylish affair with excellent performances all round particularly from stirling hawes chancellor and may direction wise it's intoxicating and immersive sometimes fast paced sometimes not but it never ceases to be anything less than compelling as a whole it's polished and well delivered the sex is undertaken with tenderness and delicacy and although many will not class it as a real film it will remain among my favourites for some time to come
<START> this is a film that has garnered any interest or praise it has received simply on the merit of being a lesbian interest piece the performances are mostly emotionless compared to better films in the interest genre the entirety of the film's watchable value is garnered through modest suspense over whether and when the partners' family members will say something discouraging about their lesbian relationship the best element of the film is likely the beautiful new england scenery although much of the film is set inside it is hard to envision how any viewer watching this film and not seeking affirmation of their lifestyle or wishing to see that of others affirmed even through poorly realized drama could appreciate treading water in any significant way it is a terrible movie
<START> this game was one of the main reasons i actually got a ps2 i remember playing soul edge sometimes called soul blade back in the day and i was hooked on it br br i did play the original soul calibur but i never got a chance to play it for a huge amount of time i did however buy the gamecube version of soul calibur ii and that was what truly got me hooked on the series and i was ecstatic when i heard of soul calibur iii this game still gives us the classic characters such as nightmare and however it also adds several new characters such as tira and the unplayable night terror the true boss of tales of souls the strategy based chronicles of sword mode is a new feature which i really like it can be quite challenging in the later chronicles but it's a good addition to the series br br the soul arena mode has several missions in which you must fight a certain enemy under certain circumstances the exception is final battle in which you simply must defeat night terror it's another fine touch that makes the game all the more fun br br in some scenes in tales of should you will be made to press certain buttons in order to get a different result this can be in order to dodge block an attack or to get a better ending every character has two endings all in all this is an excellent game and i'd recommend it if you're a fan of fighting games
<START> a female friend invited me to see this in the theaters br br after half an hour we walked out and went into the next multiplex yeah we broke the rules in time to catch the beginning of against all odds br br i remember too many apes dancing around saying very little about the characters or introduction to the story captured either one of us or was even memorable it just dragged to the point of being painfully boring and believe me any excuse was good enough to spend time with this particular friend br br the production values were excellent good photography and lighting but this was a major studio release and we came to see a movie not an art gallery it seemed like ralph richardson and andie mcdowell were going to be wasted in such a poorly written film br br perhaps if you make into the second hour there is something worth seeing i do not have so much patience with my time 4 out of 10
<START> first and foremost i wish to aim a big mean middle finger towards the troma dvd distribution crew who were actually stupid enough to reveal the identity of this movie's pivot killer on the back of the cover the synopsis just randomly mentions who's the person responsible for the massacre on graduation day for christ's sake i don't care how terrible or how predictable an 80's slasher can be just mentioning who did it ruins the whole point so a word of advise in case you also purchase the troma double feature containing graduation day and barbarian in dinosaur hell do not Â repeat do not Â turn the box around and read the back watching the film is already a painful experience but reading the back would really spoil everything br br now as for the actual the actual movieÂ oh boy personally i'm a fan of the cinematic 'work' of herb freed well actually i don't really know whether i should admire pity him all films are pretty bad amateurish but at the same time you can tell his direction is spirited and full of good intentions unlike with haunts and beyond evil he followed a contemporary popular genre trend and tried to cash in on the typical high school slasher films just to offer a minimum of originality all the victims in graduation day are promising athletes and members of the same track of coach george michaels awesome name i guess herb freed is a fan of wham during the opening credits we witness how a young girl dramatically dies on the field moments after winning a 30 seconds running race the debate of whether or not her coach and fellow track team members weren't pushing her physical limits too much is raised but one particular individual goes one step further and begins to sadistically kill everyone he she considers responsible for laura's death what a demented little movie the script must be one of the most incoherent ones i ever with loads of red herrings and sub plots that go absolutely nowhere and death sequences that are almost too cheesy for words there's a bloke impaled by a football attached to a javelin others are decapitated with an absurdly big sword and the unluckiest bastard of them all even falls to his death on a disguised bed of spikes herb concentrates on the the fast pacing of the killings so much that he totally forgets about the sub plots he introduced earlier in the film for example laura's sister returns home from her military training and seemly starts an investigation regarding the circumstances of her death halfway through the movie however her character hardly appears in the movie anymore also the girls' stepfather is referred to as a violent drunkard but this interesting given immediately gets ignored as well instead of carefully mounted suspense and misleading red herrings we're served disco dancing roller skating sequences and Â of course Â numerous images of unattractive 80's chicks stripping their tops off despite being really bad graduation day could count on a respectable cast christopher george grizzly city of the living dead greatly stars as the demanding coach carmen argenziano when a stranger calls the accused briefly appears as a police detective investigating the rising number of missing teenagers and michael pataki dead buried dracula's dog has a very amusing part as the school's stressed out principal the teenage beauties on duty include linnea quigley and white heck for some horror fans the presence of these two ladies is enough reason already to count graduation day among the most quintessential slashers of the early 80's it's a dumb film but entertainment and chuckles are guaranteed
<START> the gilmore girls is about a mother who had a daughter when she was 16 now the daughter is 16 in season 1 and they live like sisters sharing everything trusting each other completely br br i like the gilmore girls but i am not sure why the mother named lauren graham and the daughter named rory short for played by alexis are both very beautiful women they are both funny and they are charming in their own ways there are some funny supporting characters such as luke scott patterson he and like each may be even love each other but neither of them really acts on it they have their little moments there are some other supporting characters most of them very funny and with their won touching moments br br what i like the most i think is to see the relationship between the young mother and the daughter who is becoming an adult the dialogue between them is quick sharp funny and sometimes touching as well the band they have is beautiful the gilmore girls makes you feel good so try it
<START> being a self confessed slasher addict means that it's very rare that i get the chance to review many bigger budgeted movies with creditable casts aside from james successful box office draw identity there have not been any big name entries since the scream trilogy once again put wes craven's name back on the hollywood map that's why mark malone's the last stop Â a mystery thriller with blatant slasher overtones instantly intrigued me with a decent line up including adam beach and jurgen prochnow and an intriguing soundtrack that even finds space for lynn anderson's rose garden i must admit that the initial signs were very positive for this claustrophobic feature to the best of my knowledge there have only ever been three other snow bound slashers unless of course you consider demon possessed to fit in the category the first slice and dice on the ice was the bone dry satan's blade then came the lisa loring cheese feast that was blizzard of blood and the enjoyable shredder followed some fourteen years later br br during an extreme blizzard state trooper jason adam beach battles through the snow to reach a remote lodge in the colorado mountains his task is to inform the guests that the road is closed and they must stay for at least one more night until a path can be cleared through the hazardous conditions this news doesn't go down to well with the suspicious bunch which includes two troublemaking brothers callum keith rennie and peter flemming a truck driver that really doesn't want to hang around william s taylor a randy couple of lovers winston and amy adamson and jason's ex girlfriend nancy rose the motel owners jurgen prochnow and p lynn johnson aren't overjoyed by the news either but they offer rooms to the stranded guests and attempt to calm the tense situation things take a turn for the worse when jason finds a mutilated body and a bag full of stolen cash lying in the snow behind the cafe just like a chapter out of an agatha christie mystery the lodgers begin dieing at the hands of a masked assailant that seems intent to re claim the money with so many dodgy characters to choose from and no way of leaving the crime scene jason has to attempt to stop the maniac before he kills againÂ br br a good mystery needs at least a handful of shady suspects who each have a credible motive a remote location that no one can escape from and a smart protagonist to help unravel the clues fortunately the last stop provides each of those essential ingredients in a thriller that has its equal moments of brilliance and downright stupidity the film kicks off superbly as the dubious personalities clash in a claustrophobic environment that manages to keep the tension running high throughout the runtime malone keeps the interest levels raised as each character unveils their own reasons to attract some of the suspicion and to be fair the essential twist isn't one that you'll guess easily in fact i found myself watching the movie through once again to see if i could pick up on any hints that i missed first time around unfortunately when the maniac is revealed to be an over the top psycho that wisecracks like a comic book bad guy the last stop a huge amount of credibility thankfully all is not lost when an unexpected and brilliantly orchestrated plot twist salvages the film's finale br br similarities can be drawn with the excellent identity as the two plots are almost interchangeable james effort has to be the better of the two mainly because of the star billing of john cusack and the ever reliable ray liotta with that said though adam beach does a good enough job in the lead while jurgen prochnow amy adamson and the brilliant callum keith rennie add some credible support rose acts as in this role as she probably does from day to day in reality and winston started fantastically before going completely overboard with the film's climax if you're a die hard slasher fan that's watching this for some bloody killings then you're going to be disappointed the balaclava wearing psychopath only pops up once and the rest of the murders are committed off screen but as i said earlier malone's directorial talent means that the suspense is never too far off the boil and you can forgive the few flaws because the positives just about triumph br br the last stop is well worth a look for slasher addicts and movie fans alike yes there are a handful of negatives but overall this is a solid example of emerging hollywood talents if you liked identity then certainly give this a
<START> i saw this movie for the first time on a sick day from school about ten years ago compared to the made for lifetime movies i usually watched it became an instant though obscure favorite br br i've seen it maybe twice since then i think some parts are little cheesy maybe the plot could use some more action br br nevertheless it captures the fantasies and realities of children with uniqueness and warmth the magical realism is on par with that of amelie and the heart with that of the wonder years despite the particular development of my tastes i still find the subtle magic of this film the lovable characters and its simplicity enchanting
<START> time travel is theoretical so i can give the script some leeway br br i also understand the concept that by changing just one variable you can potentially change the way history unfolded br br what i cannot understand however is the way the change in time unfolded we are subjected to a series of which progressively retrograde planetary evolution while this is a convenient plot device as it allows our heroes enough time to resolve the problem it makes no sense whatsoever surely if you change a variable and that variable has significantly or even completely altered planetary evolution then by the time you come back to the future the evolutionary process has already been established and there would be no need for waves after all why would a change that happened 65 million years ago need to wait until now to be effective the fact that the moth was projected forward in time may give it some credibility but the life of that moth 65 million years ago was significantly altered ergo any change to evolutionary history would have begun then and not be dependent upon a return to our current time br br to solve the problem the team goes back in time to prevent the change in variable from ever happening by doing this successfully we see that the changes to evolution never happened and that no one even remembers the events surely what works for the solution should work for the original change i like a good rollicking sci fi adventure but unless it is set in a galaxy far far away it needs to have at least some grounding in theoretical possibility to make it truly entertaining br br good premise bad plot reasonable acting and in all fairness just a twist on jurassic park br br not on my watch again list
<START> this is a pretty good made for tv flick of the 'what if' variety as in what if terrorists exploded a 'dirty in a big city in this case london lots of poking at folks that say 'we're all set in the event of an that then reveal that they're not exactly telling the full story and is anyone prepared for something like this you can bet not this shows the material for the bombs being smuggled into the country the making of the bombs the secrecy and double lives that the people behind it lead etc it also shows public servants i e firemen giving their all to save people when they aren't getting any help when the government doesn't want to send anyone else into the affected area also shows how woefully inadequate are for any such occurrence as the government talks everything up but then stands there with their mouths hanging open as the tragedy unfolds and could this happen right here in the good old usa well unless you've been living in caves for the past 20 years something already has to an extent and don't bet that anyone would be prepared for something of this nature this is fairly realistic and yes even scary well worth seeing but just hope nothing like this ever really happens 8 out of 10
<START> after seeing purely belter i came onto this site to review it but not only that i also had to check out the resume of the screenwriter director mark herman as soon as his name appeared on the opening credits i knew that i had seen his name before somewhere and after checking i found out he wrote and directed the film version of little voice one of the most underrated feelgood british movies of the 1990s br br purely belter is an entirely different kettle of fish it's a grim stereotypical view of geordie life and a very unfunny one at that everyone is either a wife beater a single mother a shoplifter a drunk or a junkie since many scenes are set in a school the pe teacher is a sadistic bully and that's the closest the film ever gets to reality oh and everyone is very foul mouthed which adds to the grim unlikable atmosphere br br i didn't like purely belter much while i watched and now that i know who mark herman is i like it even less with little voice herman proved you can make an amusing uplifting comedy featuring northern souls but i had to ask where his undoubted talent went in this movie
