<START> like many western pennsylvania history buffs i had been really looking forward to this much heralded pbs program that was produced by however i must say now that i was somewhat disappointed on the positive side i believe that overall this film did a fair job of explaining the main issues and describing the events of the so called french and indian war in particular its presentation of the point of view was somewhat new and quite interesting although it certainly was at time over emphasized also on the positive side the blend of narrative and action scenes was well done and came across somewhat better than many of these typical documentaries made up of experts interviews and picture stills a la ken burns on the negative side many of the battles did have a somewhat staged look and many important aspects of the war were overlooked most of all i was very disappointed and frustrated by how little importance was given to forbes's successful campaign of against fort duquesne as compared to the earlier failures of by washington and by braddock in particular i was somewhat incredulous that there was no mention of colonel henry bouquet the swiss mercenary in the british service who was most responsible for success finally i could not believe the complete omission of the battle of bushy run that started as a re run of defeat but ended up as the victory that decided the outcome of war thanks to the wiles of the same colonel bouquet who certainly must rank as one of the most successful british commanders of this war
<START> for a long time this was my favorite of the batman films it had the best cinematography and an edgy feel to it with two wild characters catwomen and the penguin along with the always interesting christopher walken however after the last viewing it finally slipped in my ratings and frankly i now prefer the last batman batman begins with christian bale br br the good nonetheless this is still the most intriguing of the five latter day batman films the stylish cinematography in here is the best of any of the batman movies director tim burton is known for his films which feature stunning visuals as this is a great example the three characters listed above are all very different and very interesting almost fascinating of the villains i preferred catwomen finding her the most fun to watch before and after she changed violence is not overdone here as it was in several of the other batman stories but one is never bored watching this as he did in the first film michael keaton does a fine job playing batman bruce wayne br br the bad for a movie based on a comic strip that mostly kids read i still think these first two batman movies both done by burton were too dark and the profanity was definitely not appropriate although unlike the first movie there was no usage of the lord's name in vain in here there still was profanity and both villains made too many sexual remarks that would have been okay if they hadn't marketed this film for kids as well as adults danny devito's penguin is downright gross in spots grotesque i can handle but who wants gross few guys meanwhile complained about the beautiful michelle pfeiffer playing catwoman too much darkness and some cheap shots on christian bashing also made me re consider my previously high rating of this film br br overall fabulous visuals and memorable characters make this the most interesting in the batman series but too dark an edge too gross and too much anti religious bias all finally turned me off after a half dozen looks at this film sorry but i prefer a kinder gentler batman movie after all it's just a cartoon most will disagree but i was glad to see the series lighten up after this one
<START> somehow this documentary about miles manages to include very little music and no complete tunes though miles appears in the film 95 of the interviews are other folks not miles there are huge chronological gaps many aspects of his life his childhood prodigy his drug addiction are skipped or glossed over and you'll learn little about what made the man and his contribution to music so groundbreaking skip it
<START> i love a film that mixes edge of the seat suspense laughs style good acting and a bit of self parody hitchcock consistently carried this off and in le rouge jean pierre melville does the same i was sorry when this long film ended br br i agree with the english commenter who found remarks by one of my compatriots chauvinistic i love french films italian films english films indian films and the increasingly rare good american films i also feel the writer who panned the film for being not even a good copy of an american gangster film missed the point completely but i guess it's like jazz either you get it or you don't so why waste time trying to explain br br just see le noir and be prepared to be deliciously entertained
<START> given the subject matter of drug addiction down to the bone almost can't help but be a rather depressing film but depressing doesn't necessarily have to mean bad unfortunately in this case it is in fact pretty bad the film has some good things going for it most notably the quality performance of vera farmiga in the central role of irene a working mom struggling with a cocaine addiction but there isn't enough good here to outweigh the bad the film's failings lie mainly with the story which fails to captivate and never really seems to get going irene goes to rehab and comes home to a clueless husband who has no idea how to support her attempt to kick her habit irene grows close to another recovering addict a male nurse from her rehab center complications ensue but the story never really sparks to life it doesn't seem as if the movie is really going anywhere you can say it's a stark realistic look at the day to day struggles of an addict maybe so but in this case it doesn't make for an interesting movie the whole thing has a very blah feel to it the minimalist cinematography doesn't help matters adding another layer of drab to the incredibly drab proceedings and none of the other performances measure up to hugh dillon is ok as male nurse friend but nobody else in the cast adds anything of value to the proceedings all in all this movie is a bleak depressing and rather dull ride
<START> well i tend to watch films for one of three reasons unfortunately there are no transformers in this film so i can recommend it only on comedy value and pretty women read girls br br yes it is funny i know this due to the number of people in the cinema who were laughing on a regular basis throughout personally though i loved it for laura fraser who imho is fit
<START> this film is a load of crap it's quite disturbing to see that anyone is able to say that this is one of the best films of the year what can i say bad acting bad action scenes which becomes really comical in the end pardon me if this was a comedy then i didn't understand it if it was i regret laughing of the tent scenes do yourself a favor go to bed instead of watching this good night
<START> the tv announcer who introduced this late one saturday night said it should have won oscars quite a statement for a film i'd never heard of though why i should have taken any notice of a tv announcer i don't know in the event said announcer was talking tripe br br it's a dreary miserable movie that leaves a bad taste in the mouth i couldn't get on with awful burr ming gum accent can't see any advantage in it being set in the anyway br br unresolved threads abound and i wouldn't normally mind this but half of them make no sense and what about when says he'll pick up from outside her b b although she never told him where exactly she was staying or her buying into the funeral that clearly never took place and where was she during those days and ill thought through bits of business if you ask me br br it's a thriller without thrills it's full of pretentious bits of business it's depressing br br didn't like it thought it was rubbish wouldn't recommend it 'nuff said
<START> completely overlooking the whole movie adaptation of a video game this is another terrible movie by mr boll how he continues to be hired to make movies is a constant surprise to me and obviously most of the movie going community br br as a whole i will say that this attempt was fractionally better than so many of his previous attempts some of the dialog was even half way decent in far cry though he still some phrases and in some cases he doesn't even use the phrases correctly br br now besides the fact that jack carver is supposed to be american and not german til was still entertaining in this role one exception is the laughably lame lines he uses to get in bed with the girl and we are supposed to believe that she is ready to have sex with him so casually after such minimal dialog emile simply there for comic relief i am sure and still lame jack's character looks old and tired yet is still capable of the extreme acrobatics needed to avoid one of the altered super soldiers in the lab br br don't watch this one for the far cry adaptation but you might just waste an hour and a half watching it if you have nothing better to do
<START> although i brought this film by accident i thought it was the original halloween stupid eh i was surprised by how good it was many sequels just continue the events of the previous films this however tried and succeeded in explaining the events of the prequels why does michael myers kill people and how come he seems to have supernatural abilities i thought this was a top horror film full of action suspense and surprises i'm very glad i brought it i've given it 9 out of 10
<START> it's become extremely difficult to find a good horror movie anymore thought this movie was a good thriller br br could have had better production values but what kept me going was the suspense and the twists i had real reservations before seeing this movie because of the cover i was afraid that it would be excessively bloody and gory i was wrong br br although there is a lot of scary parts there is a lot of suspense and drama too br br the acting in dead line was better than what you would expect from a micro budget horror flick the characters were believable br br the movie is really thrilling and quite scary at moments so it makes you grab your seat until the ending credits roll br br because of its production values the sound is not very good for example 8 10
<START> quintet is definitely not a film most people would find amusing or even interesting for that matter there is no scene dialog acting or plot development that would light a spark the icy world is one thing but muddled plot is something you really can't bear the characters are not only three dimensional they're not even one dimensional there is no emotion and there is no sense in anything that goes on there is a world encased in ice where nobody is doing any meaningful work except playing quintet and the rules to the game are never even hinted the homes are not heated even there is electricity but who and what produces it there is wood but there are no animals except dogs so where do clothes come from or shoes for that matter since apparently there is no industry and everybody is dressed as in 16th century europe which is in odd contrast to not so futuristic backdrop the entire movie seams to be stuck inside altman's imagination and he never bothered to share his ideas or his vision with audience desolation or hopelessness have nothing to do with lack of appeal to this movie the world of george lucas's thx1138 is no brighter place and characters are no more fun but the story has it's path in quintet there is no obvious or even hinted path and in my opinion it doesn't even provoke thinking about the idea behind it all as for example similar film john boorman's zardoz it's not even done in altman's unique style so it doesn't appeal to his fans either and i'm one of them all in all robert altman had a dream and he woke up without telling anybody what it meant not even to him
<START> tom jerry are visiting africa and disguise themselves in an amos n andy fashion they even act and talk differently with the standard degrading usage of extremely poor grammar associated with the stereotypical image of blacks portrayed in many cartoons of the era aside from the offensive images this cartoon just isn't very good why were they going to africa in the first place apparently just to provide the audience with another amos n andy and the additionally overused cannibalistic portrayal of native africans the only reason this got a 2 instead of a 1 was there is a decent few seconds involving an octopus br br worth one view which will still leave you shaking your head wondering how ignorance could prevail br br note i consider some cartoons containing such racially stereotypical images very good it all depends on if there is good content surrounding the cartoon or if the only reason for the existence of the cartoon is to make fun of those incorrectly portrayed in other words if you get rid of mammy shuffling feet the poor grammar and black face with giant lips images is there anything left in the case of plane dumb there is not
<START> it is such a shame that so many people love family guy because it is easily one of the worst shows on tv there are many points to address here br br the flashbacks now in season 1 and 2 which i think was exceptional the flashbacks were quite frequent and actually somewhat tied into what the plot was about and was even funny now season 4 and on the flashback s are even more occurring and has nothing to do with the plot aren't funny and really long boring and meaningless family guy thinks that long drag scene which go nowhere are funny when really it is poor writing br br wow a baby that sounds british how funny can that be it's not his character is so unstable it's unbelievable remember in the early season's when was all about world domination and killing lois well now he just has scene's that are awkwardly gay with brian from wanting world domination to being gay bad writing br br references how do they manage to keep making poor references to 80's tv shows or events well they just re use the same old garbage you know in 20 years hopefully family guy will be canceled by then if they are still doing jokes about shows from the 80's it will be even more irrelevant than it was before because will have forgotten this still keeps me wondering why they can't just writ good episodes with quality jokes br br voice acting my god the voices in this show is so poor seth should just focus on his crappy episode writing and stop doing voices all the extras in the already bad family guy episodes all sound the same the simpsons get 6 or 7 people to do all the voices a few of them are voicing about 15 20 characters all sounding very different but why can't family guy do that oh right it's a crappy show br br the stuttering usually done by peter brian and any extras whenever they talk or are offended by something they have to stutter out their just to try get a cheap laugh i can't believe that family guy can't even speak normally to get people to laugh at their jokes br br offensiveness ok short and simple family guy tries to break the barrier and be cutting edge but really they fall flat every time go watch south park br br terrible plots the plots and story lines are just utter trash the simpsons have started their 20th seasons are still have better plots than family guy about a total of 8 or 9 minutes is flashbacks and drag scenes which have no relevance br br popularity lots of little kids have shirts and think hes so funny when really they don't even get the terribly written sex jokes they just say oh ha ha when they don't even get it family guy has gotten canceled twice and brought back by dvd sales how sad is that they got canceled the first time i think after the 2nd or 3rd season and i honestly believe that shoulda been it those episodes back then were superb they shoulda left on a high note br br drag scenes and falling there are scenes that go on way too long one that just aired this last sunday peter went to an executive bathroom in which about 2 minutes was spent imitating the intro to jurassic park and the plot of that episode is stolen from a seinfeld episode as well also a scene when chris is working at a store and hes talking with the employee for about 5 minutes about a movie which also features the stuttering the chicken fights are so stupid 3 of them each one longer then the last useless unfunny writing thinking that people enjoy long scenes of rerun fighting between a chicken yeah a chicken now every time someone falls down and by the way no family guy fan can deny this that every time they fall down its under a split second and they always land with their arm over their back to make them look funny i guess its been used at least 30 times br br herman oh jeez everyone thinks the old pedophile is so funny when its just a really bad running gag they've even gone to lengths of giving him singing scenes which are very poor and basing entire episodes around him they've done the same thing with other characters like the doctor who i know has had an episode based around him br br the simpsons well not much explanation needed here there is so much evidence of family guy stealing simpson's jokes how family guy is just a poor mans simpsons br br so im sure i've forgotten some key points somewhere but im sure this is enough to prove that family guy is really a terrible horribly written tv show that everyone seems to love when really they should go watch simpson's seinfeld and frasier
<START> the writers of lost have outdone themselves season two's finale is even more heartbreaking and intense than the finale for season one locke's lack of faith has not only resulted in spiritual consequences for himself but in tragic physical consequences for the lives of the other castaways michael's betrayal resulted in a success for him but can he possibly escape the island he will have to if he wants to stay alive i don't doubt that one or more of his former friends would be willing to kill him in revenge this finale has left more questions than the previous finale and i can't wait for fall br br a side note what is the point in posting a review just to write out all the spoilers where is the pleasure in ruining the surprise for everyone else the current review on this page is nothing but a big fat spoiler fest poorly constructed in barely readable english with the express purpose of making someone mad good job
