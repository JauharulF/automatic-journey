<START> the war in the east as the germans referred to the ww2 soviet nazi conflict was a war of annihilation on the part of the germany 90 of the german army were in the soviet union fighting their ultimate aim was to wipe out the so called sub human russian population and colonize the mainly empty country with german settlers after they had won br br read hitler's willing executioners br br here we have the german army presented as innocent victims and not as nazi mass murderers when are modern german film makers going to be honest and face up to the past br br better see the russian film come and see instead
<START> being stuck in bed with the flu and feeling too rough to get up to find the remote i actually watched this abomination from start to finish how many people can say that and for any who can what's your excuse my god has there ever ever been such a total mess released by a major studio there is not one second of genuine tension in a supposed thriller the script is inept and ludicrous the sets look like they were leftovers from a low budget tv movie and the cast what were they thinking sally field gives what is without doubt the worst and most embarrassing performance of any academy award winner in history her irritating nasal whine and stupidly perky behaviour in what is meant to be a life threatening situation are truly asinine it's a wonder she didn't use all her future earnings to buy up and destroy every print of this turkey michael caine who now pontificates endlessly on the art of screen acting even running master classes for would be thespians should be taken out and shot preferably by one of telly henchmen angela cartwright an actress i usually like and whose name isn't even in the opening credits poor soul is ten years too old for her role and her horrible matronly yellow prom dress must haunt her nightmares to this day slumming it are karl malden and shirley knight hopefully they collected a big pay packet to assuage their involvement the whole film is a series of bad scenes but one that especially sticks in my mind is the explosion which results in the ceiling if an upside down ship's deck can be termed as such collapsing and a load of empty cardboard boxes falling through ooh how scary really really terrible
<START> now this is the sort of film we used to get weekly now a days it is rare to see a drama that depends on the cast talking to each other br br there are no explosions car chases or any chases there are implied sexual situations this is not film for the younger crowd it is for those that appreciate people talking to each other they do argue a lot as we have married couple having mid life problems br br emily watson tom wilkinson are seemingly a very happy middle aged loving man wife now living in this same small london suburb handsome rupert everett returns home to visit his wealthy father br br he of course meets emily watson it would be easy for anyone to be smitten by emily i say no more except that as the credits begin there is a fatal accident the rest of the film is about the repercussions of this accident all the lies the various characters tell br br the acting by this trio the others is excellent br br julien fellows wrote the screenplay based on a novel by nigel he also directed this was his first directorial attempt he did very well the entire production is first rate br br the film had a few month theatrical run in late 2005 is under 80 theatres this to me is a shame stupid comedies open on at least 2000 screens but real good as this many others open in only a few br br by the way there are some very funny lines regarding certain situations br br ratings 1 2 out of 4 95 points out of 100 imdb 9 out of 10
<START> from the first to the last scene this film is made very realistically even too realistically that sometimes we can't see details in night scenes it's dark as real night in the desert sunshine is so strong as in real desert br br script and actor's play are also very realistic shots and episodes are edited not to show things and events effectively to explain them or as many hollywood films do to entertain viewers editing here is to represent the events as if they really happened in afganistan camera is set sometimes far from dying solders even the moment when the main character major is shot and killed br br such method reminds me of masterpieces of italian neo realism and the construction of the story here is based on the same principles as or the bicycle thief chronological series of true to life episodes and a few pathetic moments which at first seem to be sudden and illogical but have inner reasons br br i think the inner reason of major suicidal death is religious emotion repentance for innocent people's death not only his accidental killing of family in the village but also death of solders under his command he is not depicted as a eager believer on the contrary he is depicted as tactful and responsible officer exactly for this reason his last decisions to go back to the destroyed village and to turn his back to an armed boy whose family he killed seem an act of repentance br br the russian orthodox choral which sounds at the end evening sacrifice is another context by which all the film can be seen from this point of view
<START> first of all mexican werewolf in texas is not a werewolf movie this title is bullcrap the story is actually about a that kills all the local villagers in the little town of furlough in texas i suppose the distributors renamed the original title so that it would make some extra bucks or something and i guess it actually works because that's the reason why i bought this piece of crap it sounded so stupid anyway the movie isn't any good actually it's bloody awful but i didn't expect anything else when i bought it it's a low budget horror movie with a monster if you enjoy low budget horror with bad dialog actors and some gore then you should check into this movie but i must warn you this movie is really br br this movie has some of the worst acting i have ever seen the actors try to hard and t it gets completely ridiculous they almost never say a line in a normal way they always have this completely wrong tone about just everything they say it's so stupid it almost looks like a freakin parody it's like they shot each scene only one single time and were happy about it the worst of them all is the blond girl which is supposed to play a bimbo she's the worst of them all i have never seen an actor as bad as her and i've seen even when her boyfriend dies she can't stop being a bimbo about it i hate her br br some of the shots in this movie were actually quite good the ones that where shot in the daytime are all pretty decent for a low budget project but most of the movie is shot in the night when the strikes and the lighting is way too dark the gore scenes are few and short but really grizzly and violent the effects are pretty hilarious really but that's the way i like it the looks pretty messed up and it's easy to see that it's a guy in suit br br overall this movie should only be watched by extreme fans of low budget flicks and it's very important to not watch this alone because you will probably be bored to death i recommend watching this flick with your friends and some beer
<START> a young man who never knew his birth parents receives an old farm in an isolated section of west virginia upon the death of his natural father he visits his property with a cross section of potential victims including the comic relief black guy and a trendy lesbian couple hmm will there be skinny dipping take a guess unfortunately the party comes to an end when the spirits of drifters killed by his evil great grandfather and used as scarecrows come back for revenge this film starts out well an artful montage of depression era photographs and phony newspapers set against a speech by fdr this i believe is his first appearance in a killer scarecrow movie establishes the mood i developed some hopes for the film which were partially realized the story was serviceable enough the setting was sufficiently bucolic the photography was mostly in focus the acting while no great shakes was slightly above par for horror movies in this budget range the film might've actually worked within the narrow demands of the genre if the scarecrows were scary but they weren't they looked cheap they weren't frightening at all the better the monster the better the movie these scarecrows wouldn't scare dorothy let alone toto
<START> this is an excellent james bond movie although it is not part of the original and more famous series and it is a standalone film it is very well done enticing sean connery to return to the role he made famous was a stroke of genius as was titling the movie in a way that references his past vow to not play bond again connery was as great as he was in his earlier 007 appearances the script is outstanding as are the photography and the performances it's the earliest movie i recall with kim basinger who became much more famous after this film barbara carrera was excellent and klaus maria brandauer was absolutely perfect as the main villain the frequent references to the aging of bond and the changing times and attitudes of the british secret service were most humorous the 007 gadgets equaled those of the other bond films the only thing missing was the famous 007 music theme which of course could not be used by this competing production it was rather amazing to me to be able to see two excellent james bond movies released in the same year this one and octopussy with roger moore an interesting aspect of the film is an emphasis on video games and computer graphics the early 80's were the first heyday of such things and the use of them in this film made it a very contemporary movie the film is actually a different version of thunderball updated with newer technology regardless of the repeated theme there are sufficient differences to make it most entertaining i will watch this one frequently
<START> okay she's on the boat with this guy realizes he's out to kill her knocks him out and then finds the reason he's out to off her is this disk that got her coworker killed so what would any rational person do maybe him over the head again to make sure he's really out tie him up look sandra honey you've got the chance to escape while the guy is out for only so long until you know how long it will take you take you to escape make sure he's not able to come after you i hate these stupid female victim roles the rest of the movie was just a series of twists and turns that were completely convoluted and too unbelievable to remain interesting
<START> this movie is really bad trying to create scientific explanations for zombies always ends up taking away credibility from the history of the movie there are so many things i could point about the movie that i could almost write a book on how much the movie sucks for instance there were like 50 people on the plane they killed like 100 and they kept coming apparently the virus gives complications because everybody had yellow eyes also the virus makes people roar like lions or something and the virus not only tissue as it also gives superhuman strength not to mention that this virus messes up peoples hair it's also important to notice that if you shoot someone with a pistol probably only happens on planes that person is kicked back in the air remember that if you are escorting a prisoner on a plane and you loose him always look inside the drawers and cabinets the size of a bottle you never know where those bastards are going to hide and if by any chance you can land a plane full of zombies against a mountain and survive happens all the time after watching dozens of people being killed just walk away from the plane watching the sunrise and making jokes about dating the flight attendant
<START> it's nice that these three young directors have produced films with good productions values and decent acting there's some good work here br br unfortunately they suffer from what much of modern gay cinema recycled plots too familiar devices i have seen the pool setting way too many times in gay male films and hackneyed scripts most egregious of all is dorothy whose preposterous premise is that a cute young guy will have trouble getting laid in nyc due to a shortage of identifiable gay guys in his vicinity br br in terms of cinema these shorts play like tacky little gay afterschool specials not a lot of imagination in their writing or execution basically they follow a point and shoot shot reaction shot master shot convention which becomes painfully dull after five or so minutes there's hope for queer cinema in the works of todd haynes sadie benning and the late great marlon riggs but not here these films are incredibly middlebrow singularly whitebread and their values basically pander to a gay bourgeois sensibility which is probably why they play so well at gay film festivals
<START> rented the video for a slow saturday night first viewing i thought it was funny took a while to get used to the american caricatures here we're more attuned to british grotesques but very enjoyable br br watched it again next night and really warmed to it the characters seemed more human lovable even a film one could watch several times and get more out of it each time however my wife hated it no accounting for tastes in humour i suppose
<START> chuck norris stars as danny a cop who took down a hulking serial killer however when said killer escapes danny knows he is the only one able to stop the terror however danny harbors a secret he knows that it was sheer luck that got the terror arrested and even more luck that danny survived now a final battle is waged but is danny ready right there in my description tells what the problem of this movie is norris is playing a wimpy hero who still suffers from psychological trauma in the hands of a better actor this concept would be interesting and could make for a great thriller in the hands of a norris thriller it just makes it ridiculous and hopelessly also on board is american steve james and ron o'neal but any attempt at character development is defeated by the atrocious script also there is hardly any action and i always preferred a norris movie with more fighting and less talking given the rating on this website i must not be alone br br out of 4 bad
<START> i tend to like historical period films and get new ideas for costumes for my historical group and a friend recommended this one to me i like johnny lee miller as an actor so i figured it was worth it and i was definitely rewarded his portrayal as a member of the english noble class was by far more accurate than i've seen in the past the comedy aspect of it left my sides hurting the costumes weren't awful and historically i didn't wince too much i also noticed the fact that england didn't have a proper sewage system until much later but anyone who dose not go deep into the of england's past won't notice nor care absolutely worth seeing i highly recommend this movie
<START> that was one of the worst movies i've ever seen why would someone make a movie about getting away with murder mr allen again plays the only type of character that he's able the sexually stunted man who can't get the girl get a clue allen there's a reason that's the only character that you can successfully portray stir clear of this movie it's a waste of time unless you want to know how to successfully murder someone i feel sorry for the actors who say 'yes' to woody allen look at his cast and tell me how many of those people are still working my respect for all of the actors who work for him immediately goes down because they chose to participate in the film
<START> probably one of the worst movies ever made i'm still trying to figure if it was meant to be fun but for sure i had no fun at all maybe the movie lost something during the english italian translation dunno for sure i miss the guts to watch it again in original version br br my rate for it 2 10 and i feel like i'm being pretty generous let's say 1 point is for liv cause she's a nice babe and the other point is for those decent actors that got trapped into a worthless useless and pathetic movie br br take care br br alex
