<START> up at the villa 2000 1 2 br br warning you may find some spoilers ahead br br it's hard to know what is the point in up at the villa a gorgeous but shallow period piece one of those made with the only objective of earning oscar nominations for best costume design and art set direction one for cinematography and another for score are also welcome it has the same basic idea of thousands of period pieces produced every year a good looking intelligent woman trying to find love in a strange place to her she has many difficulties but ultimately finds her happiness in the arms of a man that is not the one that she had an accomplishment with in this case our lady is in florence some time before world war ii she is an english widow engaged to a rich but old man whom obviously she doesn't love one day she meets another man who has not a good reputation but for whom she falls in love of course there is her friend who will help her for better or worse and a third man who commits suicide here in the lady's room setting up a risky situation for her guess how the story ends br br up at the villa is not a bad film i was always quite interested in the story but never got excited the problem is not the slow pacing but the screenplay adapted from a novel it needs something more spicy exciting twists and suspense every time you think the story will get warm it gets cooler again if you think there is a conspiracy involving the mean police chief of florence well there is but it doesn't change almost anything in the story it just keeps going and going till the predictable ending br br as i said up at the villa is not bad if it is a bit bland it never gets sappy and too sentimental the acting is half and half but surely convinces kristin scott thomas made some really bad choices after the english patient the romantic drama the horse whisperer and the dull irritating random hearts up at the villa is undoubtly better than those pieces and kristin is also better but she can do more than that sean penn is good as always even if his character is a big dude anne bancroft is a terrific actress the graduate my god and here she doesn't let her character become ridiculous now the supporting actors are pretty bad jeremy davies is sooooooooooo irritating br br the directing is good but not audacious it was interesting to know that the director is the same of angels and insects also starring kristin scott thomas another so so period drama but more audacious than this what matters here are the visuals florence is wonderful the costumes are great the scenery the music br br in the end up at the villa is an average romantic drama but of course it could have been much better it is watchable and interesting but don't expect a suspense film it is not this film kind of fails because it wants to have some mystery something to behold however there is not much to say mainly because of the shallow screenplay now about the oscar nominations don't worry it will probably get them
<START> this movie is a haunting telling of the life of the author and poet mishima it jumps around through his past through his last day and through some of his stories but is expertly constructed as it moves from section to section it captures the flavor of the man his work and of his times the difficult 1960s br br i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazing stylized beautiful and effective they could be used as for any set designer i woke up at night dreaming of the golden pagoda br br the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist br br i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history
<START> this movie was suspenseful and fun to view as i am a fan of these type of movies i did enjoy this the premise is kind of scary but the fact that i didn't rate this a 10 was because the movie was a little over the top in some areas br br spoilers br br cmon nobody could identify this girl i understand the concept of isolating oneself but i find it hard to believe that somebody anybody wouldn't have been able to id this girl as angela bennet that was over the top and so was the scene where she walked over to somebody's desk and started typing this was overall a really good movie suspenseful and keeps your interest dennis miller was great as allen really believable bullock was good as the lonely reserved computer worker the bad guys all underestimated br br i think the premise of the movie was really different and scary in today's times who knows what could happen but some of the over the top scenes prevented this movie from being a 10 8 of 10
<START> got the chance to see this at a friend's house today and was impressed with what it achieved on such a small budget not that this ever bothered me anyway since i love low budget sci fi like dr who blake's 7 and dark star hell even outland wasn't a big budget affair so whilst money helps it takes more than throwing cash at things to make them good br br the story is straightforward at first with a group of mercenaries paid to escort a prisoner through space their ship is attacked and they are forced to land on the nearest planet they then discover the prisoner has made it too he's a stone cold nut case and that's only the start of their problems br br the effects except for the gunfights are minimalistic and add to the film without overwhelming it computer effects look a bit dodgy at times but serve their purpose well and add to the story lending a futuristic feel to the proceedings films like i robot could have benefited from this approach instead of being largely style over substance and substituting special effects for a plot like all too many of hollywood's offerings br br whilst none of the actors get oscar material it's tightly scripted and shot and at an hour and ten minutes doesn't outstay its welcome the characters don't get fleshed out much but then they didn't in predator either which it resembles in feel big man mike mitchell is a good stand in for arnie and is a good combination of brains and brawn br br some people may be annoyed at the lack of explanation towards the end but i like it unlike a lot of films and shows which leave things unexplained it is not so obscure that you can't get a handle on it at all and i'd like to see a sequel where the nature of the aliens is explored further br br a cracking little film from an enterprising team done on the cheap but a fun way to pass an hour if this is what they can do on a shoestring i'd like to see what they would do with a bit more cash and hope the film industry and the talentless armchair critics don't knock all the creativity out of them first br br recommended
<START> why what a disgusting joke of a supposed movie from the poster it looked like a cute movie what a disappointment who the heck is the male lead he looks like an old retarded retired reject cop i am a cop and i can tell the man can't act go back to being a cop no screen presence why did they show his bare ass so as if he is mel gibson hell no put the filmmaker out of business this guy has no business making a movie i seriously doubt women or gay men find him attractive whoever cast the film is a no talent hack who cast no talent hacks in the lead it's great that us white guys are alway getting the asian women but why an ugly white guy why not dean cain or brad pitt as the white boyfriend why to asian women like ugly white guys or black guys in what i see don't get it must be low self esteem br br the only hot girl who can act in the movie was the kate holliday why was there one hot white chick among all the rest of the ugly asian chicks who think they are hot and can act br br only two actors in this movie the host of the poetry at the end of the movie and the one hot white chick in the massage house tl young and kate holliday should have been the leads in the movie br br the asia character was ridiculous looked like she was trying too hard to be some kind of ghetto sexy black girl key word here is trying br br gina you can't act and you are not hot enough physically for this kind of role you need to play character roles and be more humble in your self presentation br br i think the actress is gina i looked her up on the imdb and she is a great asian actress if that is the case i don't want to see what the bad asian american actresses are br br no wonder hollywood doesn't have asian american actors if this is the best they got they were supposedly winning some kind of asian film award give me break it looked like they just made a movie for the sake of putting a bunch of asian girls in them they aren't even hot gina you are not hot stop trying play character roles and improve your acting you are not a leading female type br br if this movies makes money pigs can fly sorry for being so blunt but i feel that these actors actresses need to either get better or work on their craft for the exception of the two actors i mentioned who should have played the leads i say this in love for all the asian lead girls in the film please do what your parents say and go and be doctors lawyers and engineers and do acting on the side for fun hopefully that is what you are doing now i am not trying to be mean but hoping this will be read and push you people to either get better or go do another business there was not even a message ethically in this movie br br i would not be surprised if soap girls was secretly funded by members of the ku klux klan special department of asian american hate propaganda of the klan br br otherwise asian people must hate themselves seeing this film makes me as the viewer grateful that i am not asian you folks are pathetic have some self respect you asian people
<START> i have seen this film more then once actually el padrino was one of the best feature films that i have seen in a great deal of time br br there was a big cast jennifer tilly faye brad dourif and damian who really shined like a real star in this part of kilo br br i heard this film was shot for under two million dollars i have seen films shot for 33 million that cant compare to the quality and production value br br damian why are you not getting offers and more film work excellent job i cant wait to see the sequel and i hope it has the same action br br jennifer tilly has made a cult classic character with br br damian moves coolly in every scene much like the movie stars of the 40's and 50's so sick of seeing these non charismatic actors like ben stiller getting all of these films when there is talent like this that have something to show a great film br br go go go kick some but in sales el padrino
<START> this show is sheer entertainment and doesn't try to be a greek drama it certainly contains elements of one what with all the plot twists but it's immensely engaging and fun las vegas is the perfect setting for a show and they will certainly never have a lack of material to work with anything and everything does happen there the actors in this show are extremely personable and you really do want to see what they are up to and into each week the show is also very funny the humor arises from the characters and situations not just thrown in gratuitously it's a well crafted show in that regard it certainly makes me look forward to friday nights and i'm glad i now own the first two seasons on dvd
<START> although many audio recordings of great musicians like jascha survive the cinematic or televised record is limited indeed this is why musical offerings like they shall have music are such rare gems while with modern eyes and ears one can quibble about the plot the perceptive viewer should put this film's unique delights in their proper perspective the plot was designed to appeal to both young and old audiences of the era but it remains enjoyable to this day a important aspect of the experience of watching classic films is to see them through the eyes of the moviegoer of that era br br i must take issue with reviewer who complains about a film that is in black and white or who feel obliged to report that their students express such reservations these are juvenile complaints which reflect a limited historical perspective for the teacher this should offer up an educational opportunity to explain the unique qualities of black and white photography and its place in cinematic history color can in fact get in the way of a good storyline or the music for example the black and white photography of john ford's stagecoach is like the still photographs of adams an artistic masterpiece br br as for being wooden i could not disagree more if you want blatant emotional posturing go to a rock concert the role of a classical musician like is to move the audience not him or herself emotion is conveyed through his playing not through his body language he had a rare ability to extract every emotional nuance out of the music and transfer it to his listeners it is the listener who should be moved not the artist br br incidentally one reviewer asked about seeing on youtube playing the 1st movement of the tchaikovsky violin concerto with frank mchugh in the audience this is from the 1947 film carnegie hall not they shall have music carnegie hall is an even greater treasure of many great classical artists in their prime we are blessed that there were film producers who at least in these limited instances chose to showcase these artists in was still an era not totally overwhelmed by the lowest common denominator tripe we get today
<START> i was telling a friend of mine about the time my grandfather actually picked this horrible piece of crap for us to see one night at the theater he never picked another one again it was that bad anyway my friend then told me that her father did some of the writing for this garbage i thought she was kidding it turns out she was serious she had never actually seen it and she said that it put a quick halt to her father's writing career i told her not to waste her time but if she did actually break down and watch it she would see within the fist minute why this ended her father's days as a writer i mean even for the 1980's this crap is bad beyond description i mean joe frazier as terrible tucker and why in the world would two cops care one bit about a house full of ghosts and the movie poster a ghost with his tongue hanging out what is that about nothing about this makes any sense well i told my friend that this crap not only ended her father's writing career it ended the careers of everybody involved or at least none of them ever fully recovered from being in this garbage of a movie let's just say that i will forever ridicule my friend for revealing to me that her father was a writer for this movie that alone should tell just how bad this is
<START> whereas the movie was beautifully shot and reasonably well acted the script was dull plodding and nothing we have not seen before not once in this film did i ever get the feeling that these people were really in danger no noticeable climax and a very standard resolution i believe these type of movies have been overdone and should be given a rest after all didn't everyone on the planet see schindler's list
<START> i've seen this movie about 6 or 7 times and it truly gets funnier every time perhaps what i enjoy most is the tired character paradigms that the movie offers us the somber all american male protagonist his blonde girlfriend the theater nerd with glasses a brunette girl the antagonistic jock and brunette girl 2 however we're then presented with two magician martial arts experts with mullets driving a convertible if anyone can explain that please contact me among other highlights are bobby johnston's portrayal of the jock character dell and his trademark line that's why i keep her around in watching johnston's performance it comes as no surprise that his career quickly descended into the realm of soft core porn spoiler also after multiple viewings i still have absolutely no idea what that big demon at the end says at any point it's just muffled noises oh well that's probably for the better and lastly why are all the demons so slippery is wet skin scarier it certainly didn't help in this film
<START> the minutiae of what's involved in carrying out a robbery is what makes this one of the best of all heist movies then there's the robbery itself a wordless thirty minute nail biter that has never been surpassed followed by what is probably the cinema's most pronounced example of dishonor among thieves as things begin to spectacularly unravel and we have what is unquestionably the greatest of all heist movies br br this was a tough and unsentimental film when it first appeared in 1955 and it is just as tough and unsentimental today it displays some of the edgy brutality of dassin's earlier brute force there isn't a flabby moment or duff performance in the entire film and dassin captures the milieu of seedy clubs and parisian back streets like no one else and the final drive through paris by a dying man is one of the most iconic closing sequences of any movie a classic
<START> ok i normally don't add comments on movies but i finally watched a movie that was so utterly full of bullsh t and riddled with incompetence that i just had to warn people about blackwater valley exorcist is loosely about a wife beating pederast priest and this podunk family of horse freaks and to make a long story short the youngest daughter who was molested by the priest but in love with the hillbilly ranch hand gets possessed along with a heroic god shunning mexican gardener who once participated in a exorcism the wife beating pederast priest manage to save the day but not before the possessing demon is able to jump over to a hooker who the town sheriff made blow him all in all this movie is the biggest pile of useless i could get very descriptive with this part but why waste my energy on this movie sh t i've ever seen any and all persons associated with the making of this movie should be sterilized so that they cannot pollute the earth with their useless spawn
<START> i have seen many possibly too many straight to video no budget slasher films and have developed a taste for the good ones or the ones that are less sucky as ridiculous as that sounds hahaha dr chopper is what i kindly like to refer to as absolute crap nothing about it is enjoyable the acting sucks the characters suck the killer sucks the gore is minimal and sucks it is about a group of college friends who drive out to a newly discovered family cabin owned by the parents of one of the kids it is meant to be a relaxing retreat but little do they know that a deathly ill former plastic surgeon gone bad along with his two female assistants search for usable tissue to save the doctor his name is dr chopper since he rides around on a motorcycle and of course chops this is just a terrible movie not worthy of anyone's time enough said
<START> what can you possibly say this is the uncut hardcore musical alice it works too with a large energetic cast seemingly enjoying themselves to the hilt and whilst one could wish for a re mastered version i guess we are lucky to even have this video transfer pretty much a delight throughout there are a couple of slightly off moments but this could have been embarrassing all through and it certainly is not it also could have been and today would have been too camp no a very fine effort that is amusing tuneful and just sexy enough fine performances particularly the kristine debell in the lead and was that an richard prior as the prone knight being vigorously if discreetly ridden
