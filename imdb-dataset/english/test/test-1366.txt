<START> the battleship potemkin is now the oldest film i've seen and it is also the first silent film i've seen i heard a lot of good things about this movie so i got the tape out at home and i watched it when it ended i just thought that this was a classic masterpiece the story is based on the real life russian battleship potemkin you wouldn't think it but some of it was sad and disgusting sad being that the mother dies and the rolls down the stairway and disgusting being they have to eat rotten meat with maggots in it br br today it is still considered to be one of the best silent and russian films ever made i think that everyone should see it if they can find it you will be presently surprised at how good it is it's a must see classic 5 5
<START> it's proof that movie makers and their financiers treating their audience with contempt isn't a new phenomena as it was done as early as the 1940s and house of dracula is a great example you'd think having a film with dracula the wolf man and frankenstein's monster the producer would dictate to the screenwriter to have all three appear in a scene they had a chance with house of frankenstein then when they had a second bite of the cherry they blew it again with house of dracula to lose one chance is a misfortune to lose two smacks of cynical money making br br it's obvious the producers are beyond caring larry talbot turns up again even though he was shown to die in the previous film which sums up the cynicism of the franchise it also shows what a poor screenplay it is and we're mistreated to some awful plot turns like condition being cured by a special type of plant which will soften his skull i'm thinking screenwriter edward t lowe might have had his skull softened if this is the type of stuff he comes up with br br director erie c can't improve on the script and throws in a few of his own for example talbot is startled to see dr snatch a lift on a cart but nonchalantly watches climb a wall and jump in to the chÃ¢teau courtyard one can't help thinking reaction shots were mistakenly switched round at the editing stage br br lon chaney jnr is famous for his roles in horror movies but didn't have much of a career outside them perhaps that's down to the fact he's not a good actor and here he commits the worst type of acting being very wooden it's not entirely his fault though because all the characters spout rather awful dialogue and are all rather wooden due in part to lackluster directing br br house of dracula feels a million miles away from james whale 1931 film and its sequel from 1935 and would have been a very sad note to end on but ironically universal decided to make one more movie to wrap up their franchise with a horror comedy starring abbot and costello
<START> this is strictly for pryor fans just because he was a great funny guy doesn't mean this is more than a b movie the script is awful it just meanders around constantly ridiculing crime and prisoners of war it balances between comedy and melodrama and keeps falling on its face doing justice to neither br br first there are 30 minutes of rather unrealistic uninspired vietnam prisoner of war time Â the guy is playing basketball at one point how more can you pander to your audience that prison time is boring unconvincing and already can easily put one to sleep br br back in the u s the guy for no real reason at all is considered a war hero yet he is of course quickly forgotten by the public and seems to be stumbling into all kinds of wacky mishaps or are they really we will soon find out yawn there are annoying clichÃ©s his sick mother his little daughter he never meets a high end whore falling in love with the hero etc it is very odd how this movie constantly switches from tragedy to slapstick in one instant doesn't work at all br br overall this in fact is just a bad comedy and does a disservice to prisoners of war just because this guy was a great stand up comedian played in a few good movies and died of ms is no reason not to be annoyed by this silly unconvincing unfunny comedy but if you like richard pryor you will probably be thrilled by him reading 3 hours of dadaist poetry
<START> where to begin where to begin savannah in the episode gimme shelter to disabuse fox does not at this point in time have any intention of releasing the show on dvd but be not that you are reading this reveals that the magic lingers fifteen years on and small wonder this was post modern television a valiant attempt to visualize magical realism 'neath the blue patina charm and brio were scripts bursting with symbolism and metaphor music that actually interacted with scenes and ultimately an attempt however doomed to recapture one's belief in innocence to reclaim eden as it were it's potency is perhaps best attested to by the fact that even as we umm type a book is being written about the show wherein will be found the thoughts fancies and reminiscences of many of the show's actors writers directors and producers in the anyone desirous of once again visiting the end of the world and themselves with seamus sheriff cody savannah et al should not hesitate to contact me i may be able to make you a copy angels in the spray wizards in the palm trees
<START> there have been some great television movies in that past epics such as roots and lonesome dove come to mind category 6 day of destruction will not be remembered for advancing the cause of made for tv movies a laughably bad story surpassed only by the horrible screenplay as i like to call it inspires more sympathy for the actors involved than terror in nature that the movie was supposed to bring out that sound you hear during the movie is supposed to be the sound of wind but instead it's actually the careers of randy quaid brian dennehy and thomas gibson greg of the dharma greg duo plummeting faster than houses and trucks and cows can fly away from one of the 15 tornadoes we see in the first 5 minutes of the movie the movie was advertised as nature gone amok instead we get a lame story about how 15 different weather systems conspire to produce 150 degree days in chicago then a blizzard the next day from a hurricane that was in the gulf of mexico that combined with a storm system from canada but actually had it's origins in a jet stream changed by global warming enough it didn't matter what the story was the acting was terrible the words the actors said were dumb and 13 scientists throughout the country had after hearing the dribble that came out of the movie i didn't care what happened to any of the characters the special effects were sub par even for made for tv standards and the story lines were pointless all in all i really really dislikes this tv event
<START> i loved this film independent film making at its best the cinematography pacing rhythm and acting were perfectly in sync fred carpenters best work to date the movie is well written with lots of plot twists that take you to a great ending it moves well and keeps you involved being a photographer i was most impressed with the cinematography the lighting creates mood and a beauty that is usually found in a much bigger budget film this gave the actors a great canvas to start from to work their magic and that is just what they did great performances from all the actors and each one was well cast in their roles as i said in the beginning the is a wonderful film and one of fred carpenters best movies you will love it
<START> makes the fourth theatrical release the one national lampoon took its name off of look like a comedy classic a complete mistake and a sad attempt to capitalize on a once proud franchise painfully unfunny and unwatchable even for a tv movie the cousin eddie character has become progressively less amusing from the original vacation when it was fresh and unique through christmas vacation when it was starting to wear a bit thin to vegas vacation where it was actually annoying to see come on screen but in fairness there were a lot of things that were annoying to see come on screen in that movie but this attempt to move the character up to lead status is unfortunate to say the least the vacation movies themselves met an ugly death in las vegas and this hope at reviving even the thinnest thread of the series for television was thoroughly misguided chevy chase and company put together a great trilogy back when he was in his prime now let's just pull the plug and let the title rest in peace one tiny note of interest the original audrey griswold dana barron the first of four actresses to play the part including juliette lewis returns to the role 20 years later one is left only to wonder why
<START> i would like to know the real name of the lodge where scenes from the movie were filmed it is truly beautiful and hearkens back to 20's and 30's architecture like the hotel del i know it was on either big bear lake or lake arrowhead and would like to hear if it is still in existence as for the movie itself it is truly amazing that jane wyman was even nominated for an academy award this must have been a period when she was well liked by her academy peers it really would have been interesting to get a true impression from wyman and the other actors in this movie regarding the script the script of this movie like the recent kevin costner movie with a message in a bottle is so unbelievable that it it limits the credibility that the actors can bring to their parts rock hudson can be forgiven he was never a great actor was able to get by mostly on his looks and didn't get credible roles until later in his career pretty maids is the exception but wyman must have been forced to take this movie through contractual requirements or the studio system
<START> the sea inside a film by alejandro amenabar br br almodovar has always single handed the flag for spanish cinema for years now out of nowhere came amenabar reinventing genres and injecting some new blood to the otherwise spanish industry now in a big gamble he switches from psychological terror to social drama well the big ones would be are audiences ready to embrace the swing and more important can he hold the flag this is the story of ramon a sailor that in his twenties was paralyzed from the neck down in an accident at the sea and his fight with the spanish government for the right to end his life the story has the traces of an afternoon made for tv melodrama and the only way this is going to work is through words and honest performances and they both come in spades mateo gil and amenabar co write in a way where the audience is not meant to be lead blind to a death end but they are encouraged to make up their own minds in the process and that is a brilliant stroke this is not a movie pro death but a movie in favour of the ultimate illusions of our time liberty there is a few laughs spare a long the way like when the church comes home in a wheel chair to deconstruct beliefs but is mostly a valley of tears through out punches coming from all fronts even when you think you are safe his father that to that point didn't make any sense comes up with the most moving line of the entire movie it is a heartbreaking experience specially when seems more full of life than most the people wandering the streets and everyone around him tries to convince him of the wonders of life even those who are helping him to dieÂ but when you strip a man of his the film is almost exclusively built on close ups bringing a claustrophobic feeling that makes the audience more sympathetic with that's for the actors a huge challenge that must construct their whole performances with their eyes and the eyes don't lie bardem was not granted his second oscar nomination probably in favour of eastwood but in my opinion he was the only one who could have shadowed fox this role reminds me of the great gregory peck in to kill a mockingbird where the acting looked effortless and i reckon bardem has reached that status where the line of what is acting and what is real has become completely blur i was never fond of his early work but since almodovar's live flesh he is on a roll los lunes al sol the dancer upstairs and the oscar nominated before the night falls made him an international star and although he and banderas come from the same almodovar background is fascinating to see how different paths they took and how bardem has now become a real reference for spanish cinema in the whole world a golden globe 14 goyas jury prize at venice and probably an oscar with permission from the chorus boys amenabar directs co write edits and puts music to a high caliber drama he has pull it offÂ what about some science fiction now whose life is it anyway
<START> i really hated this movie and it's the first movie written by stephen king that i didn't finish i was truly disappointed it was the worst crap i've ever seen what were you thinking making three hours out of it it may have a quite good story but actors no suspense no romance no horror no it didn't have anything br br it's got this strange crazy science man with einstein hair the classic thing not real at all and a man keep getting younger all the time it seems like they just used the name of stephen king to make a crappy too long movie with nothing exciting at all br br i give this movie 1 awful if they had like 5 i would probably take that instead it was a total waste of time
<START> my friend and i rented this one a few nights ago and i must say this is the single best movie i have ever seen i mean woah dude we better get some brew before this joint closes and dude linda's not a bra again what poetry woah and it's such a original movie too i mean you don't usually find a slasher film where every single murder is exactly the same i mean exactly now that's originality and almost all the transitions between scenes are these great close ups of the psycho in the er scrubs how cool the acting is so wonderful to the dad was just brilliant must have studied real dads before filming and how many movies do you find that just don't make any sense not many but this is one of those gems i mean how cool is it that one guy waited outside for like six hours to pull a prank while his friends were both inside that's really cool overall i'd say this is the single greatest film of the genre nay in the world
<START> as usual another masterpiece in the vice academy series hahaha i don't know why they even bothered to make this trash just another series of cops acting slutty a defining part was when ginger lynn allen's character holly wells and elizabeth character candy tried to seduce the scientist by wearing nothing but their bra and underwear under their just a wonderful scene ha a character that i didn't like was the commissioner he was very annoying and ignorant they should have arrested him mrs was pretty annoying as well they should have stopped this series after this movie
<START> i just recently viewed shame which is directed by ingmar bergman the film was interesting and very unique i liked how it was in swedish with english subtitles and that it was also in black and white these features allowed me to better relate to the characters the time period and their stories i didn't like how the movie was very slow in the beginning and how you didn't know what was really going on at first it was mainly a story of eva and jan's relationship the movie also ended on a very depressing note because nothing good came out of all of the conflicts and changes throughout the movie i probably would not go see shame again but it was a very cultured experience
<START> i write this review just after hearing of stanley kubrick's death it's a great loss and i write about 2001 a space odyssey because i feel it is the consummate kubrick film the one he will be most remembered for it is a picture like no other not only science fiction but changing the way films are conceptualized it was probably america's first 'art' film and has inspired the likes of george lucas and countless other writers and directors br br aside from its visual greatness the reason the film spawns so much discussion and analysis is because so many people have so many different interpretations of it kubrick and arthur c clarke his co writer had a vision but we have never really found out what was going through their minds of course the skinny on its 'message' is how technology of the future will take over humanity and decide the course of our lives unless we are careful 2001's ending is one of hope a version of our rebirth through the star child's flight back to earth it is meaningless to many but discerning filmgoers will understand br br although 2001 does not have the wicked dark humor of dr strangelove or clockwork orange or contain strong eccentric characters that filled his earlier works like paths of glory or spartacus i still feel he would've liked to be remembered most for this if anything hal will be his most memorable character dangerous murderous and artificial it was a half decade in the making at a time when hollywood was still churning out dull musicals and just waking up to the new wave of french and italian cinema kubrick was a maverick director who made great films on his own terms his own time and for everyone else to marvel at he will be missed
<START> very interesting to find another reviewer who had the exact same reaction to this movie as i did it was a heck of a lot better when i was 10 or 11 years old br br seeing it more than 30 years later it's still okay but it only mildly held my interest what seemed hugely funny back then was only mildly amusing br br also things that were astonishing to me as a 10 year old came across as just silly for example in one scene trinity is walking along and fires his revolver behind him and kills two men without even looking in fact he doesn't even bother to look and see if they're dead because he knows he hit the mark um yeah right br br in addition a lot of the dialogue sounds quite wooden sorry but 35 years later it hasn't really aged that well br br although it's been a long time since i've seen that one as well probably a better terrence hill film than this one would be my name is nobody
