<START> i watched this film mistakenly thinking that it was that other radio station zombie flick the shonky production values and low rent cast soon gave away that this was another one of the those cheap sci fi channel style knock offs br br the central performance from bill moseley is initially quite engaging as the dubious radio shock jock but as the film goes on becomes less and less convincing as he is actually required to act the rest of the cast have little to do other than look concerned and have no depth whatsoever br br the cinematography is dull flat and completely uninspired like so many of these kind of films it doesn't even manage a decent bit of convincing gore the zombie make up is literally pathetic apart from one notable exception towards the end of the film br br the film tries to inject originality and a message into it's concoction of half baked and ripped off ideas by somehow equating this outbreak with intolerance towards islam and the war on terror this is woefully handled with all the intellectual clout of a 6 year old as the characters and seemingly the writers are unable to distinguish the difference between race and religion describing all people of a certain skin colour as muslims most notably one character is revealed to be muslim by skin colour alone at the same time the muslim terrorists who cause the outbreak are the usual psychopathic stereotype br br presumably the far far superior had a similar budget as dead air yet shines everywhere where this film fails miserably
<START> being a big fan of horror films and always manage to find something good about a picture but this film just did not hold my interest or attention this story revolves around a father and his daughter and a girlfriend since his wife died a few years back these people encounter a horrible situation in a town they stop off and visit and all the senior citizens in this town gang up against these people and almost kill them this film reminded me of a film called children of the corn because it really involves children who are being presented to satan and are his instruments of terror there is plenty of chants mambo jumble and a toy tank that completely destroys an entire family in their station wagon as well as dolls who kill a husband and wife
<START> you'd have more excitement cutting off your testicles than watching this clearly a trick to get you to rent descent instead of the descent which is a much better movie br br this is a total rip off of the core and much much worse as regards special effects i could do better with a box of cornflakes and a roll of i mean come on that mole thing bore more resemblance to a vibrating dildo than a subterranean vehicle br br don't watch it if you do you'll find the room your in has a funny smell for days after and you'll have this nagging feeling in the back of your head that you should go kill yourself or something
<START> just finished this impressively nutty affair and whilst i can't say as it was as good as i had hyped it up to be in my mind it was still an effective and at time pretty nasty piece of brain warped and misogyny fuelled j trash its story tells of a poor gal searching for her sister who winds up getting raped and drugged by yakuza scumbags and the helpful lady doctor who sets out to avenge her doing so in bizarrely gruesome fashion after a similar bout of rape and drugging oh yeah and there's a bit of straightforward sex in there as well sadly its all soft core as per the japanese disapproval of below the belt nudity but is minimal in fact only really noticeable in a hilarious blow job scene although writer director kazuo komizu fails in creating an especially compelling tale this is at least pretty scuzzy stuff diving early on into the well of filth with a pretty unsettling rape made worse by the fact that the gal looks kinda young though i'm pretty sure she was of age also for the most part this is pretty professional looking stuff maybe not stylish but it has a certain flair and the content is handled reasonably well with particular kudos for largely avoiding having to employ much things are mostly sex rape based for about two thirds of the sharp runtime and its pretty watchable if you groove to such fare it gets a bit numbing after a while but the ladies are easy on the eye and it is reasonably harsh at times the music from takahashi is occasionally effective though hardly a key part of the show it does in a few spots complement the action neatly at any rate enough for me to notice it more important are the effects by which pack an impressively splattery punch when they appear helped out by the lunatic nature of the climactic shenanigans things even pull to a curiously affecting ending sure it ain't a weepy or anything but for a film so gutter level for most of its runtime it is relatively poignant altogether this is a pretty entertaining diversion for mean spirited trash fans especially those with a taste for japanese adventures i could really have done with a longer revenge section and more gore also perhaps more of a point brains but hey it kept me watching and it is pretty nicely stocked with memorably wtf moments so if you dig this sort of degenerate junk probably worth your while just maybe don't expect the second coming
<START> this is a very strange film with a no name cast and virtually nothing known about it on the web it uses an approach familiar to those who have watched the likes of creepshow in that it introduces a trilogy of so called horror shorts and blends them together into a connecting narrative of the people who are involved in the segments getting off a bus there is a narrator who prattles on about relationships but his talking adds absolutely nothing to the mix at all and just adds to the confusion as for the stories themselves well i swear i have not got a clue why this movie got an 18 certificate in the uk which would bring it into line with the likes of nightmare on elm street and the exorcist nothing here is even remotely scary there is no gore sex nudity or even a swear word to liven things up this is the kind of thing you could put out on children's tv and no one would bat an eyelid i can only think if it had got the rating it truly deserved a pg no serious horror fan would be seen dead with it so the distributor probably buffeted the bbfc until they relented anyway here are the 3 tales in summary 1 a man becomes dangerously obsessed with his telekinetic car to the point of alienating his fiancee 2 a man who lives in a filthy apartment is understandably freaked out when a living organism evolved from his six month old tuna casserole 3 a woman thinks she has found the perfect man through a computer dating service that is until he starts to act weird and there you have it some of them are pretty amusing due to their outlandish premises my favourite being number 2 but you get the feeling they were meant to be a frightening and b morality plays unfortunately they fail miserably on both counts to sum up then this flick is an obscure curiosity for very good reasons
<START> i can't believe that anyone would green light this let alone voluntarily star in it i will never be able to get that 90 mins of my life back br br this has to be one of the worst films i have ever seen some films are so bad they're good this has gone so far round again that's somehow it's so bad it's terrible i was not exactly expecting much it being a low budget bandwagon jumping rehash of a b movie but it still came in way under my expectation levels even tv movies have higher production values br br there were very poor special effects shocking dialogue terrible acting and a completely unexplained plot who cursed her and why why did the 6 inch snakes turn into 15 foot snakes has anyone ever heard of highly venomous garter snakes or pythons 100 passengers 3 000 snakes so many promises none delivered br br some comments would have you believe that this film is worth watching for the last five minutes it's not even worth a rental stay in and watch a low budget tv movie you'll enjoy it a lot more br br why was this made oh yes to shamelessly cash in on the internet phenomenon that is soap shame on you brothers shame on you
<START> all this show is is the same plot spelling is in danger of failing school he needs to pass to become emperor he needs to learn something which he thinks is stupid he then uses it learns more about it and realizes it's not so stupid posing as the principal tries to transform into some animal to stop him every episode br br jokes from the movie are copied incredibly complicated plans breaking the 4th wall constantly squirrels they should try hiring some writers br br 2 10
<START> this movie could have been an impressing epic but the makers seem to have done their utmost to make it appear foolish even god himself is not spared in this movie in that his words are drenched with childish jokes the result is blasphemous and annoying only people who don't care to see a cheap parody on the biblical story may perhaps watch this film without embarrassment the makers of this tasteless production should see the gospel according to mathew a film of pier paolo pasolini who shows that it is unnecessary to pervert the words of the bible to make a good story the most impressing result is obtained by a sincere rendering of the plain text itself
<START> would someone explain to me when the ghoulies learned to speak this was a horrible film i loved ghoulies and ghoulies 2 but what's this unless you want to kill yourself please stay away from ghoulies 3 on a scale of 1 to 10 ghoulies 3 gets a 1
<START> korean romance about the owner of a camera store who is diagnosed with a fatal disease as he goes about his daily routine and prepares for the end he becomes acquainted with a young girl who is a customer a friendship and romance grows eve though neither expresses any sort of affection for the other good film is unlike anything you are likely to see remade in america simply because the studios would insist that the couple act on their feelings he will not say anything because he doesn't have that long to live she won't because its not the thing thats done and he is not responding as she thinks he should of course its much more complex than i'm making it out to be and in all honesty its the sort of thing that you should discover for yourself is it a great film no but it is a good one that will move you emotionally the final lines of the film still haunts me i always knew that love would fade like a photograph but you will remain in my heart as you are in my last moment thank you and goodbye it may seem odd out of context but with in the context of the film it is very moving
<START> so what can i tell you about this movie if you cheated a lot in high school you do recognize some br br this is the best thing i can tell you about this film br br if you like american teen movies maybe you also like it br br but i don't see this kind of movies as something funny sorry to say but if you are older then 10 years i shouldn't advise you to watch this br br because there is one shot with a couple of beautiful women girls in this movie i'll give it a rate of 2 br br so deal for yourself good luck
<START> circus could have been so much better if they had reduced the number of twists and developed each better the film features a very gifted cast that mostly perform well however it totally loses the audience basically everyone is back stabbing everyone else and not back stabbing them at the same time because they are backstabbing someone else and working with did i lose you well the film is even more confusing clearly written by a first timer writer it has some redeeming qualities though in the acting especially famke janssen shines as lily but sadly gets a lot of useless screen time just standing there doing nothing the dialogue is a bit cheesy and the accents sometimes irritating but its still worth watching if you're a fan of any of the actors especially john and famke who get the most screen time just remember to watch it with a notebook so you can write down who is double crossing who every second
<START> from 1936 1939 peter lorre made a string of highly successful mr moto films while technically b films they were much better made than typical films of the genre however lorre tired of making these highly repetitive films and told friends he wanted out of the series when it was canceled in 1939 lorre was thrilled but his plans of getting more complicated and satisfying roles did not materialize when he moved to columbia pictures island of doomed men is one of these films and it's pretty obvious the studio isn't putting much effort into the movie as i think the plot was written by penguins talented penguins perhaps but still the movie made little sense at all br br it begins with a guy agreeing to be an undercover agent for the government he is to infiltrate an island in the us where something strange is amiss now they easily could have just got a search warrant to do this but given that penguins were writing the film the agent takes the rap for a murder he didn't commit and spends a year in prison for this he apparently hopes that he'll be paroled to this island as many are sent there when they finish the term br br there are some more serious problems with this idea first they only have him serve a year before getting paroled but he was convicted of murder and he refused to divulge who he really was they would never parole anyone in a case like this second what if he wasn't paroled to the island he would have spent an entire year in jail for nothing third why not just have scuba divers or or cops in boats come to the island talk about a contrived plot br br once on the island the agent discovers that evil peter lorre has set up his own private prison and staffed it with guys on parole as slave labor what about the men having to report to their parole officers this was never explained but lorre was using them to mine for diamonds and they were treated abominably now another question i had was that if lorre was discovering huge diamonds there he was a very wealthy man so why not just pay people to mine for the diamonds why set up your own version of devil's island and savagely beat and kill the men br br eventually lorre gets what's his and the island's slaves are released unfortunately by then i really didn't care overall watchable but rather dumb lorre's career only took a turn for the better when he moved the following year to warner brothers with films like island of doomed men i could see why his stay at columbia was short
<START> i and a friend rented this movie we both found the movie soundtrack and production techniques to be lagging the movie's plot appeared to drag on throughout with little surprise in the ending we both agreed that the movie could have been compressed into roughly an hour giving it more suspense and moving plot
<START> i'm sorry but this movie is just way to shallow for me in it perez is a taxi dancer with boyfriend keitel trying to make it as an actress first of all what the hell is a taxi dancer even after sitting through this i still don't know oh yeah perez also inspires to follow her like a lovesick puppy there's no reason behind the love it just kind of happens there are times when the characters and events really try to pull at your heartstrings but it rarely works the only character you really do feel anything for or with is keitel's character and that's only because he does such a good job with it any other actor and the character would have been just like the others br br the script is basically an uninspired rehashing about how hard it is to make it as an actor actress it's been done and said before the language and dialog sounds like it was written by a street pimp the ending is well i don't want to spoil it let's just say it feels unsatisfying i'd be more upset if the story was any good to begin with the directing is average with nothing truly wonderful but nothing that is really painful to watch either to reiterate the acting the only one that does anything worth watching is keitel though i could have lived on without seeing him in tiger print bikini underwear br br oh yeah eddie bunker shows up as random as that mention is that's how random it is in the film and tarantino does his director buddy a favor by showing up for about 20 seconds
