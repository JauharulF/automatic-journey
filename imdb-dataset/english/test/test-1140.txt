<START> the movie invites comparisons to shakespeare the mandarin is beautifully written and spoken and the plot is intricate and intriguing never has gong li looked better never has the glory that is china been better represented on the screen the balance between political turmoil and personal intrigue that gladiator hinted at but never really delivered is here in spades simply incredible
<START> ho hum rich good looking kid gets in trouble poor girl falls in love with him jealous ex boyfriend causes tension yadda yadda i actually laughed out loud in many parts of this movie because the next scene was so predictable and just plain stupid as one scene moved on to the next i often found myself wondering just how we got there like i had skipped a few chapters in a book br br the script was pretty pitiful and didn't have me or my wife caring much about any of the characters except the jilted boyfriend now if the ex boyfriend had gotten an axe and hacked apart the girl and rich kid then then we would have a movie and all the stupid dialog and leaps in plot could be acceptable but since this movie attempts to be touching and totally misses the boat and ends up resorting to the romance equivalent of divine intervention to try and jerk a tear it just falls very very flat br br avoid this movie clip your toenails instead you will have more fun
<START> i watched the halloween episode oh my god i wanted to die the acting was just awful the lines were uttered with absolutely no conviction its a bad idea for a show as well i mean who would watch some web show like that in real life miranda cosgrove was great in a supporting role in drake and josh but doesn't have the force of character to anchor her own show i'm even more upset because her leaving is a major reason why drake and josh ended she was approached with her own show she jumped ship on drake and josh they then decided that maybe they would do a thing with drake and josh moving to college thereby explaining the loss of meagan as a character but drake had already had thoughts of moving on to bigger and better things and he figured if miranda did it why couldn't he the best part of the show was the theme song a catchy good tune in a mire of mediocrity of course drake bell was dubbing miranda's voice for the whole thing and wrote the tune
<START> i am left with little choice but to employ it at least once during the course of my review of among other things what defines pretension is in my opinion a lack of emotional sincerity on the author's part seems made with an all too contrived and self aware intent to be artistic symbolic spiritual provocative metaphorical mythical even but luckily for all true artists out there a predisposed formula to achieve artistic beauty and depth doesn't exist stunning natural locations yes these remote parts of southern italy look exotic even to most other italians pretty actors and some amusing gutsy spontaneous performances by a handful of attractive children won't elevate a substanceless movie beyond a pretty succession of images yet this insincere and vain and ultimately hollow movie to be art succeeding only to a very limited extent perhaps in some cases by accident i'll admit that the conceptually pompous ending does have a certain visual poetry to it however it's my belief that this was achieved in ways that had more to do with the beauty of the sea and the strong symbolic power of bathing and water connecting it to so much that's mythical mystical religious archetypical etc than with talent br br valeria golino is gratingly histrionic and affected in her performance as grazia for a mentally unstable woman from a humble and provincial background she sure has a fashionable wardrobe her flattering floral dresses and attractive sun kissed beach hair could have graced the pages of any vogue summer edition the fact she was a nutcase could in a way have been nothing but a fashionable addition to her trendy demeanour and look that's how skin deep her condition seemed to me two dimensional stereotype of the innocent natural child woman misunderstood and oppressed by her backward community was tiresome and irritating at worse while leaving me unmoved and indifferent at best i agree with the reviewer from london who wrote that mental illness is very badly served by cinema during the course of the entire movie we never really get a sense of illness and have no idea what is actually wrong with her other than her being a tiresome stereotype of a free spirit we don't know why she's given injections and is required to see a specialist in milan this generic way of writing mental illness is one of the main tell tale signs of the movie's overall shallowness br br another fairly insulting aspect of is the of its location i struggled to figure out whether this movie was supposed to be set in the present day or the past seeing as it aimed to make even an admittedly backward part of italy by comparison seem a dozen times and more conveniently primitive than it actually is again this smacks of shallowness and a complete lack of sincerity on part some non italian viewers will gleefully lap up the picturesque the clichÃ© of the possessive macho italian man as if it were common place so keen will they be to continue viewing my country as one culturally stranded sometime in the 1950s the question i'd like to ask david ferguson the reviewer from dallas texas is as follows is your country's mentality stuck in the 1950s no ok then why should mine be unfortunately for whoever still wishes to view italy in such an anachronistic way that aspect of is actually ridiculous and phoney even in the eyes of this italian viewer the subtly incestuous tension between grazia and her eldest son was as tiresome and predictable as fabrizio sexist but loving husband routine i especially loathed the scene in which grazia joins her husband and male friend in some man to man banter over a bottle of beer to her husband's macho embarrassment and displeasure according to this movie it isn't a woman's place to take part in a man's conversations ah but our loveable free spirit is too good for this place and doesn't understand the oppressive unwritten rules of patriarchy not only does this scene depict something so fake it should be enough on its own to discredit the entire movie's credibility it also completely gets the wrong end of the stick of the culture it strives to depict clearly showing that it was written without a clear understanding of the location or its population i would challenge anyone who knows contemporary italy to say otherwise br br for a truly accomplished contemporary italian filmmaker one who in my opinion deserves to be listed among the greats of italy's glorious cinematic past which alas isn't the shadow of its former self look no further than gianni especially and his latest la stella che non unlike most contemporary italian cinema sadly derivative and stagnant is a fresh and independently creative voice despite my scathing review of i am now more than willing to believe that latest now showing in italian cinemas will be a worthwhile one i therefore look forwards to enjoying it though it won't be overly shocking to me if i don't considering my feelings for
<START> this agreeably perverse and oddball early 80's teen body count flick may never reach the astonishingly bent pinnacle of the deeply unsettling and criminally underrated murderous moppets movie devil times five but it's still an above average killer kid opus nonetheless br br the slim but serviceable plot centers on a trio of misfit tykes two bratty boys and one creepily twinkle eyed albeit angelic looking little girl who are all born during a solar eclipse on june 9th 1970 when the strange antisocial trio who stick together in a tightly self contained and exclusive circle reach ten years of age they suddenly go homicidally bonkers and declare open season on the hapless unsuspecting local yokels of the heretofore sleepy and peaceful california suburb of meadowvale writer director ed hunt the usually incompetent unsung hack responsible for such wonderfully wretched clunkers as the delightfully dopey starship invasions the uproariously inane jesus christ vigilante parable alien warrior and the stunningly silly the brain does a pretty solid and capable job here the kill scenes are abundant and reasonably brutal the arrow through the eye gag is especially nasty there's a sizable smattering of gratuitous nudity and soft core sex a goodly amount of tension is neatly created and maintained some nice dollops of dark humor punctuate the arrestingly warped mayhem and the surprise grim ending manages to be truly jolting br br moreover the top drawer cast further elevates the proceedings to the perfectly watchable and absorbing jose as a small town doctor future jake and the tv series star joe penny as an amateur the prey 's lori as the plucky babysitter heroine susan strasberg as a bitchy school teacher american ninja 's michael dudikoff as a jock and cyril o'reilly the lonely misanthrope vampire in the hauntingly melancholy dance of the damned as a libidinous teen dude who gets bagged while doing just what you think with some naked hot chick in back of a parked van billy jacoby who went on to star in such late 80's direct to video dross as dr alien and andy freeman and especially the eerily adorable elizabeth hoy are genuinely creepy and convincing as the terrible of chillingly evil and amoral rugrats and yes that's none other than julie brown the brassy comedienne who scored a surprise top 40 hit with the hilarious novelty tune the homecoming queen's gotta gun as the lovely vacuous full breasted redhead bimbo who does a great lengthy totally extraneous yet still sizzling and much appreciated nude striptease while dancing in her bedroom to a cheesy blaring rock song all in all this baby sizes up as a sturdy and satisfying slasher item
<START> as a kid i grew up with the chintzy 60's tv series and no i'm not that pow however when director tim burton brought his novel vision to the silver screen i simply took an immediate shine to it and never backed away from favoring his installments over the much hyped latest additions 'batman and 'the dark which i don't really care for even if they're going for a much more grounded approach and wanting to explore bruce wayne batman psyche but in honesty i don't think there's all that much to tap in to i wanted crazy fun with a dark streak and in my eyes that's what burton brought across and this is the reason why i can watch them over and over again br br after wowing audiences with the 1989 'batman' thanks to the gothic art direction and jack nicholson take no prisoners performance of the camped up but psychotic joker burton would return 3 years later for the follow up and my favorite of the batman films so far 'batman camp but well done in what would fair up to being even more expansive louder dreary and nihilistic and having two villainous foes for the price of one enter the grotesque penguin with danny devito magnificently going out on a limb and the ravishing catwoman a steamy michelle pfeiffer who fills out the suit nicely coming to spoil party again batman an aptly brooding michael keaton is equally commendable and looks quite imposing in that bat look at the eyes plays second fiddle to the bad guys but i always preferred this sober interpretation of batman that gave him an ominously gloomy mystique but also a wearing psychological complexity that never felt the need to force feed and his turn of bruce wayne was well served too burton's atmospheric direction opens with his sleek gothic style an carnival comic book world filtered in with a splendid range of characters and vivid costumes the moody narrative in what probably is a tad too long is more so symbolic in its progression rather show piecing its spontaneously arresting and extravagant set pieces and sharply etched art direction covered with shadowy tinges and grey blue neon lighting of a wintry backdrop the magnetically free flowing camera work takes flight and danny elfman's stately spacious score balances the playfulness along with gloomy touches with a very hypnotic pull the rest of the performances might be overshadowed but christopher walken digs in his teeth into a glassy role of a two faced businessman max pat hingle is back but gets very little to do as commissioner james gordon and michael gough is delightful as alfred in solid support are michael murphy andrew vincent schiavelli doug jones and peter rubens also makes a cameo appearance
<START> the key scene in rodrigo garcia's nine lives comes when sissy spacek hidden away in a hotel room where she is carrying on an affair with aiden quinn find a nature documentary on television at which point quinn notes the contrivance of such things disparate footage is edited into one scene predators and preys are thrown together in order to capture the moment all to force connections where none actually exist characters in the nine shorts that make up this film occasionally spill over into each others stories but none of them ever seem to really connect a woman preparing for a violent confrontation with her abusive father is later seen working in a hospital room where another woman is preparing for a a man who runs into an old girlfriend in a supermarket and sees how his life should have been later hosts with his current wife a dinner party for an unhappy couple garcia arranges some of his characters in front of each other but none of the subsequent stories ever really build on what came before br br garcia's first film the wonderful overlooked things you can tell just by looking at her also had a short story structure and overlapping characters but there were fewer of them and they had a lot more room to breathe and grow the gimmicky premise of nine lives that each of its nine stories is told in a single unbroken take in real time never allows the film to build up any real dramatic tension or momentum it's also a fairly visually ugly movie interior shots are often murky and hard to watch while other scenes particularly one where a girl walks back and forth between rooms to talk to her uncommunicative parents are rendered annoying by the camera work given that this is garcia's third film and that he has a respectable history of directing for television the direction in this film is rather surprisingly amateurish like fellow filmmaker child of a great writer rebecca miller garcia son of gabriel garcia marquez is focused on the writing and character aspects of his films often to the detriment of the film making ones br br individual scenes are touching and even affecting i did like jason kissing robin wright penn's pregnant belly and joe mantegna whispering lovingly to his wife as she slips into pre surgery sedation and sissy spacek stealing a few happy moments away from her life with aiden quinn before brought back to it with a phone call from her daughter but the film unlike things you can tell just by looking at her feels more like an exercise than actual drama we are just watching people act
<START> this is a relatively watchable movie 1 after watching ultimate killing machine this one looks good in comparison there are no obvious technical gaffes although the vampiric teeth look odd br br the story line makes no sense let's see an american gi fights vampires comes back to the states and is rehabilitated for seeing vampires his commanding officer is the aunt of his ex wife who happens to be doing some research on the of the south american area where the vampires are huh don't pile on too many coincidences who cares about the head vampire or his daughter or any one in this film the only originality in this is that most of the myths about vampires allergic to crosses and garlic can't come out in the day etc are wrong but they can't be killed except by beheading or a wood wound in the heart yeah right it's obvious they just didn't want to film a dark movie since this is a made for tv film br br it would have been nice for the viewer if they had hired some actors oh they've got lynda carter tv's wonder woman and a big black dude with a tremendously deep voice who snarls appropriately in order to show off his vampire teeth prosthetics but otherwise you would never know they had actually paid people to read these lines br br there is more than enough fight scenes and some vampire biting neck blood but no real violence
<START> a poetic examination of the human condition performed without dialogue the anti hero the man builds a contraption to escape a band of marauders out of the of what was once a civilization to the ruins of the city to for his survival there he crosses with the brute brilliantly played by jean reno of the professional and mission impossible fame the man is rescued by a crazy old genius who lives in a fortress of his own design by using their wits the man and the old genius are able to keep the brute and his ilk at bay but they realise it is only a matter of time before their defenses are compromised so they make a break for it this is a strongly understated tale of the desparate struggle for life with excellent action scenes and clever humor of all of the movies of its kind like road warrior omega man and even ultimate warrior featuring yul as a buff knife fighter le dernier combat is the most artfully crafted copies of the video are hard to find i would give my left eye ball for one if your local art house ever has a revival of this film i heartily recommend that you break any engagement to able to be able to see it big
<START> i have to say its not very good polly bergen is fine in this film the rest are so so i'm gay and honestly there are so many clichÃ©'s for this time in history that its just sad we started watching it then turned it off then decided it would be fun to make fun of the rest of the film but all said the basic idea of the film is good if it was re written with less contrived lines and better acting it could have actually been prety good over all i would not recommend it in the this is coo coo thinking line is so lame on top of that the fight in the hair salon is funny because its so bad the lesbian sister in the room with them while they are trying to get it on is so weird its sad
<START> if you're a fan of the original ten commandments this movie will make you weep inside granted i'm only about 1 2 hour into it currently but it's so painful i felt it was my duty to warn away real ten commandments fans before they are subjected to this bastardization i didn't think it was possible to actually make the special effects worse than they were in 1950s when the original was shot but this 2006 remake proves me wrong i can forgive some lame special effects but the craptastic dialogue melodramatic lifetime movie style schlockiness and the stilted we are wax figures come to life acting makes me hope they'll rewrite the plot and drown moses in the red sea
<START> oh what the heck i'll reveal the secret this movie stinks br br yeah there are some nifty dinosaur effects that for their time were probably really exciting to watch now they don't cut it but they're not terrible they're just good enough to tolerate without being able to laugh at it so they just sit there and i sit watching this not laughing not excited just well bored it stinks br br if i can exercise my jay sherman for a moment the film really does the box promises cowboys versus dinosaurs and in very generic sense it delivers guys dressed like cowboys fight a couple of big dinosaurs but really these guys are a bunch of sissies and the hero is a loser more on this later and the dinosaurs are hardly intimidating the plot is a yawner and there isn't much technically wrong with it that's there to laugh at it's all just gray and bland br br after some dreadful night cinematography filmed in one and a half colors i called it we get the plot which involves some people doing stuff that was what i caught oh and they are at the turn of the century in mexico so they at least dress like cowboys even if they don't act like it br br so a bunch of these people who i think were human they go in the desert and they stumble on these dinosaurs after they find a miniature horse i don't know let's just move on then the movie degrades into a really pathetic king kong ripoff in the final act at that point i had lost the will to even keep my eyes at television level and i drifted in and out of consciousness br br the hero is played by the guy from beneath the planet of the apes who essentially played charlton heston's part when heston decided he didn't want to be in the sequel he was picked cause shock o' shocks he looks exactly like heston that's about all he has going for him i was really upset when he was the hero of the film cause all he does is glower bag the chick in the film who's named t j unfortunately she's not a prostitute or finally the origin of the name would have been revealed meanwhile his friend kills all the dinosaurs saves the day numerous times and what does he get for it not recognition no nothing and he dies sacrificing himself for his friends they don't even wait up for him while they escape br br boring long slowly paced with little to enjoy until the film decides to carbon copy king kong's script onto it's own it's best to avoid this film unless you enjoy pain on the scale of dropping an anvil on your eyeball
<START> if i were to pitch this movie idea to some hollywood bigwigs i'm sure it would sound like this br br me four boys at a private high school are good friends and they are witches br br hollywood that sounds like the craft br br me no no i said four boys not four girls br br hollywood that still sounds like the craft just with boys instead of girls br br me ok but there is this fifth unknown boy that comes into the picture and he wants more power br br hollywood still not much difference because one of the girls in the craft also wanted more power br br me ok ok i'll make these boys part of the in crowd they'll be rich and the school is on the east coast br br hollywood now that sounds original that is nothing like the craft here's a billion dollars br br this movie was so clichÃ© and uninspiring even the manufactured drama between chase and the brothers of was very blasÃ© a bunch of rich kids with their biggest problem being what color bentley they want for their 18th birthday and 18th car don't interest me at all even if they have powers every single kid in this movie looked like they stepped out of a magazine and of course there had to be the gratuitous male nudity and female 80 nudity just to drive home how out of shape you are i wanted to rename this movie the witches of o c oooh rich kids and their problems let me pretend to care br br this film was completely unimaginative and predictable the final fight was lame and dragged out and the ending was very anti climatic this was a movie best left on the cutting room floor
<START> oh yes i admit i have made myself guilty of the crime of seeing this piece of trash i can't say i was forced by aliens who pointed a gun at my head tied me to a chair and made it impossible for me to close my eyes and then turned this awful excuse for a movie on no i did it with free will i deliberately tortured myself let's go through the fact here folks the acting is an insult to humanity the plot if it exists is ridiculous the character development is horrendous the characters that appear in the movie are so clichÃ©d you would br br recognize them in your average comic book the editing is sloppy and unimaginative the camera work is low key the dialogue is simply the worst in cinematic history the directing well let's say i bet it wasn't hitchcock br br then to add to these facts there was absolutely no talent involved wath so ever the director must be smoking crack now to forgive himself for inflicting this poison to the world br br bottom line passport to paris is one of the worst movies ever made permanent
<START> this movie is a nonsense spoof comedy in the lines of the airplane or naked gun but it doesn't even come close to this two because it lacks originality and a little more intelligent jokes rather then just throwing you with the same old easy jokes br br you can figure out some references to other movies from the top of my head i identified dodgeball and rocky so you can have some fun with that trying to find out what movies are spoofed br br the movie also offers you an occasional laugh but nothing that can cause you injuries thus nothing really funny br br i liked the character ipod in some ways even though some of the jokes with him are standard comedy 101 br br i think this movie and like most of nonsense spoof comedy depends on the mood you are in so if you think you will laugh to any joke watch this movie if you are in a serious mood forget about this re watch the airplane instead it will definitely make you laugh
