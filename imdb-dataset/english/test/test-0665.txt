<START> the frozen limits is a big screen vehicle for the artists known as the crazy gang they were a group of british entertainers who formed in the early 1930s in the main the group's six men were bud allen jimmy teddy knox charlie naughton and jimmy gold hugely popular in the variety halls the group were also darlings of the then royal family the plot here sees them as the wonder boys troupe who set off to seek their fortunes in alaska after reading about a gold rush in the newspaper only problem is is that when they finally get to red gulch it turns out they are 40 years too late br br i often cringe when i see the statement it's very british because it implies that those not of the british isles may struggle to get it the reason it bothers me is because in this www internet age i have garnered a ream of non british film loving friends who have been known to split their sides at the best of ealing will hay and the imperious terry thomas so then is it true that something such as the frozen limits is unlikely to be appreciated by a non british audience well yes it's true so much here is british but really it has to be said that the classic movie fan is pretty well versed in history and when all is said and done the visual mirth here is universal with the anarchic not so wild west make over an absolute winner a winner that has every chance of being more appreciated by an american audience now than it will be by a british audience not all the comedy works and in truth the big 6 are trumped big time by a film stealing moore marriott but there are skits and parodies here that deserve respect and a nod of approval from more illustrious comedy acts you are unlikely to nearly fall off your chair like i did because of an gag but if you be a classic comedy film fan i feel sure that you will at the worst acknowledge there's some very talented people at work here br br now then dose the mounties always get their man 8 10

<START> as an avid fan of christian film and a person trying to maintain a keen eye for improvements in the realm of christian film making i was excited to get a chance to see this film i was ready to see something that would make a new mark in quality movies i was left disappointed br br the beginning scene is excellent though a slight rip off of leon the professional on the angle it showcases some great cinematography in the early goings everything after that was pretty much downhill br br i was barely able to sit through this one i was tempted multiple times just to shut it off br br the acting while quite possibly sincere was incredibly awful but then again the heart of the problem was the screenplay itself the dialog was worse than anything i have ever seen and even my amateurish screenplay the awakening soon to be an independent film looked like a hitchcock thriller next to this which isn't saying much the bright side of this film is that it was filmed on sony's brand new high definition 900 cameras shooting in this film and star wars attack of the clones were the first movies ever to use these new technology cameras that year unfortunately the camera's performance seemed to be wasted with bad lighting poor angles and awkward handling br br the only good feeling i got coming out of watching this movie was how good my rookie indie film is going to look next to it 4 10
<START> this movie just seemed to lack direction the plot developed so many twists in such a short amount of time that it seemed to lose any semblance of what the true storyline was there was a lot of wasted dialogue and just seemed like the writing was rushed and a little too wandering the exorcism scenes and possession story began to take a back seat to the character's back stories which were a little weak to begin with br br all in all i would say skip it unless you have rented out the rest of the horror section at your local video store and you have a jones for a movie you haven't seen before you're much better off just watching the exorcist or the exorcism of emily rose
<START> i have just watched this latest version of macbeth and was pleasantly surprised with the solid acting and obvious effort that had to turn a low budget historical piece into a fully fledged watchable movie br br one note however the music was very lame and added nothing to the intensity of the film and sounded like someone with a keyboard and a bunch of as opposed to a full orchestral score i think paul needs to get his act together
<START> my wife received tickets for our family to attend the premier of this movie from her employer for free i only regret the price of the popcorn and the two hours of my life wasted on this garbage film br br i own the dvd of the original mask and quite enjoyed it i expected a remake nowhere near the original in production values or writing but wasn't prepared for this vulgar pile of trash weak acting poor plot a bad cgi baby passing gas and urinating in hyper mask mode a woman turned into a giant nose spewing fun huh my eight year old son loves movies like lord of the rings harry potter and star wars after this was over i asked him what he thought his exact words i hated it it's like the scooby doo movie they take something good and have to put all that gross stuff in my twelve year old daughter and wife hated it as well my wife later told me that my son her twice during it if we could leave he's never done that before i'm proud of him lest you think i'm some kind of puritan from the groans and lack of laughter i heard in the theater i think most of the patrons agreed with me br br this film represents everything bad about children's entertainment today and any positive reviews must be from people financially connected with the film
<START> the emergence of quentin tarantino and his dubious influence on the likes of guy ritchie may have triggered the wave of appalling british gangster flicks we've been bequeathed over the past few years but one of our most famous acting exports only serves to perpetuate the cycle by lending his considerable name to trash like this i only wish he'd taken a moment to consider before choosing this project for the same reasons of personal gain he admits he often employs it's not only stifling his talent but possibly the promise of future originality from british films br br not one of this film's characters are likeable or even remotely realistic and the dialogue consists of the usual empty threats and colourful language caine doesn't give the material any more effort than it deserves either if this was meant to be in the style of a tragic fall from grace a la king lear it would've helped immensely had i cared about the ultimate fate of the principals instead of just wishing that they'd get mired in the quicksand of life and dragged under almost immediately br br
<START> directed by the younger brother of great director leo mccarey this is a pretty good short from the three stooges nominated for an academy award here the stooges are doctors named doctor howard doctor fine and doctor howard they are not the brightest doctors but they get the benefit of the doubt as long as they handle for duty and humanity br br i liked this short it is not one of their best but some moments are hilarious though one joke that is repeated more than once works every time the part where they must operate the hospital's boss is terrific to say more would spoil some of the jokes so you must see it for yourself just another fine short from the three stooges
<START> one of the worse gay related movies i have ever seen since these are not characters in this story it's hard to comment on the actual film therefore since colton ford aka glen laid his life open for all to see i guess he's fair game to criticize and that's not hard to do here goes 50 something glen is a big time porn star who wants fame and fortune as a big time singer i guess 11 films makes him a star being gay and forty i have seen porno and i did not recognize him or his lover personally they all look the same to me with different hair styles face it guys he's no jeff stryker jim or casey that's ok though the purpose of these films takes place in about 6 5 minutes so they all pretty much have the same requirements if you know what i mean br br so glen wants to be a serious legit singer after he dumps the porno industry but he can't get anyone to take him seriously i wonder why was he so stupid to think that he could whitewash taking his clothes off and having sex on film and according to the film it's not just porn flicks he indulges in it's living in a house with other stars where people can hook into their bedroom the bathroom and where ever via it's 500 dollars an hour to entertain at a private party strip gigs at clothing optional hotels doing something called meth which i presume is a drug and then you have the balls to get angry when someone at a club gig tries to touch you because he's legit now oy br br the only interesting non cardboard character is the academy award winning gay screen writer who wouldn't give his name and considering this is a documentary well porn is as porn does you can tell he's most amused by the dumb bunny porn star br br glen has one hyper nellie manager kyle who wants to him as a porno participant in hopes of getting him gay club gigs he tries to do the routine wear this don't smile say this in what amounts to controlling issues but our anti hero will not be controlled or told what to do that's the first mistake i'm not saying kyle was right but if any budding singer starts questioning the manager they're not going to get far kind of like he who is his own lawyer has a fool for a client br br all of this wouldn't have been bad if it weren't for one small tiny bit of information drum roll please he's bad he sucks his singing talent ranks up there with ashlee simpson it's hard to root for someone who while trying make his dream come true at 50 doesn't work like normal people no job can you say lazy ass and the whining and the why don't they accept me song and dance and after a few months of scraping the surface of the music industry he spouts off why don't i have a record deal by now what actors are waiters writers work in low level newspapers or mags whatever this guy is above that it's true he wants his success now merely because he decided he wanted it whine whine whine his lover leaves him to return to nursing but i tell ya i wouldn't want that moron dispensing medical care to me both of them were useless airheads the movie is useless unless you really like whine and people stay away do not waste your money on the crappy lives of useless people there are far more interesting things stuck to the bottom of your shoe
<START> this has got to be the worst steven segal movie i have ever watched even worse than eco piffle like on deadly ground fire down below i'll start with the good points it's got stylish direction for a dtv movie and has wonderful that's it the story dosen't really go anywhere it's just an array of well staged set pieces just so seagal go shoot bad guys the body count can easily match tarantino at his bloodiest the plot is needlessly complicated and confusing you forget who the good and bad guys are the acting i use the term loosely is mediocre at best seagal's usual one constipated expression and wooden acting i can take but the others especially the brits were down right terrible br br what's in the package why are bad guys after it is seagal being set up br br who gives a s br br when i rented this movie at my local blockbuster once i'd paid the assistant laughed at me and said it was the worst movie in the shop i could have picked i felt like punching him till my arm went numb br br anyway i haven't seen half past dead or out for a kill yet and i go back for more humiliation at my store but they can't be than this turkey br br the soundtrack is supposed to be young and hip it just gave me a urge for half a dozen br br all in all this is seagal at his worst the guy who's gained about and looks well past it he's a guy who just doesn't no when to stop he should retire gracefully now and have a go behind the camera or become a martial arts teacher or something br br my rating 2 10 1 point for scenery
<START> this movie can best be described as a very long episode of a very bad sitcom how many vaguely humorous misunderstandings can you cram into just one movie notes are misplaced bags are switched conversations are misheard people get mixed up situations are misinterpreted and somewhere along the line people are supposed to laugh about something the writers are really struggling to keep everything going which makes the dialogues feel really forced if anyone in this movie acted like a real person all this would be resolved in around two minutes or so and everyone could go back to their lives but they have to keep the misunderstandings going at times this movie also tries to go for some juvenile laughs but all those do is remember you about how funny american pie was the scene with the nerd telling the hooker who he thinks is a foreign exchange student to eat his sausage goes on forever not one second of it is funny i've got to give this movie some credit though because of the subplot about stolen money it's not as boring as it could have been it also has a laugh here and there but then sadly goes back to yet another character misunderstanding stuff overall this movie is just way too lame
<START> if you're ok with the outlandish work of italy's premier horror to accept his outrageous story lines and flamboyant you should have a great time with opera if you don't then you won't br br cristina plays betty a beautiful young opera who is given a shot at fame in an avant garde production of macbeth when the star of the show is hit by a car as any thesp who has the will know macbeth is a production that carries a betty soon discovers that the show in which she is now the star is no exception a killer is systematically offing the staff at the poor betty is forced to watch by the sadistic murderer who tapes needles under her eyes to prevent her from closing them br br with the help of a little girl who crawls through her air conditioning ducts her director and agent and a few ravens who have seen the murderer's face betty discovers the killer's identity and the truth about her mysterious past br br let's face it opera is one crazy film with its preposterous plot turns convoluted death scenes and an ending that beggars belief and whilst director dario argento has never been one for shall we say conventional story lines this particular giallo is so daft and features so many of his trademark stylish touches all ramped up to the max that it's almost as if with each successive film he is seeing what he can get away with at times almost parodying his earlier work br br this is exactly why i find the film such fun br br argento's camera movements are absolutely incredible gliding creeping and in one amazing scene even swooping around the opera house above the audience the power of verdi's music is combined perfectly with the synth majesty of claudio simonetti's score providing a suitably grandiose accompaniment to the sumptuous visuals and several outstanding set pieces featuring sergio nauseating gore fx go to prove that no one does death better than argento check out one character's stunning demise in which a bullet passes through a spy hole in a door in slow motion and straight into their eye br br 7 5 out of 10 rounded up to 8 for imdb
<START> free stupidest name title ever is the worst episode of any of the tv shows i watch which includes x files alias all 3 law and orders all of the family guy simpsons chappelle's show colbert report and more south park was for very long my favorite of the comedy shows because of it's shockingly obscene content and disturbing black comedy free has none of the content i mentioned earlier it was so tame so it might has well been an episode of sesame street kyle goes to sea world where a few of the workers play a prank on him making him think a whale is talking to him he befriends the whale actually befriends it hello this is south park the same show that brought you cancelled it hits the fan death camp of tolerance and so many more not spongebob squarepants ugh i actually watched the whole episode which is 30 minutes of my life i will never get back anyhow i was extremely disgusted with this episode and i can't believe the shocking decline in the quality of matt work
<START> like many a child born in the 1980's i grew up on the mel brooks films that weren't necessarily the ones like blazing saddles and history of the world part 1 i saw those of course though not as frequently as now but the ones meant for the whole family spaceballs and this film i knew at the time i wasn't seeing great art but just a campy goofy though always laugh worthy take on robin hood and or adventure movies but calling it a family movie in quotes means that a adults really can enjoy it as much as kids if not more because of the little in jokes and silly vulgarities and b once a kid sees it when he revisits it as i have a few times it's still as fresh but with some things not quite understood the first time around it's a comedy that is not only filled with jokes at robin hood movies and other movies godfather of course as well as little mentions for other movies of modern times but one that references brooks's own movies as well this is a filmmaker who isn't above poking fun at even his own style br br basic story robin hood cary elwes in one of his best turns returns home from the crusades to see things are in peril with king richard gone and so goes forth to reclaim his land and to naturally rob the rich to feed the poor along the way he meets dave butts heads with prince john richard lewis and the sheriff and of course still pines for the love of maid marian this of course is the usual clothesline for brooks to let the comedy run off into the scenes and while sometimes a joke may not work or might become stale on a repeat viewing so much of it sticks that it's hard not to chuckle it also helps that a couple of bits are some of the best in any such as the godfather bit dom delouise at his very best brooks's own cameo as the lewis and chappelle's acting turns and an endless slew of quotable lines and a couple of tongue in cheek songs some of it is obvious yes some of it just takes right from the pages of blazing saddles sure but is it a good time for the right crowd definitely and for parents who grew up on the 70's brooks work it is a fantastic way to introduce the young ones to his work through this even the suggestive sex jokes and such are not r rated all in good fun
<START> first off i'm a huge bronson fan have been since the late '70s i watched every film he made on the big screen since love and bullets which ironically was the beginning of his end as a big name hollywood blockbuster star br br i kept hoping that things would turn around for him that he would make a really good film in the '80s but that never happened and i don't know what he was thinking when he signed with cheapjack studio cannon and hack director j lee thompson for most of his latter films br br assasination gave me some hopes when i saw that peter hunt was directing instead of thompson but those hopes were quickly dashed first off the film looks incredibly cheap like it was made for about 3 mil minus bronson's inflated salary i heard he insisted on 5 mil per picture which is probably more than the rest of the budget for all his cannon films the white house scenes were filmed on the va grounds in west la i was taking the bus when they were shooting nice job on recreating the white house but did no one think about getting the palm trees out of the shots guess not br br secondly the supporting cast is really bad ireland was dying of cancer and despite this she's not bad but the horrible asian woman playing bronson's sidekick was typical of cannon's talent at the time non existent i would be real curious to learn how she got this role i can't imagine a worse actress for the part plus she's a good 40 years younger than bronson the story is not that bad and it's something that bigger and better budgeted studios did later eastwood's in the line of fire and costner's bodyguard film but the way it's staged here is really sad i'm wondering if they could not afford to do more than one or two takes per shot none of it is believable in the slightest if secret service men really behaved like the keystone cops in this movie we'd have presidents rotating out of office and out of life every few months
