<START> tromeo and juliet is perhaps the best shakespeare modernization i have ever seen not that there's much competition but anyway br br all in all tromeo and juliet is definitely one of troma's better movies one of the little pearls hidden in a towering heap of dung it's a funny action packed gory take on the world's greatest love story but still manages to follow the original story as faithfully as one can except from this kind of movie well except for the ending where tromeo and juliet kill abusive father and live happily together in a sunny suburban area for the rest of their lives with their hideously mutated children br br this is the movie high school literature classes should show instead of making poor students read through hundreds and hundreds of pages of shakespeare's scripts thumbs up
<START> this film is essentially for those who have had little or no introduction to hip hop specifically as was the case with the director before he started this film it was cool to have it focus on the bay more than expected because ny is always getting all the credit but from the bay the q bert worship is a little out of control this film didn't introduce anything new to me but it did change my opinion in that going into it i was sketchy about the prospect of giving the tables the distinction of being a bona fide instrument this film ought to convince anyone that it's right up there with the viola and clavichord
<START> rising is a documentary about the slums of rio the favelas specifically the most violent one according to this film a lot more kids have died violently in favelas over the last decade or so than in israel palestine during the same period a fact astonishing if true which shows how under recognized this social problem is in the rest of the world this is an important topic especially for those who see hope in grassroots efforts to marshal the and most at risk through a vibrant cultural program this is a compelling documentary if occasionally marred by a somewhat too personality based version of events and by grainy digital video and film that sometimes may make you think you need to have your eyes examined br br drug lords rule in the favelas and gun toting teenage boys are the main drug dealers like in parts of colombia fernando movie city of god de deus has been accused of celebrating violence de deus is another of many favelas but the early section of rising shows that in fact boys do celebrate violence and want to deal drugs where the money and the action are it's cool to carry a gun there cool to work as a drug trafficker it's fifty times more profitable than the earnings available by other means br br first discovered the movement and its leaders anderson and josÃ© junior while visiting rio for a conference and quickly persuaded his friend and mentor zimbalist to quit his job and come down to help make a film with his own promise to fund it eloquence and charisma and a startling twist in his life make him the center of the film and its chief narrator but like the favelas themselves the film teems with other people no doubt about the fact that is a remarkable leader organizer and artist br br is compared to bosnia shooting there was very dangerous anderson friendship and protection and caution and diplomacy in the shooting enabled the filmmakers to gain access and shoot detailed footage of their subject matters while mostly there were close calls avoiding any serious confrontations with drug lords or drug dealing cops they also trained boys to use cameras and left them there on trips home that resulted in 10 of the footage including rare shots of violent incidents including police beatings it's hard for an outsider to keep track of police massacres in rio there was one in the early 1990's that looms over the story and inspired who ended his own early involvement in drug trafficking to lead his cultural movement the cops are all over the drug trade and if anybody doesn't like that the ill trained police paramilitaries come in often wearing black ski masks and shoot up a neighborhood killing a lot of innocents br br this is pretty much the picture we get in city of god except that this time junior and the other guys come in starting in but spreading out eventually to a number of other favelas to give percussion classes that attract dozens of youth girls as well as boys their cultural or program formed in 1993 is a new alternative way of life for young black men in the rio ghettos it leads them to leave behind smoking alcohol and drugs that's the rule to explode into rap song percussion and gymnastics in expressive galvanic performances eventually the best of the performers led by wind up appearing before big local audiences with local producers and their has an international recording contract br br other centers and groups have been created by or through the over the years in and other favelas to seek the betterment of youth by providing training and staging performances of music theater hiphop and dance at centers br br the performance arts aren't everything just the focal point is also a movement for broader social change gathering public awareness through such performances the centers also provide training in information newspaper radio internet e mail links hygiene and sex education to seek to bridge gaps between rich and poor black and white and to offer workshops in audio visual work including production of documentaries the program is currently active in four other favelas br br there are many scenes of street and home life in rising and they look very much like the images in city of god with the important difference that the focus and outcome are very very much more positive not that it isn't an uphill battle and the corruption of the police the inequities of the social system and the indifference of the general population of brazil are not directly addressed by any of this but there's a scene where talks to some young kids in another cynical boys not enthusiastic about and determined to work in the drug trade as himself did as a boy doesn't seem to be convincing any of them despite pointing out that traffickers don't make it to the age of fifty but we learn that the most negative boy in this group richard morales joined the movement five months later there's also the account of a freak accident that disabled but with a positive outcome br br it would be great if the images were sharper and clearer and if the story were edited down a little but this is vibrant inspiring material and represents committed risk taking documentary film making and it's nice that rising has been included in seven film festivals and won a number of awards including best new documentary filmmaker at the tribeca film festival it's currently being shown at the institute of contemporary arts in london however a wide art house audience in the us seems somewhat unlikely br br included in the 2006
<START> this movie should have come with a disclaimer that it was akin to the left behind series i did not know it would be a bible thumping movie i expected it to truly be a movie about ufos and alien abduction for entertainment's sake as previous reviewer comments it would be fine to show at a church but not at a public theater at least not without the prior knowledge of what the premise of the movie is about i felt deceived out of my spent for this movie as nothing in the summary refers to its religious overtones if you go to church it'll probably be shown there for free some time other than the cover up of its true subject matter the movie was fine as far as acting and script were concerned but i have to say i walked out an hour into the movie when i saw what direction it was headed and that i was not going to be entertained but preached to
<START> i knew little of this movie when i entered the theatre for an advance screening i gathered from the ads that it was a thriller br br what we have is like compulsion meets matlock two teens decide to commit a perfect murder a victim is selected at random and then carefully executed so that no traces of the actual murderers is found then a bunch of false leads are planted that point to an innocent bystander innocent of the murder anyway br br enter sondra bullock as the investigating officer imdb says that she's fbi but i don't remember that i thought that she was a regular cop she's frustrated by the inconsistency of the killers profile the profile doesn't fit the profile and by the power and influence of the father of one of the boys br br she's also has demons of her own which figure prominently in her to become a cop but this is the only character that is really more than one dimensional all others are pretty flat br br for a thriller there are really no big thrills it's mostly a cat and mouse game like an episode of matlock which she's watching at one point in the film the twist is that there are two involved in the killing just who is the real murderer justin or richard it'll cost you eight bucks to find out
<START> this is breezy highly entertaining drama with an excellent cast garfield is fine as a boxer hiding from the police with that motley crew the dead end kids most notable of these is the beautiful billy halop who has some very moving moments gloria dickson who in real life died very young in a house fire is strong and very attractive as sister and in the early scenes ann sheridan on the brink of stardom is a knock out may robson is very funny as a crusty old granny but claude rains proves here that even a great actor can flounder if mis cast whoever thought of casting him as a tough new york cop br br busby berkeley proves here that he was a fine director with or without musical numbers the film moves at a terrific pace and the water tower sequence is very suspenseful and well photographed the ending is contrived and the plot nothing startling or original but i still found this a highly enjoyable experience
<START> first let me review the movie this movie creeps me out and i don't even believe in aliens however the movie has its flaws br br there are three acts to this movie act one is perfect it sets up the movie and really builds up the creep factor i must say the score is great everything is set up and it's set up perfectly br br act two begins when jillian playing sherry burton goes to the shrink they hypnotize her and she recalls the abduction act two ruins the film when the aliens show up screaming mad george did the effects for the aliens i must say they did a good job except with their depiction of the gray aliens no offense but the grays looked like door prizes br br on a side note i liked how they treated hypnosis in acts one and two if you paid attention you would notice that the husband and wife had two different memories in the husband's version of events the blue light zaps them and his wife says somebody's here or something like it it makes sense the husband is concerned for his wife someone may hurt her that's his issue however in her version of events she says help me she does not say somebody's here this also makes sense the aliens are after her wanting her husband to help and save her is her issue now back to the film br br act three turns the film into a gore fest it begins with a strange procedure it's a typical gore fest but it does have a surprise ending i won't ruin it because it's actually an interesting development br br the dvd and commentaries takes itself too seriously but if you think wilford brimley saying horsesh is funny you might want to check it out in the cast interviews section now on to my praise of jillian br br i could only hope jillian will read this i had never seen her before but wow what a performance let me tell the rest of you this first of all this is supposed to be a serious film the details i will now describe may sound campy and fun like humanoids from the deep 1980 but it really isn't got that okay br br jillian is hot naturally good looking she is naked for a lot of the film a good thing unfortunately she is usually being assaulted terrorized and raped a very bad thing however she must act in a lot of this film naked she gets points for overcoming that she has to act happy sad horny afraid and physically hurt all in the span of a few moments the turnaround of emotion is astounding she has to cheer for joy when she learns she's pregnant she has to scream in terror when the aliens take out her guts she has to act very angry when her husband suggests that the baby isn't his she has to act like she's in denial saying nothing is wrong with her baby when her husband says otherwise a denial i should note that is really forced upon her by the aliens controlling her i am talking oscar caliber performance here br br then there is the rape scene it's disturbing but since it's just some rubber alien it's not too bad in this scene the alien is not a gray alien so i will describe it the alien has tentacles and it's kind of like a table jillian is on the table like part restrained by the tentacles by her head is the alien's head the alien's head is long and it flips down so that its head is now above legs then the alien's hey comes out of his forehead it's forehead sounds pretty campy right well jillian plays it straight and she pulls it off she has to act like an alien with its hey coming from its forehead is raping her and she pulls it off it's a very intense scene but that's not what makes it you see this scene is done in a flashback what makes the scene is performance recalling these events she is just lying in a hospital bed under hypnosis recalling the alien abduction but her acting here is more intense than the actual rape scene how many actors can pull off a performance in a scene that describes a rape that is more intense than the scene with the rape not many however jillian does it br br i could go on and on jillian if you ever read this i want you to know that i name withheld alias of 1 believe you are the best actress ever you are the best actress ever i could only hope you read this and take it with you always br br as for everyone else progeny 1999 is an okay to good film i would recommend it
<START> lackawanna so emotionally powerful in its portrayal of urban blacks during the 50s and early 60s a culture of joy and sadness specific to working class blacks that existed outside the mainstream culture the characters of santiago hudson's play depicted black individuals who lived imperfect lives but maintained strong positive values of love loyalty and honor although the characters moved away from those values at times they did not deny the importance of the values instead they recognized and accepted their own imperfection and those of the other characters without judgment that passed through the life of nanny the central characters were strong and believable the settings were realistic and brought back personal memories of a by gone era pre integration urban life was a time of sensory intoxication sight sound and smell that could almost be experienced by watching the drama lackawanna blues unfold i will watch it again and again
<START> true this is not john sayles finest film brother from another planet but it is not entirely forgettable either if not for any other reason than its message like batman wild thing's parents were murdered in front of him leaving him to fend for himself in 'the zone ' a corrupt section of an unnamed city where greed and violence reign supreme instead of falling in with the likes of chopper robert davi wild thing fights for justice using his powers of tai chi and eerie cat impressions occasionally lighting himself on fire he becomes something of an urban legend a modern day robin hood and a hero for the ages 1987 at its finest wild thing lives
<START> i like christophe lambert as an actor he has played in several good movies highlander subway greystoke but i can't even think he has played in that movie the story is nearly nothing the special effects are very bad and the actors also to resume the movie i have only one thing to say it's the first time that i go to watch a movie and want to leave after 10 minutes
<START> wow after seeing this film you will know why america's youth continues to lack intelligence and any traits to contribute to the wellbeing of society except for making themselves more inept to function br br jackass number two stars some of the most people imaginable who at there core lack any sort of talent or brains to make anything of themselves especially bam and steve o and there only option for fame was to make a living entertaining those as stupid as them by harming there being a guy drinking horse semen just flat disgusting a man putting a fish hook through his cheek and acting as bait for sharks this isn't humor it's evidence for him br br overall i walked out of the theater with no hope for mankind
<START> this has no relationship to virtual encounters 1 so it's not really a sequel the two videos just share the general concept of people having simulated sex through a virtual reality machine so if you were really blown away by the story and dialog in vc 1 yeah right and expecting a continuation in vc 2 just be warned all the actors and actresses are new but it has the same excellent director sybil richards br br but like vc 1 you get lots of beautiful women and a lot of great sex scenes that push the envelope of soft core just about as far as it can go br br if you have vc 1 and you liked it you'll like vc 2 if you don't have either but like really good softcore sex get both
<START> this is an enjoyable project that is not a film as the title suggests good performance by nadia who re enacts the role of grace i follows the re enactment of what happens to mike and grace in new york city she leaves but he wants to get in contact with her this project is his way of trying to getting in touch with her br br i saw it on ifc i have heard that it will be released on dvd as well i do like this trend of more independent projects this is an example of a good project br br i hope that he finds her br br take a look and be entertained br br
<START> sayles had a very interesting film on his hands with silver city however it somehow became very muddied as it progressed from beginning to end chris cooper did an exceptional job embodying the essence of his character a of sorts but he wasn't nearly given enough screen time instead we find ourselves on a rampage with a character that felt less personal less developed and overall too confusing the path that this danny huston leads us on inevitably becomes the downfall of the film too many characters are introduced to us in such a short time these characters randomly were involved with the progression of the plot which became too convoluted with each passing minute sayles knew what he was creating i just feel as if it wasn't being translated well to the silver screen br br sayles is a master of his trade his films continue to inspire and evoke thought even if they are not commercial successes the trouble with silver city is that i think he found himself going too deep with not enough money or time to explain it all at the beginning of the film i had an idea of what was happening but as more and more characters were introduced as more and more plot twists tried to occur i lost the sense of the film by the ending while the ending was very clever and very dark i needed more explanation i think some of the reason that i lost my train of thought with this film was due to the casting of danny huston as our guide he was pathetic i didn't seem him as very exciting person to lead us on this adventure he seemed to go through the motions but not really accomplish much at all this was the first downfall of important film br br while i will admit that the characters played by richard dreyfuss miguel ferrer james gammon and daryl hannah were interesting i just needed a better guide to help me understand their roles in this political scandal danny huston just did not cut it for me outside of the characters sayles needed a stronger script i sometimes felt that unless i was deeply rooted in the political world some of the references were well over my head the entire reasoning for silver city to be built and the corruption behind it eluded me i am a simpleton that loves advanced films but this one just didn't make much sense to me there were several times that i found myself asking why instead of seeing the whole picture i felt as if the individual stories were as clear as glass yet the whole picture was dusty and murky at the same time sayles needed to concentrate more on the bigger picture instead of these smaller issues which ultimately fogged this film br br perhaps i went into this film with the wrong idea i was expecting to see another version of primary colors but instead witnessed something less heartfelt and more technical without giving the ending away i thought that the final scene was one of the most beautiful moments in political cinema history the brilliant symbolism has stayed in my mind for the past two days after watching this film while the rest of the movie quickly shuffled away from my mind maybe a second viewing would do better for me but for some odd reason silver city just didn't click with me there seemed to be too many loopholes that were never explained or accounted for an ensemble piece is always good with me but when the characters are introduced without explanation it just looses steam this was one of those rare occasions br br overall i was very upset with this film being very democrat i wanted to see a side of politics that i wasn't aware of and another side that would make you chuckle i wanted to be engulfed with the world of corporate money and the that are elected i wanted intelligent humor framed by the words of george w but instead all i found was a very confusing story aimed at a certain audience of which i will never be a part sad this picture had so much wasted promise br br grade out of
<START> the idea of bringing dracula to contemporary times isn't bad after all it might revive the series a bit by injecting a new story element into a series that hammer has all but exhausted in a long series of generally excellent movies however because the present day turned out to be the crappy early 1970s the results were pretty silly and looked more like love at first bite a deliberate comedy seeing christopher lee in a film filled with 70s hip lingo and electric guitar chords and laughable rock music just seemed beyond stupid to make matters worse the acting is much more over the top here with an intense and silly performance by johnny alucard i also thought it was really funny that it took van helsing's grandson to notice that alucard is dracula spelled backwards no one else figured this out for themselves wow what cunning br br so because so much of the movie was bad why did it still earn an almost respectable score of 4 well when the story came to the expected showdown between van helsing peter cushing and drac christopher lee it was exciting and ended very well additionally and i know this will sound very sexist but if i had to watch a bad film at least stephanie character wore some really nice outfits that revealed her ample talents so to speak so at least it was a pretty film to watch br br by the way the film ends with the phrase may he rest in final peace at the end though this was not the final hammer dracula film with lee he returned for the satanic rites of dracula just a short time later and it was in many ways even worse than this dud of a monster film
