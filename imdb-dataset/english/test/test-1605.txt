<START> easily one of the best indian films ever granted that's not saying much i made this conclusion after a whopping 15 minutes of watching but i can truly say that fire is also one of the really beautiful and brilliant films i've seen br br beautiful because of its imagery the best example i can give is the parallelism between the 2 female leads radha and sita and the characters of the same name in hindu mythology sita for example is the wife of the revered lord ram as legend goes ram subjugates his wife by making her walk through a fire to prove her purity ' sita in response cries and leaves him reuniting with her mother the earth this story has all sort of crazy links to the stories of the 2 indian women nandita das and shabana azmi the word fire' all of a sudden has many meanings marriage tradition religion motherhood and probably a few others i didn't catch br br brilliant because of its social overtones many who were offended by the premise for this movie should in fact be first to see fire e g my mom who actually loved it why because although fire is an attack on tradition it is also an attack on tradition in other words that is its strength not its weakness traditional conservative social mores whether indian or canadian or american or whatever are useless if they enslave you gender roles and self denial can both do this br br these are the things i took with me after seeing fire hats off to deepa
<START> in 1850 in yorkshire a boy chimney sweep is falsely accused of theft by his crooked master and runs away he falls into a treacherous local river and is transported into an underwater realm where he makes many friends and rescues the mythical water babies from an evil shark br br based on a book by charles kingsley this is a lovely children's film half live action and half animation which is both a grim and evocative depiction of victorian times and a terrifically enjoyable undersea adventure it really is two films in one which somehow complement each other and combine into a much richer whole the animation by tony cuthbert jack and is wonderful as is the photography by ted and the music by phil coulter and bill martin has a great rough diamond quality as the literal fish out of water i love the moment when he's on top of the mansion sees all the chimneys and shouts blimey at the top of his voice mason and cribbins are the filthiest nastiest bullies you could hope to see in a costume drama if you want to see real victorian values don't watch sense and sensibility watch this and whitelaw pertwee who does umpteen voices and percival are all excellent this is how a good children's movie should be good old fun but also just a little bit thoughtful sad and frightening high
<START> this is easily the best of the summer camp movies in fact few of the others are even fair let alone anywhere near as entertaining as this one is br br the film is just simply out to have some good clean fun many people who went to summer camp as kids will see that it is presented here faithfully to the way it usually was but with slapstick comedy mixed in bill murray as the chief counselor of the camp leads a fine ensemble cast and is usually at the center of the riotous nonsense has great one liners throughout usually broadcasting his jokes as pseudo announcements over the camp's public address system br br several great supporting actors played the campers and counselors to build a myriad of fun and interesting subplots all the while sprinkled amongst the many incidents of camp hi jinx spaz jack blum and fink keith knight were two characters particularly well done the adventures and misadventures of these two are hilarious each has classic lines and they are characters you like and root for look for spaz in the scene of disco dance pandemonium br br the girls in the story are realistic characters too they're not dumb naive freakish oversexed nervy or any of the other overused abominable teen character stereotypes kristine debell kate lynch cindy and others make these characters believable br br the requisite pranks abound usually at the expense of camp director morty harvey the nature of these pranks start at outrageous and progress from there however with all the silliness going on and the others have their serious sides for example befriends a shy lonely kid rudy chris makepeace and takes him under his wing br br the story culminates with a sports competition against a rival camp it's a great root for the underdogs finale when the chips are down motivational it just doesn't matter spiel is inspired and one of the best moments in the movie and get ready to root spaz spaz spaz
<START> ok with this film there are a number of ingredients at work br br first put in loads of hillbilly truckers good ole boys who have secret desire to take law into own hands second put in evil hillbilly cops controlled by a texas bred outlaw third put in karate fighting trucker played by chuck norris fourth put in a chump teenager as norris's nephew captured by evil hillbilly cops fifth show chuck norris fighting in slow motion br br now mix all together and what have you got br br you guessed it one very mediocre movie
<START> just saw it at as closing film of austin film festival going in a had seen a few snippets of their act at alamo and thought the trailer was amusing but i wasn't expecting such an epic theme music and the use of tarot cards is genius in the title sequence watch out for cameos from ben stiller and tim robbins and the dark lord himself who has a fetish for so much over the top fun and the songs are so catchy the car chase was by far my favorite scene i know this will earn cult status right away and win over some new tenacious d fans just like me i hope this does well in the theaters follow me we are the shadows
<START> crossfire is remembered not so much for the fact that its three stars all had the first name robert but as being one of the first hollywood films to deal with anti semitism br br the story opens with the murder in silhouette of a man whom we later learn is a jewish man named joseph sam levene pipe smoking police captain finlay robert young is assigned to the case an ex soldier montgomery robert ryan comes upon the murder scene and we learn through flashback that he had met in a bar along with other soldiers who were in the process of being mustered out of the service following wwii br br according to montgomery he and pal floyd bowers steve brodie had followed and cpl arthur mitchell george cooper to apartment for drinks montgomery tells finlay that mitchell left the apartment first and that he and floyd followed soon after with still alive and well br br unable to locate mitchell finlay suspects him of the murder he enlists sgt peter robert mitchum to help him locate mitchell mitchell meanwhile has been wondering the streets in a dazed state he meets prostitute ginny gloria grahame in a bar and strikes up a friendship she gives him a key to her apartment and he goes there to rest unexpectedly a man paul kelly turns up looking for ginny mitchell still in a daze leaves and goes back to meet and his pals manages to keep him from the police and hides him in an all night movie house br br from mitchell's perspective we learn that montgomery hates jews and is probably the killer finlay begins to focus his investigation on montgomery trying to prove his guilt he to have one of the soldiers a kid named leroy william phipps set a trap for br br crossfire is considered to be one of the best of the film noire genre in fact it garnered several academy award nominations including ryan and grahame for best supporting actors it was made on a modest budget in about three weeks br br it has all of the elements of classic film noire the shadows low key lighting and the story playing out mostly at night the requisite femme fatale of the piece is grahame's ginny who plays a minor role but is nonetheless your classic femme fatale the unnamed character played by paul kelly in an excellent bit has been chewed up and spit out by ginny and was she about to do the same to mitchell br br robert ryan steals the picture as the brutal montgomery although it would type cast him in similar roles for years to come robert young makes a good low key detective but robert mitchum has little to do other than befriend the mitchell character others in the cast are jacqueline white as mitchell's wife lex barker who would go on the following year to play tarzan as one of mitchum's soldier pals and richard powers who was previously known as tom keene as finlay's assistant br br director edward would shortly run afoul of the house un american committee as having communist and spend a couple of years in jail
<START> oh the horror the unspeakable horror of this film if you can even call it a film this looks like some first year art school project hastily cobbled together br br the talents here will subject you to a painful mix of under and overacting and practically all the scenes were terribly contrived and pretentious br br the film in no way reflects malaysian culture or social conventions nobody even talks that way over here i live in malaysia btw br br spinning seems tailor made to pick up an award in the foreign film category of some western film festival and unfortunately that ploy seems to have worked some reviewers would no doubt describe it as exotic but a more accurate word would be atrocious br br
<START> hey all you jive hustlers you stone foxes you mean dudes watch out cause slaughter is back in town if you are looking for a bad ass funky film to watch some night this is just right is back and trying to take it easy n' relax after his adventures down in mexico but if you are a narrow minded gangster like you are bound to seek revenge why i don't know was in the first one his brother or what any who the movie starts off with the old assassination from a plane routine we all know that that is the most effective way for taking out one guy in a picnic full of people needless to say slaughter survives the ordeal but eric sorry george i mean isn't that lucky smack also slaughters best friend pratt is killed this is the start of a grand adventure filled with the hippest music james brown himself has to offer that's right 'the godfather of soul' has put his trademark up on this bad boy in addition to jim brown in the lead part this movie is filled with some of the biggest names the blaxploitation scene has to offer how about scatman crothers dick anthony williams gloria hendry and brock peters in other parts we see none other than judith m brown and last but definitely least the fantastic don stroud as the evil henchman
<START> although the movie was only so so the closed captioning was by far the best i have ever seen most of the time the spelling is terrible and the captioning out of sync i use the closed captioning even though i can hear well but find a lot of actors mumble also many times the sound track overrides the dialogue thanks
<START> the final comedown wants to say something about racism and inner city violence unfortunately the message is by the nonsensical script the amateurish production and the heavy handed polemics how heavy handed you ask to give you just one example a black doctor comes out of his hiding place unarmed with his hands up in the air ready to surrender to the police one of the all white cops says don't shoot him he's a doctor to which another cop replies so what he's still a n r and proceeds to shoot him in cold blood the cops are portrayed as ignorant racist killers even though at the end there are just as many dead people among them as there are among the black people who staged the riot and this whole event was meant somehow to the white folks to the demeaning treatment of the black folks when in fact something like this can only breed more hate and violence on both sides pamela jones as williams' girlfriend briefly lights up the screen with her smile and body particularly in a tender sex scene and elevates the rating of this movie from 1 to 2 out of 10
<START> why do they keep making trash like this because it makes money that's why eraser is not so much a film but a string of action set pieces strung together it's well filmed but predictable and it's all been done before only better this is basically a nineties version of
<START> this movie is such a good movie shah ruck khan does a great job as the crazy mad villain who is totally obsessed with br br the girl the story is fantastic the acting by all br br characters like the girl and shah ruck and sunny are all fabulous and i really love the first song especially how it comes back at the end oh and its so emotional if your a true shah ruck khan fan you have gotta watch this movie because its the best shah ruck khan movie ever he plays an excellent role and i wish he done more crazy man roles but u have to watch this what so ever this is a really good movie this is a really good movie you have to watch it it is truly amazing you have to watch it it is fabulous i can go on and on about this movie because it is a fun funny scary cool and totally fantastic movie in the world
<START> there is one adjective that describes everything about this film acting plot effects continuity etc and that word is poor the government wants to asses the effects of space travel on certain organisms but the capsule crashes and a mutant something or other looks like a guy in an ape suit with the top of a football helmet over his face wreaks havoc around the accident scene which includes a favorite place for the window fogging partying set therefore some young people as well as a law enforcement officer are among the creature's victims you gotta be extremely about how you spend your time or rich if you spend any money to view this epic
<START> i found it hard to care about these characters who were either annoying or insipid all living their fabulously hilariously urban lives br br the dialogue was at times and at other times the narrative seemed hard to follow was it me or were entire scenes deleted br br it felt like a poor sitcom somehow turned into a film the stereotypes and jokes about men's groups would perhaps have been funny in the early 90s as it is this is where much of the humour of the film comes from and boy does it get old fast br br apart from the attractive irish man this film was a dud and not even in a so bad it's good way the last 20 minutes were particularly painful perhaps if you've never met any gay people or never thought about homosexuality before then this film might have something meaningful to say otherwise darlings you'd still be better off renting the boys in the band or beautiful thing
<START> one of the greatest lessons i ever had in how to watch a movie happened this way br br i was working in roger corman's offices like so many other before and since i was and trying to figure out how it all worked and how to make myself indispensable hah one afternoon julie corman roger corman's wife and a producer in her own right asked me to load up a tape i'm not sure why she wanted to watch it i got the impression it was a student film or a show reel something like that some sort of calling card whatever the reasons she had to see it the only free video machine in the offices at the time happened to be in the room i was working in and i was the nearest person to the machine i started the tape br br fade in on screen a figure sat at a desk facing the camera behind him screen left was a door that opened into the room against the far wall was a coat rack a second character entered through the door and started talking the first character the guy at the desk turned round to reply this is all one take static camera there are no cuts pans or dolly shots just one locked off camera the second character turned to hang his coat on the coat rack and delivered his next line julie corman said i've seen enough and left the room br br what she had seen in the ten seconds of footage she had watched was that the director was an idiot opening with two characters who immediately turned their backs to the camera delivering lines nope sorry next that's how long you've got ten seconds cock it up in the opening shot and you are dead br br i was reminded of that moment while i watched the opening of this piece of crap after an interminably long travelogue of jungle we see several monkeys apparently throwing themselves into cages a man carrying a gun laughs a jet liner lands and we see it taxi the whole way to the terminal god this is boring cut to the interior of the airport two men meet aha something is happening they shake hands cut to a different angle of the two men br br and the director crosses the line br br the first two shots of the movie that have any kind of spatial relationship with each other and the guy has cocked up 'not crossing the line' is one of those basic rules of movie grammar that keeps the characters from jumping about from side to side on the screen and confusing the audience audiences don't like to be confused mystified baffled puzzled and intrigued yes audiences love all of those confused no you loose them they walk out 'not crossing the line' is one of those things they pound into you at film school or should it's basic stuff it's not an inviolable rule there are no inviolable rules directors break it all the time but not on the first real cut of the movie br br i thought i've seen enough and switched off
