<START> part of the bbc filming of all of shakespeare's classic plays this version of hamlet does nothing to dispel my particular impression that it is one of shakespeare's most over rated plays and hamlet himself a not particularly moving and tragic character i feel no sympathy for him and i didn't after watching this br br even when you have great actors like the great derek jacobi in the role of the dane and patrick stewart as claudius and jonathan hyde as rosencrantz it cannot disguise the lack of passion in the storyline and when a good actor like jacobi injects passion into it he renders the entire role incomprehensible i just could not connect his of the character to what he was saying and this killed it for me that said he does get the to be or not to be speech right as his actions with a dagger make clear the character's suicidal intentions at that point in the play br br the supporting roles to me better written and consequently better played are enjoyable notably ward's loopy ophelia and stewart's well detailed interpretation of claudius br br at four and a half hours it is very long and best watched in bite sized chunks check it out if you're interested but be prepared for a long watch
<START> this columbo is unique in that we don't really know the exact outcome until the very end our favorite dark horse detective suspects a pair of identical twin brothers of killing their rich uncle each points the finger at his brother in a mystery series in which the crime is shown at the beginning of the drama this twist could reasonably be used only once or twice and this was columbo's time other than that wrinkle this episode fits in well with others of the series it has a lighter tone than some with a very funny performance by jeanette nolan as the fastidious and loyal housekeeper who takes an instant dislike to columbo
<START> like almost everyone i am familiar with the music of ray charles who hasn't heard georgia on my mind and the mess around and some of the other marvelous songs featured in this movie but about the life of ray charles i was sadly ignorant until watching this i have to say that jamie foxx brought ray charles to life brilliantly his performance was powerful right down to the mannerisms and voice inflections the movie also offered a no holds barred account of some of the trials and tribulations charles dealt with over the course of his life and with some demons from the past that haunted him well into adulthood perhaps the most powerful scene in the movie was the heroin withdrawal scene which was painfully realistic the movie portrays charles' growing awareness of and involvement with the civil rights movement culminating in his refusal to play before a segregated audience in georgia which led to a ban on him performing in the state his drug addiction and extra marital affairs are also well documented the movie revolves around a plea from his mother when he was a child don't let anyone or anything turn you into a cripple the point is that drugs did just that and to honour his mother's memory he had to beat them there's not much here about his later life and career after breaking his heroin habit but up to that point this is really powerful stuff 9 10
<START> first ifc runs town and country and now this the difference between that stinker and this pink panther rip off is that town and country was watchable this isn't br br i can only surmise that the cast signed up for this so they could goof off in europe on somebody else's dime belushi is especially irritating his scene with candy doing a z grade dom deluise was torture speaking of torture five minutes of the talentless shepherd and i bet the prisoners at gitmo would crack like walnuts br br the real crime besides this being green lighted is shepherd's character a mousy wife who takes a monte carlo casino for a half million bucks if you buy that i have some oceanfront property in arizona you might be interested in
<START> ok film like segal's last few films once again goes beyond the knock 'em down kick 'em in the groin shoot 'em in the face get revenge against the bad guys for hurting my sister's niece's cousin stuff seagal was into for a while steven started thinking and using his bucks to make movies with actual ideas in them sure there is plenty of action in this flick but also some thought and heart it's not an oscar flick but well worth the effort unless the viewer is so into brain dead violence that it hurts to have to think for longer than a second it's worth a rental or two
<START> anybody who goes to the manhattan hospital center is taking his life in his hands that includes the staff of the hospital br br i had never seen the hospital before and i was intrigued at how similar the characters and situations of the plot were to that other paddy masterpiece network there are elements in george c scott's character that have both al schumacher's and howard br br he's the administrator of the hospital and he's mad as hell and not going to take it any more he's completely estranged from his wife and kids it takes a faye dunaway type character in the person of diana rigg to make him snap out of it one roll in the hay with her and he's shocked back to reality and the fact he still can contribute in the world br br but first he's got a real problem someone is out killing hospital staff four of them in a 48 hour period and the nice part is their deaths can be attributed to in large part to the general incompetence of a medical bureaucracy that's where the comedy comes in br br there is an actual howard beale type character in the person of barnard hughes diana rigg's father his end is not quite as dramatic as though br br back in my working days it was part of my job to pay medical suppliers some of them could be as big creeps as you'll find portrayed in the hospital the black comedy satire had some real bite to it for me br br george c scott was nominated for best actor but having won and refused to accept the previous year's oscar for patton he wasn't about to get a second chance he lost to gene hackman for the french connection still his handling of the role is unforgettable br br try viewing the hospital back to back with network and see how many similarities you spot
<START> typical story of an evil kid going after people i suspect that antonio fargas huggy bear on starsky and hutch and vincent schiavelli didn't want to stress this junk on their resumes actually schiavelli left this life with a mostly good resume sometimes i wish that the killers in these movies would just go after the idiots who decide that we need a new one of these movies every other month note that comment is not to be taken seriously i just think that slashers have lost their touch br br anyway this is one movie that you'll do best to avoid it's ninety minutes to two hours that i'll never get back
<START> the fifth collaboration between marlene dietrich and director josef von sternberg blonde venus is a film that looks great while it's playing but fails to engages the viewer the plodding storyline of dietrich being torn between two men becoming a mammoth cabaret star and fighting for the custody of her child is jumbled and often feels like bits of three separate films half baked together dietrich is unwisely cast in a rather passive reactive role for much of the film and her character remains aloof from viewers while herbert marshal is unconvincing as her ill tempered husband and cary grant is largely wasted as a suave suitor who dashes in and out of the picture the film does contain some intriguing set pieces the hot voodoo number is the high point that are impressively surrealistic for this era in hollywood although it proves to no avail in such a dull incoherent film
<START> nostalgia isn't always the best reason to watch a movie more often than not the movies you loved as a kid will disappoint you as an adult while there are exceptions to this rule it's hard to justify owning a dvd of krull regardless of how many insightful the director's commentary may be but stay sharp gen x because the dozens of disappointments dominating your trip down memory lane might stop you from stumbling across one worth revisiting br br one surprise film worth another look is joel schumacher's the supernatural thriller starring 80's popcorn heavyweights keifer sutherland kevin bacon julia roberts and billy baldwin you would think that a stew comprised of this cast the flamboyant flair of schumacher and the Ã¼ber slick eye of cinematographer jan de bont would result in something sickeningly stodgy but aside ain't half bad even though it's production design is inexplicably over the top and the photography is achingly over stylized replete with neon soaked streets spewing endless billows of steam still manages to be an effectively dark and compelling thriller if there's an explanation why was forgotten it might be because 1990 saw the release of another far superior supernatural thriller jacob's ladder br br had been released a year or two after jacob's ladder it's likely schumacher's flashy thriller would have been dismissed as a toned down commercialized rip off of adrian lyne's nightmarish masterpiece but with these films being released in the same year enjoyed a different fate take at the box office despite being a watered down version of a similar premise the passage of time hasn't been as kind to it has been lost atop a dated heap of throwaway 80's brat pack dreck while has cemented its reputation as a timeless classic fates aside is seamlessly terrifying and it manages to keep audiences guessing right up until the last frame whereas falls victim to over simplification and hollywood conveniences that drag down the final act into a predictably tidy denouement comparisons between the two movies is unfair and ultimately overlooks ability to represent the 80's at its quintessential best released at the end of a decade of shallow excess will always be dated by its hairstyles and clothing styles but in fairness it should also be remembered as a well executed movie at or at least near the top of its particular heap of dreck for intents and purposes it's an entertaining walk down memory lane
<START> i was looking forward to dante's contribution to this excellent horror anthology series from showtime but this was easily the worst of the bunch it's really too bad part of this may be due to the poor if odd choice of source materials why joe didn't just write an original i have no idea instead we get this soapbox episode where the message overwhelms the script the characters the staging everything and by the end i was just wondering whether it could get any worse and i won't spoil it but it ended up getting worse what a stinker by such a talented creative team skip this one and buy the john carpenter one instead it manages to balance all of the elements horror humor character vision and it's fun homecoming is about as fun as having a bear take a dump on you while you sleep
<START> as i expected would happen too many reviews of this film from professionals and amateurs alike have focused as much if not more on the film's ideology that's because the sea inside aka mar is a film about euthanasia specifically it's a true story about an infamous named ramÃ³n who fought for many years for the right to assisted suicide who was denied that right by the spanish constitutional court and who well i don't want to ruin the ending of the film for you br br the real life catalyzed a national debate on euthanasia in spain now with producer director writer composer editor alejandro abre los ojos 1997 and the others 2001 biopic the sea inside another rhetorical aid has been provided in the international debate on this hot button issue br br but as i keep saying to deaf ears your opinion pro or con on the film's ideology shouldn't affect your rating of the film you're not supposed to be rating the philosophical or political messages that amenÃ¡bar wants to make you're supposed to be rating the film as a film maybe that's a bit too idealistic as none of us can likely completely divorce our evaluations from our ideological biases but idealistic or not that's the goal br br so forget about the philosophical and political issues for a moment as a film amenÃ¡bar has turned in one of his most elegant and mature works to date he does not focus on societal debates he does not focus on legal political struggles he focuses on as a man living out his days confined to a bed in his brother's home br br played here in an amazing performance by javier bardem was a as the film begins he has been a for 26 years that condition was brought about as amenÃ¡bar shows us through marvelously shot flashbacks by a diving accident was distracted by a beautiful woman miscalculated the water dove in snapped his neck and almost drowned as a he eventually began writing poetry some of which was published in a book entitled el infierno letters from hell in real life book became a best seller in spain perhaps taking artistic work as a cue amenÃ¡bar has created an elegantly poetic film br br most of the sea inside is set inside bedroom the focus in these scenes is complex and sublime performance as a bardem is limited to moving his head and talking he has mastered subtle changes of expression and inflection to convey a deep character with a multifaceted intellectual approach to life bardem and amenÃ¡bar have often waxing philosophical in understated speech but there's always a combination of a wicked sense of humor passion for the aesthetic including music and women and a sadness and even occasionally bitterness not far below the surface different underlying emotions occasionally break through like waves on the skin of the ocean br br the people interacts with most frequently facilitate this in complex ways these others include his sister in law mabel rivera who has been his chief caretaker since accident his brother josÃ© who is one of the vocal objectors to wish to die and with whom there is an underlying unresolved issue it seems like maybe josÃ© was the one to save from drowning his nephew javier who is perhaps the most understanding towards him a right to die advocate clara a pro bono lawyer julia belÃ©n whom he wanted because she had a degenerative disease cerebral dominant with and and would thus by more empathic and who he falls in love with and rosa lola a local woman who works at a and moonlights as a dj who heard about him from the media who wants to convince him to desire to live and who falls in love with him br br the bulk of the film consists of these characters interacting with in his room there are also a few other ancillary characters including father who remains oddly distant and a notorious and media conscious priest padre francisco josÃ© marÃ­a pou who does his best to change mind via philosophy theology in a scene often mistakenly characterized as comic it has an attendant comic element but the scene is primarily very serious br br that most of the film takes place in room ingeniously gives the couple significant changes in setting greater impact room has a nice big window which he says he is satisfied with as an observation point on the world maybe even more importantly he regularly imagines the window as a launching pad through which he flies across the hillsides to the ocean which he always loved and which has been the most influential force in his life it provided his living when he was younger and took his mobility away amenÃ¡bar gives us a fantastical sequence of imagining one of his flights to the sea it is beautifully shot with low angles presumably from a helicopter of the hills rushing by until we follow a stream to the wide open ocean which in this film represents freedom the infinite and natural forces br br the other significant change of setting arrives with finally taking to a wheelchair he otherwise refused them saying they mocked his immobility to make an appearance in court to help plead his case amenÃ¡bar gives us a poignant melancholy travelogue shot subjectively of viewing life and the world in action from the car window br br whether you agree with euthanasia or not it's difficult to deny that this is a well acted well scripted and well constructed film you may not believe that it's a ten and that's even more unlikely if you disagree with euthanasia but it's still worth watching as a fine example of artistic sophisticated film making
<START> this movie is a perfect example of barkers cinematic gifts to the horror monster genre i thought this movie did a great job of keeping the feel and look of the novella and comic books or actually the comics may have come second i forget this movie was made for barker fans it helps to have read the book beforehand but isn't that important if you can follow a film i saw to anyone who is on the fence about this film read the book then re watch the film you might find a new respect for the movie i came to this movie a big fan of barker already and having read the book prior loved the film instantly there are great cameos makeup writing directing etc in this film this movie does something that most monster horror movies fail miserably at show the monsters they are there in full color not hidden in shadows and taking most of the screen time unlike other films that use quick cuts or trick lighting to hide the creature this movie celebrates the grotesque and casts them into the forefront as the good guy two thumbs up clive we're waiting for the thief of always
<START> for the people who have compared this trash to the brilliance of david lynch etc please listen to your carer when they say dont use other people's pc without their permission br br this is complete and utter poo there is no art here this is some person trying to make a name for himself with a cluster of gross out ideas which he was not clever enough to enforce into one main idea so instead he went for the easy option br br any one with half a brain could sit at home and conjure up some controversial images to shock viewers but it takes a person with true imagination to be able to make it into a movie people want to watch br br i am a lover of shock cinema i have seen or own pretty much all you can get and i can strongly advise to anyone who loves the world of movies to steer well clear of this garbage br br this one is only for people who like to over analyze what they are watching or for the 17 year old first time drinkers who dont know any better br br 0 10 br br
<START> spoilers horrifyingly enough i have actually seen the film that this horrid film was a sequel to it was called ator the fighting eagle and i saw it when i was just 8 years old it made such an awful impression on me that i never forgot it i've been an mst3k fan for a long time so when came out on tape i bought it i was horrified to realize that it was a sequel to the wretched ator movie that i'd seen so long ago costume has somehow gotten ever skimpier than the last time i saw him how can he wear that tiny little bikini doesn't he care that it shows off the fact that he has no errr package and poor thong he gets no lines and no girl and has to follow that frizzy haired girly doofus ator around all the time has anyone else noticed that miles o'keefe walks like a woman no wonder he's not interested in the pretty if somewhat lackluster the evil but bad guy is more to his taste i'm sure i loved cardboard spray painted swan helmet and the way he spent all his time trying to touch some part of ator the fight scenes are so badly choreographed that its a wonder that the swords ever manage to connect the dull old guy spends all of his time standing around looking depressed ator drinks from a cup given to him by a guy who hates him and then looks surprised that they drugged him he must be pretty smart though he invented a hang glider in the space pf five minutes then flew it into a rift in the space time continuum so that he travelled briefly into 17th century bulgaria that was after he stabbed the giant snake puppet of course and saved the post coital while she sat around doing absolutely nothing the real hero of the movie was thong who saved ator several times from his boundless and killed the evil in the bargain kudos to thong the only competent person in the whole film
<START> the credits at the end read all directed by shigeru that's a fitting way to phrase it because it seems like filmed material from several projects were thrown together somehow barely even attempting to make it all form one consistent work it more felt like one of those music clip things that are marketed as feature films to cash in on those video commercials just that here we have the marketable music and the live performances missing except for one scene which may as well be marketed as a weird music video clip in japan whatever br br it makes zero sense visually it isn't too special either although it has its moments for example the female creature with the death powder who is strapped onto a bed base and some morphing sh t throughout and it certainly has an industrial y feeling to it usually i'd call the effects dilettantish but what this film offers in this regard is baffling more than anything else you remember those cheap video effects from 70's and 80's music videos that make them look so dated like a picture within a picture flying through the screen there is quite a lot of these kind of effects in this and without any apparent reason the most half assed seeming effort comes in the form of a picture collage the pictures sort of look like album covers whatever br br i don't know what's up with the subtitles of the version i saw the chinese ones or whatever those hieroglyphics are sometimes seem to show up when nothing is even said and the english ones often show up without the chinese ones the english subs talk much about life without death is it possible and a mind without a body which provides what comes closest to a comprehensible conflict between characters in this film one guy a scientist dude says that life without flesh is death while another guy a metamorphosing dude who claims his mind is beyond his body now that he got the death powder blown into his face and that he now knows the secrets of the flesh and whatnot metamorphosing dude is visibly p ssed off about the scientist dude's claim whatever br br erm the end all written by perception de ambiguity
