<START> just want to inform you guys that this movie was actually pretty good br br thought it was a lame ass movie but not at all many moments in this movie wore pretty horrifying br br this movie has enough blood gore and some sexy make out scenes of course to keep any horror buff like me 100 satisfied the cast was also pretty good imo br br even though its not a high budget movie the effects wore definitely kinda creepy sometimes br br worth watching if u like a kick ass horror movie thats for sure br br tom
<START> the grudge 2 let's see don't get me wrong i'm not a japanese horror film or horror or grudge basher i loved the first one and the original ju on i feel that much more justice could have been done for this one aubrey only existed to fill in what needed to be in the ending which if you've already seen ju on before this you already know the whole movie all it was really was a complete remake of ju on just more closely followed than the grudge though everyone may have thought that it's coming to america was a bit interesting it was expected as the house burning in the end of the grudge left the 2nd hungering for a new plot br br save your 6 50 and wait for this to come out on dvd rent it watch it then decide if you want to buy it this movie is good for a fall asleep at 2 in the morning film but overall i'd say a 4 out of 10 sorry grudge fans it's just they just failed at this one
<START> five teens set out to do some camping in the oregon wilderness and despite being warned by the park ranger they soon realize that something is lurking around in the backwoods waiting to strike br br when it comes to old horror movies the only one that keeps popping up in every conversation is friday the 13th so i took it upon myself to find those good old horror movies that fell short for simply being compared to friday the 13th just before dawn just so happened to be among the ones i found and was really very impressive it wasn't as bland as some of the stuff you find today it was very sharp in terms of character development as it had quite a few likable ones and it has this very casual pace its not in a hurry to get to the hack and slash bits it takes its time to set the proper mood and tone and is very atmospheric and builds some killer suspense by letting you always have that sense of dread like somethings out there but you don't know where it is or when it will strike br br where i live its definitely an overlooked gem simply because people never heard of it or won't give it a chance but i'll state that it is not a friday the 13th rip off the two concepts don't even go near each other but in my mind it is overall one of the more impressive slashers i've seen in a while
<START> the third film i got to watch at the philly film fest was this outstanding drama from japan after breaking out of prison nine escaped convicts plan to find the key to the universe that a tenth convict who didn't break out told them about along the way we get to know each of these men fairly well each has their own dreams for much of the movie it seems to be mostly a comedy but a shift takes place that the film ends up a tragedy all of the actors give great performances i can't say much more without spoiling the film but suffice it to say that you end up feeling for some of these individuals at 2 hours this film is a tad to long but good none the less i have no qualms recommending it with the warning that it does have a bit unsettling violence for the tender hearted hit a home run this time out and it makes me want to search out his prior films as well as look forward eagerly to his future ones br br my grade a
<START> this movie as my chinese girlfriend informed me features two well known hong kong pop stars while this may make the movie a mere marketing stunt i found the acting acceptable and they're both cute br br the story is pretty poor overall the vampiric traits and weaknesses are however used in humorous ways and created some uniquely entertaining bits the quarreling between the two girls made me chuckle and this gave a fine balance together with the well executed action scenes to create an entertaining movie
<START> there was a time when michael jackson was revered as the king of pop then came a time when he attracted negative publicity as much as lemonade attracts wasps finally it is now the time that we feel truly sorry for this man br br this 'movie' is another reason to i promised a rabid michael jackson fan to watch it with her you know the type of fan someone who tells him or herself to like everything the object of affection ever did while watching this movie which she had seen twice already i realized how far this fandom goes probably far enough to rate this movie above a 1 10 as some people miraculously did br br the movie attempts to be a parody of many other movies and series most notably cast away lost and jurassic park unfortunately it fails miserably at any level the acting does not save the absolutely horrible story the filming has the quality of a too often played video tape the special effects were better executed in be kind rewind for those who do not now this movie with aluminum foil all this would be funny if the movie managed to be well funny unfortunately it is not it hurts to watch this br br and then there is michael jacksons appearance in this garbage he appears on a projection screen to deliver an important message and manages to come across as mobile as jabba the hutt and as serious as a 4 year old just when i thought who is the terrible person that lured this poor man into participating in this movie and yet again making a total fool of himself i finally reached the ending credits and discovered that the movie was actually partially shot at jackson's neverland ranch in other words he likes it br br this movie and jackson's involvement in it is truly disturbing do not watch it even for the haha a movie in the imdb bottom 100 effect or be warned
<START> i enjoyed this film which i thought was well written and acted br br there was plenty of humour and a thought provoking storyline a warm and enjoyable experience with an emotional ending good fun
<START> i saw this at a drive in when i was 9 all i remember are a few scenes the ones where the main character elle is being chased by a guy in a mask and being scared seeing it now my opinions have changed it's a pathetic horror film about an run by gloria grahame sad and dealing with a young talentless girl elle who is sent there after her mother the town tramp was beaten to death with a hammer graphically shown the film has adolescents actually actors in their 20s being beaten tortured killed starved attacked with meat cleavers raped etc etc the brutal hammer murder is the opening scene and then it gets worse and worse there is nothing to recommend about this crap the plot is stupid all the dialogue is bad and the acting the less said the better how did this sickie get by with a gp now pg rating it would get an r now worthless one last thing a truly repulsive twist ending suggests incest
<START> i saw this film at the film fleadh the year it won best short film i have to say that i thought the direction was fantastic and the performances from the key cast members were very memorable both of the main cast are definitely names to watch out for br br the final shot over the cliff was mesmerizing and i for one would like to find myself there if i was waiting for the end of the world to happen the kiss was definitely a great payoff done with great br br i can only assume that the film was shot on film and i have heard that the dop won an award at the tribeca film festival for his work on this film and i must say well deserved br br i would recommend this film to anyone who was a teenager in the 1980s it brought back some great memories and some scary ones
<START> spoilers br br this movie is not action packed it's slow and boring it's not funny or exciting it's predictable and plays on cheap sentimentality and vague patriotism the special effects are not imaginative or impressive they are noisy and uninspired br br the acting talent is wasted on hopelessly stupid one liners and clichÃ©s these are spouted by characters they ought to just be called gentle giant black man ' eccentric genius who is about to crack ' square jawed hero coming of age ' by the book coward ' luckless gambler who lives by a code of honor ' impulsive and so on br br and the writing how many undramatic countdowns did they think they could fit in this thing does a scene where people have to defuse a bomb by cutting one or another wire even count as fiction anymore the drama of the last 15 minutes of the movie depends on the audience caring if some jerk can put aside his personal differences with ben affleck and say bye bye to liv tyler in time to save the earth all the work is done we just have to wait a couple more seconds for harry stamper the jerk to toss off a few cotton candy lines i know bruce willis is a generally charismatic guy but his harry stamper character is an obnoxious bore i thought he earned the golden he was awarded for this role br br since the movie is so long the plot so obvious and the dialogue so disposable one can't help but notice the lame inaccuracies inconsistencies and plot holes 800 feet into something the size of tx is less than a try walking 800 feet into tx and see how close to the center you are after all the discussion about the artificial gravity on the russian station it appears to be arbitrary once inside actually gravity comes and goes throughout the movie does it make any sense that anyone besides michael bay would give these morons a couple shuttles and send them to blow up an asteroid threatening the earth br br the sentimental phone insurance cola commercial style montages were revolting br br i do like action movies really this one is boring stupid and really stuck on itself it deserves hatred and scorn because it's everything hollywood's most expensive efforts have become a bunch of cheap cliches running from one expensive explosion to another oh yes the whole thing is permeated by a neanderthal conservative outlook on sex politics and so on
<START> i got this movie with my bbc jane austen collection 5 dvds of old bbc adaptations and didn't like it at first it's completely different from the others and it lacks or so i thought one of the qualities that i enjoy in all other austen movies cheerful common sense the nightmare scene in which mrs richards apparently sews her fingers together was especially upsetting br br i still don't like to watch the finger sewing scene but i do love hearing mrs r saying dreamily while she sews my only acquaintance tore my gown this movie is now my current austen favorite i've watched it 7 or 8 times so far the acting to my mind is incredible the way i notice good acting is when i find myself looking up from whatever i'm doing sewing though not my fingers together hopefully or or whatever in order to watch the character deliver his lines it's the turn of expression the cast of posture that make the words come alive that's what makes good acting as far as i'm concerned br br well i watch almost every part of northanger abbey because almost all the actors play their roles with such charisma peter firth is amazing as mr the perfect blend of fop and real masculine hero you're not sure until the end whether he's after catherine's money or not i love his touch of welsh accent mr and mrs richards are charming the combination of their behaviors especially mr richards' high voice lending counterpoint to his wit and wisdom makes them so real general as the hard hearted father who may possibly be a murderer is fascinating too and captain the grinning rake who is so clearly enjoying himself and the sister and brother whose names i can't currently remember the two of them are so perfectly at once smart and smarmy br br the other reason i love this adaptation is that it is the most romantic of all the jane austen adaptations i know this was one of austen's weak points well it is as far as i am concerned even though all her novels are love stories it's hard to feel that her heroes and heroines are really in love at the end and if they're aren't really in love then what's the point all the other adaptations i've seen other than the early olivier garson one have pretty cold fish kisses at the end if they kiss at all i don't at all like sex in movies but it really is necessary to have a heartfelt kiss in the end and the ending kiss in northanger is a doozy br br the over the top approach to costumes music and lighting work very well as far as i'm concerned and the script is extremely clever the way we are educated about gothic romance in bath cathy's normal country upbringing etc is very well done as they usually are in bbc productions also i like the part when the little black page does the cartwheels and the i think was an entirely appropriate and very clever expository device br br some people have objected that this version is the opposite of what jane austen intended to do in northanger abbey she meant to make fun of gothic romance not promote it but i don't think she meant to put mysteries of etc down she was just making the point that you need to distinguish between reality and fiction and this point is made when mr chides catherine in his mother's room besides general was a villain albeit a prosaic one that point was meant to be made surely
<START> i will repeat what a stupid scenario br br is there anything new inside i don't know who have wrote this but i believe this guy have watch all hollywood children family teens movies ever made all scenes and u can see in everywhere why do u people making this movies children's like an adults they like money gold cars and they are positives they have lucky and emotions of course without it can be done o the young actors wow i do like when is camera concentrated on their nice faces what a crap there is 90 better children movies that this one this is not creative or funny movie this is simply nothing br br d
<START> this has got to be one of the weakest plots in a movie i have ever seen br br however that is not all that this movie is lacking this movie has the worst acting writing directing special effects you name it it's the worst ever br br i highly advise you to spend your time on worthwhile movies and not waste your time on this garbage br br i do agree with an earlier post that the women were definitely men dressed up in drag and that did give me a laugh i keep trying to figure out if they were being obvious about it or if they were actually trying to be sexy women br br anyway there is not much else in this movie that is worth watching br br to sum it up horrible acting horrible script horrible idea for a movie an hour and a half of my life i want back right now
<START> the photography is accomplished the acting is quite good but in virtually every other department the greek tycoon is a dreary bore taking its inspiration from the real life love affair of jackie kennedy and aristotle onassis the film is a glossy but absolutely empty soap opera of the kind that can be found on tv all day long viewers who embrace the whole celebrity magazine culture paparazzi photographs and gossipy stories about the rich and famous will undoubtedly find much to whet their appetite here but those who prefer films with a bit more substance and craft and quirkiness will find the 107 minute running time a butt numbing slog br br american president james cassidy james franciscus and his beautiful wife liz jacqueline bisset are in greece on official business a ridiculously wealthy greek shipping tycoon theo anthony quinn catches sight of liz at a party at his elegant manor despite the fact that both of them are married to someone else there is an immediate attraction between them later at a private party aboard his yacht makes his desires known to liz some while later president cassidy is assassinated whilst out strolling on a beach liz is shocked and saddened by his death but it isn't long before she seeks comfort in the arms of her greek lover eventually the two of them are married and their love affair becomes a favourite talking point for the world's newspapers magazines photographers and wags br br it is somewhat amusing to note the vigour with which the producers of this film denied that it was a dramatisation of the kennedy onassis story they wanted the film to be seen as an original story rooted in fiction but anyone with a brain can see from where the movie is drawing its inspiration even aristotle onassis himself knew the greek tycoon amounted to his love life getting the hollywood treatment if rumours are to be believed he actually had a hand in approving anthony quinn for the role j lee thompson isn't really the right sort of director for this type of movie Â he's better suited to action fodder like the guns of and ice cold in alex Â but he the proceedings with an uninspired professional quinn is very watchable as bisset looks lovely as the object of his desires franciscus uses his toothy smile and a faÃ§ade of integrity to make for a believable politician their performances are good on the surface but there's little for the actors to do on any deeper level similarly tony photography gives the film an elegant surface sheen as it moves from one exotic locale to the next but the merest of scratches proves that there's nothing behind the film's glossy exterior
<START> this is a well directed columbo episode with also some good character but the story just doesn't really know to interest enough and doesn't appear as well layered and constructed as was often the case with a columbo movie this also goes for the killer's plot to kill his uncle it's quite simple and doesn't seem as well thought out perhaps this movie didn't really took itself serious enough since the atmosphere of the movie is mostly light at least when compared to different columbo movies br br for instance the movie features quite a large amount of comical relief mostly coming from the columbo character himself it makes the movie an enjoyable one to watch but it also gives you the feeling they sort of overdid it times also mostly since it doesn't correspond with most other columbo movies br br the characters are good and it helps that it features martin landau in a double role it's always funny to see how much different he still looked as a young man while for instance a person such as peter falk hardly changed any over the years he only got the movie also features julie newmar among others who is best know for playing catwoman in the '60's batman life action series it's funny how she still moves like catwoman in this movie intentional or is this just her way of acting br br it's an enjoyable and good to watch columbo movie but it also gives you the feeling that it all could had been a lot better with a better thought out script br br 7 10
