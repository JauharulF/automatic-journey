<START> this first time writer director comes across as a season pro with two coyotes most action dramas are all about the action first then the story but this picture works the other way around if this is just the beginning for this director then hollywood will soon be making room for this rising star independent movie making has once again reached a new level
<START> the columbia pictures short subject unit never had any delusions about producing any 'art' films they wanted to give the film exhibitors just a little more for their money when booking a columbia picture into their theatres this would go double for the 3 stooges films br br men in black 1934 came about as close as any of their comedy shorts in that it received an oscar nomination for best short subject comedy though it did not win it well could have it was good enough and even those who do not number themselves among stooge files still seem to be won over by the clarion cry of calling dr howard dr fine dr howard this was the second entry in the long series of comedy shorts made by the stooges for producer jules white head of columbia's short subjects department only woman haters described in its credits as a preceded it at harry cohen's poverty row br br the film starts off in the office of dr graves the head of the hospital he is receiving new interns and in addressing the group he relates that three of them are passed along from medical conditionally as they had remained there so long but the good doctor states that he will not reveal their identities as long as they pledge their all for duty and humanity the stooges run up front pledging for duty and humanity and run out of office breaking window glass in door the game was on br br the stooges took off and did not stop for the remainder of the 2 reels every type of gag was in evidence from broad sennett like sight gags to puns to dialect humor to 'theatre of the and a surrealistic running gag involving a public address system which seemingly takes on a life of its own and having the true culprit a radio tube get shot to a he got me it all plays out quite well honest the sets used were very authentic looking and were no doubt borrowed from columbia features being made around the same time there are plenty of wheel chairs surgical scalpels etc in evidence to maintain the illusion of a hospital br br a true strength of men in black is the high number of usually nameless players whom we all recognize by face along with them the film boasts of a great number of veteran comedy actors who always turn in fine performances often stealing the scene the people with names like billy gilbert hank mann and bud shine in even small parts br br and lastly we have the maestro the conductor director raymond mccarey kid brother to leo mccarey who showed off his abilities in getting this little film 'in the he skillfully kept it all moving acting as a traffic cop at times what with all the actors extras and behind the scenes crew moving and outside of each other's way and that doesn't count the giant 3 man tandem bicycle the sway backed horse and miniature race cars not to mention the 'giant green '
<START> this is a piece of cinematic beauty and it shows more of quebec culture to others than probably any other work to come from la belle province it takes everybody into a first person experience of the culture to the point that you wish you glued your hair in place and lived breathed and ate everything maurice richard the book does this as well as the short and i'm glad that in all the time i did spend studying french in high school this was required reading in both languages br br i thought it was brilliant to have carrier narrate this story his molasses thick accent brought a lot of realism to the story the animation was good as well very surrealist which brings attention to the idea of this being a whimsical daydream fancying over better days gone by br br again as a symbol of culture this is unsurpassed one can almost smell the being cooked slowly over a wood stove this whole film deserves endless praise for making people proud to be canadian and encourage us all to appreciate the finer things of family and our roots i'm from ontario and this film made me fall in love with quebec maurice richard va vivre dans nos
<START> dead man walking is a film not about the death penalty but about the people involved in a death penalty case the killer the families whose kids were killed the nun who becomes his spiritual advisor and what happens it tells the story with little fanfare but a lot of compassion and sensitivity i have it on dvd and every time i watch it not often it's never an easy film to watch i'm more impressed by what tim robbins and the entire cast did here so revealing that it could be a documentary so compelling you can't take your eyes away so subtle and yet so powerful dead man walking is nothing short of a masterpiece it doesn't matter whether you're for or against the death penalty or even have no opinion this movie will have you thinking about the issues for sure it takes a courageous screenwriter and director to look this material in the face without flinching even once and everyone involved in the film pulls it off there isn't a single scene that rings false a masterful film but don't expect light viewing to some the final scenes could be more graphic than anything imaginable even though no blood or violence is shown you get drawn into this film and become a participant and there's a character for just about everyone to identify with 10 10
<START> i saw this last night in fort lauderdale in general it was funny and i liked the characters especially sabrina the acting is good and the story line was ok except for the ending which left way to many strings dangling and we were like what i wanted to know what happened to the characters and it was a strange ending that could have been done so much better br br the film did portray rule life really well and we laughed throughout it has flaws that is for sure but for a first time film for ash christian i thought it was good you might want to wait for the dvd on this one but if you get a chance to see it give it a shot
<START> it's okay a few years later classic network will be his true cinematic big home run but for now this dark comedy isn't the classic it aspires to be it's mostly awful although it has some good scenes the first murder victim being found the e r clerk responsible for billing patients making a surprise discovery delusional confessional and the very last scene where scott's character regains his professional integrity and self respect it also has some ludicrous scenes scott's character's whiny monologue during his early visit to the hospital psychiatrist scott's character's raping rigg's character horrible mugging in his brief scenes and the o r doctor on the operating table to resuscitate the wrong patient because i already have one malpractice lawsuit br br also tries too hard throwing every conceivable hurdle at this one hospital i e the murders the administrative mistakes the poor people protesting outside etc it might have worked better as a look at the industry as a whole acting wise scott is passable rigg seems miscast hughes is inspired and mugs through out his brief performance the rest of the cast is too one dimensional
<START> with all the misery in the world how can we not get drunk Â mia br br a lovely aerial view of a major city turns ominous with the approach of a fleet of airplane bombers an irate hairdresser reacting to a perceived racial slur cuts a road through a businessman's bushy hair a man dreams of being dragged to an electric chair after a failed magic trick and a teacher breaks down in front of her grade school class because her husband called her a hag these and about fifty other vignettes that run the gamut from the outright depressing to the wildly humorous to the joyously uplifting populate roy you the living his first feature since his critically acclaimed if commercially unsuccessful songs from the second floor br br you the living is filled with the same kind of imaginative set pieces as songs replete with black humor surreal situations and strange looking characters though a bit overlong and less focused than his earlier work what remains constant is unmistakable style with its stationary camera sterile looking backgrounds and precise attention to detail if there is a theme that ties the sketches together it is that our time on earth is limited and tomorrow's another day' so let's treat each other with kindness along the way we are entertained by tuba and drum music from the louisiana brass band dinner guests at a banquet hall standing on their chairs singing a rousing song and a house that turns into a moving train br br the emotions range from the gloom of a daughter attempting to communicate with an alzheimer's patient to a young woman's ecstatic dream about marrying a handsome guitar player named to the cheers of a crowd of onlookers while there is no continuous narrative thread the theme of greed and desperation appears in several sketches the first of these threads features two corpulent individuals and their tiny dog sitting on a park bench the woman the fact that no one understands or loves her yet she blithely ignores the man's comforting and reassuring words br br there is also a hefty of irony during what seems to be an executive luncheon one man tells another on the phone that workers don't appreciate quality and how nice it is to appreciate money and the things that it can buy such as fine wine when he is not looking however a man at an adjacent table calmly lifts his wallet from his jacket on the back of his chair though cynicism is at times not very well hidden you the living has an underlying humanism that shows compassion for the human condition it is a cautionary tale that looks at the mess we humans have gotten ourselves into but suggests there is still time to turn it around if we heed the warning of the poet goethe that opens the film be pleased then you the living in your delightfully warmed bed before ice cold wave will lick your escaping foot
<START> i'm normally not a drama feel good movie kind of guy but once i saw the trailer for radio i couldn't resist not only is this a great film but it also has acting cuba gooding jr did an excellent job portraying james robert kennedy a k a radio ed harris also did a fantastic job as coach jones i was pleasantly surprised to see some comedy in it as well so for a great story great acting and a little comedy i give radio a 10 out of 10
<START> inspired by a true story tale is full of 1970's feeling but is disjointed in the telling this is the tale of a black college swimmer who ends up in at a closing rec center in a bad neighborhood and somehow puts together a swim team the film staggers around blindly for the first half hour until terrence howard as our hero gets the kids into the pool it picks up at that point by becoming somewhat engaging though it still staggers about there is a good story in this and its clear why howard and bernie mac took part in it but the script is poor and most of the direction seems intent on making it feel like instead of making us feel anything for the story br br not the disaster that some reviews made it out to be it instead suffers by all of the recent sport true stories coach carter invincible glory road etc which at least knew that you have to at least work with the story to make a movie as opposed to just letting the audience suffer because its true
<START> i've read the book and was expecting a good movie the first time i saw it i'm afraid to say that i was disappointed the movie did not follow the book and made many changes that i did not like br br one of the changes that i did not like the way that lord fenton was portrayed it made no sense to make him out to be a bad man the way that things ended between lord fenton and scarlett was a lot different and their whole relationship was too intimate br br there was also a lot less confrontation between scarlett and rhett in the movie than was originally written in the book the movie sent the two in two completely opposite ways and they did not seem to cross paths often enough to make it seem like there still could be love between the two a fine movie but i believe that it certainly could've been better than it was had it more true to alexandra book
<START> my 15 year old daughter asked me to watch this movie with her on cable tv as someone who saw revenge of the nerds in a movie theater i found this movie to be an extremely predictable remake of it the nerds were simply replaced by dorks i drove her crazy by being able to predict precisely what would happen in each scene the cast was cute especially amanda bynes br br screenwriter chad creasey should be ashamed for writing such an obvious remake of an early 1980's flick the title should have simply been revenge of the dorks perhaps the sequel will be revenge of the dorks 2
<START> they are hunted and starving they are completely and yet they press on through sheer inertia this film tries to answer the question how far will human beings go to survive hopelessness emanates from every of this film and like so many japanese films of this time it condemns the blind military loyalty that pressed the japanese people into war
<START> a very courageous attempt to bring one of the most intricate books of literature to the screen the story manages to get most of conrad's basic messages across and the acting is superb the liberties taken by the script often deepen the meaning and do seldom distort it compliments to writer and director
<START> like another user i got this cheap i thought 85 Â£8 although not worth that amount of money it is a total classic that i like the other users first saw when i was a kid and was looking forward to seeing again some 20 years after the story is amazingly thin which is why it might have worked for kids but all the radio language and trucker stuff makes up for it it'll look good on my dvd shelf in years to come first viewing 1980 10 10 second viewing 2002 4 10
<START> glorifying not glamorizing world war ii br br we've had quite a few documentary series about world war ii on the regular television programming without looking up any information in some encyclopedia or film book it seems that this old memory can recollect most names entirely on it's own br br there was crusade in europe which was the title of the war memoirs of one general of the army and later the president of the united states of america dwight d eisenhower it told the story of the conflict in europe as viewed by the supreme allied commander br br then there was a crusade in the pacific subject matter self explanatory which i don't remember much about newspaper man author jim bishop was the host navigator of br br and there was the excellent winston churchill the valiant years the series was a co production of the british broadcasting corporation and the american broadcasting company it first aired in 1960 61 season here in the states and boasts of having richard burton's speaking the words of sir winston br br it is the 1952 nbc television network's production of our subject matter today this victory at sea that wins the cigar hands down br br to begin with this had to have taken the production several years of carefully and literally sorting through thousands of hours of film the movie footage referred to here was the official filmed record taken by members of the armed forces of the united states independent newsreel film motion picture record of our other allied partner nations as well as captured axis pictures from nazi germany fascist italy and imperial japan br br once that was accomplished the various corresponding film had to be cut and edited into a series of 1 2 hour installments this was done with great skill being that there were so many scene changes whether done abruptly or as a dissolve the look of ever episode appears as smooth as if it had been a single motion picture project br br the writing of the spoken word to accompany this finest of real life film was no less amazing and unique the highly polished and meaningful eloquence wastes not a word and at times even the description of action rather than exaggerating it the narration goes to mr ralph graves who was a talented actor of stage film radio and television he certainly gained a measure of immortality by way of his golden toned voicing of the written episode descriptions br br lastly victory at sea enjoys the luxury of having an original score both opening theme and incidental music penned by richard rodgers of broadway fame rodgers hart rodgers hammerstein his compositions are intricate full variable and even classic in the true sense br br the classical arrangement was played by the nbc orchestra under the direction of robert russell bennett and as a soundtrack record cassette tape compact disk it has been continually available and in demand ever since its first release 55 years ago and really small wonder for it is this musical score that is so mesmerizing to the viewer listener it truly puts the frosting on this cake br br sir winston churchill the valiant years also had a beautiful and highly memorable original score this also was composed by mr rodgers br br we had in additional ace in the hole in our house in the person of our father the late clement j ryan 1914 74 dad had been in the u s navy during the war being inducted in 1943 our pop was always on hand to explain and further elucidate any of the situations that were depicted in the series br br he and our mother the now 90 year old bertha nee ryan already had my older sister joanne 1942 90 as a dependant
