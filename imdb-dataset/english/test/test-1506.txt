<START> i got this thing off the sci fi shelf because i remembered seeing the first of the series when i was a kid i'd rented the second one and it was a decent b sci fi this one was out right obnoxious the special effects on the cars looked like something my 4 year old cousin could have done the two assistant female cyborgs were so terrible that i literally cringed every time they came on the screen the plot left so much to be desired that it made me sick i don't know what anyone was thinking when they agreed to be a part of this movie but i'm sure that they'd have done better to have left it at 2 movies the movies in this series are going from good to decent to terrible i only hope that no terrorist groups have access to this movie as it makes an excellent torturing device
<START> it's bad for ya really showcases more of george carlin's talents he really is still as sharp as a tack it is a shame that we lost him this past year but his comedy will forever live on this stand up special is literally one of the funniest i have ever heard a comedian perform even though he is making fun of small children it just makes you laugh the way he says some of the stuff it is true that carlin can literally make something that seems unfunny and turn it into one of the funniest things you have ever and will ever hear i really enjoyed this stand up particularly from carlin and recommend that those that liked this check out more of george carlin's stand up
<START> i absolutely loved this movie it's my number one favorite although there were a few flaws what movie doesn't have flaws this movie was very well written directed and produced the characters in this movie are very real and believable they made all of the characters fit into a specific role i think that the most apparent thing about here on earth was the love triangle as well as the other emotional situations brought into the movie it's not one of those movies where you just can't seem to relate to anything because in it are situations that everyone is or has been in there are so many different things going on in this movie that it is hard not to relate to it i am just 18 years old and i can even relate to it it was heart warming and wrenching at the same time here on earth will make you laugh cry and sometimes angry i give this movie an excellent review and recommend it to anyone who loves romance and passion
<START> there is only one word that describes this film bad i have no idea why this movie was even made or how they got dennis hopper to star in this film stuart gordon is a better director than this and hopper is a much better actor the film is plain stupid i did like the square pigs idea and there was an interesting love scene involving a cyborg other than that avoid this film at all costs
<START> dr marnie bannister magda is a horribly disfigured woman when one of her colleagues discovers a rejuvenation formula marnie sees it as her opportunity to become beautiful when she's denied the drug because of possible side effects she kills her colleague to get what she wants the drug works and she becomes beautiful but the formula brings out the worst in her and it's not long before she's left a string of bodies behind her br br have you ever heard the expression as exciting as watching paint dry that pretty much sums up during the film one of the characters utters the line something so horrible it's inconceivable i wasn't sure if he was talking about something in movie or the movie itself i'm really disappointed because i had high hopes for this one had possibilities but they're never realized at every opportunity the plot has marnie do the dullest things imaginable the writing is horrible and part of the problem is magda she's not that appealing and cannot carry the film on her own br br another big problem with is the direction and editing it's a mess we see things and places that have no bearing on anything in the movie the camera lingers on shots too long after the scene is over i can't think of a single shot that would call anything but unoriginal this group of filmmakers exhibits little in the way of imagination or talent br br i may not be familiar with the italian comic on which is supposedly based but i'm sure it's got to be better than this
<START> this movie tries its darndest to capture that classic bad canadian movie feel br br quirky and obnoxious characters a few quirky town with quirky folk a quirky coffee shop or restaurant coffee shop here lots of shots of canadian stuff for postcards ocean stuff here lots of mention of gotta get out of this town downright booooring br br and it succeeds on all counts br br something to note though i couldn't figure out whether this movie was just trying to be post northern exposure quirky comedy or something surreal like a drug induced or psychotic hallucination the editing of this movie jumped around from one unrelated thing to another with zero pacing or motivation not to mention the fact that half the time we didn't even know where we were jumping take for instance the very opening shots of yelling teens in a car who are they and what the h did they have to do with anything and this sub uh plot use that word plot loosely kids that seem to span generations i don't think they actually do but the editing makes it look like they materialize from flashback all of a sudden to current time huh what did i miss br br avoid unless for laughs or you want to try and trip out on the inept editing
<START> it's a unique film as it gives us our only chance to see the young noel coward in all his ironic glory because he seems so reserved detached he's perfect for the role of an unloved cad who matter of factly uses all those around him however in the deadly serious no pun intended last act when coward must make like the flying dutchman he's much less comfortable br br but his way with an epigram is peerless and hecht macarthur have given him some gems macarthur really he was the wit of the pair br br the film is superbly lighted by the great lee garmes but has little camera movement aside from a storm sequence hecht and cared about one thing getting their dialogue on screen note h m themselves have blink and you'll miss 'em cameos as bums in the flophouse scene br br the most notable supporting player is the one and only alexander notorious broadway columnist and close friend of both macarthur and coward who appears as one of the bitchy authors always kept waiting in the reception room of publisher coward br br curious that would agree to do a film that clearly lampoons the legendary round table of which he was a founder and macarthur something of an auxiliary member br br the scoundrel actually won an oscar for best story though that victory is probably due more to coward's imposing presence than any brilliance in the plot it's coward and the dialogue you remember
<START> cuba gooding jr will win the oscar for best actor in 2003 and ed harris will win for best supporting actor what a beautiful and poignant film it is but be sure to bring along a box of tissues because if this film doesn't get to you then you have ice water in your veins br br it was 1976 the setting was in south carolina and the civil rights act was about ten years old we have a white high school football coach and teacher ed harris then there is a black retarded frightened but pleasant fellow cuba gooding whose greatest possessions including a radio are piled into a shopping cart which is also used as his bicycle br br ed harris takes a keen interest in the fellow for a reason explained much later on in the film he gives cuba the nickname radio and what follows is an riveting engrossing poignant exploration of the human soul br br the movie is nothing short of a masterpiece
<START> it's not plot driven ok it's not a character study fine there's no action alright there's no point hmmm br br maybe it's supposed to represent the boredom and absurdity of living in and parts of israel these days in a state of violence petty disagreements deep rooted hostility etc but mostly it's long long scenes of nothing happening or things which look like they're dripping with meaning a checkpoint tower crashing to the ground an balloon floating into jerusalem a crouching tiger women bullets into a halo but when you try to derive some meaning there's no there there br br bonus you can watch this film in fast forward and it will make absolutely no difference except that it might be slightly less boring
<START> stanwyck at her villainous best robinson her equal as ruthless land in this fairly ordinary western br br some good action scenes strong use of location colour and cinemascope but why the obvious use of stock footage in the stampede scene br br ford is dependable as always and foster is strong as robinson's daughter but it is the baddies' film and it's not just stanwyck and robinson brian keith makes a surprisingly dashing villain as stanwyck's lover and richard jaeckel is unforgettable as a cold hearted killer br br see it for the camp value
<START> we're both stumbling around together in this unformed world whose rules and objectives are largely unknown seemingly indecipherable or even possibly nonexistent always on the verge of being killed by forces that we don't understand so says ted in the film which for some people sums up life and probably is a film about existence what is real and what is unreal and how you tell the difference or not the last line of the film is superbly ambiguous br br the film seems like a shaggy dog story indeed it has a real shaggy dog in it but it takes you along on an interesting ride full of provocative cronenberg touches that will make you look at amphibians game pods fish spines and bones in a new light some bits are quite icky it takes place in a rural setting where the gas station is called and a chinese restaurant is called 'chinese restaurant 'the film has an engrossing texture that is leagues away from your usual big budget science fiction movie you can read many things into the film and it repays watching more than once br br the main actors are jude law who is ok and jennifer jason leigh who is great some roles don't suit this very talented actor but when she has a good role like this she is unmatchable her unconventional beauty and fascinating voice suits the part of looks great in a short black skirt too there are other familiar actors but they are not given much to do it looks good sounds good and a howard shore score complements the film very well cronenberg is possibly the alfred hitchcock of the sci fi horror genre no matter what film he makes he is always worth watching
<START> in efforts to make a somewhat comedic yet serious movie about the art of growing marijuana stephen gyllenhaal director fell a few bong rips short of a good movie while the cast is nothing short of amazing this movie is extremely hard to sit through the acting of billy bob thornton ryan phillipe jon bon jovi hank azaria and kelly lynch couldn't even save this movie from failure it would be wiser to flush three single dollar bills down the toilet then to check this movie out at the local video store br br
<START> hoot was terrific the owls are adorable and the movie highlights an interesting environmental issue i didn't know existed florida is full of so many fun characters and the film does a great job of bringing that to the screen my kids particularly loved all the different animals from snakes to owls to alligators it's really a simple story but also one that they need to hear at this age when kids are young that's when they really develop their sense of values and yes one of those must be caring for our environment and all the creatures that live in it i think it was great that the film even sparked a conversation with them on the ride home about animals and how to help them it was just truly sweet and enduring to hear my little girl talk about how she wanted to save the baby birds anyway overall it was really a great time and i'd recommend the movie to anyone looking for something entertaining and meaningful
<START> this has got to be one of the most magnificent things i've ever seen on film i don't know if it's as serious as it seems to try to be but that hardly matters this film is extreme absolutely wild and surreal the packaging and the marketing only make it more so because you know that ever so often some mother has to reprogram her kid to accept our reality after he checks this out from the video store expecting something completely different look at the for one thing and where else in america can you see a ten year old kid swear as much as this one does and then get his eye ripped out by pervert the rival of pulp fiction's zed and that food inspector scene is the best the amount of well known to vaguely recognized actors in this film is one of the best things about it soon much sooner than you realize you too will find yourself saying is that meat loaf is that drew barrymore is that the doctor from star trek voyager is that flea is that the owner from twin peaks gassing squirrels with car exhaust and isn't this guy from the new rob zombie movie he looks an awful lot like shrek i think my favorite scene is at the very end with phil in a full body cast i mean please why aren't more movies like this shown in airplanes this director hardly has anything else to his name higher than return to salem's lot but he displays true stumbling man child genius in this creation if you're an intellectual looking for something to p s away your evening on i highly suggest this film for satisfaction this movie's plot is all too ridiculous but imagine it taken out of context boy arm wrestling an over aggressive meat loaf who seems hell bent on taking out his anger at not being accepted into guns n roses looks over his shoulder and sees the doctor from voyager enter the bar can you imagine what any half brained channel surfer active through the last six years would think of seeing that now imagine if you actually cared about meat loaf or voyager to begin with or imagine if you're a flea fan rocky horror picture show fans this film contains notable music mind you but its soundtrack is more plasticine than mad max 3 what does that entail for you this is the retarded inverted mongoloid cousin sister mother puppy of the rocky horror picture show how about when sleeve flies back onto his arm in an act of cable access special effects quality when i saw this film it was on the suggestion of my cousin who had watched half of it in a fit of half aware childhood in the early half of the nineties and who has since been haunted by vague memories of it i myself had not slept in three days it made me laugh of course it's also an anxiety movie the music doesn't encourage the suspense but it eventually gets to the point where it's been fully established that the american censorship committee has obviously missed this film entirely and absolutely anything can happen in it and probably will any time gus turns a corner or the view so much as changes camera angles i found myself obsessing over the possibility of those cards flying out his window at any second watch this movie awesome
<START> you could have put the characters on the island for any reason at all and had the same movie the first one had an original story the second stole one from king kong and in the end i hope of this trilogy the story seemed to have been bypassed altogether drop some people on an island full of dinosaurs and watch them run for their lives that was about all there was to it the special effects were decent but not worth 8 dollars if you have a discount theatre in your local area wait and see it for a buck i wouldn't even bother renting it that would be too much money for this thriller
