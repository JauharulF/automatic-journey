<START> as a native of the city where the story takes place buffalo ny it's fun to see the local sites but the story line is so local and fun too br br the small scale promoting of this film requires strong word of mouth to accomplish the wide viewing it deserves please make this film the success the big fat greek wedding was
<START> this is like a school video project and a propaganda film that puts the whole class as well as the teacher to sleep br br utterly boring long silent yes silent strings of unrelated video clips br br instead of this movie watch the paint dry or the grass grow it will be more interesting unless you enjoy seeing arabs being malicious to everyone around them br br the director should be embarrassed of this lame waste of film br br it deserves a one for the movie quality a zero for the ridiculous propaganda message and a negative number for the script or lack thereof
<START> i saw part of this film on the sci fi channel but missed the ending i bought the dvd to see the whole movie and i'm glad i did br br a young mother and her two daughters move into a house out in a backwoods area that they inherited from the husband who died from an illness it's very run down but the three women make the best of it the teen daughter scout taylor compton is warned by a local boy about the zombies that come out at night she ignores him but since he has a cute friend she joins his group meanwhile the younger daughter chloe grace makes a friend in a zombie girl her age named mary it turns out that mary and several other kids died in a mine in 1913 while working as child labor now that they are zombies they attack and kill anyone who's not a blood relative br br this movie was directed by j s cardone whose previous films include the slayer 1981 and 1990 two movies i didn't like in the slightest bit this is why i was surprised that i actually enjoyed this movie the film is deliberately paced which i liked this allows you to get to know the main characters most of whom are likable child zombies have been used at least since george romero's 1968 classic night of the living dead still i found the tool using child zombies in this movie interesting it would seem that cardone finally found the right script and cast only the stereotypical scenes of the teens smoking drinking and making out in a parked car were boring to me br br taylor compton also appears in the halloween remake appeared in the amityville horror 2005 and the horror film room 6 2006
<START> i've never seen the original movie others have commented on so my perspective is just about this movie without comparison br br i found the message of the movie to be if you only worry about yourself all will be right with the world everything will fall into place your lovers will love you more your friends will respect and like you more your employers will want you more pay you more and even your own children and parents will love you more br br i find this message to be reprehensible and totally false br br kudos for the very funny birthing scene at the end there isn't a mother out there who won't laugh during that scene br br overall a very disappointing movie plot i didn't find myself rooting for anyone in this movie i thought they were all pathetic self absorbed individuals that i just didn't care what happened to them and that's not a movie people want to see
<START> blind images are great the action draws you in completely even though the movie is a bit long by the end credits all that you can think about are the film's positive high points the lead actors have the most incredible screen presence the story is heart wrenching the film score is nicely understated completely moving in its own powerful way not your standard melodramatic cuing trance like moments add poetic resonance to the engrossing narration and terrific visual compositions hope you get a chance to see this film it delves into some dark territory but you come out of the tunnel seeing nothing but white light
<START> the movie gets a score of 3 because it dared to be so very different it features a cast acting while you can hear their thoughts and desires this is truly a weird film and an experience i won't forget the only problem is that the experiment though in some ways interesting is generally quite dull and unengaging in fact it's amazing that a norma shearer and clark gable film could be this dull the film is based on a eugene o'neill play and it really does seem quite stagy in fact it would have been best just to keep it as a stage production it just didn't translate at all to the big screen br br so this movie is only recommended to die hard and those who love gable films so much they just have to see all his films
<START> the tunes are the best aspect of this television film which has admittedly better than average production values but very surface and slightly altered biography dramatizes richard's discovery of we've only just begun and karen's marriage troubles admirably the superstar montage was a nice touch yet notably leaves out the disagreement with neil the contribution of tony guitar solos etc is sweet in her karen persona but it doesn't include the tomboyish and sides of the real carpenter's personality anderson is in fine form as the creative and take charge richard and fletcher makes her mark as the loving but overbearing agnes the most haunting moment of the original broadcast is the use of goodbye to love in the background of a commercial displaying an anorexia hotline
<START> if you're looking for a movie that's fun to watch simply because you can make jokes about the not so great acting cheesy special effects and typical sci fi plot then this is the movie for you not at the acting was bad in fact a few actors were actually fairly decent the special effects weren't the greatest to say the least the animals looked completely computer animated there was an annoying squawking to cover up the swearing and there was only one song played over and over again throughout the entire movie overall a good movie if you're looking for something completely cheesy and fun to make fun of not a good movie to watch if you're looking for something serious
<START> there is nothing mean spirited or evil about this movie it's just terribly dull dull is the photography the film stock appears old and faded and washed out maybe it was even 16mm blown up to 35mm dunno dull is the script which is tedious and ish that is kind of 1960s nova cocktail party cool like our beatnik grandparents might have spoken if they were trying to appear really straight the of life' characters were mostly annoying true they were real to life but hey if i wanted to see truly ordinary people doing really mundane and ordinary things i'd just watch myself i wouldn't all the way down to a cinema and blow five quid and an evening watching someone else do it br br i expected a funny bright rom com what i got was more like what two intelligent and moderately talented 19 or 20 year olds might have produced on their first day with a new video camera br br i gave this a 4 out 10 because it appears that someone tried at least
<START> this show is brilliantly hilarious i started watching in 2007 and had never heard of it before then after one episode i was hooked i'm never home to watch it so my wife bought me the entire series on dvd non stop laughs need i say more i wish it was still on tv because it is definitely worthy and a whole lot better of crap on currently on tv br br i wish they would make a movie seriously who wouldn't go see it kevin james's name alone will bring a huge fanbase to any movie the guy is make your stomach hurt funny br br just a really good down to earth believable show if you have the chance to buy it on dvd do it its worth it
<START> i wanted to see this movie because i am a very huge abbott and costello fan and when i saw it i liked it br br this movie is funny not hysterical but funny i mean i laughed at a lot of the funny parts and i just plain enjoyed it br br though it is not of the best of the perfect straight man and the perfect buffoon you should see this if you really love abbott and costello br br out of all of the abbott and costello movies that i have seen i can't say i've seen one that i hated this is decent funny and entertaining abbott and costello at least made some pretty decent movies in their later years br br all in all i liked this movie it is not one of their best ones but i liked it br br 7 10
<START> this movie would receive a much higher vote from me in general and i will talk about why but first and foremost it receives four stars and should stay at four stars because of the directors ridiculously tasteless portrayal of rape and sexual assault not far into the movie oyama sexually assaults a woman he rescued earlier and while she briefly becomes somewhat miffed by his actions this attitude only lasts about five minutes before loving adoration sets in and carries her character through the rest of the film i know many will argue that it's not that important in a kung fu beat em up and as a fan of the genera i can't say that it's all that unusual but that doesn't stop it from being completely tasteless every time i see it br br what i will say in this movie's defence however is that it's somewhat refreshing to see a martial arts or even action movie of any sort that offers no actual hero for the viewer to get behind oyama is portrayed as a rapist and murderer a societal outcast whose only student becomes completely mentally unbalanced before being gunned down by the police the final shots of the movie leave one with the feeling that oyama himself is poised for a major breakdown and no longer seems to care for the woman he earlier assaulted into loving him and has since followed him with puppy dog like devotion br br whether this was truly the intended message of the movie or not one can't help but feel a little hopeful that oyama might be on the brink of suicide by the time the movie is over this is a rare emotional treatment from the martial arts genre and its interesting to see a film that leaves you with a sense that its violence is not to be celebrated if only karate bullfighter had treated the subject of sexual violence better either by creating more emotional depth and recognition between the two characters involved or by leaving it out all together this would have been a much more interesting film
<START> this movie was flippin awful i wanted those hours of my life back for god's sake stay far away from this awful ball movie at all costs its not worth mentioning the title but the ratings on this movie are pretty generous for a vomit scum movie like this and where do i begin the dumb a kids in the movie the zero plot or story the garden variety college frat boy esquire scenes of towel slapping or the very bad acted teen angst innuendo my god it never ended i remember thinking i would have rather kissed the movie theater floor then sit through this one again br br but what do you expect most people with the brain power to look up reviews are not going to be the target audience here at all so go see 2 again or the jet lee one if your debating to yourself look this movie will just cost you your soul your money your energy and your brain cells heed the warning
<START> i viewed this movie for the first time last night and i enjoyed every aspect of it dancing the acting the dialogue the plot the script and the whole atmosphere that this movie created i would highly recommend it br br jennifer grey gives an absolutely wonderful and first class performance in her role as frances baby houseman she has a natural ability and flair for dancing and she is beautiful and enchanting on the dance floor but what is wonderful about baby is that she has such a wonderful depth and dimension to her character this is not simply a movie about dancing but the scriptwriters have also given us a chance to see baby deal with the various emotions and feelings that she is experiencing throughout the movie and to allow us an insight into how her interaction with others at the camp changes her life grey portrays her character with such realism and poignancy that you end up feeling deeply for baby as she experiences all she does in this movie br br patrick swayze is magnificent in his role as johnny and truly succeeds in making his character come alive he gives his character a comprehensive personality strong appeal and great depth the chemistry between swayze and grey is enchanting and powerful and contributes significantly to the great success of this movie br br cynthia rhodes is great in her role of penny and her portrayal of the ordeal that she experiences is truly powerful and contributes a frightening dimension to the film the other members of the supporting cast orbach and the late mark cantor deserve a special mention here also give wonderful and imaginative performances that gives this movie an additional dimension of high quality acting and believability that is wonderful to experience the dancing is magnificent and first class on the part of all involved br br the script and interaction between all the major characters is intriguing and engages the viewer in a powerful fashion the plot although exceedingly predictable is given more than enough life and vitality to make this movie successful br br furthermore the wonderful selection of music contained in this movie creates a truly magical atmosphere and very nostalgic environment that enhances the quality and success of all the various scenes br br dirty dancing' is a truly powerful magnificent and very appealing movie that leaves you deeply touched and with a wonderful feeling in your heart and soul and an inspiration to dance i highly recommend it
<START> hollywood movie industry is the laziest one in the entire world it only needs a single hit to flood theaters with the same old crap re invented over and over again take superheroes for example for each x man and spiderman there are daredevil elektra ghost rider and hulk japanese horror remakes are even worst it only took the ring which was pitch perfect mostly because of mr gore to bring a ton of look alike creepy woman based horrors e g the ring 2 the eye dark water which was fine but pointless and the grudges br br the first grudge wasn't entirely bad it was scary most of the way which is what one could expect from it plus the plot had some brains mixing narratives grudge 2 is exactly like the previous this could be a good thing but hey what boy men in black ii was it a nice thing to xerox the entire screenplay and just change the villain for the grudge 2 the critic goes the same way br br tired scares bad acting except for amber tamblyn and clichÃ©s all over the place three stories take place on different places and time there is aubrey tamblyn investigating what drove her sister karen sarah michelle gellar to death allison arielle kebbel who is taken by colleagues to visit the house where the incident depicted in the first movie took place and finally an american family that witness strange stuff happening on the apartment next door glad to say and i mean it that everything is tied up at the end but one must not rely on the end to make a good picture when everything else is simply tiresome and dull br br the chills are all over there a girl alone in the lockers someone who shouldn't enter a house others that dig too deep meanwhile ghosts keep killing and killing and killing which seems even more deadlier than ten world wars or the ebola epidemic hey doesn't that seem just like another bad japanese remake something called pulse yeah day after day it's getting easier to hold a grudge against hollywood
