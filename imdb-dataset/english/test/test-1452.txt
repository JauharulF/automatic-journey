<START> i find it difficult to comprehend what makes viewer's feel this is a powerful movie i would guess that the main intention of this film would be a character study and the effects of racism in a british community it is therefore all the more disappointing that all the characters are two dimensional and the acting is at the level of a college performing arts course i'm always sceptical of improvisation another word for being too lazy to write a decent script i was embarrassed by the performances and sat in an audience who laughed when they surely were supposed to be moved by the story racism is a serious issue but i think a subtle approach in cinema works far better than laying it on with trowel
<START> a man is pulled off a london street and taken to some foreign country where he is tortured as a terror suspect dull banal film bored the hell out of me more an idea then a film i was half way into this 77 minute film when i realized i had no idea who anyone on screen was it was as if they took every other similar film and pulled out all of the ideas and put them in one place with out the real notion of character certainly its well acted with passion but there is no emotional center there is just an everyman of sorts which the filmmakers feel is enough its not and while the story presented id in theory important as a warning the film is too dull to convince anyone of it especially if one has seen the other better films of a similar ilk rendition with reese witherspoon for example
<START> a slight case of murder is an excellent tv movie which is defiantly worth the price of a rental william h macy is great as a movie critic who accidentally kills his mistress and then has to try to conceal the crime although that may sound dark the film is actually quite light hearted and funny with many memorable lines acting is harder than i thought you ever see body heat i think i owe bill hurt an apology and my personal favourite for next week answer these two questions about film noir what do these people do during the day and why is it always raining the film has a great supporting cast including macy's real life wife huffman james cromwell and adam arkin a must see for macy fans
<START> okay so i am gazing through my mom and dad's extensive dvd collection mostly because they don't charge late fees and i come upon a thousand acres i was stunned that here was a movie that had jessica lange and michelle pfeiffer with a small appearance by jennifer jason leigh that i had not seen i don't think i had ever even heard of it before well this is exactly the kind of find that i dream about since i have to admit that my parents raised two movie buffs in my brother and me with a few exceptions neither of us can even get them to consider watching the lord of the rings movies but my dad loves the matrix trilogy go figure we have very similar tastes in movies br br it was a particularly awful day today weather wise it poured rain all day so i popped in this movie and shortly after i was mesmerized br br this has to be one of the all time best sleepers i have seen jessica lange and michelle pfeiffer are great in their roles especially since they are playing very different types jessica lange's character is a people pleasing follower who despite her being the senior child in the family rarely takes a leadership role rather she bows to her father jason robards and sister rose pfeiffer and is hell bent on teaching her little sister caroline leigh how to follow suit michelle pfeiffer plays a very strong willed cancer survivor who is barely able to keep the anger at her unhappy life contained this movie is five years prior to white mind you so it was definitely inspiring to see her playing such a strong angry character br br i would have to say that this movie will probably appeal more to women however true movie buffs who enjoy a film for what it is regardless of genre or target audience will have a hard time denying the charm of this touching drama about family secrets and what they do the people involved and those who love them i don't know how i missed seeing this movie before now but it sure was a nice distraction on a rainy afternoon enjoy
<START> we all want to fall in love the experience makes us feel completely alive where every sense is heightened every emotion is magnified it may only last a moment an hour an afternoon but that doesn't reduce its value because we are left with memories that we treasure for the rest of our lives br br i love watching people fall in love it must have something to do with the excellent chemistry between the main characters br br mark elliott a charming sensitive american war correspondent arrives in hong kong at the dawn of the korean war he finds in han an awesome beauty of true grace br br han a lovely eurasian doctor is captivated by mark's tenderness and insight br br it was instant attraction when they first met the two commence a passionate affair leading them to fall deeply in love br br their love is so strong so wonderfully expressed that highlights elliot's married status and the difficulties of the troubled time of the korean war communism and race relations br br holden is an inspired choice for the role not only does he have an imposing screen presence but he brings the perfect mix of enlightenment compassion and emotion to the part br br opposite him oscar winner jennifer jones perfect in her oriental look radiantly beautiful in that traditional and modern asian inspired jones floods her role with personal emotion giving her character a charismatic life of its own she delivers a heartfelt performance turning her character into a woman who undergoes a spiritual and emotional awakening br br her scene in that verdant hill where she takes refuge is exquisitely touching specially when we heard mark's voice whispering we have not missed you and i that many thing br br henry king who has established himself as a masterful director of romances spreads the theme tune by alfred newman in the air above the cosmopolitan harbor his film is colorful elegant with excellent cinematography and set design br br nominated for eight academy awards this beautiful and sensitive motion picture won three best costume design best music and best score
<START> after the general a film that romanticized the life of dublin gangster the general to such heroic proportions that it made the average dublin person sick along come kevin and his attempted portrayal of mr lynch or martin cahill aka the general the acting is so bad that this crime drama becomes a comedy for the native dub and a tragedy for the kevin spacey fan in short is the movie worth a look no unless u like bad acting with hilarious 'proper irish accents ah sure to be sure to be the story is ripped off from the commercially successful 'the general' which despite is glorification of a well known dublin animal in martin cahill is still worth a look on a domestic scale because it shows real working class dublin and on an international scale because of he true irish acting and killer cast including john voight all in all 'ordinary decent criminal' is anything but a decent film avoid
<START> typically i'm a comedy guy i rented this at the video store under comedy and thought albert brooks awesome and rented it it seemed like the romantic comedy and i remembered i hated those and had the full mindset of hating this movie br br boy was i wrong br br while this is a romantic comedy it's acted by an amazing lead supporting cast brooks hunter cusack and nicholson and everything works well within itself the script sounds real and not forced like this could be happening in the news station you're watching at night it takes your emotions and makes you enjoy hunter and brooks and loathe hurt which makes the ending a bit unenjoyable and fruitless but it shows how you don't need a happy ending to end a movie you just need a truthful ending which is what everyone got not everybody's life ends well and it shows in broadcast news maybe people don't like the ending because it's not your typical happy ending associated with romantic comedies but it works it's real and it's genius broadcast news is a classic in it's time and a fine romance movie up there with casablanca well maybe not that high but it's the only other romance i can think of that i like br br broadcast news 9 10
<START> dogtown and z boys is a documentary about the skateboarding team and their influence on skateboarding it also focuses on the history of skateboarding it was directed by stacy peralta a member of the original team and was written by stacy peralta and craig another member of the team the documentary stars the members of the team and is narrated by sean penn br br the documentary talks about the beginning of skateboarding and how it evolved from surfing it discusses popularity in the late 60s and the 70s its decline in the 80s and its in the 90s skateboarding was introduced in dogtown the nickname of the poor side of santa monica california the team originated from the surf shop which manufactured the first modern skateboards the documentary mainly consists of the original team members talking about the past in the team the competitions they won and their popularity and prestige it focuses on three particular members of the team peralta tony and jay adams three of skateboarding and probably the best three members of the team br br the interviews in the documentary were usually voices over archival footage from dogtown in the late 60s and 70s very rarely to you actually see the people being interviewed but when you do they are shown in black and white while the archival footage was in colour i think stacy peralta used this technique to show that the documentary was about the past i e the glory days of the team and not the present the documentary is very fast paced in that we often see clips of impressive skateboarding over up beat music of the era such as jimi hendrix led zeppelin and david bowie and the interviews tend to be quick and to the point knowing nothing about skateboarding i e not even knowing how to ride one straight along the ground i was very surprised that i found this documentary so interesting the reason is that this doco was more about the team than the actual sport of skateboarding so while i couldn't relate to skateboarding i could relate to the boys in the team because it was made by actual members of the team it gives it a little more depth and authenticity br br all in all i would have to say this is one of the best documentaries i have ever seen it gave me a whole new insight not just into the team but into skateboarding as a whole for those who love skateboarding i can only imagine how it must be even more interesting seven and a half stars out of ten
<START> few would argue that master animation director hayao miyazaki is one of the few to hold this ability br br no too many are focused on john amazing ability to steal other movies plots turn them into pretty puppet shows and then be lauded as a genius but i digress br br miyazaki has given us film after film that deals with important mature issues usually ecologically themed and has an intelligent script that even the most jaded viewer who would normally despise any film that was animated could thoroughly enjoy if given the chance still miyazaki almost never forgets who will undoubtedly be in the audience of these movies children br br that said i am at a loss to think of another filmmaker with this ability where else are you going to have a film where a three year old my nephew link will sit still throughout the move enthralled a 7 year old my niece amber loving it all her own and able to appreciate the star power of frankie jonas and noah cyrus a 12 year old my nephew aaron who's review was of course it was good everything miyazaki san does is good a 32 year old animation fan brought to tears by the powerful directing and gorgeous animation er that would be me and a 58 year old woman my mother able to connect with the mother characters and i'm betting the older too and loving the cuteness of the child characters br br and that is what i respect most about miyazaki san he seems to speak to his audience in a completely different way than the average filmmaker on the surface could be seen as a simple story about a little fish girl who gets a taste of the human world and wants to join it and the friend she makes there a little boy names somewhat like the little mermaid but there is an entire different level at play here true to form miyazaki his film with intensely strong female characters mother mother the older ladies in a nursing home are all genuine characters with minds of their own and extremely strong willed br br but the girl who takes the cake is herself once she decides that she likes the human world she simply uses her own will to achieve her dreams her father is trying to keep her innocent and keep her a magical fish but young knows what she wants and becomes human out of simply her own determination br br once human she teams up with her friend whom she loves very much although maybe not as much as ham is asked to be the man of the house at age five when his mother lisa decides she has to help the people at the rest home where she works during a typhoon that has been inadvertently caused by on her quest to become human frankie jonas yes he's related to the jonas brothers can we just get past that please gives perhaps the best performance in the film as young which is good since he has the most lines his character is also strong willed but also very respectful and friendly characteristics you're not likely to find in a child character on this side of the pacific br br in the end father fujimoto must cope with his daughter's decision and his wife's wishes to allow her to be human he hopes that and will remember him fondly and once again miyazaki refuses to allow a character to become the stereotypical bad guy although miyazaki has for some reason received some criticism for this it is honestly what makes his movies magical and yet relatable no one in real life is completely a bad person all humans are various shades of gray and that is exactly what miyazaki does with his characters br br and then there's the animation itself in a time when cgi would certainly have helped with the copious amounts of effects shots in this film especially the water miyazaki has chosen to incorporate no cgi whatsoever certainly the hand drawn animation was colored by digital means but every film in this was hand drawn and i for one was extremely grateful for that the character animation was extremely fluid and there even appeared to be some lip sync going on quite unusual for an anime film the backgrounds seemed to be rendered with colored pencil and had an effect all its own on the audience this is what animation used to look like and what it should look like br br in the end i found to be thoroughly enjoyable certainly not miyazaki's best in my opinion that honor is still held by kiki's delivery service but still a 10 star fun movie for the entire family
<START> 'o brother where art is a gleeful retelling of homer's 'odyssey' set in 1930s mississippi and rampant with splendid quirkiness that is the trademark of the brothers coen three hapless convicts make their escape to find treasure and more than their share of adventure in this delightful film george clooney is in fine ingenuous form as the chatty amiable leader of the trio but the real acting kudos go to john turturro and tim blake nelson as his goofy but lovable cohorts dubbed the bottom boys' by clooney's character after they receive baptism by full immersion in a river the three cut a record under that homespun nom de plume for the cash and unwittingly become overnight sensations with veritable 'rock star' status the film is accompanied by enough music and songs to almost qualify it as a musical and there are some incredible feats of film making here the scene at the kkk rally is a real doozy and is so similar to the scene when dorothy's friends rescue her from the witch's castle in 'the wizard of oz' that it almost amounts to cinematic plagiarism and what an amazing work of plagiarism it is without giving away the ending i must say the climax of the movie is one of the most breathtaking sequences put to film in recent memory on a par with the spectacular finale of 'magnolia' another one of my favorites 'o brother' is a must see a perfect 10
<START> normally i don't like chuck norris films i appreciate his work as a martial artist and his fight scenes are usually fairly well choreographed chuck is undeniably one of the martial arts greats so in my local used bookstore i found a film i hadn't seen before and took it home br br while the acting in this movie was worse than most norris films i was hoping to see at least one fight scene i quickly began to realize that this wasn't a typical norris film rather it was a christian film destined to illustrate the good will win out paradigm br br there is really nothing on the packaging to indicate that this is a christian film with the exception of the label goodtimes entertainment which i had never heard of before i'll certainly keep that in mind the next time i see a film from that company br br i don't have a problem with christianity i do have a problem with sneaky proselytizing if someone is going to make a religious film at least have the good sense to indicate to the viewer that such is what they will get the only redeeming part about the exercise is that i spent only 3 25 to spend 97 minutes to watch a great martial artist not fight at least it was during supper time and i spent some of that cooking and eating br br in short if you're looking for a mediocre martial arts film and not hoping for much don't bother with this film because it doesn't even offer that
<START> really bad italian horror movie a sort of remake of hammer infamous frankenstein must be destroyed this time with a lady frankenstein taking over the business from father a few nudes several botched bits of dialogue no tension at all forgettable
<START> i expected a lot more out of this film the preview looked interesting so i decided to check it out bottom line is that the adventures of sebastian cole only had one decent thing adrian grenier br br i really like grenier and found his performance to be very pleasing the character is designed well but everything else sort of just drifts along through the duration of the movie clark gregg is really good but i don't think that his character was explained too well i mean there's not too much to explain he wants to become a woman still something was missing br br the obvious low budget of the film was nice to see i enjoyed that the movie was filmed on just a script a bad one at that and just a few actors it was a nice change br br while the main idea of the film was actually okay it became disappointing to see a lot of scenes that had nothing to do with it just thrown in here and there like i said the script looked promising and i must say that i was interested where director tod williams was headed but it was basically a very slow movie with not too good of dialogue br br sebastian started to look good towards the end but again it fell right back down into a hole the acting was mostly good the writing is in need of some work yet the budget of the film helped it out in the long run br br i would recommend this to someone if they wanted to watch a quiet movie with a strong lead character but other than that i would stay away personally i wouldn't watch it twice
<START> a combat veteran fresh from completion of training reunites with an old friend in manila and gets caught up in a power struggle with a ruthless land baron br br but do you really care about that if you're even reading this page you must know something of what to expect it's your typical chop socky complete with ridiculous dialouge mega corny villains apocalyptic sound editing and a camera that begs for your attention the only reason for being seen in public with this film is the fight sequences wonderfully choreographed by mike stone and true master sho kosugi franco nero ain't no slouch either assuming you can see around the mustache br br well i'm being too harsh there are some good laughs enjoy christopher george repeatedly screaming ninja and delivering arguably the goofiest death scene ever captured on film
<START> if the caper genre owes a lot to walter huston it also has a debt of gratitude to jules dassin a man that was ahead of his times and who suffered a lot because of his blacklisting when edward accused him of being a communist the end of his american career would have meant the end of mr dassin but moving to europe proved he was bigger than the same people that had contributed to his hollywood demise br br rififi is an elegant film in which all the right elements come together thanks to mr dassin's vision he decided to adapt auguste le novel because he saw the possibilities for turning it into a caper film that became an instant classic jules dassin was penniless in paris when he discovered the city that were going to serve as the background to his film the bad weather paid off for mr dassin as the streets were always wet and not much had to be done to show them that way br br when we first meet tony he is playing cards tony appears to be in bad health he coughs all the time and sweats profusely after losing all his money he goes to see jo the swede who tells him about a possibility for a robbery at maupin webb the fancy jewelry store at a tony section of paris they pass the idea through mario who suggests cesar the milanese an expert safe cracker br br tony who has come out of prison recently learns that his former lover is now with a creep that owns a night club upon confronting instead of love all he feels is contempt and the meeting ends badly and he throws her out of his place has no love for tony who is his natural enemy because of his connection with br br when the day arrives the gang is able to get to the apartment building where on the second floor right above the jewelry store the owner lives but he is away everything goes well and the gang gets away with the jewels cesar the milanese a typical ladies' man takes a ring as a souvenir which in turn he gives the chanteuse at the night club this tactical mistake is the spark which unravels the well thought plan br br jean made an excellent tony he showed a tired man who was possibly doing his last robbery carl robert manuel and the director jules dassin are seen as jo mario and cesar the quartet jewelry thieves marie plays marcel plays with a subdued intensity robert hussein who would go to direct movies later on makes an impression with his remi one of men br br the film best asset is the great camera work by philippe who captured the atmosphere of paris and the locales where all these criminals operate from georges music plays well with the action in the film jules dassin was peculiar in his choice of films that he directed and unfortunately that is our loss because this man was a genius as proved mainly with the naked city night and the city and rififi
