<START> you can't really blame the movie maker for glorifying che because the industry is all about money most of the stories you hear about this freedom fighter are absolute tripe fabricated by the communist cuban government after che's death che was a murdering scumbag from day one here's a list of the great things che did for cuba 1 executed thousands of innocent cuban men women and children to satisfy his lust for power br br 2 destroyed cuba's economy and good standing with the rest of the world the cuban used to be equal with the american dollar now it's basically worthless br br 3 continually failed at all things that involved diplomacy economy and the military he never made it past his first year in medical school and he was only in one real battle in which he surrendered with a fully loaded gun br br 4 he took over the largest estate in cuba to set up for himself he had a yacht a 60 custom made tv from america a swimming pool and a view of the ocean so much for shunning the life style br br cuba today is an absolutely destitute country and you have no one but che and the castro brothers to thank for it if you go to cuba today you will not be allowed out of the tourist areas if you did manage to get out of what you're meant to see you would find slums beggars and prostitutes br br if you think any of what i'm saying is untrue then go do some studying compare cuban exports from 1950 60 to those of today talk with people who survived or who had parents in the so called cuban revolution of the 1960's read all of the reports of murdered innocents read the reports from people who served under che and castro and fled because of what an evil disgusting human being he was br br and please please always remember to read or watch everything objectively stop taking everything at face value and think about it
<START> clayton moore made his last official appearance on screen as the masked man in director lesley epic adventure the lone ranger and the lost city of gold co starring jay as his faithful indian scout tonto was an old hand at helming westerns during his 40 years in films and television with over a 100 westerns to his directorial credit this fast paced horse opera embraced a revisionist perspective in its depiction of native americans that had been gradually gaining acceptance since 1950 in hollywood oaters after director delmar daves blazed the trail with the james stewart western broken arrow racial intolerance figures as the primary theme in the robert schaefer and eric screenplay having written 13 episodes of the lone ranger television series schaefer and each were thoroughly familiar with the formula but they raised the stakes for this theatrical outing our vigilante heroes ride to the rescue of indians who are being murdered by hooded white hombres for no apparent reason the mystery about the identities of these assassins and the reason behind their homicidal behavior is revealed fairly early so that you don't have to guess what is happening br br although the violence in this saga appears tame by contemporary standards the fact that the lone ranger shoots a bad guy to kill in one scene rather than wound and that a dastardly dame slays a double crossing accomplice by hurling a that sinks into his back between his shoulder blades was pretty audacious the television series never went to this length and when the lone ranger wielded his six gun he shot the gun out of the villain's fist rather than blow him away the other discrepancy here is the indians lynch one of the raiders and torture him for information but they are never brought up on charges from abducting this henchman douglas kennedy didn't have the villainous statue of lyle bettger who menaced the masked man in director stuart the lone ranger but he acquits himself well enough as a cowardly outlaw who kills one of his own henchmen without a qualm when the miscreant threatens to divulge his name and the identities of his cronies to a band of vengeful indians br br the lone ranger and the lost city of gold opens with a recap of the masked protagonist's origins as an ambushed texas ranger and his transformation into the lone ranger with tonto serving as his sidekick this opening two minute refresher is an excellent way to get a series oriented character off to a start so that everybody including non lone ranger fans is on equal footing the primary plot about a gang of ruthless white wearing hoods and hooded raiders begins with them killing indians and stealing worn around their necks the lone ranger and tonto arrive too late to intervene but they find a baby hidden nearby taking the baby and the dead indian they ride to a nearby spanish mission supervised by padre vincente esteban ralph moody of the outsider and turn the infant and body over to him initially the padre has to assure an indian maiden lisa of gaby that the masked man means them no harm and is their friend padre sends tonto off to town to fetch the doctor dr james rolfe dean of gun fever and tonto promptly runs into trouble in the form of the paunchy town lawman sheriff oscar charles watts of giant who abhors indians tonto tries to see the doctor who is treating prisoners in the sheriff's jail and men start to rough him up when rolfe intervenes and rides back to the mission br br eventually the lone ranger and tonto are able to capture one of the hooded raiders but an indian maurice of drum beat and his fellow braves abduct the henchmen and take him back to their village they stake him out and shoot arrows at him to loosen his tongue chief villain ross brady douglas kennedy of hell's crossroads and his cohort william lane bradford of devil's canyon ride out to the village and brady uses his winchester to kill his captured henchman little does brady know that his henchman talked the lone ranger and tonto arrive not long afterward and for his perfidy tells them what the man said before he died and the lone ranger decides to adopt a disguise so that he can learn more he masquerades as a gentleman bounty hunter with a mustache and faux southern accent br br despite its concise 83 minute running time the lone ranger and the lost city of gold lacks neither excitement nor surprises keeps the action moving ahead at a full gallop the dialogue is largely expository rather than memorable as schaefer and push the plot ahead more often than spring surprises but there is one major surprise that ties in with the good indian theme there is also a scene where the lone ranger pushes his own credo about justice available for everybody under the law at a time when supreme court chief justice earl warren had embarked on the high court's landmark decisions that recognized and mitigated against the conditions surrounding racial segregation civil rights separation of church and state and police arrest procedure in the united states one thing that differentiates the lone ranger and the lost city of gold from its predecessor is its epic scale with flashbacks to the age of the spanish conquistadors with a slight bit of science fiction involved in the form of a destructive meteor generally lone ranger stories confined themselves to the 19th century without dragging in european history no the lone ranger wasn't the first movie to deal with spanish conquistadors robert d webb's the seven cities of gold 1955 concerned the spanish searching the southwest for the eponymous places but western beat gordon douglas' gold of the seven saints 1961 to the screen
<START> in this offering one only has to view the current kennel club's annual offering to see the parallels outrageously funny and captures the true essence of the competition one can only imagine the wit of the producers and the amazing ability of the performers i too would have nominated this movie for a globe award and feel it is one of the funniest i have ever seen
<START> was okay but hero high was my favorite when i was a kid i mean before there was sky high 2005 and zoom 2006 there was hero high a school for super hero's in training teenagers with super powers would help police capture bad guys and other times they would get in embarrassing situations like the greatest american hero 1981 it was a fun cartoon to watch what was also fun was the live action stage show called the kid superpower hour with the actors who voiced the characters also dressed has there characters in the show rex ruthless john berwick misty magic fields weatherman jim captain california chris who also sang the theme song dirty trixie glorious gal becky who looks like the love child of superman and wonder woman and punk rock johnny the whole cast just went with anything when it came to the jokes the cartoon was a fun superhero comedy i shore up it will come back in live action like fat albert 2004
<START> i am very open minded i watch all kinds of programs to the end good or bad just to give them a chance and learn from the good aspects and bad ones this show had potential to be good but my god what were the writers casting director and director thinking the cast of actors are terrible with the slightest exception of meryl mimi rogers and darcy joy being given occasional good lines with the best execution of the lot br br the rest of the cast kill the show it is the same story line in every episode sam has plans to do something his boss disrupts these plans by assigning him ridiculous work projects then the foolish ways sam tries to accommodate both in a manner that is primarily stupid and lacks any real intelligent humor this is every episode it gets very tiring br br season 2 they ditch the eye candy the 2 hot girls in the show get written out yet the brother stays explain that casting cut to me please i can see why they wrote them out they had no substantial role but they didn't add anyone better to replace them br br the cocky derek character is given a continuous appearance in season 2 his acting along with everyone else's resembles many poor sitcoms from the 80's might have been funny then but painful now br br the show could have been so much better with a few good writers and some people who had any talent to execute them this show lacks everything production quality is the only good aspect of the show it is great in that regard unfortunately the content is painfully sad br br my god fox was there really nothing better to choose from i'm sticking with shows like it's always sunny in philadelphia or 30 rock for now the bar should be set by programs like these that actually assume the audience are intelligent and aren't continually drooling on themselves using all their brain power on continuing to breathe
<START> i saw this last night and voted it an 8 since then it's grown on me and i'd give it a 9 br br the film has at first a seemingly slightly disconnected facade between the first and second halves the first half is a comedy and there's little hint of the ragged truths of eras life wars religious intolerance that will become revealed in the second half while at first it may be a little disconcerting because it's a slightly unfamiliar narrative sequence on reflection it works br br the acting was good in the role of alex the interpreter was especially great br br i've scanned most other user comments and see that some who've read the book are pleased with the movie while there are a few who are not both feelings of course are valid br br for me a retired family therapist and one world believer the film was relevant on two different levels br br the first as history gave a powerful reminder of how commonly happen with demonizing and trying to exterminate any of those with a different moral value system than our own br br the second was that in demonstrating the first it also revealed something in common to each of us all our families that each of us must go back to our roots to more fully understand ourselves br br t s eliot expressed this exquisitely in the 4th of his four when he said we shall not cease from exploration and the end of all our exploring will be to arrive where we started and know the place for the first time br br jonathan goes on a fulfilling journey that any of us would find fantastically illuminating to explore and discover our roots what were those people going through then who were they really before when and during the early years before and after we were born etc br br so the film at first gives us the impression of a comedy then shifts to give us a lesson in history and human deficiencies but through all that it also gives us subliminally a message about each of ourselves all of us would be abundantly rewarded to go back and understand the place from which we first started
<START> is awesome considering that the producers had a meagre budget they have done an excellent job it is a must watch the small kid has done an excellent job with a lot of emotions flowing through his eyes grandfather is at his best the photography is superb technically correct and very creative it helps in adding a lot of emotions to the mainstream content the movie will keep u engrossed and don't be surprised if you are shaken after the movie and the story lingers in your mind for a few days i sincerely hope that they make it to the final oscar nomination br br enjoy and again don't miss it
<START> this fourth installment of the series is the last to get a theatrical release though it feels like a direct to video movie it's ok i guess but nothing special the acting is the worst of seen in the series up to this point and like the third movie there isn't much in the way of imagination also the sentence directed by alan smithee is never a good thing smithee is the pseudonym directors use when they want nothing to do with the movie anyway its an acceptable movie in the hellraiser series but not much more than that it's a slight drop in quality from number three and a huge drop from the first two for me hellraiser iv bloodline is a 4 5 10
<START> text taken from 2001 melbourne international film fest guide br br the title is a pun based on the film's lead actor fabian deliberate mispronunciation of falkland a reference to the film's setting and a rather less than subtle allusion to the secret agenda of its protagonist br br fabian is an argentine national an amateur magician passing himself off as a tourist visiting the falklands soon after it is reopened to its people his master plan is to win the ultimate struggle by seducing and impregnating the local females commencing with the delicious camilla thus an entire generation of half creates the illusion of a documentary and maintains a fish eyed perspective that gives the film a voyeuristic flair and intimacy argentina
<START> i like the concept of csi but the show is spoiled by some seriously wooden acting the medical examiner has the best lines and delivers them in an arch offhand manner that up the story unfortunately he has little screen time br br also why does jorja fox always look and act so utterly unhappy i know that forensic investigation is a very serious business but the characters for the most part seem to confuse seriousness with humorlessness and a complete lack of personality i can't imagine dating either sarah or catherine what would you talk to either one about i'm waiting for the episode when at the end of a shift catherine picks up a remote control points it at grissom shuts him down and wheels him into a closet until the next day
<START> the trailer for this film promised a new twist on the zombie genre setting it in the old west except it's not the real old west of course it's some sort of future west in a world where some apocalypse has as are known to do killed people and subsequently turned them into zombies it's zombie virus time again folks and you know what that means get bitten and become one of them br br so into this dusty and dead filled world comes a hero he's a bounty hunter getting paid for taking care of zombies it's not exactly clear who is providing the funds but it seems a little cottage industry of zombie hunting has emerged but as the trailer tells us there's a problem they are running out of zombies the only way to keep on earning is to infect new towns and cities with the virus br br i think that's not a bad idea for a film but unfortunately it takes a lot more than a good idea and a crowd of people pawing at windows to make a good zombie film what we actually get is a clint eastwood clone the actor's even called clint for crying out loud and his hilarious sidekick trying to bag zombies while trailing some still living bad guys to get some big reward the whole subplot about infecting other towns is only mentioned in passing over half way through the film instead there's a lot of western movie clichÃ©s poor zombie make up and some world class bad acting really bad the sort that wouldn't even make it onto hollyoaks both hero and villain chomp on cigars quips are thrown people get bitten as the movie lurches to a conclusion the only thing worth wondering is whether it's going to end with the clichÃ© of the hero being the only man alive having killed the one he loves or the clichÃ© of him turning into a zombie in the final frame it's the first one by the way this film was written and directed by gerald nott it's the only thing he has done and hopefully it will be his last at the start of the film there is a caption that reads nott entertainment at least they got one thing right
<START> when i first became a father about 5 5 years ago i was prepared for many of the sacrifices i'd have to make i knew i'd have to change diapers and take them to swimming lessons and attend many a freezing santa claus parade but i wasn't ready for the kind of sacrifice i made last night this in my humble opinion is cruel and unusual punishment br br underdog is bad it's not quite karate dog bad but it makes the shaggy dog feel like pulp fiction if underdog were a television show i'd recommend flipping on by not even the presence of puddy and the voice of edwards can save it bow wow br br it was also just about the best 80 minutes i've ever enjoyed james was seated to the right of me and michelle to the left and i spent more time watching their reaction to this talking flying mutt than watching the screen at 5 and 3 years old they were the target audience and this movie nailed the target there's a scene where underdog loudly in another dogs face and michelle thought it was the funniest scene ever captured on film when underdog was flying into outer space james was literally at the edge of his seat mesmerized the kids absolutely loved underdog and that's why i was there that's what last night was all about br br unless you're accompanying someone under the age of ten you have no business wasting a second of your life watching this brutal film but if you are looking to kill 80 minutes with your four year old i won't judge i had a blast
<START> if you love japanese monster movies you'll love this action packed battle pitting an alien invader intent upon conquering the earth and a giant robot with an of super weaponry the alien emporer guillotine from the planet gargoyle has a army of thugs called of course the gargoyle gang as well as an endless supply of immense hostile creatures that are routinely loosed upon the earth to smash buildings make loud noises panic the populace etc a little kid named johnny has the giant robot at his beckon call and sends the robot as needed to beat up and then blast these creatures johnny joins a group of good spies called unicorn and endeavors to help save the world br br in spite of the campy nature unintentionally humorous dialog and the fact that the target audience was obviously children this movie has non stop action colorful characters decent special effects and just happens to be downright fun to watch battle scenes are well executed and frequent as the storyline requires the good guys and bad guys both made sure they had an inexhaustible supply of bombs lasers ammunition and schemes to attack each other in spite of the fact the movie was constructed from edited episodes of a tv series the plot actually develops and reaches an ultimate conclusion br br the film has a positive outlook and appeals to everyone's especially kids' desire to destroy evil in its many forms kids may be the target audience but it's fun for everyone to laugh at its comical silliness yet at the same time root for the good guys to prevail and save the world the acting is cheesy in places but that is the charm there are several lines of corny dialog possibly translation errors or possibly intentional jokes by the movie makers and you'll find yourself quoting these absurd lines later br br admittedly this film is not high in production quality or budget however for what it is campy sci fi it's enjoyable for some laughs i recommend it to anyone with a sense of humor for that sort of thing
<START> i would have to say this is a great movie br br mike judge has an eye things that nobody would ever notice hence office space a statement about the dumbing down of society and that survival of the fittest is mere pipe dream in 500 years that pop culture and mass marketing by wealthy companies tend to rule the day yes there is a lot of potty humor in it and it is to get the story moving and his point across but the genuine frustration on private joe bowers face is priceless and some cases we can all relate to it at some point in our lives br br if you do not enjoy the humor then look at it from a different point of view and watch it again it took me watching it twice to really appreciate this film for what it with said after watching it am going to read a book now
<START> caught this movie on tv and i watched it again i said to myself it's been a long time since i watched this movie so why not and once again this movie thrilled me it is so easy so watchable and so human that i don't know why some people dislike it br br john travolta shines as michael his dance and every move angel that can hardly be related to this word he smokes drinks and he eats like some savage but he's got big heart on his way michael helps all people he meets dorothy winters andie macdowell in her singing and finding a right man frank quinlan william hurt in developing himself as a good and decent man michael even helped dear old pansy jean stapleton that last scene is beautiful when they dance on the street br br travolta had great help in other actors andie macdowell is so beautiful and likable william hurt is great as usual late robert pastorelli shows his talent jean stapleton and teri garr are also good but my favorite supporting actor in this movie is bob hoskins as the tabloid owner br br so we've got here a solid movie about people with a warm story also and attractive cast just don't take this movie seriously and i can guarantee you'll have fun
