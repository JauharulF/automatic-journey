<START> this tatty am adaptation scrambles through the plot of dickens' wonderful book replacing the emotional impact with hurried transitions and any exterior locations with drawings it's not the fault of the actors and the production team that the budget is so low of course but you have to question the point of making this in the first place when there's neither the time nor money to do it justice michael scrooge is far too gentle at the outset making his transformation lack power and this isn't helped along by a lack of reaction from him as he watches the visions the other actors range from acceptable clive paul to non committal bernard lee to seeming like they're about to forget their lines john le mesurier it doesn't even score points for effort to be honest
<START> 4' is basically a slopped together mess for universal studios to try and work a new twist the concorde supersonic airliner into their in the sky' formula br br bogged down with unintentional humor the best of which is when george kennedy sticks his hand out of window at supersonic speed to fire a flare gun at a heat seeking missile following the flight path and the simple fact that these dumb passengers keep re boarding the same plane to continue their flight despite all the problems in the air many stars in this one including robert wagner sylvia kristel alain delon and martha raye as a nervous passenger br br not really related to the other films
<START> i had seen in blackadder and the new statesman so i thought i'd give this film a try br br at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 8 i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasn't at around 8 i threw the dvd into the dustbin and that's where this film belongs br br what ever happened to british humour the humour so fine and witty intelligent and artful that you find in yes minister blackadder vicar of dibley fawlty towers or the fast show the black humour britain is so famous for i don't want to insult anybody but i presume even stupid children wouldn't find this funny they deserve more intelligent fun and you can do better so please do
<START> turd pie br br take x2 franchises par boil for 5 mins stir in mixed cardboard characters non actors work best add 2 tons of clichÃ©s then bake in your plot hole microwave until bored serve with a sprinkling of dawson's crack not a typo br br voila money spinning brain rot for the emo world of generation br br looking for the keys in drain was the best bit br br aside from the first 5 mins its one of the worst films ever made br br utter utter nonsense
<START> it's probably a year since i saw but it has left strong memories of the two main characters jaded photographer and his naive cousin from the village br br it's a long film with very little dialogue and a quite limited plot this has evidently annoyed a fair few viewers but the film constructs such a painfully believable portrait of and that there's just as much emotional tension as in the thriller br br just to be clear there's no padding in this film in the long pauses where no one speaks there as much happening in the characters' emotions and in yours watching them as you could bear go to see it awake and alert and you'll be gripped rather than br br rings true in so many ways and that sincerity is probably its greatest accomplishment people don't grapple with events and problems so much as with each other in fact in the whole film there's probably not one point where the main characters and ex wife are not opposed br br much of it is true the world over country cousin perhaps wilfully naive expectation that a job on a ship will drop into his lap urbanised cynicism and unwillingness to sympathise with br br other truths are more specific to turkey that might be tolerating his stay with gritted teeth veering between macho ambition and wide eyed awkwardness when he tries to get to know a woman br br is undoubtedly a pretty bleak film and one strengths is not to beat us over the head with the themes he explores for me at least i believed entirely in the behaviour of his characters all the little failed attempts to connect and petty cruelties ring so true and yet i didn't leave with a message that the world is like that but instead i got this is how we sometimes treat each other
<START> if you like really shocking movies this is for you the acting is the worst i've ever seen and the story line goes no where if you come across this film in your video shop don't even consider borrowing it the chick on the front cover isn't even the one in the movie i gave this movie 1 10 only because i couldn't vote 0 avoid it at all costs
<START> a brilliant animated piece that was far ahead of its time and certainly far ahead of anything that was being released in mass production at the same point in history the influence of this work upon tim burton's nightmare before christmas is readily apparent one can only imagine how starewicz over every beautifully detailed frame of this masterpiece br br there have been very few animated films of this caliber it's a shame that more people haven't seen this gem br br apparently imdb now requires comments to be at least ten lines long so this is the tenth line this must be something new but i really don't have anything else to say
<START> what often threatens to turn into a soppy and soft headed drama about misunderstood middle class youth ends up a surprisingly shaded and subdued movie by john frankenheimer his first though he had started in television directing among other things an earlier version of this script br br we are still in those semi mythic when teenagers drove and jeans were still james macarthur adoptive son of playwright charles and actress helen hayes and later to enter pop culture as hawaii 5 0's gets involved in a minor incident in a movie theater which escalates to his throwing a punch at the manager whit bissell and being booked down at the police station his dad james daly a big shot movie producer gets the call doesn't listen to his son's version of the story and pulls strings to get him off br br but macarthur keeps carrying a chip on his shoulder which even his sympathetic mom kim hunter can't knock off things worsen in the canyon homestead until macarthur trying to vindicate himself stages a reprise of the original incident br br the movie doesn't quite avoid the attitudes Â and cliches Â of its time but presents them with considerable nuance every character gets an honorable hearing every point of view has its merits and reactions to the movie will depend on what viewers bring to it there are flaws the word crummy ' a standard rebellious euphemism of the era is used about 30 times too often but they're outweighed by strengths the movie benefits from a strong cast most notable among them the excellent character actor james gregory as a police detective and a resolutely non exploitative way of telling its story from a vantage point in the new millennium the hot water macarthur finds himself in may seem a little tepid but the young stranger remains honest and honorable br br
<START> this movie will give me nightmares i will wake up drenched in sweat screaming i didn't make this film please don't blame me i honestly think it would have been more entertaining to watch a fat guy eating lard in his moms basement for a hour or two than to watch this crap i understand money was tight but goddamn what the hell were they thinking there was no thought plot or effort put into this this movie needs a warning please for the love of god don't fund the drama department a the local jc on an other note these are the least likable characters i have ever seen and i have seen movies with hitler in them so lastly take my advice the next time you even think about renting this just pop a few hundred and let the sleep come
<START> i have nothing at all against paul schrader in fact hardcore 1979 is one of my very favorite films but some horror movie fans were in a premature uproar when his original version of the exorcist prequel dominion this one you're reading about right now as it turns out was scrapped by warners and when renny harlin was substituted to spruce things up and make a new version that was more scary in my opinion some viewers were prejudiced and became automatically up for hating renny harlin's take on the subject exorcist the beginning before the first frame of film was ever even for them to judge and i ought to know because i myself went into the theatrical premiere of beginning with stubborn arms folded and prepared for the absolute worst which i was sure had to come imagine my surprise when i found harlin's beginning to be much more serious than i ever could have conceived with a good performance from stellan as a young version of father who was struggling with his faith in god it wasn't a great film by any means but it was nowhere near the garbage i had prepared myself for well in advance sight unseen br br well now i finally have seen the true garbage version and it's paul schrader's dominion prequel to the exorcist it was relentlessly talky uninteresting and insipid stellan troubled priest was nowhere near as interesting as he had been for me in harlin's film and the actor himself not as good in the part for all those who pointed out the obvious cgi effects in beginning guess what they're here in dominion as well remember the silly ending in harlin's rendition which i'll also agree tainted the rest of that movie well you're going to find that this ending from schrader isn't a hell of a lot less lame br br let me also say that i resent the nonsense that's been presented by those who appreciate this film better than harlin's by saying that we're retards or cannot appreciate subtle film making as a person who despises stephen mtv fashioned mummy of '99 and being a true fan of the very suggestive and discreet old horror films of the '30s and '40s i can assure you this is not the case with me at least there was some degree of terror and exorcist type goings on in harlin's beginning this one here is just a real exercise in tedium and a great challenge even for the most certified of insomniacs it's going to be quite interesting to hear horror fans try to convince themselves that dominion prequel to the exorcist was as good as they'd already made their minds up for it to be in advance just as they were already pre disposed to lambasting harlin's beginning the second they learned paul schrader's name was getting soaked with the white out
<START> i love this show it is amazing i can never miss an episode even if i've already seen it the actors are perfect for the parts i love gilmore girls i've gotten all my friends to watch it even their parents watch it now i watch it daily and i usually watch it more than once a day i wish my mom was like my friends say that i talk and act like and rory have a wonderful mother daughter relationship it is a great teen show because they actually kind of learn from watching it my vocabulary has widened from watching gilmore girls lauren graham and alexis bled el are perfect for the parts of and rory i think luke and should get married because chris has left and rory way too many times and has broken heart too many times too
<START> these days ridley scott is one of the top directors and producers and can command huge sums to helm movies especially since he has films like alien gladiator and blade runner to his credit so from this partial list of his credits it's obvious he's an amazing talent however if you watch this very early effort that he made while in film school you'd probably have a hard time telling that he was destined for greatness that's because although it has some nice camera work and style the film is hopelessly dull and uninvolving however considering that it wasn't meant for general release and it was only a training ground then i am disposed to looking at it charitably hence the score of 4 br br by the way this film is part of the cinema 16 european shorts dvd on this dvd are 16 shorts most aren't great though because it contains the man without a head copy shop rabbit and wasp it's an amazing dvd for lovers of short films and well worth buying
<START> i started to take a critical view on this adaptation within the first few minutes but as a dedicated jane austen fan i persevered through to the end however this is not a programme i would recommend to someone unfamiliar with her work as i don't think it does the book justice nor makes particularly entertaining television in its own right there was something about this adaptation that lacked believability many of the costumes and even the actors did not have an authentic look and i found the acting to be at times poor there is no doubt that the actors were all very good looking but this didn't provide enough variety to create really diverse memorable characters it was far too static being set entirely in the same location and missing out fanny's return home which is one of the most interesting parts of the story the best actor was blake who captured the wholesomeness of edmund very well and the crawfords were effectively cast too i do like billie piper as an actress but this role did not suit her and was much better played by frances o'connor in the 1999 version who gave overall a far more subtle and convincing performance jane austen adaptations will always provide a love story to leave you feeling good but unfortunately this is one of the worst i have seen
<START> not as well known as the english american german and french cinema though cinema from sweden from the was also quite good interesting and revolutionary br br this is a movie that is made great by its story the story is told in 'a christmas carol' kind of way in which the death himself confronts the deceased with his past present and what could have been it's of course a story that concentrates on morals and it does this very well the message comes across as very powerful and effective this is of course also definitely due to the effective directing from the father of swedish cinema victor br br the story is based on the novel by other swedish author selma the story is adapted by victor himself who perhaps should had taken out a few more elements to let the story and movie flow better it perhaps takes a bit too long before the movie starts to take form and the story gets clear but when the movie does take form and pace it becomes a really wonderful one br br the movie does not only have a great story it also is a good looking one the movie uses some early and effective effects and uses some different color filters to create the right mood and to indicate what it past present and br br did not only wrote and directed this movie he also plays the main character of course the acting in the movie is over the top at times by todays standards but not as bad as in for instance early german movies was the case and after all this movie is more about its story and morals than it is about the acting so it really doesn't matter much or distracts br br a really great and effective underrated silent movie classic from sweden br br 9 10
<START> this film is the best kung fu film of all time although there is not wire work and special effects like those used in crouching tiger this movie uses ingenuity and creative camera work to create memorable fighting moments and the fight scenes are well choreographed and tight there is a ton of action in this film with lots of great fight scenes but the story is very good too with lots of twists and turns the characters are well rounded and have real depth to them as the motivations for their actions and personality are revealed in a much greater detail than most kung fu films there is some really great camera work in the film with my favorite shot starting as a close up on our hero's face showing his reaction then pulls back quickly to reveal the scene before him that is the cause of his look originally i bought the movie to hoping see some great fight scenes but upon multiple viewings i learned how terrific the acting and story were as well overall a great film
