<START> wired would have to rate as one of the ten worst films i have ever seen the writing and direction show a stunning lack of imagination and i'm sure that most of the actors still cringe whenever anyone mentions this film br br it fails to work either as a tribute to belushi's unique talent or as an accurate account of his short life br br a pointless mess with no redeeming features
<START> marked for death 1990 spends more time on action sequences than it does with focusing on its characters after his first two impressive efforts above the law 1988 and hard to kill 1989 this third steven seagal picture makes the idea clear anyone who opposes him is meant to look like a fool the bad guys are just there to make him look good br br seagal had been steadily building an audience that seemed a bit larger than those that follow the kick 'em up antics of chuck norris or jean claude van damme br br in marked for death seagal tosses aside any pretense at style and heads full throttle into exploitation this film contains loads of graphic violence gore and nudity that seem to be there for no reason other than to please rowdy moviegoers who are unable to distinguish between action pictures that tell a story and those that simply pour on the thrills without rhyme or reason and he deserves some real blame for this lapse in taste as a producer of marked for death br br seagal plays john hatcher a retired dea agent who comes home to chicago where his family is being attacked by a jamaican street gang who attack his sister's house and the film proves that it isn't squeamish when hatcher's niece danielle harris is shot in the crossfire hatcher gets mad and he decides to team up with his old friend max keith david a school gym teacher and charles tom wright a jamaican cop br br naturally hatcher declares war on the chief bad guy a dread locked jamaican voodoo priest called basil wallace a nickname that apparently means outrageous overacting br br and it is almost unbelievable in the way seagal picks off various members of the gang he gouges one guy's eyeball he breaks a guy's back and he breaks numerous arms and limbs br br all logic for this movie is thrown out the window through the glass that is why aren't hatcher and friends indicted for all the property damage they cause or the body count that piles up and how did they get their cache of automatic weapons from illinois to by plane without being detected br br seagal has a clint eastwood stoicism about him that fans once seemed to enjoy and despite the three different characters he's played in as many films each dresses in oriental black and wears a ponytail one of the problems that i have with some of seagal's movies is that the main characters never seem to be in serious jeopardy and because he's the star of course no one can lay a glove on him except for the bad guy br br seagal's heroes are all interchangeable as are most of the plot lines and action sequences regardless of whether he's masquerading as a ship's cook a fire fighter or an l a cop wearing love beads seagal is always seagal which is exactly what his fans want in fact the of these films is such that if i wanted to i could take an old review change the names and have a reasonably accurate take on the new movie not that i'd ever really do that
<START> lucio fulci made a lot of great films throughout his career and the way that many of them featured a bucket load of gore lead to him earning the title 'the godfather of gore' while don't torture a duckling was made before fulci became well known amongst gorehounds and isn't all that gory it's certainly a gritty and nasty little thriller and for my money the best film that fulci ever made don't torture a duckling really is head and shoulders above a lot of the giallo genre in terms of production values and unlike many of fulci's later films everything about this giallo is great the plot focuses on a small rustic community where dead bodies have began turning up the murders are even more shocking because the victims are just young boys shortly after the police convict an innocent man of the crimes a reporter named andrea arrives in the village and decides to start investigating the murders on his own soon encounters various suspects including a sexy young lady named patricia a sinister priest and a local witch who enjoys making wax effigies and sticking pins into them br br while this film may not feature loads of gore it does have two of fulci's nastiest sequences to make up for it the nastiest involves a woman being brutally slaughtered by a group of men in a cemetery while the image of a man falling from a cliff and hitting any number of rocks on the way down is liable to turn some stomachs don't torture a duckling features an absolutely great italian cast barbara bouchet a personal favourite of mine is incredibly sexy in her role as patricia and gets to flex her acting muscles more than she did in many later films tomas is excellent as usual while the rest of the cast is well fleshed out by likes of irene pappas florinda bolkan and marc porel the cinematography on display is stunning and fulci really gives the viewer the impression that he puts a lot of care and effort into every scene the story plays out slowly and it's always interesting as fulci never allows the film to stray too much from the central plot line there isn't a great deal of mystery towards the identity of the murderer but fulci almost manages to keep us guessing right up until the end and don't torture a duckling does climax on a high overall it's a shame that fulci didn't make more films like this don't torture a duckling is his out and out best work and i insist that every giallo fans sees it
<START> if you see this film in the tv listings just ignore it if you're looking for something scary you'll be better off watching reruns of the x files br br previous comments referencing the incredibly poor acting by the female lead are dead on she is almost unwatchable the sum total of her range includes and and and not br br i am the kind of movie buff who enjoys a good 'bad' movie but this is ridiculous there is no direction the plot is as simplistic as the set of numbers they keep throwing at you and much like that set of numbers it ends up having no meaning in the end br br your time will be better spent if you turn off the tv and give your dog a bath
<START> not the best plot in the world but the comedy in this movie rules kelsey grammar is wonderful in this movie another funny guy is rob schneider who will make you crack up with his segments with ken hudson campbell who plays lauren holly plays probably the more serious character in the cast as lt lake bruce dern is a great actor in this movie playing probably the most serious character in the movie the actor i liked the most was toby as nitro all the electric shots his character takes in the movie is hilarious br br plot is a little uneven about lt commander tom dodge who for years has wanted to command his own sub when he finally gets the chance instead of a brand new sub he gets a rusty wwii diesel sub the stingray his crew isn't any better misfits of the u s navy he is then put in a series of war games that shows how an old diesel engine can handle itself against the current nuclear navy things still don't get any better when he finds out his dive officer is actually a female officer to see how women do on actual subs to get the commander position he wants he has to win the war games and blow up a dummy ship br br the movie fairs quite well in fact i laughed non stop when i saw this movie in theaters i loved when they were in silence and farts and everyones reaction to the smell is hilarious br br overall 9 out of 10 this movie is just plain fun to watch it nice to have a movie like this i hate movies that try to be 100 serious
<START> this film offers many delights and surprises when and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch you share general exquisite joy in his partaking of the en even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor br br babette is an artist whose medium is food perhaps no other art form allows the artist to share her creations so directly br br the main theme of this movie the potential that the sharing of food has to transform how people see each other and how they see the world is much the same as the theme of but babette's feast does not hit you over the head with its message the townspeople are conservative puritans but not exaggeratedly oppressive you come to understand and respect them and ultimately to appreciate their humanity br br many issues are raised for you to reflect on the nature of art the contemplation of paths taken and paths not taken the relationship between the spiritual and the physical the effect of environment on behavior the taking of life to give life among others br br the only disappointment for me was general speech delivered at the climax of the meal i expected deep heartfelt observations but i got some vague mystical ramblings the speech had such a minimal impact that i hardly remember it br br but this understated film leaves a lasting impression the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars
<START> i found the film quite good for what i was expecting although i weary because i have a fear of injection needles i sort of came to expect when they were coming so if you're not into needles blood the human body and some good medical fun put this movie back and rent another as the other user commented i was also please at the german attempt at a slasher film i'm an american who just moved to germany to stay with a family and saw this lying on the shelf i love psychological thrillers and i'd say this is somewhere along those lines a character falls into places and feels misconstrued while trying to dig her way out and find some truth to a situation things get a little sticky and other aren't so sure she's on the right track so throughout the film you're kept on edge about who's anatomy you might catch a glimpse of and who's rounding the next corner
<START> for those of us who are part of the real world of ballet this film is completely ridiculous ivan kirov was basically a gymnast not a ballet dancer viola at the time was with ballet theater now american ballet theater and a reasonably good dancer but except for dame judith anderson the acting is amateurish and is completely over the top embarrassingly so i saw this film at age 14 and at that time never having seen a ballet i was very impressed however later in life long after i had completed my own career as a dancer i purchased the video tape of it curious as to what it was like after so many years i couldn't believe how naive hollywood could be about the world of ballet but it was made in the mid 40s before the red shoes or the turning point the latter giving a true picture of the ballet world the entire cast of spectre have now passed away ivan kirov not his real name dying at age 79 it was his one and only film thereafter being kept by a chicago business man so the rumor goes
<START> this film noire set piece suffers from murky sound at least as shown on the inadequate equipment of both the seattle and maine film festivals and murkier plotting while rickman suffers from an american accent old tennis shoes and baggy sweats nonetheless he has moments of stellar scenery chewing and the film offers sinister ambiguity from norman reedus the pretty polly walker and a surprise ending to frequent filmgoers while a beautiful look at the of both maine and rickman due out in video release after a cable airing in march not to be missed by any rickman fan ignore the hooey
<START> while in one country spain luis bunuel and salvador dali combined forces to create the benchmark of short subject cinematic surrealism un chien andalou walt disney and his collaborator ub in america worked on steamboat willie the most prominent of the early synchronized sound cartoons it was revealed that this was not the first contrary to other reports it's also one of the more successfully simplistic and funny of the mickey mouse shorts still in a silent film way the only sounds are little irks and bleeps from the mickey and the animals it also goes by fairly quickly for its less than ten minute run but in these minutes one gets the immediate sense of how much fun disney has with his characters and how the newfound use of sound changes how his creation uses the animals as musical tools there's no story to speak of just random things that happens and occurs because of mickey err steamboat willie on this boat on a river and like the better mickey mouse shorts his lack of speaking acts as an advantage it's a must see if you haven't seen it as a kid but if you have it might still be worth another look
<START> i just watched that movie and was pretty disappointed i didn't expect much to begin with as the premise of the movie doesn't suggest greatness anyway sadly it doesn't even manage to deliver just as stupid entertainment the main problem is probably the acting while i've seen far worse actors in far worse movies the story would require some people to act out as violent maniacs some others as people caught a in really stressing predicament and they fail to deliver that although i watched the german release i watched with the original audio so it's definitely not just bad voice overs or anything like that added to that the german dvd release seems to be cut the killings are all pretty much left out meaning that except for a few semi gory scenes closer to the end the german release doesn't deliver as a movie for gore hounds either can't comment on that for other releases of course the plot has some stupid moments thrown in here and there and the beginning is just hilarious ever heard of a demon visiting a psychiatrist too bad the movie takes itself far too seriously if it was filmed as a horror comedy and changed a bit here and there accordingly it might have worked better the ending is just a huge disappointment br br if you've got really nothing better to do and just can't stand the boredom anymore you might and it's really a weak might consider this movie if there's anything else available to watch or do pick that alternative
<START> quintet marks the only venture of both paul newman and director robert altman into the realm of science fiction it was said of newman that he could not do comedy but he tried until he finally scored a real success in that genre with slap shot but the failure of this film left him gun shy and he never tried it again br br this is one of the biggest downer films i've ever seen it's a futuristic ice age brought on by who knows what but presumably it's a nuclear winter even during the ice age of thousands of years ago the parts of the earth still sustained animal and human life but apparently not here seals have survived and paul newman is a seal hunter on the outside br br but hunters do need a little r r and newman goes to a futuristic city where things are so boring the natives have some kind of game played with six people and it's a kind of russian roulette to win you have to kill five other participants in your game br br it's a sad turn to see what man has come down to which is one of the reasons i just could not get into this story the atmosphere is bleak the story is bleak the people are bleak it's all so bleak no wonder this thing came up short at the box office br br it's a film that just about everyone thinks is never going to be on the top ten list of paul newman films including me br br this is man's future what a bummer
<START> up and coming was a very positive sitcom which brought a tool and or channel that opened the young minds of the black culture the focus and outlook was a message of positivity for our people and hope for change i advise this selection for every american household to experience the struggle and the reward the show was never given the chance to blossom into the idea of middle class blacks becoming business owners of their own the were so compatible with real life that impacted the lives of so many i sincerely hope that the entire volume can be restored and put on dvd for americans to enjoy with their families br br thanks
<START> ignore the bad reviews on here this film is awesome just before dawn is a great example of what can be done in a film with a minimal budget if you have a dedicated crew decent script and a cool idea for a film it's a hell of a lot of fun br br i enjoyed it a lot more than most other 80's slashers because the killer is so unique wrong turn ripped this movie off something fierce there's plenty of blood and scares my girlfriend was freaked out and she watches almost everything with me and doesn't flinch it's got that creepiness to it br br i'd say that just before dawn is the best early 80's slasher out there i really enjoyed it br br 8 out of 10 kids
<START> some modern horror movies are very good strong plot scary moments good acting while others are just unfortunately belongs to the latter camp br br i will rate the movie based on 3 elements plot scary factor and acting br br 1 plot true to the name the movie the plot moves in circle and never really explains itself ok the town is captivated by the spiral curse but why and why do people act so foolishly there is a fleeting attempt to explain about what is happening by the reporter br br 2 scary factor if this was meant to be a horror flick it has failed miserably i can't really remember one good scary scene with plenty of build up to it br br 3 acting very monotonous people walking around saying meaningless phases i can't really feel much empathy for our tragic heroes br br all in all there are much better modern japanese horror movies out there with coherent plot and strong characterization don't bother wasting your time on this wannabe
