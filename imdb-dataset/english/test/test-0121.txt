<START> now don't get me wrong i love bad movies no i adore bad movies troll 2 ouch painful manos the hands of fate just watch go guru the mad monk is that traffic noise in the medieval background ok so that's clear but this is one of those films that was quite obviously trying to be something better but didn't make it why not well it would be easy to blame the plot but heh we've seen worse there weren't too many holes and heh i know there's not a lot of originality in it but then that needn't kill a film the effects aren't bad if you completely ignore the last scene the monster is ok the truck quite menacing so where did it go wrong well i'd love to blame it on the look a like harley so i will comedy and horror are difficult to mix well bad comedy and horror even worse and there's the problem i loathed this guy from the moment he stuck his head up literally the continual of the overly meek adam becomes annoying so annoying that you lose belief that the mildest of people wouldn't react by pushing him out of the moving car door and i thought it was the monster bits that the director was meant to have trouble convincing us of why are bad movies fun well you have great fun poking holes in them laughing at the script all the howlers etc this film doesn't make the coveted category of 'worst movies' because its just bad due to being annoying nuff said don't bother go watch anything else and you'll be a better person for it i promise fade to chants of
<START> one of those tv films you saw in the seventies that scared the hell out of you when you were a kid but still gives you an eerie feeling no great actors or expensive production but everytime that phone rings
<START> i read the comments about this movie before watching it and wasn't expecting much but as a b movie it's a curiosity i guess you have to be a certain type of person to enjoy this kind of thing but i seriously thought it was awesome people should watch it just for the experience because it's totally one of a kind don't expect much of it the acting is poor transitions were obviously done on a pc etc definitely a b movie but nonetheless really worth checking out very funny mild gore and some questionable themes so probably not something to show your gran but for the more adventurous viewer i'd say it's a must see
<START> this was a letdown in many ways the location filming in ireland though quite beautiful at times cannot save this uninspired flick greg evigan and alexandra paul as the married couple trying to get their marriage back on track and who inherit a haunted mansion just aren't interesting characters paul towards the end of the film becomes incredibly annoying and one wishes she would just close her mouth and shut up as it seems she is screaming as if it has just become an olympic event other problems with this film are odd segments that have nothing to do with the core of the film such as the opening sequence with two cleaning women and the woman in a bed with a severed hand climbing over her writhing naked body although the woman is quite adequate doing this it does nothing storywise one is left thinking the production team needed to pad out a short running time and just tossed in some padding and a bit of t and a the cgi effects are cartoonish as well and the fiery finale rivals co executive producer roger corman's much earlier and far superior film the fall of the house of usher in all its ineffective cheapness any attempt at true tension and suspense and as a result chills are thrown out the window in this low budget bust if you like images of ireland you might find something here but you would do better renting or buying a travelogue skip this unless you are undiscriminating and think plot is secondary rent another low budget ghost story if you can find it titled the woman in black and see how good and scary a movie can be this was a wasted opportunity
<START> despite all it's trappings of style and cinematic invention this is basically another serial killer thriller following the same sort of plotline favoured by such old favourites as silence of the lambs team of cops follows the trail of particularly nasty murders someone else gets taken and they somehow have to find out where they are before it's too late only in this case the only person who knows the killer himself powerfully played by vincent d'onofrio is in a coma and we need psychologist jennifer sci fi mind meld machine to get into his head and force him to tell all this is where the film gets all new and different as we enter via a 21st century cgi update of dr who's kaleidoscopic favourite the trendy time tunnel a kind of hellraiser y weird world of scary crazy stuff going on all over the place ruled over by d'onofrio now a kind of overlord of his twisted mental world inside his comatose body the inside the mind sequences are well realised and often pretty stunning all the leads perform adequately the gruesomeness is to the max if you like that kind of thing but the hype around the whole thing led to a disappointment for me as i had expected something completely new and unlike anything ever done before not this fairly successful blending of serial killer and special effect horror genre staples sometimes horrifying often pretty a fairly gripping story told with care and attention by talented film people but by no means the great leap into the unknown it has been marketed as
<START> this excruciatingly boring and unfunny movie made me think that chaplin was the real hitler as only someone as evil as him could torture people with this tripe i saw this movie remastered which only made the suffering inflicted by this atrocity more severe this movie is nothing but a pathetic repetitive movie which instead of inducing two hours of laughter it induced two hours of suicidal urges after the first 10 minutes of this i began wishing that gas would start seeping from the speakers of the theatre br br if i could give it a zero out of ten i would happily do so avoid at all costs
<START> in all the episodes i never saw any real action or drama or comedy br br the plot is so repetitive br br somebody gets something old and then somebody else tells them a little bit about it and how much it's worth and who made it and where it comes from and how much it could sell for and if there was any work done to it br br i watched about 30 of these i realized there is no drama nobody ever loses a limb or life or gets divorced or hit by a car or air plane br br there are no car chases or explosions not even a horse race with old carriages br br all those guns and swords and nobody goes on a violent killing spree what gives no no axe murders no gun old englishmen in bad suits just you have an old tea set and it came from the country of germany back in blah blah blah br br i'm still waiting for somebody with a time machine to go on screen and ask about it but no it never comes to be and the only thing that happens is that some stuffy englishman or woman serves up some crap about something old being sold in boston or china during the ming dynasty big deal br br can't anybody ever kidnap one of the leads and hold them for ransom is there no alien spacecraft that will obliterate the entire floor who the hell writes this stuff as a series and expects us to stay awake this is about as entertaining as watching paint dry only with commentary br br there's no sex there's no comedy or romance no action no suspense no action no drama no mystery or martial arts br br this show sucks what ever happened to supermodels wearing thongs and spewing lasers from a futuristic weapon antiques roadshow more like grab a blanket and pillow and go to sleep show
<START> all grown up is basically a spin off and not much else of the original rugrats cartoon that featured the babies tommy pickles chucky finster lil and phil deville angelica susie and later kimi sister and tommy's brother i grew up with rugrats and thought it was a great cartoon it had excellent humor nice stories and the show's creators klasky csupo were obviously very original and creative with the concept of the adventures of babies the new show all grown up tries to recapture the magic of the original cartoon i was disappointed when i saw it i found the all grown up chuckie just annoying and the whole pre teen acting mature trying to be popular that applied to unfortunately all of the characters dull and washed out there still are some funny scenes and jokes in the new series and it was interesting how the artists would make the whole baby gang of rugrats look ten years from their age in the original show overall this show is and only watchable if a you're a die hard fan of the rugrats b have never seen the original show c you're a pre teen that has nothing to do or d your so bored that your somehow forced to see this show this show is not that good it doesn't compare to the older rugrats episodes in quality humor and everything else
<START> i so much enjoyed this little musical fantasy i bought a copy to share with my friends it is a pleasant and diverting change from our mundane lives i believe that we can all benefit from an active fantasy life one of joy and indulgence i heartily recommend it br br the performance is excellent and the music uplifting
<START> ahhhh 1984 i was young and stupid and just developing a taste for those exotic cigarettes whilst living in a squat in moss side with the most unbelievable case of cockroach infestation br br after a few of those this show was rotflmao material i was an avid fan then i'd look down at the floor or up at the walls or just about anywhere and see my very own collection of little scuttling about br br not sure if it was the chemical enhancement but i remember thinking at the time that the overt surrealism of the show was fantastic it was my second favourite thing on tv at the time 1 was the season of luis bunuel movies being shown by channel 4 radical art lives on br br also you gotta that theme tune i swear i'll never drink no more
<START> a mix of 70's drug humor along with parody of medicine and classic story line as i've often said about this flick if you don't get it you're way lame classic lines such as i've got this erection and it won't go away no matter how many times i do it you're a nurse what can you give me for it nurse replies all i have is 5 dollars and my wedding ring great sound track the classic hyde's got nothing to hide stays surprisingly close to the original plot not that the original stays in the way of a joke haven't met anyone with an iq over 115 that doesn't find it hysterical br br
<START> what a mess of a movie if it wasnt for eric roberts and susan sarandon's performances this movie would be a total waste a very muddled plot and phony dialogue eric roberts debut where did his career go from this movie on nowhere but down
<START> i was recommended this film as one of the best love stories ever told and as i am huge fan of love i bought the tickets and sat myself in the theatre after 90 minutes i left the theatre with nothing but disappointment and the theme song as the only positive thing of the film i was appalled at the story itself that two people can love each other but be so afraid as to never act it i just couldn't go passed the language barrier and the cultural barrier the second time i ran into it i was in a different mood no longer had any expectation and had more patience more relaxed mind to see the film and as soon as i opened my eyes i discovered the love the beauty of the film i went beyond the language and the love story and saw the acting not even for a moment did i ever felt like they were acting and the cinematography the first time i heard a definition of what a film is i was told that it should be a chain of perfectly balanced photographs shots and this is the film to match the description almost every shot has an idea behind it and combined with the music and the light effects the result is just a masterpiece and a masterpiece is just something that you must have in your collection of films
<START> i feel at a loss so brilliant is this film kieslowski is a writer a philosopher and while an excellent filmmaker his greatness lies in his writing and red is his paradigm this film is a study of the artist's judgement in the creation of his fictional world of how an artist can attempt to remake life even his own thru his art even as he cannot escape the knowledge that no matter how he involves himself in his story it is still fiction and he is still outside of his remade world still burdened with its unreality and the reality of the life he has tried to artistically remake and magically all of this is not to the smallest degree at the expense of a wonderful story about the mysteries of love and fate and the characters who live out this story this pre judged destiny if i had to choose i might nominate this the greatest film ever made
<START> this is one of those movies where i was rooting for whoever could end the movie the quickest i wanted to see the cops kill keaton and garcia just to get it over with basically this is the deal two cops have to die and a third has to get horrible burns on his face for garcia's son to get a bone marrow transplant from convicted killer keaton is it worth it no
