<START> this movie was produced by the biggest producer in costa although their authors brag about it as a the biggest movie in costa ever made and their actors even dare to say that they didn't get an oscar nomination due to it's political relevance with oil he he right well this is all a lie this movie was supposedly based on a book written by carlos salazar about a love triangle super clichÃ© soap opera like subject and it secondary story is about an oil problem on the atlantic coast of costa with an american oil company who wanted to explore oil deposits on the region but at the end it never was approved by the government now it may have some nice footage about the beaches but that's it nothing bigger than that it is all in the camera most of the actors are lousy except for two or three the rest lack of sense of what acting means they overact most of the time the story is completely common and clichÃ© worthy of a cheap mexican soap opera as i said because the crew advertised it as a protest movie about oil but 80 of the movie is based on a stupid love triangle the script is nothing impressing it is very simple and the dialogs are not very thought it has also got some editing problem on a couple of scene changes but besides that is pretty decent the director did an alright job i mean he is not like an oliver stone but he did his job with the resources he had handy i would like to question him why instead of using actor he spent most of the money on foreign ones i mean after all they about being an 100 production that's what you at least expect final the end is is not well done there are flaws and details that don't match or are useless besides being the most elaborated movie in all history i think it's mediocre you can make way more interesting and better pictures with less cash never heard of pi anyway if you are curious about costa rican or central american movies this one will do but you are definitively not missing anything
<START> the distribution was good the subject could have been interessant and comic whereas he described the wandering of an old non credible communist looking for loving sensations instead of this the atmosphere is nor lively nor heavy
<START> this was one of the most mixed up films i have ever seen everything in the movie seemed to be attached to justify some other element that had been glued on there is even a talking buffalo that wants his wet nose rubbed to make the magic happen even the brutal father seems to be stuck in just to give the kids an excuse to fly away in a wagon it was laughable but in an uncomfortable way because of the serious subjects that seemed to be used just to set up the plot
<START> this one is a cut above the usual softcore t a with the spirit of a dead actress returning to claim the film role she believes is rightfully hers and using the body of an aspiring young actress to do so br br as always the gorgeously sexy amber newman the is main attraction her sensuous presence overshadows the mildly attractive o'brien br br plot 1 2 out of br br sex nudity out of
<START> it all depends on how you look at it are either halfway to heaven or halfway to hell says the priest rev harlan in northfork the polish brothers' film is an ambitious one that will make any intelligent viewer to sit up provided he or she has patience and basic knowledge of christianity the layers of entertainment the film provide takes a viewer beyond the surreal and absurd imagery that is obvious to a less obvious socio political and theological commentary that ought to provoke a laid back american to reflect on current social values the film's adoption of the surreal coffins that emerge from the depths of man made lakes to float and disturb the living who nearly crucify their feet to wooden floor of their homes angels who need multiple glasses to read etc and absurd images of half animals half toys that are alive of door bells that make most delicate of musical outputs of a harp a blind angel who keeps writing unreadable etc could make a viewer unfamiliar with the surreal and absurdist traditions in literature and the arts to wonder what the movie is un as entertainment though european cinema has better credentials in this field hollywood has indeed made such films in the past cat lee marvin and his horse leaned against the wall to take a nap several decades ago northfork in one scene of the citizens leaving the town in cars seemed to pay homage to the row of cars in citizen kane taking kane and his wife out of xanadu for a picnic br br the film is difficult for the uninitiated or the impatient film most interesting epilogue one of the finest i can recall can be heard as a voice over towards the end of the credits the directors seem to leave the finest moments to those who can stay with film to the end if you have the patience you will savor the layers of the you gulp or swallow what the polish bothers dish out you will miss out on its many flavors br br what is the film all about at the most obvious layer a town is being vacated to make way for a dam and project even cemeteries are being dug up so that the mortal remains of the dead can be moved to higher burial grounds real estate promoters are hawking the lakeside properties to 6 people who can evict the townsfolk of the 6 only one seems to have a conscience and therefore is able to order chicken broth soup while others cannot get anything served to them br br at the next layer you have christianity and its interaction on the townsfolk most are devout christians but in many lurk the instinct to survive at the expense of true christian principles exemplified in the priest many want to adopt children without accepting the responsibilities associated with such actions br br at the next layer you have the world of angels interacting with near angelic humans and with each other you realize that the world of the unknown angel who keeps a comic book on hercules and dreams of a mother finds one in an androgynous angel called flower hercules while the filmmaker does give clues that flower is an extension of the young angel's delirious imagination subsequent actions of flower belie this option you are indeed in the world of angels not gods but the pure in therefore not in the world of the living the softer focus of the camera is in evidence in these shots br br at another layer the toy plane of irwin becomes a real plane carrying him and his angels to heaven 1000 miles away from norfolk br br the final layer is the social the country is divided into two types of people fords people and chevy people is there a difference they think they are different but both are consumerist br br to the religious the film says pray and you shall receive words of fr harlan quoted by angel flower hercules to the consumerist the film says its what we do with our wings that separate us each of the 6 also have wings one duck goose feather tucked into their hat bands but their actions are different often far from angelic as suggested by the different reactions to a scratch on a car br br the film is certainly not the finest american film but it is definitely a notable path breaking work superb visuals striking performances especially nick nolte and a loaded script offering several levels of entertainment for mature audiences
<START> set just before the second world war this is a touching and understated romantic story that is loosely based on a real event br br it concerns a german rocket scientist ulrich thomsen working in britain in the advent of the second world war fearing hitler may recall him to germany to assist him preparing for war and his slippery assistant heinz eddie are evacuated by the british authorities to a remote scottish island they are given the task of building a rocket post box that will enable the islanders to communicate with the mainland br br mocked and bullied by the islanders they set up home with local girl catherine mackay the stunning macdonald with whom thomsen begins an affair but complications arise when germany comes calling br br the central romance between and catherine is subtle and sincerely played and the supporting cast is a colourful bunch with an array of respected scottish character actors including gary lewis and clive russell br br fine cinematography and a brilliant central theme song sung in the local dialect round out this movie br br intelligent but undemanding it is good for a quiet evening in
<START> gulliver's travels is at the beginning a satiric novel written by a great misanthropist called jonathan swift so it is not recommended to judge of this movie just by itself we must go deeper into man's conscience to get to the point where swift would have lead us gulliver has lived a voyage of truthfulness of solitude of apprehension of what may be his true life we cannot just sit and watch that movie saying it is so cutie or so boring the matter is far beyond that and i would like everyone to expect that this is the greatest movie ever as far as you can feel the truths that emerge from ted character the unforgettable gulliver
<START> i'm not going to lie and say i don't watch the show i do but it has a lot and a lot of flaws 1 the boarding school is perfect the drama is at a minimum everyone is so nice to each other you know lets give that a reality check its impossible that any school is perfect like free for everyone big dorm rooms mini fridges if there was a school like that in real life almost nobody there would be a virgin for one two everyone there is so rich and its weird how nobody has anything stolen yet 2 characters really unrealistic first things first who in they're right minds talk like they do they talk like a perfect teenager would secondly logan reese matthew underwood is an extremely rich boy hot teenage boy my question is why isn't almost ever girl in that school all over him he's rich and hot now a days all those girls would be after him even if he was a jerk also chase is the most stupidest person ever he is this shy teenager who claims to not be in love with zoey and over reacts to everything that involves zoey she must be blind not to see him in love with her br br come on nick i know you can do better than that please
<START> i love movies and rarely do i see a movie that i hate but this was the worst movie i have ever seen or at least close to it any movie that ends with a rape scene is awful hands down i cant believe i wasted 2 hours of my life watching this movie i'm really mad i want my money back and my time back awful do not go to see it the cinematography is awful the plot is awful the ending is awful i didn't know what was going on during half the movie cause i could not see it and i was watching on a very nice and big tv rent saw the hills have eyes or house of wax any of those are better if u want something scary
<START> as i sit and think about poison for the fairies i realize that i may not being fair with the film my rating of 3 10 may have more to do with my disappointment with the film than its actual quality or entertainment value based on the plot description reviews on imdb and the 7 6 imdb rating i would sure that i had stumbled on a little known gem sadly it just didn't do much for me for whatever reason poison for the fairies all but put me to sleep br br poison for the fairies is the story of two young girls in 1965 mexico city one of the girls veronica is a compulsive liar and tells her friend that she veronica is a witch the other girl flavia is so gullible that she believes and is frightened by everything her friend tells her that's really about it in reality nothing much happens and the film drags on and on as veronica attempts to terrorize and dominate flavia one commenter on imdb described it as the scariest film in 80's mexican cinema my comment Â if that's the case there must not have been many horror films made in mexico in the 80s another commenter wrote watch it if you wanna get scared my comment Â are you sure we're talking about the same movie my opinion is diametrically opposed to these examples i've given to me it was dull uninspired and poorly acted the scene framing is especially annoying as director carlos enrique doesn't ever show the faces of any of the other characters veronica and flavia carry on long drawn out conversations with members of their families and their teacher but we never actually see these peoples' faces it's an annoying gimmick
<START> i'm guessing that the folks talking up this drivel are cronies of the director or something this is bad and not in the michael jackson song kind of way to compare the pacing of this movie to the progress of a snail would be to insult the snail this movie limps along for what seems like an eternity all to introduce us to some un scary zombie kids with silly makeup and some sort of vendetta or thirst for blood or whatever believe me you won't care the thought alone that mom would move her two daughters into this dilapidated and filthy home is absurd and worse i found myself simply not caring backstory about the zombie kids snore of mom and or daughters don't care br br in short wow was this dull don't bother
<START> have pulled yet another beauty out of a seemingly bottomless bag of great games if any further proof was required that they rule this genre of gaming then this is it before actually playing the game there was a little concern about how the writers were going to keep up the pace of gags after the first two games fears were rife that it was going to wear a bit thin br br play the game and see how quickly those fears are from the introductory video with in the boat to the closing stages in the funfair the jokes just keep on coming i was a great fan of the first two games and the other works day of the tentacle sam max etc and this one does not fail to deliver the quality you will not be disappointed well i wasn't
<START> this is the funniest movie i have ever seen however i have laughed harder at plenty of movies this is because best in show's brilliance lies not in slapstick or one liners but in sophisticated and layered verbal wit the improvised dialogue is is so quick that you end up laughing not at each individual joke but only until after several jokes build on one another each disarming your senses until the jokes climax and you can't help letting loose br br it's a well shot film but what makes it extraordinary is the acting i was impressed on my first viewing but when i watched it after having learned that virtually every scene is improvised i was amazed it was thoroughly enjoyable to see the comedians work off each other build jokes out of nothing and completely immerse themselves in their characters br br i imagine the golden days of second city were like this
<START> this movie actually hurts to watch not only did i not laugh once i ended up getting a serious headache at times i felt so sorry for the actors involved the best way to sum it up is to note that among sex comedies it is probably the least funny and least sexy of all time i'm only sorry i can't give it a vote of less than one to give this a rating of one is an insult to every movie that scores two or better br br now i see that they're filming a sequel hearing that someone is actually paying these people to make another movie convinces me that there's just too much money in hollywood raise their taxes making a sequel to this movie may very well constitute a crime against humanity perhaps an international tribunal should be convened or u n sanctions applied to the filmmakers br br in short it's a really bad movie really really
<START> a fantastic musical starring gene kelly and rita hayworth he owns a nightclub where she dances she's no star yet but she gets a big break when she's chosen as a cover girl for vanity whose owner was actually in love with her grandmother when he sees the resemblance he picks her right away for a contest his is running hayworth's newfound fame at first works wonders for kelly's club but her star rises so quickly and so high up that his grasp on her begins to falter this isn't the most original of plots but the two leads really make it work it also helps that the screenplay is great kelly's not yet at his peak especially his peak as an actor his dancing however wow hayworth is the star but kelly claims the film's most memorable moment as he dances passionately with his own reflection it's obviously a take off of fred astaire's shadow dancing in swing time but i think kelly one ups it which is hardly believable in fact this has got to be the most amazing dance sequence in film history save perhaps the finale of an american in paris several years later the rest of the songs are also excellent and the musical numbers are even better too bad rita didn't sing her own songs well she may have a couple of them as her singing voice seemed to be different sometimes her dancing is wonderful as is the rest of her acting it's hard not to love her in anything she's really one of the few truly beautiful women from the classic era not plastic like many of them no you can really see the warmth in that woman her smile is so disarming phil silvers has the role as kelly's best friend and he is also very funny the trio of kelly hayworth silvers is obviously the kernel which became the kelly reynolds o'connor trio in singin' in the rain eight years afterwards one of the biggest musical numbers in the film seems almost completely pilfered with the good morning number in singin' i do think singin' in the rain is the better film as cover girl is a little rough around the edges this roughness though just adds to the charm there are aspects of this film that beat singin' in the rain and even an american in paris for instance the central relationship is more emotionally involving instead of the dominant older man chasing the little girl leslie caron and debbie reynolds were just teenagers after all we have a very nice relationship with two people who seem more like equals there is no chasing around an aspect that does unfortunately turn a lot of the best musicals a little sour you have to admit kelly and hayworth are a couple from the start and when that begins to fray i really felt it 9 10
