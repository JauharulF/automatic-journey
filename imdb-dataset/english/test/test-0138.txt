<START> i first watched this movie back in the mid late 80's when i was a kid we couldn't even get all the way through it the dialog the acting everything about it was just beyond lame br br here are a few examples imagine these spoken real dramatically way over acted you're going to why would anyone want to go to br br nobody ever told us about any br br this movie was so bad my sister and i rented it again for her 16th birthday party just so our friends could sit around and laugh at how awful it was i don't think we were able to finish it then either
<START> i watched this film with a group of friends at the 1999 melbourne international film festival and no one had a good word for it br br i happen to love bluegrass and country music so it's not as if i'm unsympathetic to the subject matter but the problem is that at heart it's a very conservative movie little more than a filmed mills and boon story a bodice ripper of the most simple minded and soppy kind br br it's not just that the love story at its heart that between reece and dr lily is more than a tad unbelievable why any male would be attracted to the nostril flaring man devouring lily is beyond me and frankly mike harding as reece seems to be just going through the motions br br it's simply that the whole movie is too tame and well mannered for its own good there is precious little danger dirt or drama sure there's a moment of excitement involving a school run by lily's younger sister but this whole episode is funnier than it is dramatic it's just so poorly written and acted and the movie betrays its conservative agenda in the manner in which this subplot is resolved br br as for good old reece now what's wrong with a name like i ask you is the ending of this film believable fitting in with the character this film had earlier constructed i think not
<START> people watch movies for a variety of different reasons this movie didn't have the big budget there's no special effects no car chases and there's no explosions actually reality doesn't have much of these either at least not in my life br br this is a very real movie about very real people none of them perfect in any way but together they are put into a situation where they learn to explore and accept what is different and that in turn makes order out of chaos i am not prepared to limit the possibility of since i'm neither an expert nor use the full extent of my own brain br br so watch this movie for the characters it is brim full of a whole cast of wonderful quirky folk br br within the first three minutes kiefer sutherland enacts detective michael life superbly and he keeps developing the character throughout the movie excellent acting very believable br br henry czerny could not have been cast better and the rapport between his and kiefer's 'mickey' enhances the of their characters br br i thoroughly enjoyed the cranky landlady i'm sure she and my mother in law are good friends br br there's a host more of these wonderful characters but space is limited here so watch the movie and enjoy them
<START> a great film every moment masterfully conducted by and his crew the actors give credible performances all around the visuals are haunting beautiful and sometimes hauntingly beautiful shots of the japanese country and city landscapes the sounds courtesy of japanese band are never overly edgy as one would expect from band made soundtracks it's strangely atmospheric and well suited to the scenes they're on br br all in all they worked everything out perfectly well if they were to give any justice to the story perfection is the only thing anyone could have accepted br br the real greatness of 9 souls is the compelling story the prison break movie maybe something of a lost genre these days and road trip movie losing it's appeal due to the way the world is getting smaller but this story easily mixes something fresh to those two genres br br 9 convicts are given freedom and possibly the opportunity to regain their places in society will society accept them will they be truly free of their dark pasts and can they stick together long enough to stay alive and find out br br each convict has an interesting history their crimes are as varied as their apparent fates a sense of brotherhood among them keeps the story high on drama and supplies it with hilariously comedic situations and due to the nature of their backgrounds violence is always something waiting to happen br br after all that all i can say is go give it a watch
<START> having watched this movie several times i have come to the conclusion that milos forman made a very daring decision to manufacture a muse for goya when the artist led what most would consider a tempestuous passionate life while the french revolution and the napoleonic era raged across europe surely one that would have sufficient drama upon which to draw while i do understand that mr forman was relating in the microcosm of the tragedy of life the devastation of the world at that time i was left feeling that there was just so much of goya left out so much of his humanity the strongest and most eloquent point this film made was that because of man's fallen nature each of us is a potential villain in the stream of life each of us has evil within us that we must fight with the help of god how eloquent when goya says he should have helped more how true for all of us we must defend and protect the innocent the superbly ironic scene in which the once imprisoned priest sentenced to die pronounces the death sentence on lorenzo who condemned him originally is the stuff of genius i was left wanting something more when the credits rolled maybe less of the unreal coincidences and more of the inner life of the characters
<START> i know it's hard for you americans to find european films on video dvd particularly from the 80's but please seek out the original version of the vanishing title spoorloos 1988 and you'll see why the hollywood version of the vanishing screws up bigtime particularly at the finale br br i really like sandra bullock kiefer sutherland and particularly jeff bridges but this is just so so lame compared with the original what where they thinking can you imagine seven with a happy ending with gwyneth paltrow running happily into the arms of brad pitt in the finale the whole point the original was such a major international success was because of the shocking finale so why do you accept this kind of remake really avoid this and get the original
<START> my mother is as gone with the wind as one can be she has the collector's plates the rhett and scarlett madame alexander dolls gwtw christmas ornaments even a gwtw cookbook my sister and i had only seen bits and pieces of gwtw but we knew the whole plot by heart on a whim my sister bought this miniseries thinking my mother would like it and we had taken an interest in it after through the novel a bit br br yesterday we decided to watch both gone with the wind and scarlett we started gwtw at about 2 30 in the afternoon and ended it at 6 30 we started scarlett right after my mother usually goes to bed at about 10 00 she wound up staying up until 1 30 with us to finish it we were riveted i like how the movie starts off at melanie's funeral right where scarlett left off saying i'll think about it tomorrow scarlett doesn't stay in georgia for long she runs off to charleston in her quest to win him back rhett is not happy when he finds scarlett in his home so he leaves for the family's plantation scarlett being scarlett follows him and they finally agree to put aside their quarrels for a time in order to keep the gossip at bay rhett starts to enjoy her company again and takes her out on his boat a storm comes up and they sink he helps her swim to the shore of some island terrified that she has died rhett is anxious until she awakes when she does they both get swept up in the moment and make love scarlett wakes up the next day back in charleston but rhett has gone and writes that he thinks it best if they never see each other again br br scarlett is heartbroken and when she is so she does some stupid things in this case she is seen by anne hampton going up into a hotel room alone with ashley nothing happens but her reputation is stained so scarlett goes to savannah with her two spinster aunts she soon discovers that she is pregnant and decides to wait for the right time to tell rhett while in savannah she meets many of her o'hara relatives and grows to like one cousin in particular a father she soon gets her divorce notice from rhett and then decides she will never tell him about her baby just to spite him typical scarlett br br she decides to go to ireland to make sure rhett can never discover her condition she meets many more relatives and buys a beautiful ancestral home through out this time rhett is courting anne it is on halloween when scarlett gets the notice that rhett has remarried she goes into labor that night br br the movie skips to a year later and scarlett is very happy with her beautiful daughter kat she is being pursued by lord richard fenton who is really an evil man forcing a young girl named mary boyle to sleep with him scarlett meets rhett and anne again at a horse fair after a riding accident scarlett has a conversation with anne and learns that she and rhett are to have a baby heartbroken again scarlett leaves and goes to dublin with fenton there she a relationship with him like i said she does stupid things when she is heartbroken br br mary boyle has discovered she is pregnant and goes to for help the priest urges fenton to help the girl and fenton murders him after threatens to tell scarlett fenton convinces scarlett to go to london with him to escape her grief over death mary asks to go with her back in charleston anne has died of yellow fever it is made clear that she never bore rhett a child br br in london scarlett sees fenton's true colors after he hurts her when she isn't in the mood the sleep with him fenton rapes her after she tells him she never wants to see him again she falls unconscious after and when she wakes up fenton has been stabbed to death scarlett is charged with his murder br br rhett hears about it and rushes off to england with sally in tow fearful of the gallows scarlett has no choice but to tell rhett about their daughter rhett is furious at her for keeping such a secret but stays to help her mary boyle the real killer can't be found scarlett is found guilty but mary finally arrives to declare her innocence after promising to help mary scarlett leaves with rhett for ireland because as he says it's time i became acquainted with my daughter the scene where he sees kat for the first time is absolutely beautiful in ireland rhett sees how much scarlett has changed and the two finally reconcile completely and admit they still love each other deeply br br after seeing gwtw i will say that yes vivian leigh was a better scarlett but i liked the character of scarlett in this film than in the first the reason being that in gwtw you don't know why you like scarlett she's so cruel to rhett and haughty and spoiled but you like her lively spirit in scarlett you see how much she has changed oh she is still in the lap of luxury but she's not haughty anymore you see how she becomes a true mother to kat and a generous person to the poor people of ireland joanne whalley does and excellent job at playing this new side of scarlett timothy dalton is not clark gable but at times you swear that you can see original rhett in him br br if you just sit back and not compare joanne whalley and timothy dalton with vivian leigh and clark gable you will most certainly enjoy this movie it's a chance to compare the scarlett of yesterday the one she becomes after tomorrow
<START> it is sad what they are letting into film festivals these days i had to sit through over twenty minutes of this dreary short that wasn't funny at all to get a good seat for a feature film that i wanted to see at a local film festival the festival paired this horrible short with a great feature i am just glad the feature was good otherwise i would have not been a very happy camper br br for a comedy short film it got no laughs the title says it all
<START> i'm not a big musical fan but this is one of the few i really love unlike many other musicals such as the sound of music none of the songs are about gratuitous stuff each song is social commentary acumen on war sexuality spirituality and freedom especially amazing songs are easy to be hard age of aquarius hair flesh failures 3 5 0 0 walking in space and hare krishna totally revolutionary and wonderful i can't wait to someday see it live
<START> a must see br br excellent positive african american love story this movie had reminded me of watching the old black and white movies with my dad more true to life characters looking for love being in love and loosing it old story fresh view larenz tate was so cary grant in style as the character may have been in a situation but the actor kept him from looking silly and like a cardboard cut out long has always been a favorite of mine she is sweet even when she is tough almost like a hepburn this is one of his best work and showing that he is better than always playing an angry black man br br this movie is a classic superb acting well written a real love story set in chicago what more can you ask for br br superb black love story br br amsterdam holland
<START> this film is strictly for fans of debbie reynolds and eddie fisher br br i get angry at tcm for showing this mess more frequently than bachelor mother the delightful original i get angrier still that some hollywood boob thought it would be a good idea to remake bachelor mother filling it with some lame songs that only serve to interrupt the flow of a cute comedy instead hollywood could have spent the time money energy and talent wasted on this horrible remake to give us something new and original wow what a concept br br bachelor mother the original with ginger rogers and david niven is a spicy stew simmering with sexuality it is a 1930's wink at the hays office bundle of joy the remake with debbie reynolds and eddie fisher is strictly milk and cookies it is a 1950's handshake with eisenhower br br which cast would you rather watch debbie reynolds eddie fisher and adolphe menjou or ginger rogers david niven and charles coburn for me every member of the cast in the original version is far better than his her counterpart in the remake br br in the original a beautiful young ginger rogers is at her peak david niven delivers perfectly as a somewhat spoiled sophisticated and yet befuddled scion of a wealthy department store magnate and i always love to see charles coburn in a movie in bachelor mother he is priceless as the desperate grandfather wannabe br br in bundle of joy debbie reynolds is her usual perky self she is fine in this role although her performance along with fisher's completely changes the tone of the story as an actor eddie fisher is hopeless he is completely lacking in screen presence here he is way too wholesome for this story his acting is completely bland and clueless likewise his singing is so bland and unremarkable that it has been completely forgotten by the world at large the only time he is not completely painful is in butterfield 8 where incidentally he doesn't sing here fisher's lame performance alone is enough to ruin this movie adolphe menjou a favorite character actor delivers a competent performance but not one of his best he is more blustering than commanding he and fisher are not convincing as a father and son br br do you see a musical for the music the story being merely incidental or do watch a musical for a story with some good music used for seasoning if the former you might like this lame remake otherwise you are much better off watching the ginger rogers non musical original bachelor mother
<START> this is one of the best and most under rated teen movies ever made br br i saw this growing up and it was and is one of my favorites maybe not as popular as fast times but just as great br br there is a serious side to this movie as mentioned by other reviewers it starts as a comedy and morphs into a drama about halfway through that's the beauty of it though and what sets it apart you get it all humor not unlike that of fast times drama and a great great soundtrack br br i personally think every kid about to enter high school should see this it would give an idea about the journey their about to embark on cmon what kid watching this wouldn't be able to relate to someone in the movie the fact that it becomes so serious halfway though is also cool and just superbly well done you don't even see it coming definitely a lot of surprises br br spoilers don't read anymore if you don't want to know br br great knee humor who could forget the scene between gary and camilla i can still hear it oh my big strong burrito priceless br br some of the scenes between gary and karin are hard to watch particularly the final scene of coarse there are so so many women like karen out there who would have made the exact same choice she did think about it how many women reject men with hearts of gold like gary for jerks i know i've done it and so have many females i know this movie will inspire discussion and despite the countless times i've seen it still leaves me filled with admiration for the film makers and performers everyone will find someone to relate to in this movie or what's more likely more then one person br br lastly the music used is just great a lot of cars u2 lots of obscure now songs from the 80's an 80's purist's dream br br but make no mistake it is not the music that makes this movie unique it is the story itself plain and simple one of the best of it's kind and a teen movie classic
<START> bela lugosi as god transvestites discussed in a movie in the straight laced 1950s by golly this must be an ed wood film br br watching this movie i felt a combination of guilt pleasure and nausea all at the same time the story is about glen ed wood himself and his cross dressing alter ego glenda somehow if this movie were made now i could see kevin kline playing glen glenda notice how all the cross alter egos are versions of their male name glen glenda robert roberta etc it attempts to sympathetically portray it as the mental disorder that it is rather than as a graphic perversion br br somehow wood manages to sneak in bondage and s m sequences into his initial story of glen glenda along with these racy scenes satan himself shows up obviously having a bad hair day the dialog and pace are nonexistent but the film is enjoyable in its context the weird world of ed wood br br sterno says put on your favorite lace panties for this one

<START> this was a very brief episode that appeared in one of the night gallery show back in 1971 the episode starred sue lyon of lolita movie fame and joseph campanella who play a baby sitter and a vampire respectively the vampire hires a baby sitter to watch his child which appears to be some kind of werewolf or monster while he goes out at night for blood the baby sitter is totally oblivious to the vampire's appearance when she first sees him and only starts to put two and two together when she notices that he has no reflection in the mirror has an odd collection of books in the library on the occult and hears strange noises while the vampire goes to talk to the child she realizes that the man who hired her may not be what she thought he was originally she bolts out the door the vampire comes out looking puzzled and the episode is over i don't know what purpose it was to make such an abbreviated episode that lasted just 5 minutes they should just have expanded the earlier episode by those same 5 minutes and skipped this one a total wasted effort
