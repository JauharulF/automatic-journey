<START> this is one of my personal favorites a rare little gem that seems to be undiscovered by the general population chris cooper and patricia clarkson form the heart of the piece in what is a well chosen cast few movies have ever captured the true hostilities that the civil war but this one seems to capture all the right tones and moods if you're a fan of the book cold mountain try this movie out and see if you don't think it makes a good companion piece
<START> i loved this movie the actors were wonderful and suited their roles the story itself was great and true the setting was perfect and the message about human response to the war danger and risk was exceptional the person who wrote the music score also did the music for life is beautiful another favourite of mine his comment was apparently that this was not a like an english movie it was like an italian movie i think he's right callum blue is perfect for the part of eric i recommend this movie to everyone who wants to watch a story that is true and morally uplifting as well as a beautiful love story
<START> frankie darro was a wonderful child actor who excelled at playing little toughs with gigantic chips on their shoulders he appeared in a couple of top films of the early 30s the public enemy 1931 a ground breaking crime drama and wild boys of the road 1933 a topical depression era movie about kids who ride the rails he was essentially a younger version of james cagney although short of height his willingness to do his own stunts kept him employed in a series of programmers when the bigger studios had no more use for him br br crime school was supposed to be a remake of the mayor of hell but it had far more humour in it and featured the dead end kids and humphrey bogart as a very laid back deputy the mayor of hell is really a combination of hell's house crime school boy's town even though cagney didn't make his appearance until around the 25th minute his impact as usual was immediate he plays a hot headed gangster who is on the payroll of a political group run by the mob br br jimmy smith frankie darro and his gang including farina from our gang run a car washing racket but bite off more than they can chew when they rob a general store and push the owner through a plate glass window they appear before the juvenile court and are sentenced to go to the state reformatory it is painted in glowing terms a model school where boys are given a chance to learn a trade in reality it is a hellish place run by a sadistic warden mr thompson outstandingly played by dudley digges the only compassionate person is dorothy griffith the live in nurse played by madge evans br br patsy gargan james cagney has been given the job as the new deputy commissioner as a favour on his arrival at the school he witnesses a failed escape attempt and after talking to dorothy realises the school needs sweeping reforms he is soon running the school and brings in a system of self government rather along the lines of boy's town even though cagney doesn't have a lot to do the picture is carried along to it's gripping climax by the energy of darro after patsy is temporarily out of the picture he accidentally shoots a mobster and has to leave the state thompson returns and his brutal treatment resulting in the death of a boy skinny turn the rest of the boys into an angry mob they burn down a barn and thompson falls to his death patsy returning just in time to the mob with some sobering talk br br sure all the boys seemed to get was a stiff talking to for their crimes but i do disagree with one of the reviewers thompson was more than just a meanie his sadistic treatment resulted in a boy's death there is a scene at the beginning where the boys are served some inedible slop thompson orders ham and eggs and keeps piling the butter on his bread while talking to dorothy br br allan jenkins plays uncle mike and sheila terry although billed only as a blonde has one of the most memorable lines when she pouts and says i thought there was going to be young boys here where are they br br highly recommended
<START> i gave this 2 stars out of a possible 10 br br i went into this not realizing what it was and discovered it is apparently some kind of african musical since people break into song every few minutes br br none of the songs rhyme most of them aren't really saying anything sensible and they all have the same non existent tune if you could call it a tune br br is a tall spectacularly built young woman with the longest braids i've ever seen the actress looks as if she has probably done some modeling br br the film opens in a women's prison although not like any prison i've ever seen or heard of the inmates wear whatever they wish and seem to be having a party br br does some frantic dancing and the woman warden of the prison angelique a magnificently handsome woman is definitely erotically interested she and dance together later visits the warden's room and they make love unfortunately the scene is not detailed and is very short although there is some nudity br br then escapes from the prison and next we see her dancing in front of another group where a man named maybe a colonel it was never really clear who he was watches her he is with a young woman who dislikes seductive dancing and there is a dance off between the two women br br after that the story such as it is becomes even more muddled br br with in jail out of jail and who knows where br br may be involved with a group of smugglers or thieves br br there is more singing more dancing and a scene of angelique obviously suffering from heartbreak br br the film muddles its way to a finish and i heaved a sigh of relief that it had ended br br br br
<START> it is a movie which sheds the light on the begging of the palestinian struggle against the israeli occupation of palestine but it does not show the real feelings of the people back then and how they were tricked into believing that they could return to their home soon it does not mention the massacres committed by the jews like der and how they tortured and killed and destroyed the family of any palestinian freedom fighter it lacks the credibility about the real palestinian struggle and about anything palestinian however it has something about the suffering of palestinian citizens ending up as refugees in the nearby arab countries the movie focuses on the story of the man in coma he is now in the present time and through his story we see the film the movie is just telling the life of one person and has some nudity scenes which are irrelevant to the story
<START> i don't know what has happened to director abel ferrara ever since the body snatchers remake he seems to have lost it king of new york and the bad lieutenant remain two of the best films of the '90s searing of a decade gone wrong with films like 'r xmas whatever that means and new rose hotel he seems determined to disgust and bore his former supporters this film has no life in it while he gets excellent performances out of his actors in all of his projects the result of this mishmash of ideas just doesn't jell whatever the point is that the new breed of drug dealer is more or less the same as any other upper middle class new gets lost in the mind numbing script and boring direction br br i saw this opening night at the 4 plex in downtown l a in the lobby while buying tickets i was surprised and delighted to see it filled with a large racially mixed group of men and women in their twenties and thirties then they started into the theater but it was the theater that was featuring 8 mile not 'r xmas the theater showing 'r xmas keep in mind this was opening night had a total of 4 people watching it myself my wife and two others br br way to go abel br br 2 10
<START> i couldn't make heads or tails out of this terrible film noir br br the plot was confusing the acting was alright but the picture quality was awful though i bought this at a double pack 8 movies on two discs at walmart for 5 50 and when you put the dvd in it apologizes for the awful picture quality that some of the movies may have br br the plot was flip flopping everywhere i couldn't understand it and had no idea what was going on then the end popped up and the movie was over br br what a waste of my time br br i say don't waste your money or time on this or if you too bought that double pack then just skip over this one br br 2 10
<START> i clicked onto the encore mystery channel to wait for the movie i wanted to see island of dr moreau i caught only a few minutes of shadow conspiracy an old man runs to meet charlie and grabs him by the arm suddenly an assassin in a bright rain coat taps the old man in the head with a side arm from across the street after waiting for c to turn around and look the a tries to shoot c and clearly misses c was a much easier target the old man couldn't have run far duh there is a chase and c is on an elevator a is on the roof so he tries to shoot the cable which is parallel to the a he hits and the cable impossible later this time with a specialized rifle the a lines up on c from maybe 50 meters but is to stupid to notice a motorcycle coming up and taps the rider instead how does charlie get his parts does daddy go to the producers and say look my kid needs work it reminds me of his stupid sit com all the actors are good except yup you got it i usually have to 2 or 3 minutes of that waiting for c s i to come on let's see what can i do for the next hour i know i'll trim my toenails much better use of my time
<START> this is supposedly a story in which a grown man tells a story about his youth yet you see things like personal computers e mails faxes etc which are items used in the late 20th century and early 21st br br so when is this guy supposed to be telling this story in 2020 gee i wonder how advanced we are then how about telling us that br br also there are several legal issues which also make no sense in the courtroom scene the story falls into the usual pratfalls of surprise evidence which is inadmissible in any real court of law in this country also grandma would have to be missing at least seven years in most states before to be declared officially dead br br congratulations elmo shropshire you are now officially a sellout
<START> ravi chopra wrote this film 40 years back wanted to cast dilip kumar in the lead br br the film finally was re written and made in 2003 and hence the subject looks dated and too superficial at times br br like the reason amitabh hema separate is too superficial even the way the youth are shown is too bad like gulshan in br br the message though comes well but things are presented in a clichÃ©d manner salman's character is the worst looks straight out of a storybook while the climax speech of bachchan is good and also the final of not forgiving the sons is good br br ravi chopra does a good job music is decent the songs sung by bachchan stand out br br amitabh excels like always he has played an elder stern father earlier but here he plays a victim and portrays it well his last speech is great hema is good in her part aman verma stands out samir soni is okay naseer and the rest sons and wives are decent though divya dutta stands out salman khan is fake is okay paresh and lillete are lovable
<START> if it had been made 2 years later it would have been banned the number one must see recommendation of the day the best mamoulian film i have seen this far have but have not yet seen j h br br there's no wonder why this film got less than 200 votes a bigger that could not care less about what's proper would not be seen again until the 60's as morally ambiguous and dark as 70's grit but with a certain charm as well of course this had to lay low in the later 30's and sadly it does not appear to have been re discovered br br seriously this got it all great actors gary cooper sylvia sidney and the this time not so lovable guy kibbee and a mighty good director this far i haven't been biggest fans but i have liked his films a lot and with this he steps into a new league one of the best 30's films i have ever seen this is something i never thought even existed 9 5 10
<START> joe whole act is profanity laced with bile he is a pot smoker who entered fear factor thinking it was a joke he said he would egg people on because he did not know how stupid people were going to be the producers of the show he explained were going on the premise of playing pranks on unsuspecting contestants to see how far they will go the level of evil involved is a little twisted mr special is just filled with the rants of someone who is too good for regular human beings i found him to be offensive and his stuff can be heard by more talented comedians such as eddie murphy or chris rock even does a five minute set on the n word overall ignore this special
<START> the storyline of the stranger mirrors somewhat the 1969 film journey to the far side of the sun made by gerry sylvia anderson of 'thunderbirds' and 'space fame a parallel universe earth is the premise of both films but there is a difference where the world in the stranger features a totalitarian regime out to squash the freedom of the citizenry journey to the far side of the sun merely showed a true mirror world where handwriting roads houses machinery of every kind and of course internal organs were all in reverse or mirrored order so the similarity of parallel earths is the only connection of both films br br similarly the tv series land of the giants came before both of those films having run from 1968 to 1970 it featured a world that was nearly parallel to the earth with the exception that the planet was populated by giants 12 times the size of the humans who crash landed there the idea of a totalitarian government out to capture and contain the 'little people' was similar to the premise of the stranger more so than the premise of perhaps because of the similarly to a series to the stranger was shelved had it turned into a tv series it would have been a sci fi version of the fugitive with star glenn corbett being chased by the baddies from week to week hiding out in different locations etc btw a stronger script could have helped this film along
<START> nice to see a comedy for grown ups masterfully structured by aaron via mike own mastery mr mastery is to present characters in all their shocking truth from the sad and riveting richard burton and elizabeth taylor in who's afraid of virginia woolf to the sad and riveting julia roberts clive owen jude law and natalie portman in closer in charlie wilson's war the shocking truth is outside the characters and the sad and riveting tom hanks julia roberts philip seymour hoffman and amy adams are at the service of something else it's personal only to a point hanks has to bury his brilliance in single and julia roberts throws parties and introduces characters with blatant amy adams witnesses and exist as a character witnessing an insurmountable task that miss adams manages to surmount beautifully it is philip seymour hoffman's gus with a t however that monopolized my attention his character may not be a first but it is a first the way that hoffman presented him to us someone who survives the disregard with which he's treated by the absolute conviction that he's smarter than all of them put together hoffman is superb the pacing of the tale helps enormously not to fall in a myriad of useless questions a sharp short smart sad comedy and when was the last time i was able to say that
<START> i have seen this movie twice once a few years ago in college and again this past weekend although i absolutely despised it the first time i decided to give it another chance terrence malick is clearly a well respected director and it seems that the imdb viewers at least think very highly of the film but unfortunately it seems my tastes haven't changed at all br br where to start for one thing linda narration is horrific her voice is so irritating with that horrendous new york accent please don't try and convince me that talk that way they don't she herself admitted to just sitting down and talking about random things which does not make her a talented actress she's not even acting i came on imdb expecting to see her ripped apart since her performance is just so utterly laughable but people actually seemed to like it she's simply unappealing in every way i kept hoping malick would just kill her off br br the other actors were fine but certainly nothing special adams was probably the strongest in the cast but she also had the only decent part except the old guy he was pretty good br br speaking of acting how could shepard's character be so ridiculously stupid he bought the brother and sister act because uh why would he buy that bill and abby took every single opportunity to be touchy feely as though they didn't realize that their lives depended on acting in a very platonic way it was just completely unbelievable and finally after a considerable amount of time the farmer suddenly realizes that oh my god they're together then he goes after bill with a gun but instead seems to trip into bill's hand and ends up with a mortal stab wound br br speaking of which the fate of the characters was similarly stupid and dare i say lazy of course bill has to die could it be more boring than getting shot in a pond by a pack of cops abby goes on with her happy life getting on a train and feeling really content about the way things worked out and the irksome narrator randomly finds her deadbeat friend and they wander off into the sunset but it's okay because malick never gave me any reason to care about the characters anyway br br as for the plot this film drags along endlessly with no real plot twists or development i can't believe it's only 94 minutes long i could have sworn i was sitting in my seat for a solid 3 hours the sudden locust disaster was like throwing the bible in my face i'm totally fine with metaphors and allusions but this was completely over the top clearly the message was don't marry for money or bad things will happen to you very original br br i understand that days of heaven like all of terrence malick's films is meant to be a piece of art and i will certainly agree that the cinematography is simply stunning and the magic hour shots add a unique aura to the film but i need more than nice pictures to enjoy a film and this one just didn't do it for me
