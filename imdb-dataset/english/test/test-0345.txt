<START> the movie is a riot hilariously funny yet graphically violent just when you think you can't take any more it gives you more great the cast is excellent and the plot is very convincing the past does indeed catch up with our hero but right prevails
<START> a dreamy stunningly atmospheric film takes place in a small town of northfork montana in 1955 the government officials arrive to evacuate the town about to be inundated by a new dam there are the other visitors in the town the angels from another time but they only seen by a dying boy irvin a local priest nick nolte in a quiet heartbreaking performance takes care of the boy irvin pleads with the angels to leave the place with them br br there is some unearthly quality in the film some dignified mourning and sublime sadness when you suddenly realize the inevitable finality of everything humans and their relationships cities countries civilizations the whole world as we know it death and birth have something in common we go through them in the ultimate loneliness br br i cannot recall the film that affected me in the same way and as deeply as northfork did the film so beautiful and so tender so quiet and so powerful so heartbreaking and so moving even now after several weeks since i saw it tears come to my eyes when i only think of it br br after i saw it i had to talk to somebody about it i sent a pm to one of my friends and i asked please tell me what i just saw and my friend replied with the words you just saw one of the greatest films of modern times one of these days others will see the light
<START> i watched this film last night i though i would rent a horror scary film from blockbusters and i got this one out the opening scenes were so long winded the conversations between characters seemed not to lead anywhere br br the story line seemed so poor to me she gave him hiv and then she goes to meet someone else but she is killed by the man she infected i think she may have been doing it for a long time to different people then when he dumps the body it just happened to be the man she was going to meet was in the forest and saw him dumping the body then he chased them did he ever finish burying the body and they got into a car and he somehow found them from a different direction they came from and killed the bloke br br i think the severed head was the only good thing in the film as it was quite realistic and then when the woman ran she happened to fall over in front of him so he could stab her with a spade and then it finished br br what a relief it was the most pointless film i have ever watched please steer well clear of it it is just so poorly made i counted only 5 different people in it and the scene where he kills her is so unrealistic and they only swear in it and thats it thats it from me br br steer well clear
<START> the movie is about a girl who's not going to a bonfire only because she's baby sitting that night nothing weird about that right until the phone rings until the phone rings again and again and again those are not some stupid prank calls this is for real if you wanna see how the girl reacts just watch the movie br br great atmosphere filled with scary sounds very well performed by young camilla belle who got the lead role i see in her some great potential to become a good actress this is more than only a decent thriller i have no idea why it's so underrated anyway on my opinion this movie deserves more than only 4 10 24 of all voters rated the movie with 1 get serious people you couldn't get a better thriller for a title like this
<START> horses on mars is a wonderful journey taken by very small creatures it doesn't have to work hard to hold your attention and the characters are truly memorable most of the credit must go to eric anderson for his choice of visual style and for writing an interesting story but credit is also deserved by for the narration and the wonderful music score these choices were obviously not an accident if you can see it in 35mm scope for the most impact it is quite a beautiful film
<START> although casper van dien and michael rooker are generally relegated to b movies even they are above this movie it fails to convey even the slightest sense of excitement fear or dread unless you count the dread of sitting through the rest of this garbage the direction is amateurish with annoying cuts and jerky movement that hides the fact that the killer is no where near the victims when he attacks and what a killer he is a cheap skull mask and a black hood i liked him better when he was fighting he man this is one of the laziest jobs of character design i've ever seen i mean it's skeletor and he's on a horse this is supposed to be some scary supernatural creature how are we supposed to take this seriously all we get is scenes of this dude riding around the woods on his horse which he can barely stay on interspersed with scenes of soldiers shooting randomly into the woods thinking they can shoot a ghost occasionally skeletor will shoot someone with an arrow or ride by and stab someone revealing how corny the effects really are i generally enjoy sci fi channel fare on a basic cheese level but this film is too inept for any level of enjoyment where's dolph lundgren when you need him
<START> while house of wax will never be mistaken for texas chainsaw massacre or halloween it does try and ultimately succeed in being a worthy addition to quality horror film making there is enough tension and enough implied gore in here to please the young audience of today and there is also enough explicit gore to please some of the purists of yesterday overall it is quite a well done film that should do okay on dvd br br six kids on the way to a football game get stranded in a deliverance like setting and what ensues actually looks like it may have been taken out a discarded sequel and the backwoods hicks seem to taunt the group eventually the group has to break up and half of them head into the desolate town to get some car parts the other half of the group stays behind at camp and this sets up the second half of the film br br house of wax has many strengths the first is that it is blessed with a very likable cast paris hilton is fine in her role but she is far from the focal point chad michael murray elisabeth cuthbert and brian van holt are three very charismatic actors and their presence in the film adds some panache some credibility and some flair i had never really heard of chad michael murray only that he was a pin up type teen heartthrob but he has a presence to him he imbues an intangible to him that seems to translate into his performance he is instantly likable and he possesses a strong character trait i enjoyed his performance much more than i figured i would and when he was on screen the film flowed br br the question now becomes is this film a worthy horror film and the answer to that is a resounding yes as i mentioned off the top it is not in the same class a nightmare on elm street or last house on the left or even the ring but it is relatively tense quite graphic and there are some very inventive death scenes this is not the house of wax that your parents told you about vincent price is nowhere to be seen and when you start seeing fingers being cut off and hot wax covering comatose bodies you realize this film is a little on the edge br br i'd like to see an uncut director's x rated version i bet there is one out there somewhere that would be much more violent than this one be that as it may this is a very good entry into the horror genre and it is heads and shoulders above weak films like i know what you did last summer and dark water and a few others it is definitely worth a look br br 8 10
<START> a bunch of teen dirt bikers are out in the forest riding around in circles they're having fun little do they know nature is about to be unleashed by an emo refugee from a deliverance or hills have eyes movie he's armed with matches and fire and he's got an eye that's bleeding or something why torch a park i dunno maybe he doesn't like smokey the bear or something but he wears army navy store fatigues if that helps br br the rangers send one single helicopter to battle the resulting blaze that's all you ever see except a bunch of people in a base somewhere talking a lot about the fire but doing nothing some cop or ranger or militiaman or whatever he is drops from the helicopter on a defective tether br br everybody now rides their dirt bikes like they're auditioning for motocross they forever pop wheelies do evel knievel jumps spin around etc they argue incessantly shots of the fire are as phony as a 3 dollar bill it's the same footage from a dozen different angles and the blaze never grows or moves and you still never once see any fire fighting equipment br br syfy channel movie which has about 0 science fiction attached to it what you can expect from this bad acting cheap effects and a story that goes nowhere like the bikes and fire go nowhere laughable insomniac cure
<START> interesting tale of giant mammoth elephants running amok in modern india features transparent special effects elephants dressed in shaggy coats sporting tusk extensions all this said we do have a good story and a fine cast at work and an exciting climax it's been said that the running time on this one was doubled when it showed in india courtesy of robert a master at ' given a choice opt for the shorter version
<START> i'm not from usa i'm from central europe and i think the show is amazingly good it can be easily compared with married with children my title says that it isn't show for conservative public i mean i'm not so liberal but it may be slight difference between european conservatism and us cons anyway show is starting to be very popular in our area and it's very bad that it contains only two seasons last episode opens many continuous and funny moments anyway i and many peoples would be glad if that would continue playing the last thing i'm thrilled about this is some moral education very nice packed into humorous scenes i mean i have seen many comedies that has over two and even more minutes of very sad in tragic scenes that absolutely don't fit into comedy war doesn't contain something like that and is made for laughing it's like the simpsons and married whose also don't have any sad or even unfunny moments i'm apologizing for my awful knowledge of english but i still hope that you will understand what i meant
<START> this is one of the best thrillers i've seen it's intelligently made and brilliantly filmed and is one of the few thrillers that creates complex interesting characters and makes the movie about them not the action i would recommend it to just about anyone especially people who like movies with both style and substance
<START> most definitely the saddest movie i have ever seen a must see just so you can walk away and realise just how precious your life and loves are the acting is superb the story line potentially 'real' br br remains a firm favourite of mine even after all this time
<START> not a bad mow i was expecting another film based on womens issues but was pleasantly surprised at the element of suspense sure parts of the plot were pretty hokey but for the most part the movie kept me guessing was the nut bar connected with the ex husband somebody in the tavern or was it the guy person that she cut off daniel was excellent i've seen him in mom's on strike and in guilt by association both and he is very creditable especially the way he challenges his mother the way a preteen would typically act br br laura leighton also played the typical mother ex wife that both men and women can relate to she was frustrated enough to seem real br br see it if you missed it it's worthwhile
<START> okay so this wasnt what i was expecting i rented this film just to see how it would be since i want to see the first one anyway but this film had b movie all over it but when i watched it i realized that it was very funny for the first 30 minutes it was just how the snowman was people and one man losing his sanity but those first few minutes had some funny one liners in it when he throws up the first of his little minions i knew this would be very very funny they all act like the gremlins in the eighty four hit gremlins that it made it look like it was spoofing it and made me forget it was a b movie so if you like to laugh rent this one
<START> the plot in petites certainly left this viewer dumbfounded br br spoiler br br in the space of 48hrs or so character has an affair with a teenager loses his wife's affections attempts to seduce scott thomas is rejected by her goes on to grope yet another female character in the back of a car and then is finally shot for his trouble br br end of spoiler br br wha br br the only saving grace in this flick is kristin scott thomas similar to charlotte rampling she seems a natural to star in french cinema my hope is that one day franÃ§ois ozon may cast her in a part where she can show her true talent br br there are some fine french films such as the remarkable le colonel chabert begging for a dvd release yet this is the tripe that gets chosen br br avoid this one br br zzzz
