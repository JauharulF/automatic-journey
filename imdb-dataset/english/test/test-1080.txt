<START> i bought a tape of this film based on the recommendation of other imdb users and have to say that i was very disappointed i'm a college professor and showed this movie to my class they unanimously voted that it's a terrible film i guess that if you like the old dark shadows series then maybe you'll like this i liked dark shadows when i was a kid in the '70s but now i think it's just awful the first half hour or so at least has the virtue of some fidelity to wilde's novel after that the story veers wildly off course at least as compared with the 1945 mgm version which won two oscars nigel davenport as lord henry is really about the only thing watchable in the whole production a lot of the other acting is bad the music is melodramatic and look of the film is terrible actually it's not a film at all it was obviously shot on video and has that characteristically claustrophobic bbc look about it the opening scenes are particularly poorly lit the women's costumes are terrible the men look all right and a lot of the characters including dorian seem to have 1970s rather than victorian hairstyles the movie does well to include a lot of wilde's dialog but the voice over narration in the voice of dorian contains a lot of rubbish that directly contradicts wilde's character i'm a big oscar wilde fan and i fear that he must have rolled over violently in his grave when this monstrosity was made its only improvement over the 1945 version is that the homosexual subtext is definitely more apparent without being heavy handed i haven't seen either of the more recent versions but if one is interested in seeing the story well told i would have to recommend the 1945 mgm black and white over this one
<START> i spotted this film in a branch of the duane reed pharmacy in new york on holiday and it seemed like a bit of silly fun and sure enough the whole premise is ridiculous beyond words but it turned out to be a thoroughly enjoyable action film for kids and their parents too br br 10 year old ricky bernard jordan garrett has his head in the clouds most of the time much to his father's larry miller dismay as a member of his school orchestra ricky and schoolmates fly to a concert performance and once again ricky's mind off' and suspects some criminal plot is happening br br reluctantly aided by best friend sashi who is a fan of hot sauce what a strange plot device that was and others they try to get to solve the mystery oh yes and ricky's skills 1 000 hours of flight simulator experience prove to be handy when he is called on to save the day in the film's thrilling climax it was good to see eric roberts and mark play parts in a family film and watching the dvd interviews everyone seems to have had great fun taking part br br i totally liked junior pilot charming and good natured performances funny plot line and a real sense of enjoyment and sheer silliness br br if you are looking for an entertaining family film you could do far worse than buy this one
<START> i'm not picky with movies oh i've seen so much crap i could watch anything maybe that was the reason i watched this one to the end im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any self respecting there is the security camera footage of a game play would make it feel more realistic than this movie does the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong in some scenes you can see that it was filmed in some photo when spoilers ahead people running around does not disturb people sitting near computers i mean would you continue your work if you got ninjas around you oh and the jokes about pirates that's the worst one yet in movies spoilers end at least first one felt like a documentary now it looks like someones home video experiment you can find better movies at youtube top line don't waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes
<START> this is an example of why the majority of action films are the same generic and boring there's really nothing worth watching here a complete waste of the then barely tapped talents of ice t and ice cube who've each proven many times over that they are capable of acting and acting well don't bother with this one go see new jack city ricochet or watch new york undercover for ice t or boyz n the hood higher learning or friday for ice cube and see the real deal ice t's horribly cliched dialogue alone makes this film grate at the teeth and i'm still wondering what the heck bill paxton was doing in this film and why the heck does he always play the exact same character from aliens onward every film i've seen with bill paxton has him playing the exact same irritating character and at least in aliens his character died which made it somewhat gratifying br br overall this is second rate action trash there are countless better films to see and if you really want to see this one watch judgement night which is practically a carbon copy but has better acting and a better script the only thing that made this at all worth watching was a decent hand on the camera the cinematography was almost refreshing which comes close to making up for the horrible film itself but not quite 4 10
<START> spoiler warning br br this is probably my least favourite cary grant film i spent most of the time thinking ignore him leave him etc is he trying to kill her should we assume that after the end when he persuades her to return home with him that he will kill her after all i see from checking in a couple of books that this is a reading that some viewers critics have taken finishing early is after all a more reasonable way to film a book than to change the ending and this is a more unreasonable change of ending than for example in altman's the long goodbye unlike hitchcock's earlier example of making the murderer not the murderer because a star has been cast when gosford park refers to the lodger ivor novello's murderous habits are not mentioned the book's ending is not definitely ruled out br br in robin wood's hitchcock's films revisited he writes as one mentally from ending to ending the significance of every scene changes the apparent solidity of the narrative dissolves the illusion of the fiction's 'reality' disintegrates the film becomes a text in which the process of narrative is foregrounded i enjoy playing intellectual interpretation games as much as anyone else but unless the film stands on a straightforward reading then it fails this one fails even after considering the fatal glasses of milk that recur in a few hitchcock films br br an annoying quibble the year is 1941 nothing in the film says that it is set in the past nigel bruce keeps his money in a paris bank and goes there to do financial business does he not know that there is a war on indeed were there still any flights from croydon airport is he on good terms with the nazis how come it is never suggested that the germans shot him as a spy or something br br a curiosity when johnnie and lina have dinner with isobel the mystery writer and her brother the pathologist there is a fifth person present who is never explained nor introduced a woman in a tuxedo the credits say that she is metcalf playing phyllis is this not an example of how lesbians were coded in '40s films are we to take her as lover the books that discuss overt and hidden gays lesbians in hitchcock e g robin wood again do not include phyllis
<START> well i can safely say i'm human wong and i didn't throw up i laughed and laughed if this movie made you puke there is something wrong with you but this movie is incredible i bought it four days ago and have watched it 5 times already the animal cruelty gets my heart but not long enough to be guilty the movie is shocking disgusting and vulgar the acting is horrific what else do you want from a movie i am a die hard cult film maniac pink flamingos is awesome it makes rocky horror as someone has said look like the teletubbies
<START> for some reason my father in law gave me a copy of this tape i think because my great uncle buddy baer was the giant in this movie and my father in law thought i'd like to see it i had years before as a child and didn't like it then either br br my son then two watched it and was hooked every waking moment in front of the tv this horrid video played i went to work with the inane songs stuck in my head the two leads were worse than a junior high stage review the dancers looked like rejects from an ed wood horror flick and abbot and costello phoned their parts in thankfully i was able to distract my son long enough to lose this videotape frankly i think it was the tape from the ring br br to correct another reviewer buddy baer is the uncle of jethro max baer jr not his father 0 out of 10
<START> yumiko the pretty adopted daughter of a recently deceased japanese businessman inherits control of her father's company her uncle kazuo shun miffed that he wasn't left the business to run orders a hit on his niece when jug eared chef takashi enters the wrong hotel room by mistake and knocks out hit man invincible jung yuen he is mistaken for the killer and sent to kill yumiko instead he falls for the pretty heiress and ends up vowing to protect her however she is kidnapped by men while is preoccupied playing an arcade game with cop daniel sam lee br br uncle kazuo keeps yumiko in a hypnotic trance and takes control of the business but runs into a spot of bother himself when his gangster pals threaten to reveal his illegal activities unless he allows them total control br br meanwhile teams up with two martial arts experts lam yuen baio and lam candy lo who are hunting invincible he learns kung fu and attempts to free yumiko br br a mixture of broad slapstick humour and fight scenes no problem 2 is a disappointing film considering the talent involved 80s kung fu superstar yuen baio manages a few fight scenes but is getting a little old for acrobatics these days director kar lok chin delivers the kind of dumb parody schtick i'd expect from a scary movie film jung yuen resorts to mocking his character in operation scorpio and sam well sam lee is as annoying as always br br on the other hand collin chou as gangster ben impressed me he has an obviously strong screen presence which has not gone unnoticed by has since starred in two of the matrix movies and is soon to appear in d o a directed by corey yuen i was also impressed by but for an entirely different reason this beauty is easy on the eye and should go much further in the film business br br there is some fun to be had from working out what movies are being parodied but at 104 minutes i found this film a real chore to sit through if people pulling funny faces accompanied by silly sound effects makes you burst your sides laughing then no problem 2 might appeal to you otherwise i would leave well alone
<START> alejandro amenabar the young and talented spanish director clearly shows us he is a serious film maker anyone doubting it should have a look at his latest film the sea inside this is a movie that has been rewarded with numerous accolades not only in spain but throughout the world wherever this wonderful movie has been shown br br if you have not seen the film perhaps you would like to stop here br br ramon is a man confined to bed being he depends on the kindness of strangers for everything since his accident ramon only thinks in one thing alone how to end his life this is the moral issue at the center of the story based on the real ramon life br br mr amenabar tells the story from ramon's point of view there is nothing here that is false or manipulative on his part after all he relies on facts that were well known in his country as this case became a cause celebre in favor of euthanasia a theme that no one in that country wanted to deal with in spain br br with its background of being a predominantly roman catholic country spain has evolved into one of the most democratic societies in europe a distinction that is more notable because of its long years dominated by a dictator yet in spite of the advances in that society the idea of taking one's own life is something not clearly understood by the majority of its citizens who still considered this subject as something that could not be done in their country br br ramon was a man that loved life he lived an intense life as a young man when he enlisted as a sailor to discover the world having no money this was the only way for him to see other lands experience other cultures ramon's love affair with the sea is something that people in galicia learn to love from their childhood imagine how that same friendly sea is the one that takes away ramon's life as he knew it in a second ramon goes from a vibrant young man into a vegetable br br ramon's family is shattered by the experience suddenly they must leave everything aside to take care of him at home his brother and sister in law are stoic people that deal with the situation as a matter of fact their lives become something of an afterthought because ramon's life comes first they tend to the sick man without protesting or blaming ramon for the sacrifices they must make to keep him alive br br that is why in their minds the can't comprehend ramon's wishes to end it all haven't they given up having a normal life to take care of him this moral issue weighs heavily on these uncomplicated and simple people because in their minds they are doing what came naturally br br the second subject of the movie is the legal issue of the euthanasia and the well meaning people that suddenly enter ramon's life in their desire to help him put an end to his suffering there's julia the lawyer who is herself handicapped and suffers from a rare there is rosa the fish worker who becomes infatuated with ramon br br javier bardem makes a brilliant ramon his transformation is total we don't doubt from one moment he is no one else but the paralyzed man on that bed mr bardem can only use his face in order to convey all the emotions trapped inside ramon mr bardem makes this man real this is perhaps javier best role of his career he surpasses his own award winning performance as arenas the late cuban poet he portrayed in before night falls br br in the supporting roles belen makes an impressive appearance as julia the woman fighting her own physical problems lola is also effective as rosa the kindred soul that loves ramon deeply as ramon's brother shows a man at a crossroads of his own life mabel rivera makes a compassionate the sister in law that never asks anything of life but tends to ramon without questioning why she has to do it at all br br mr amenabar also has composed the haunting music score for the film he is a man that never cease to surprise one wonders what his next project will be but one wishes him success in whatever he might decide to do in the future
<START> the monster will look very familiar to you so will the rest of the film if you've seen a half dozen of these teenagers trapped in the woods movies okay so they're not teenagers this time but they may as well be three couples decide it might be a good idea to check out a nearly abandoned ghost town in hopes of finding the gold that people were killed over a scant century and a half before you'd think that with a title like miner's massacre some interesting things might happen they don't in fact only about 1 10 of the film actually takes place in the mine i had envisioned teams of terrified miners scampering for their lives in the cavernous confines of their workplace praying that black lung disease would get them before the grim reaper exacted his grisly revenge but instead i got terrestrial twenty somethings fornicating and in one case defecating in the woods a gang of morons with a collective i q that would have difficulty pulling a plastic ring out of a box of cracker jacks much less a buried treasure from an abandoned mine no suspense no scares and a couple of embarrassing performances somebody forgot to tell the writers that fool's gold refers to the genuineness of the gold not the people who are looking for it 3 10
<START> this is a superb game for the n64 with superb graphics and a great one player story line and even better multi player game best played with 4 people br br the many levels and options for weapons mean that this is one of the best games around for years
<START> there are bad movies and then there are movies which are even worst saw is just that br br the movie is simply bad on all points the plot the acting the camera work the music and everything else is absolutely terrible and i cannot begin to comprehend how such trash made it to the big screen br br the simple fact is that saw is riddled with plot holes the beginning is enticing and leaves much to be expected but it does not hold up and the plot becomes absolutely ridiculous and absurd the film is not creative and will not leave you with a single bit of credibility people that claim that this movie is gory violent sadistic and scary are sissy girls who have nightmares after watching csi because it is far from that br br so i am warning you know do not attempt to watch this if you have any form of intellect because you will be disappointed a true bore and a mediocre film as can be
<START> superhero movie 2008 is the most recent in the long line over parody movie movies which i despise so much i wish this movie could be the death of the genre but i know that it isn't awful enough to put the final nail in the coffin br br if meet the spartans is considered the bottom of the barrel as far as hollywood movies go than superhero movie is probably near the top unfortunately meet the spartans was actually miles below the barrel and this movie just barely makes it in br br superhero movie has a decent cast of c list celebs it's got drake bell the kid from disney's drake and josh leslie nielson airplane tracy morgan snl and 30 rock and a few others scattered throughout although it has the star power to light a 40 watt bulb the movie fails to utilize any humor br br this movie is about 80 minutes long most of which is dedicated to following the spiderman plot and not one single joke is funny i didn't laugh or chuckle or smirk the entire time br br don't see this movie don't even think about it for the love of cinema just skip it and maybe they wont come out with another one br br oh who am i kidding they'll probably come out with another one by fall
<START> like a lot of films from the early sounds days cimarron must be viewed more for historical interest than as compelling entertainment the hammy acting of lead richard dix nominated for best actor can be excused as a relic of the silent film school of acting however even giving benefits of the doubt cimarron is a badly shaped piece of drama a bloated film that moves from unrelated sequence to unrelated sequence with little dramatic impact the film is two hours and four minutes it feels like four hours when you're watching it there is no reason to waste your time on it unless you want to see every best picture winner or have a keen interest in the early sound days in my opinion cimarron is the worst choice for best picture in academy history and the award should have gone to city lights or little ceasar cimarron is barely remembered today and would have be remembered at all if not for its oscar win
<START> the magic garden is perhaps one of my most vivid '70s childhood memories two hippie chicks with ponytails carole and paula would swing on swings tell jokes they picked off the chuckle patch dress up with costumes they found in a giant chest called the and argue with a pesky pink squirrel named sherlock that lived in one of their trees they also could strum a mean acoustic guitar and sing a pretty melody this was a great childhood show very 70s feeling but that's the problem they don't make shows like this anymore pity that you could tell these two girls really had hearts of gold and loved kids they were really sweet magic garden is one of those shows that if they came out with a box set people would buy it because its such a mellow walk down memory lane
