<START> i absolutely love the first three movies they were great i once caught part 5 on vhs 10 years ago and i was disappointed but perhaps that was because i never saw the fourth one because they were shot back to back but after finally viewing a copy today i have to say it was no way better than number 5 my expectations weren't high to begin with but this is cheap direct to video stuff not even a horror movie it's pg 13 the acting was not convincing the story was rather dumb without any excitement and there were not many effects but the main problem is that there were no kills or any gore the annoying kid who gets killed in his car was supposed to be the highlight but come on br br surprisingly both parts 4 and 5 were directed by sequel director jeff burr who gave us the excellent stepfather ii and leatherface texas chainsaw massacre iii i liked puppet master the legacy even if it was nothing else than a tribute with the best scenes from all movies br br overall puppet master is very much like the hellraiser series a great trilogy but forget the rest
<START> return to me is a charming gem of a movie with an absolutely star studded cast who can go wrong with this modern day fairy tale it also includes many many jokes written by the funny girl herself bonnie hunt who wrote and directed this film david duchovny is also very good showing a different approach then from his everday alter ego mulder on my favourite show the x files a great date movie
<START> it would appear that some previous reviewers may have had their expectations set a bit too high going into this film i found it scanning the satellite channels for something not knowing what and happened upon it i thought by the title it might be one of the myriad soft core porn flicks appearing regularly on the movie channels but i was pleasantly surprised although there was some male frontal nudity in fact more than your typical soft core title go figure this was not the focus of the film it was just fun br br don't be deceived by my tastes my recent screenings have included before night falls and europa europa both imho but i also enjoy total mental shutdown when watching a movie virtual sexuality did this for me and that's not a bad thing
<START> i give it a 2 i reserve a 1 rating for guy ritchie and woody allen films we don't even remember what this movie was about the only thing we recall is one gunshot scene where the actors drop to the ground roll to the other side of a hallway or something and then get back up shooting it was like watching 80 year olds with 2 broken legs trying to perform the also when the characters were driving in a truck the engine noise or radio can't recall would vanish entirely when the actors were talking br br and like others we bought it because of the sandra bullock front cover very sad very bad
<START> the gymnast unfolds in short shots and short scenes revealing its characters and message over time the spare editing is accompanied by a beautiful simple score this intimate approach is wonderful for feeling like you're on a path of discovery as much as the characters are br br the spare approach is also its drawback there are a few scenes that are confusing because they don't have enough context there are some decisions made by the characters that seemed rather flip until i watched the interviews that were in the bonus materials i'm glad i did because the actors' descriptions of their motivations gave me a much more well rounded understanding of the film overall br br aside from the story itself it was wonderful to see women so comfortable and strong in their own bodies the shooting was very tastefully done very matter of fact one has the feeling of seeing a love story and a life story unfold not a voyeuristic sleaze film the physicality of the athletes their realness is a great contrast to the sometimes ethereal nature of the plot br br not a film i'll need to see again anytime soon since the storyline is simple but its delivery is powerful enough to stay with me for a long time
<START> tyra banks needs to teach these girls that it's not all about being beautiful on the outside the inside counts for something too a lot of the past winners have looked semi decent but are horribly cruel and starting trouble for the other girls i see tyra less involved with the girls in every season about the only thing worth watching top model for is mr jay manuel recently tyra had a contestant who was a pre op transsexual i felt that she should have done more to encourage her it was obvious that she had insecurities about her original anatomy showing through her feminine look tyra should have given her tips or perhaps she could have sent resident ms jay to help the girl out instead the contestant was met with harsh criticism and not enough positive criticism it's a shame because i truly enjoyed the first 3 seasons there's a reason why project runway has all 4 seasons out on dvd and top model only has 1 season on dvd it's called taste top model seriously needs a lot of an some more humanity
<START> even mel gibson couldnt save this slop of a movie this was one of the worst movies i have ever seen why would mel gibson make a movie that im sure he couldnt sit and watch what was this a total goofball on some heavy drugs stalking a lady who was also on some heavy street drugs for all the moviegoers out there on heavy drugs you will love this movie
<START> review nunsploitation films they've been around since forever a few that pop to mind are the mexican devil worshiping movie alucarda night of the demons 2 the convent and of course dante desecration cant blame somebody for trying to exploit a religious holy image and twisting it around to make it scary if done right it works here comes the most recent addition to the nunsploitation sub genre simply titled the nun br br the story is about this group of girls that live in a catholic school in this school there's a nun who is particularly cruel to one of the girls the girls acting in self defense against the abusive nun accidentally kill her and then decide to bury her and tell no one fast forward 18 years later and the nun is back searching for revenge from those who killed her br br this movie was produced by brian fantastic factory you know the company that makes horror movies in spain need a reminder of the kind of movies that this company churns out well heres a small reminder arachnid darkness romasanta the werewolf hunt rottweiler you get the picture about the only really good movie that this company has produced in my opinion was stuart gordons dagon thats it oh no wait i believe they also produced the excellent christian bale vehicle the machinist but thats it so when i consciously rented this movie i knew i wasn't going to watch anything that was mind blowingly good still with all that mental preparation i was disappointed br br one of the only good things this movie has going for it is its slick look the movie has some nice cinematography it doesn't look like a cheap horror film the movies special effects were alright with the nun being able to travel through water well that was an image that it self for some cool fx moments that sometimes scratched into cheesy territory but sometimes were cool enough to watch i dug that scene with the nun hurling herself at people like a bucket of water its not a particularly deadly move but it made for a cool visual there's some gore here but not a lot of it one particular scene involving an elevator death was cool but sadly the movie hit its peak with that scene and it was only half way through after that nothing really cool happens and the movie deludes into an incredible borefest br br the movie just turns into the nun popping up every now and then to give us a boo scare she would kill someone and then cut we get back to the characters talking crap going through rooms opening doors you get the drill and i just personally hate it when a horror movie turns into that people opening doors and going into rooms boring and when the characters do talk its terrible dialog in one particularly stupid scene a character decides right out of the blue that the nun turns into flesh and blood whenever she is in the water so thats they way to go to try and kill her and everyone just says ok and they all elaborate this plan to kill the nun in a water tank now who gave that guy this info and why did the others just take it for granted who the hell knows but its scenes like that that make the movie look stupid br br and yet another thing that got in the way of my enjoyment of this film was the fact that they used spanish actors who have a very thick accent when they try to speak english its very hard to make out what the hell they are trying to say id prefer to have them be dubbed then try and figure out what they are saying and become frustrated the fact that this dvd has no english subtitles didn't help matters either br br so in conclusion this is a movie that has some slick visuals nice sound effects but a terrible terrible script i guess this just goes to show that you might have the biggest budget or the best special effects but if your movie has a bad script with terrible characters and situations that your audience cant connect with then you've still got a bad movie such was the case with the nun br br if you want to have some real fun with evil nuns rent any of the films i mentioned at the beginning of this review now as for the makers of this film they should go say ten hail and light fifty candles to their saint of choice to see if they'll be forgiven for making this terrible film br br rating 2 out of 5
<START> it's really just terrible quaid overacts more than shatner the part where elvis walks in and says you can have it all just kills anything that might have been good in this movie that's bad enough as it is drug use was completely snow coated the only thing that had anything to do with his life was the bit about him wedding his cousin quaid also looks nothing like lewis and has dark roots and eyebrows i wish this could be re made in the future with someone who doesn't try so hard a bigger budget wouldn't hurt and maybe more about his actual life i was very very disappointed in quaid don't watch this movie or you will be too
<START> i think it definitely is the writing is of such a quality that beginner students of the english language should model their conversations after its dialogue for example the exchange between paul bronson and ms kathryn davis deborah raffin more about this character later is extremely clear and to the point ms davis says i hope you like chicken it's the only thing i know how to make to which deftly responds chicken's good i like chicken if that's not english grammar 101 i don't know what is br br another thing about this ms davis character sleeps with her on the second date after she practically throws herself at him and tells him she wants to see him one last time this being only the fourth time they've ever met before she moves to her sister's house in ny to get away from the creeps then he really doesn't even bat an eye while her corpse is burning in the street only minutes later never even says her first name through the entirety of the film not once never a get over here katy or a that's a nice dress you wearing kathryn or a be careful katie or the get ya br br and while this 'love' is developing between the two o'herlihy keeps his ever watchful eyes on them it's almost as if is using her as bait to get to much as he uses the camera or the car sure enough when bites bites back hard in the most incredible sequence of events ever caught on film the final fifteen or so minutes are possibly rivaled only by the final thirty minutes of delta force in their brilliance and that's giving delta force a lot of credit in what other film can you see ed lauter take out alex winter in order to get charles bronson's back a troubled gang leader seemingly calling a hotline to summon neo nazi bikers to come to his aid and nimble broadway dancers wearing mesh halter tops posing as street punks all laid down to a soundtrack written by none other than jimmy page if that's not the highest of high comedy then nothing is funny br br truthfully speaking there are a thousand ways to state the unintentional comedy of death wish 3 but the only way to truly understand it is to watch it and judge for yourself
<START> i'm desperately trying to stay awake while watching the movie solomon kane i have about a 20 minutes to go if it gets any better i will come back here and let you know but somehow i doubt that will happen solomon kane looks like it is based on the video game dark watch and it sounds like it is based on the video game legacy of kane but unfortunately neither is true i hear it is based on some comic book or graphic novel or pulp fiction or something else that i have never heard of but whatever it is based on there is nothing original in this excruciatingly boring movie the atmosphere is stolen from the movie 300 which wasn't that great in the first place the tedious overacting takes itself so seriously that it's nearly hypnotic and to be clear i mean that in a bad way the plot is practically non existent violent guy trying to be meets friendly family friendly family is murdered violent guy becomes violent again all the characters are stereotypes taken from waterworld or book of eli or the hills have eyes or whatever just choose another apocalyptic slash fantasy slash wizardry movie that you have seen and there you have it someone somewhere said this is how to make a movie use a blue filter to make everything look mysterious add plenty of slow motion shots of horse hooves splashing in murky puddles add hovering around while two boring characters are speaking to each other and oh yes rain pouring down dramatically to distract from the fact that nothing is really happening and don't forget the black silhouettes walking toward us with fire blazing behind them and lots of torches burning and of course blurry fight scenes during which it's not clear what is actually happening because we don't have the budget for the gory special effects so just throw in the sound of metal and oh by the way don't let any character live long enough for the audience to understand them relate to them or sympathize with them and cross fingers hope that fans of sword and sorcery films will eat it up even though it is complete doo doo and go straight to video do not pass go
<START> this movie would had worked much better if this was the first critters movie this is a low budget movie with only two 2 critters shown on screen why this looks like a fail is because this is the last critters movie and it's so low budget that it seems the director made the whole movie with his own pocket money however i did like this movie i compare it mostly with the third movie which were bad critters 4 have a more serious tone in it the first half of the movie even without seeing one critter yet you have a scary feeling watching it too bad they didn't milk out the critters i mean even if they only had two 2 puppets they could still have used them on screen a lot more the critters also have different deaths in this movie which made this a little special especially at the end with the frozen critter ug has a promotion in this part and is different in this movie which took me by surprise lastly i liked this one because it also has some kind of conclusion to the series so at least we won't see a critters 5 anymore oh one last thing i missed one scene in this movie we never see a critter shoot a spike from its back maybe these puppets didn't have that feature but i was very disappointed not seeing that in critters 3 we see a lot of spike shooting which was the only good thing i liked about that movie
<START> real life husband and wife paul bettany and jennifer connelly star in creation which recounts the period of charles darwin's life prior to the publication of on the origin of species in 1859 his infamous world changing tome on evolution and natural selection darwin's research created an enormous rift a schism between the believers of his day and scientists he was said at the time to be going to war against god and even to have killed god br br the film revolves around darwin's life with his wife and four children jennifer connelly is excellent as his extremely devout and loving wife a revealing scene at the beginning when she leads the dinner table in prayer and charles fails to say amen is foreshadowing of what will follow and of the stark differences between the two she is convinced that he will be eternally damned and bring misfortune to their family by rejecting god br br darwin is torn between his strong love for his wife her faith and his even stronger reason there are beautiful moments of him observing animals dissecting their behaviors and the sequences that make up their lives explaining phenomenons of selection to his children the first born annie having a very morbid curiosity we see him interacting with england's first orangutan jenny playing with it as if it were a child deciphering her every look and action br br annie the eldest child later dies and charles becomes haunted by her death having been closest to her in my opinion this part was too long bizarre and drawn out i did not like the trippy scenes where he seems to be losing his mind and is pursued by the ghost of his daughter shouting and ranting although charles thinks that his wife blames him for her fatal sickness she very poetically says the truth is if i knew then what i know now i would marry you tomorrow their bond is solid and unbreakable despite tremendous differences of belief br br when charles finishes his manuscript he hands his wife the final copy telling her she can burn it if she does not agree she stays up reading it nights on end and finally presents him with a package the book ready to be sent to its publisher in the end reason and perhaps love as well triumph as he makes an accomplice out of his adversary br br it is fascinating that darwin received a full christian burial at abbey proof that his ground breaking ideas were seen as controversial of course but were already then recognized as vital knowledge for the advancement of the human race br br the movie definitely draws heavily on darwin's family life its joys and its troubles i happened to like this aspect but fabio said it was like watching a documentary on i quote hitler's passion for ping pong this is true in some respects and i can't disagree with his desire to have learned more about charles darwin's theories from this film than we do it remains nevertheless a well executed and acted period drama br br my rating 7 7 total score 14
<START> no that its sick it's not sick it made me want to puke because i spent 2 dollars on it its boring retarded and annoying i didn't see the mst3k version which sucks because i bet the mst3k version was funny it's sad that people waste money on these kinds of movies i'm surprised its not on the 100 worst movies of all time list br br rating 0 outta stars
<START> how dare you adam low without apparent shame puts his name to this fake tribute it's not even a serious study or analysis or commentary of the great visconti's work yes it's long and portentous yes we do have some wonderful clips from the films that most people interested on the subject have already seen but what the longest leaving the most lasting impression is the gossip the last and loudest voice comes from a third rate german actor ranting and raving the appropriately named mr low directed this hoping i imagine to get better ratings than his previous more to the point but deadly boring documentary on kurosawa well i have news for you mr low and your cohorts you missed a great opportunity and i for one won't give you another
