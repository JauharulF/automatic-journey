<START> this is a wonderful look you should pardon the pun at 22 women talking about breasts theirs their mothers' other women's and how they affect so many aspects of their lives young girls old women and everyone in between with all shapes sizes etc talk about developing reacting celebrating hiding enhancing or reducing their breasts br br it's charming delightful sad funny and everything in between intercut with documentary footage and clips from those famous old young women's films that the girls got taken to the cafeteria to see the interviews are a fascinating window for men who love women their breasts into what the other half has to say when they don't know you're listening
<START> this film for me and my wife is more entertaining than all the bloc buster violent thriller mystery murder movies that abound it is about real people making the best of their lives they just happen to be indian and the main characters are in law enforcement the realistic acting and the great scenery more than make up for the slightly implausible plot the sound track is by bc smith who also did the soundtrack for coyote waits and is great adam beach plays a tribal policeman who is a little bit accident prone and wes studi is the stoic consummately professional detective there are many other fine either supporting or cameo roles by graham greene cardinal etc we have also seen coyote waits another adaptation of a hillerman novel and we greatly enjoyed it too
<START> i will not comment on the story as such i agree with most peoples comments that this is a good all round action movie with a well told story and good acting br br this film deserves 100 for cinematography for its opening sequence the opening shot is stunning and i have not yet figured out how they did it the movie is worth watching for that shot alone a pity therefore that the dvd that is currently out is just the movie and no information is given as to the making of the film let's hope somebody comes up with the special edition br br and the even better thing is that the opening sequence also becomes the ending leaving you totally guessing great stuff a must have for a collector of classic film moments

<START> the english patient is one of those films that mostly deserve all the highest praise i say most because this movie albeit very serious intense deep and really thoughtful still suffers some drawbacks first and foremost why oh why are the modern films so long this one lasts for more than two hours and from time to time it becomes really hard to concentrate and follow the extremely serious plot i say if the film were an hour shorter that would serve it only good however we have what we have the winner of several oscars the english patient is still very good it is a deep insightful treatise of human soul love and betrayal war and cowardice violence and bravery ralph fiennes is a smashing superb actor his hero neurotic and silent is an enigmatic person ready for everything only to save the life of his lover he is great even though half the time he is a deformed cripple he is the strongest link here juliette binoche is as usual very convincing and sweet she adds a lot with her excellent play and the love story plot with that sikh officer willem defoe colin firth christine scott thomas are all here all enormous and all very strong and then there is desert of egypt then there is deep sky green of italy the nature is here even when people die bombs roar land mines explode war is here too it is obvious terrible and bloody then there are corpses horrible gory bodies then nude bodies adultery and all i do not know what to say so much of a splendid actors' work so much of realism so much of brutality that war brings this is not a film for relaxation it makes you think
<START> after just viewing the movie i must say this is one of the worst films i have ever seen this takes my worst movie award away from komodo which is no easy feat it is neither a porno nor a legitimate film and it gives them both a bad name the acting camera work plot script and sound are all awful my personal favorite part of the movie is the duck asking the bartender if he has any grapes why was a joke such as this put in the film was the director thinking i need a humorous scene to balance out the great acting so i will use some lame ass joke i read on a taffy wrapper another retarded part is when norman spills the invisibility potion on himself as he attempts to keep it from spilling why did they even bother to give the film a nc 17 rating were they hoping to get as large of an audience as possible at least if it were rated x it would be more sexual and therefore taking the viewers focus away from the overall low quality i pray for someone who worked on this panty waste of a flick to respond
<START> i just started watching the show around july i found it by mistake i was channel surfing during a vacation it is a great show i just wish it wasn't on so late at night it's on at 12 30 am as a working person it makes it hard to watch all the time br br i read some comments i did not agree with the late one about not growing up in the 60's and not believing that this stuff can happen br br i grew up in the 60's i'm hispanic and i had a white boyfriend plus we had black friends in high school i believe people get along because of their interests and personalities and it has nothing to do with being a certain race or color br br i can't wait till the show goes on dvd so i can buy it this way i can see it from the beginning
<START> bed is a strange movie it's very convoluted as if it had a lot of ideas but lacked the ability to bring them all into one coherent story instead we get various plotlines that diverges into their own separate little movies oh sure they eventually meet up in the end but it all seems rather superfluous of note is the girlfriend and her troubles at the hospital was this interesting then there were the we are spirits thus we have no physicality elements which leads to the same problem that people had with ghost namely if the characters have no physicality i e no corporeal form and they can phase through walls and what not how exactly do they keep from falling through the floor or float up the ceiling for that matter br br bed was highly touted as a new breed of south korean film there's plenty of special effects but the movie itself is hollow and its faux melodrama will only touch those who are easy to well touch to begin with br br 4 out of 10 br br go to www nixflix com for a more detailed review of this movie and reviews of other foreign films
<START> john leguizamo's one man shows are hit or miss mambo mouth showed off his intense characterizations and great timing but the material was average o rama accomplished the former as well but this time the material was funny freak is a classic followed by his disappointing sex o holic but his stuff in freak showcases his genius and when he's in the spotlight he's without peer br br semi autobiographical look at the journey of a young man has power and resonance i don't think even it's creator knew about by allowing us the chance to see his soul mr leguizamo gives us an opportunity to project our own life onto his and there can be no greater gift a performer can give the willingness to drop 'the wall' expose and share is too terrifying for most actors they use characters to hide behind but goes full throttle and gleefully smashes any pretenses lenny bruce and richard pryor were our best cultural observers comedians actors because they spoke from their heart about whatever they noticed in society and the truth provided slashing humor combine that with a great actor's gift of mimicry and being in the moment not to mention a sense of humanity and you'll see john leguizamo has the power to do the same at least in freak he does br br from birth to his first big break and every life altering moment in between a viewer sees our host and other characters in their most private moments all the while experiencing the pain hope and humor that comes with looking drained and lean muscled tight is ringing with sweat by evening's end having offered up his crazy life for an audience spike lee's fluid camera work captures the actor's nuances down to the last lip curl and slow blink the scenarios range from drinking with his machismo fueled father when he was 9 to seeing a chorus line with his gay deaf uncle his first girlfriend's vicious humiliation when he strips naked eager to have sex a nightmarish first sexual encounter with a large german woman in the back of a kentucky fried chicken follows an unsuccessful attempt to pick up a drunk lapsed catholic in a bar on st patty's day climaxing in a serious showdown with his mother and father it's here that he shows his true genius he plays a scene between these two characters and himself and his brother with such a strong dramatic humourous intensity you forget you're watching only one person there's no costume changes bad wigs lighting tricks or makeup just an actor giving his all it's simply amazing br br other actors comedians that stand out right now are eddie izzard and chris rock but they don't dive into themselves as deeply as john leguizamo does that's not a criticism not by a long shot i love their work but freak is different it's moving in a no b way it's the best one man show out there and no one will be able to touch it for a long time
<START> what happened to mathew modine's career i can still recall when he was considered an a list actor br br was it cutthroat island the final nail in the coffin of a once promising career wow this guy must really hate renny harlin's guts br br this movie wants badly to be a comedy but fails to deliver any laughs the characters are caricatures and badly drawn ones at that but still what pains me the most is seeing mr modine taking up on this kind of roles next to actors so far away from his caliber i mean at the time when he was making movies like birdie he could never in his worst nightmares have imagined that in the future he would be acting in movies with a hick humping a cow that just had her anus stapled shut and maybe whats even worst next to elizabeth berkley
<START> i was a guest at the sept 30th screening of eddie monroe and was pleasantly surprised with the story the great acting and the talented directing i found it hard to believe that all this talent can be found in an independent film powerful performances by uncle benny sara jessica and morris eddie monroe the supporting cast was chock full of colorful and amusing characters this film reminds me of one of those movies that you will look back on in 20 years and discover that it launched many actors into stardom much like the outsiders where tom cruise emilio patrick ralph macchio and others can be found look out hollywood there are new stars out on the horizon and they can be discovered in a little long island independent film called eddie monroe great job
<START> this is not the kind of movie that really merits critical attention it's not going to win any oscars it's really not a very good movie at all heck it's not even really a movie just a string of short disgusting gross out skits strung together in an effort to make entertainment and as much as every critical bone in my body cries out to give this movie a failing score gosh darn it i'm going to give it a much better score the kind of people who are going to enjoy this movie are not the kind of people who really care what critics have to say so i'm not going to give some snobby critique of jackass's quality of surreal existentialism that permeates and on how our society oh forget it br br what's to say there's no plot development no character development no real beginning there's a semi enjoyable end that's not nearly as funny as the skit that precedes it and everything in between reeks of improper bathroom humor that junior high kids laugh at it's actually pretty funny br br leave at the door all your preconceptions of a good movie jackass number two is just gross out crap that's really all it is i do give the filmmakers this though they come up with some pretty imaginative stuff you'll probably cringe several times throughout want to throw up a couple times wiggle and shift uncomfortably as the people on screen do death and vomit defying stunts vomit crap urine semen virtually every bodily fluid can be seen in jackass number two there's nudity sexual humor abounds and so on and so forth br br it's entertaining if you're the kind of person who finds this stuff enjoyable then you will probably really like jackass number two i laughed several times like i said it's pretty imaginative stuff i never once wanted to vomit though i do have a pretty strong stomach just accept the movie's premise a bunch of idiotic guys do weird crap for fun once you get past that accepting it and going with it you'll enjoy it the only flaw in the movie is the sheer excess of all the weird and disgusting stuff there are several very imaginative very disturbing skits but it drags in many places as they do ones that are less interesting towards the end things pick up but in the middle of the movie the drag hurts the overall film's quality in a half hour tv show this isn't a problem but with film length celluloid it's inevitable that boredom will ensue at some point after awhile the gross crap just becomes br br on the whole though number two is an entertaining imaginative and above all disgusting comedy that will leave you with a feeling of pain nausea and hilarity go see it if you must but hey if you know you don't like this kind of stuff don't bother you'll just be disappointed
<START> an insane assault on viewers senses this is a mish mash of assorted hindi and english movies poorly done the name carries over from a 70s' multi star cast which the 2002 version also boasts of the story is taken from the 70s' dutt roy starrer and visual effects taken a horrible attempt from the matrix terminator 2 and mission impossible ii br br set in a college environment shetty akshaye kumar college kids is the victim who mistakes a fatal assault on her by two students as a collective effort on the part of our heros as it turns out is a cobra nag snake reborn as a girl in this life and her mate from the previous life now a super powerful all and any shape assuming nag is out looking for her in this life appeals to him to avenge her violation and murder br br so begins the mad killing spree where the avenging lover starts singling each male of the group with increasing powers and tricks with successive attempts the effects are extremely cheap with computer generated skeletons morphing bodies and motorcycle stunts completing the farce br br carry over from includes raj playing a catholic priest who provides temporary relief to our boys with a more religiously correct multi religion the original only had an om sunny deol plays love interest in her current life and the ultimate saviour against the all powerful br br music and songs are below average br br avoid if you don't fancy cheap thrills
<START> i first saw this film in the late 60's and try to see it every time it comes on tv which unfortunately isn't often now that i have tcm and fmc i hope it will be on at least once a year like louis gossett jr in an officer and a gentleman jack webb delivers an unbelievably great performance as a parris island drill sergeant with the classic screw up recruit and the story line in this one though dated is touching and very well acted and having real jar heads in the cast certainly helped in the realism of the film as well it's a great film with top notch acting and a superb story see it if you have the chance it's well worth the time
<START> being a fan of zasu pitts comedies i thought this one looked like it was worth a try i was quite disappointed br br the version i saw was on tcm but consisted only of the niagara falls movie the miss polly movie was absent the talents of the actors who give fine performances is wasted on one of the stupidest stories i have ever had the misfortune of sitting through br br tom brown tom wilson surprised me by being the strongest actor in the show but the spotlight is by slim summerville sam sawyer who if he has any talent didn't demonstrate it here br br zasu pitts elly sawyer is great but doesn't have near big enough a part the biggest laugh in the movie is when she ends up under sam under a table br br the only one in the movie who has any sense at all is tom wilson margie marjorie is unreasonable in general while she is physically quite attractive her personality and attitudes make her completely undesirable elly sam and the hotel desk clerk are just complete fools br br sam and elly give up their honeymoon suite in the crowded hotel for tom and margie but then they take it back sam ends up imprisoning tom and margie in their room most of the movie is them trying to break out but sam using a rifle always puts them back again br br towards the end comes the worst part tom who is finally about to make good his escape runs into a minister on a lower floor of the hotel now the guy who as i said is the only one in the whole movie who has a head on his shoulders suddenly for absolutely no reason at all decides he has to marry margie br br he drags the minister up to the room he has just escaped from but margie doesn't want to marry him he gives her a kiss and now after one kiss she feels compelled to marry him br br finally sam has the nerve to say to tom you deceived me when practically the only line tom had to sam earlier was we're not married to which sam replied you think i'd believe that br br idiotic
