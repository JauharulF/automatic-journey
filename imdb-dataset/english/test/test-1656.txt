<START> ordinarily i wouldn't waste the time on reviewing a film like human pork chop the 2001 version not to be confused with the earlier film of the same title which is probably better known in the west as the untold story but since the reviews already here are quite vague as to what it actually consists of i figured i'd best post something more detailed so as no one actually gets tempted as i was into buying it because of the film's mystique i honestly would just say stay away br br major spoilers are contained below br br human pork chop i was expecting to be like a chinese interpretation of the popular japanese guinea pig films anyone who's watched enough of that series can see where its makers are coming from there's a strong sense of humour running throughout it you can't watch the ludicrous he never dies without laughing and the making of guinea pig is a fabulous turning of the whole thing on its head proving it was just made with some glee by fairly good natured gorehounds all the gp films have a punk rock diy shot on video aesthetic occasional flashes of genuine artistry mermaid in a manhole an angry political agenda and a warped deranged zeal that sets them in a league of their own br br human pork chop has none of the above br br it's shot on 35mm film with disarmingly good production values it's 90 gruelling minutes long and it's utterly devoid of anything redeeming the plot tells in flashback at a police interviewing of the suspects of the systematic torture death and eventual dismemberment of grace a heroin addicted streetwalker who is kidnapped and brutalised by her pimp and his henchmen when she steals money from him br br despite its fleeting attempts at being a morality play the film possesses a detached inhumane feel to it and one can't help but dwell on the mindsets of those behind it although it half heartedly paints grace as an innocent victim the mean spirited nature of its screenplay and the protagonist's constant vicious dialogue veers towards a shocking utterly unwelcome she deserves it point of view which makes the whole thing almost impossible to watch far more time is spent detailing grace's degradation and when her captors are eventually deemed guilty and jailed it seems like a hurried afterthought on behalf of the writers who've long since stopped caring less br br what makes it boggling as to why anyone would want to watch such a film is that even the kind of people who do really get off on mindless sex and violence in the movies would be severely missing out the torture is just a continuous stream of slappings verbal abuse psychological abuse and then increasingly bizarre displays of power on behalf of the captors use grace's heroin addiction to make her do their bidding and when i say that don't get me wrong incidentally unlike guinea pig with it's frequent barrage of nudity that gives an almost teenage feel of mock titillation to the proceedings in spite of the ultraviolence human pork chop has no such sexual overtones there isn't any actual nudity in the film and the violence is performed purely out of malice by the odious protagonists who early in the film are seen stuffing a dog into a bag and banging it against a brick wall don't worry not real just a cheap special effect br br the only actual bloodshed in the film is towards the end when they dismember grace's body and boil the bones all very poor special fx nowhere near guinea pig level and by that stage you'll probably be already feeling too miserable and sick to even care what's going on br br the film is depressingly bleak and uncompromising along a similar line to buddy combat shock and i guess could even be compared at a push both movies deal with the gradual physical decline of an individual who exists in a nightmarish environment devoid of any social or morally redeemable characters and both movies in a particularly visceral manner with the individual's inevitable inescapable doom br br in fairness neither it's violence whereas guinea pig could easily be accused of this but one can't help but wonder where the place is for a film like this it fails to many any real points in its frank presentation of such brutality and with a leaden pace a virtually non existent plot line and the aforementioned lack of any entertainment value i just can't understand what would encourage anyone to watch something like this i only made it to the end purely for the purpose of being able to review it fairly which i hope i've now done br br overall score 0 of of 10 welcome to the bottom of the barrel
<START> for me pink flamingos lived up to it's reputation as being the shocking disgusting repulsive trashy film i was expecting it to be that really contains everything but the kitchen sink we are treated to almost two hours of nastiness that never lets up rape sex sex with chickens transsexuals castration murder cannibalism and a horrid display of singing out ones anus it is about a strange couple who begin a competition with a trailer trash family trying to steal their title as the filthiest people alive divine a fat guy in drag is an unbelievably vile human being who actually becomes painful to watch trust me when i say that this film is not one to be quickly forgotten especially the end scene in which divine eats dog crap off the sidewalk i have always thought john waters was over rated and i cannot say i like this film but it is an experience if you ever get a chance to see it
<START> i totally disagree with the comments of one of the critics before me who bashed the film having read the book being impressed by it although this is a kind of literature that you cannot really like similar to hubert selby's writing i expected being shocked but the effect was more subtle than this isabelle hubert is a brilliant actress who manages to convey a multi layered character there are many scenes that totally focus on her and her subtle changes and i can imagine few actresses who would do so well with so much disregard for their own reputation or image there is this coldness distance cruelty and at the same time there's this helplessness hurt and pain there's a person who's in control and controlled at the same time maybe this is not realistic although when you read the newspaper you'll read about much worse than this but there's a truth to it that is very difficult to bear i think it's an excellent film but i did not enjoy watching it it's not boring but there are times when i wished it would end btw her male counterpart is very well acted as well and i think well chosen too
<START> the hell's angels did come out the losers in this movie sonny stated to the director that nobody does this to the angles and gets away with it his version was the two dudes were to be to death but his suggestion was ignored they were stoops to even appear much less be technical advisers in a stink bomb of a movie like this hell's angles on jap bikes c'mon although in sonny's autobiography he says f k harley davidson and that if they was smart they would be riding read his auto he hates harleys can you imagine the angels whispering into town on their sewing machine sounding jap bikes not too intimidating they would get laughed out of town
<START> i've watched this movie movie casually and i've never stop watching because is so ridiculous any dog can play this act and will be better then the actors actors of this bad remake of the fatal attraction there is no directing no playing only an unlucky copy of the adrian lyne movie if you have doubt to suicide watch this and you can choose for yes br br i can't imagine people that went to cinema to see this rubbish maybe someone that had an empty afternoon and choose the first cinema near house to stay 2 hours with some others to forget problems but it's hard to go back home relaxed
<START> this is better then the first the movie opens up with sheriff sam then sam and anne pack there bags up and head to the while jack tags along br br people are shot get glass through necks get squished by get stabbed with icicles eyes gouged out head explosions drownings hangings lobsters shoved into faces slit throats freezing to death killed by snowballs arms are ripped off melted by anti freeze icicles down necks hit in face with pots and pans fingers getting' bitten off icicles through mouths bitten on the neck exploding people toasted snowballs and shoved in br br the snowballs are hilarious they put it into a blender and turn it on then it says 'that was fun' they put in in a waffle thing and it gets burnt br br this is just a great movie then they start thinking of other ways to kill it and the snowball replies 'that's not nice' br br it was worth then ten bucks spent to buy this br br 10 out of 10 stars
<START> especially by lambert this is the essential burrough's tarzan that i grew up reading when i was a kid i have read a few negative reviews on this film and couldn't help but wonder what their issue was they obviously didn't see the movie i did or they were expecting something that was more akin to the saturday afternoon serials br br this was the tarzan that was of the novel and the film makers should be applauded for tackling the source material and taking it seriously lambert was excellent i still think he is one of hollywood's most under rated actors this was a movie that he shines in br br the photography and the apes done by rick baker both were amazing you definitely felt the since of the jungle the 2nd half tarzan's attempt at being civilized really pulls you into the emotional conflict he had was forced to resolve br br i highly recommend this film
<START> not all films made in 1931 are this creaky and the fact that this was best picture must have given even greater impetus to the development of television br br typical of all novels it isn't possible to bring the entire story to the screen to say nothing of developing character dix so stolid in the first third of the movie does an about face but no one knows why and it makes no sense and what is there about dunne that makes makes her so stoical edna may oliver's scenes are priceless as usual br br this film has a role to play in the history of cinema but it is long and boring
<START> this anime recounts the tale of the battle for king every 1 000 years 100 children are sent to earth to fight to determine who will be their next king in the original japanese the creatures are which literally means magic evil object each is paired with a human partner and given a magic the human can use this book to unleash incredible powers in the and when a is defeated their is engulfed in flames alternately a book can be captured and burned directly after that the returns to the world br br the titular character is gash in japan a 6 year old with electric powers he is paired with and 14 year old genius is initially reluctant to fight but learning that some are evil and deciding the battle for king is wrong he decided to fight to become a 'kind king' br br bell has drawn comparison to pokemon but a better comparison is to digimon like digimon the and human have a one to one symbiotic relationship also unlike pokemon both shows have an actual plot br br bell features character growth and evolving relationships and some fairly adult story lines like love vs racism slavery mind control etc it even has some decent plot twists and mysteries
<START> i seriously enjoyed watching this movie for the first time some years ago and whenever it gets aired again somewhere which luckily happens from time to time in european cable television i experience the same thing i'm moved entertained and end up wishing there were more movies like this one br br it all deals with leo kevin mckidd and his group of friends living in urban london leo as a gay guy who follows a friend to a hilarious new age men's group and falls for straight guy brendon played by dashing james purefoy who turns out not so straight after all thrown in as side characters are the equally great tom hollander and hugo weaving whose side story alone is worth watching the movie simon callow as the leader of the men's group turning in a great as ever performance but it's really hard to pick some folks out here because every character the female ones like jennifer julie graham's and harriet walter's as well are exquisitely acted maybe even kevin mckidd looks a little pale compared to his co actors but it benefits his somewhat subdued character br br the idea behind this movie is a simple one there is never only black and white are difficult and may not always stand the test of time br br leo identifies as gay but ends up falling for a woman as well who turns out to be his teenage sweetheart and long time girlfriend brendon starts out straight but gets to learn that gay may be more than just an option for him and being bisexual might not be that bad after all darren and jeremy hollander and weaving are gay and loving it and even the straight folks in the movie like angie leo's female roommate get their fair share of love and funny moments up until the end of the movie the comedy bits especially tom hollander who's just hilarious are funny and on point and the emotions are believable as confusing as they may appear at times reading this summary br br what i like about this movie is its genuinely positive notion whether you're gay straight bisexual or simply not sure this movie leaves you feeling that it's just okay not to be sure and that not being sure might be something worth living out as well sexuality is portrayed fluid in this movie and none of the main characters seem to have a real problem with it apart from all the gay straight camp fights that you sometimes get fed with in other gay themed movies i can only wholeheartedly agree with the subtext of the movie that what you feel certain of one day when you think you identify as gay straight whatever can look very different on another i have never seen what to call it bisexuality or maybe just the absence of the segregating need for sexual classification being portrayed in such a heartwarming and true to life manner br br this movie dares going where few movies go gay or straight movies by not playing on labels and stereotypical assumption of sex and relying on that it goes further and assumes that there may be a life to sex after well known and i think the times are more than ready for that and other movies exploring postmodern themes like this one br br and for all others who don't care about that heck it's just a funny comedy worth watching on a rainy saturday evening with some popcorn on your hands give it a try br br loved it
<START> this movie looked like the out takes of the deleted scenes from a high school film class experiment it made no sense it was well acted but i only felt sorry for the characters because they had to appear in this slop the alien machines were created with i technology and no creativity they were crabs the under lit and barely seen aliens were frisbees with legs where were the tripods the editing done by director writer producer make up artist jumps all over the place with some scenes repeated numerous times most of it seemed to have been filmed in the wake of hurricane katrina the next time wants to make a movie someone needs to slap him in 2005 alone he produced 11 movies that doesn't include the writing editing directing or visual effects credits on other movies if the rest are like this snot load then he's just making fun of us this was a slapped together rip off of spielberg's movie nothing more i'm looking forward to x man the have eyes
<START> yeah i made it all the way to the end it was pretty hard though br br sometimes i was wondering if there was even a director on set the acting well i don't even know what to say i thought the girl who played emily tried her best with the boring sometimes wacky and sometimes predictable dialog br br i know that it was low budget but the hollow sound and the lighting unfortunately made it look and sound like a 100 minute long audition tape br br i'm not even going to talk about the ending br br the best thing about the movie was the music br br that being said i do not recommend this movie to anyone even for lesbians who don't have many movies to watch overall this is nothing to waste your time on if you're looking for a sad lesbian themed movie check out the children's hour lost and delirious or high art those will all leave you depressed and gloomy but you won't have to suffer cinematic hell in the process
<START> i finally got hold of lifeforce on dvd with the widescreen format intact and rousing henry mancini score to the max after having viewed lifeforce for fifteen years on tape i have to say that the dvd version was both great and disappointing the u s version is so much better than the dvd european version the u s version of lifeforce moves much faster the editing on the dvd version is terrible feels like an unfinished cut and the many scenes not seen in the american version add little or nothing to the final problem in fact one new moment almost destroys the entire movie when caine peter firth meets the male alien at the cathedral i love this scene in the u s version though on the dvd the male alien speaks to caine and what he says is soooooo hilarious it's the pinnacle of hilarity br br it'll be much less terrifying if you just come to me the male alien says in a deep 1950s style voice i was floored when i saw this it just doesn't belong in the movie that scene is pure camp in an otherwise super serious flick i'm glad hooper or whoever cut that scene when the movie was released in north america there are several changes that were made for the u s version that make lifeforce that much better and i wished the dvd had the u s version the editing is sharp and frenzied without being annoying and some spots that were already boring in the u s version are even more boring on the dvd version because of added scenes and the opening credits on the dvd is terrible much better in the u s version more subtle br br i love this film it's basically aliens making a pit stop over earth and sucking up as much lifeforce as possible the film has too many flat uninspiring sequences talk talk talk but when the action goes to london it's fun the film really shines in these scenes one can see hooper finally doing what he's great at chaos savagery horror lifeforce should have had more of these chaos scenes they're the best apocalyptic scenes ever put on film it's also the best zombie movie ever the zombies are hungry for lifeforce not flesh and they're crazed and agile and terrifying not the slow moving bores of other zombie movies also a lot of people have criticized the ending but i love it it leaves you high and dry like one of the lifeforce drained victims br br and to think this movie came out during the cute and cuddly 80s when people flocked to e t or cocoon or other sweet and boring feel good sci fi movies no wonder it bombed because it was way ahead of its time with its super nihilistic point of view br br as for the dvd well it ain't great the image is muddy and grainy and there are no extras whatsoever but it's great to see the movie in its widescreen format i just hope that they'll release a clean crisp u s version on a dvd and with commentary by hooper and
<START> the basic story idea of enchanted april is excellent two very unhappy wives meet and decide to pool their funds to rent an italian villa for a month to further defray costs they get two other strangers to come along what makes it interesting are the relationships both before and during this vacation in particular showing how this beautiful setting actually changes their outlooks on life unfortunately this good idea is totally spoiled by two key performances in the ensemble cast that are so bad that they ruin the film ann harding plays the most important role in the film in a manner that makes her seem ridiculous her doe eyed expression and vacant stares really make you wonder if this isn't a zombie movie or she's just meant to be an idiot and to make it worse reginald owen plays a character so obnoxious and bombastic that i was very close to turning off the film he was that awful and unbelievable i noticed that at least one reviewer gave this movie a 10 which is very very difficult to understand sure the film has great ambiance and a good plot but these two glaringly silly performances cannot be overlooked as they undermine the rest of the picture sorry but this film was aching for a re make
<START> writing about something so wonderful is completely hard actually it's almost impossible to describe the peculiarities of this movie this is a marvelous story about sex and gender and it's almost unbelievable that we have not to deal with obscene scenes of sex feeling this film was made for people that like to feel and just to feel life in all its complexity in a gorgeous simple way we look at it and something starts growing inside our minds even our hearts it a pure poem i've watched some gay movies and i almost always got really unsatisfied with unnecessary scenes of sex not because i don't like scenes of sex but generally they are so pornographic that i'm forced to think that the director or the producers or the writer of the script thinks that homosexuality means perversion no is totally different from that ones three are the main characters we have ito yoshida and two boys and a girl in a peculiar love triangle ito likes his best friend yoshida yoshida likes and likes ito imagine what this could turn in unprepared hands but in the contrary makes a magnificent story which goes profoundly in the philosophy of life adding a question in our mind that made me think astonished in the end of the movie why and that why expanded in multiple questions inside of my brain and inside of my heart the scenes actually sometimes tending to be boring are moments of the most delightful poem which we are able to feel but totally unable to write down in words and maybe because of that we are unable to understand the question in the end of the movie i'm sure this movie was not made for us to discuss every piece of itÂ some people want to understand a film almost dissecting it others are so used to common american gay movies that can't appreciate the real value of this master piece watch it close your eyes in the credits and feel everything feel yourself feel the wonderful song for all this and much much more i give a nine and i just don't give ten because ten of ten is perfection but i confess i almost did it
