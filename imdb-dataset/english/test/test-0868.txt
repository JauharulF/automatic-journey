<START> eight teen convicts are brought to the abandoned blackwell hotel to clean it out as community service they soon discover that it's the residence of a hulking psychopath kane who has a thing for pulling out and collecting eyeballs it doesn't help that the guard watching over them steven has had a previous run in with the beast four years earlier br br a guilty pleasure of mine are slasher films most of them are poorly directed and acted but they still hold some appeal and entertainment value see no evil is a good example of this it features atrocious writing and acting but the death scenes are pretty good and the movie proves to be entertaining the premise sounds like a mixture between friday the 13th saw 2 and halloween resurrection i really liked the idea but it didn't work out too well it was really just a bunch of clichÃ©s and everything was predictable screenwriter dan madigan just focused on the death scenes and nothing else apparently the death scenes themselves are pretty good and gruesome director gregory dark did a good job with them and he came up with some creative kills br br the acting is pretty bland and unremarkable this is because all of the characters are one dimensional and we don't know much about them it was hard to feel for these people because they were pretty unlikable kane is surprisingly mediocre i was expecting his on screen presence to be scarier but he didn't do that good of a job a second rate jason voorhees if you will the rest of the actors are relatively unknown and this film will probably neither help nor hurt their careers br br while the death scenes are gory they aren't necessary scary there's really no suspense just some gory death scenes because of this the movie doesn't hold much of a repeat value also if you don't like slasher films then don't waste your time with this one it will do little to change your opinion in the end see no evil is a decent slasher film but it is generic and forgettable so it's not exactly worth watching rating 6 10
<START> i'm astounded and dismayed by the number of reviewers on this site who did not get the point of black snake moan it's not about black white relationships or old young relationships though i think director craig brewer deliberately threw in both elements to tweak imagined taboos it's not about sexual abuse or sex addiction though christina ricci's character rae typifies those it's not about folk religion in the black community though religion plays a large role it's not a love story though there are not one but two happy couples at the end and it's certainly not about the south where everything is hotter though it's set in the south and it's undeniably hot holy smokes even the tag line writers didn't get the point br br black snake moan is a parable about mississippi delta blues who feels them who writes them who plays them what they're playing about how it heals them br br it's as though the film producers sat down with a blank slate and asked ok if we were going to help people understand what the blues are really about what would it look like so they set it in the rural south then they dream up two characters one whose wife left him to live with his best friend the other who goes off to war and his badly abused girl sleeps with everybody in town then we throw in grizzled worldliness touched just a little by folk religion they know jesus wants their lives and though they respect him they know they can't give him that some violence between men and women and lots and lots of steamy sexual images including ready to go over the top a black man in a sleeveless holding a half naked white girl captive on the end of a 40 lb chain fill it with authentic delta blues sounds make it about a genuine blues picker use music as the main healing element in the plot slap clips of blues man son house on both ends and voila you have a modern parable about what the blues are all about even the film's climax is not character conflict but the whole town dancing steamy dances to hot raunchy blues br br of course there's a bit of a dilemma here rae ricci is being destroyed by uncontrollable lust and is being healed by jackson's homey religion and and don't forget the chain but then we're shown the restored rae dancing raunchily to blues at the end is this an expression of a restored healthy life force or just more of the same trashy behavior that ruined her in the first place brewer wants it both ways but blues really is about sex and violence not to mention depression i suppose he would say blues gives healthy expression to both sex and violence without unleashing either i have my doubts br br not for the first time samuel l jackson plays so well that we forget we're watching samuel l jackson the man is unbelievably good he even picks some of his own tunes in the film and his playing is authentic dirty and hot christina ricci isn't usually this good either granted half her job is done by the costume that wasn't there and her slinky figure but she's a marvelous combination of cynical lust rebellion and vulnerability bravo to her she's arrived i was impressed by the country preacher john jr i had to check the database to assure myself that he's a professional actor and not a genuine country minister br br parents need to be aware of what they're getting if their kids bring this one home the language is pretty far off the charts the first half hour is full of graphic sex and women are violated in a dozen ways during the course of the film lazarus means well and is decent but honestly chaining a woman to the radiator plus ricci spends half the movie dressed for sex if you've got teenage boys they'll be licking the screen halfway into the film i don't recommend this for kids of any age adults only please br br that being said black snake moan is informative and accurate about blues folk religion and sexual abuse and tells a tale that's redemptive in lots of ways it's unorthodox but well worth the time and my goodness is the sound track hot
<START> while i understood that this show is too weird to please everybody i don't get where all these bad reviews come from and i'm most surprised over the bad reviews that it has gotten from fans of the movies i liked it and got hooked on it since the first episode i watched it's a little messed up though that was put into school and it seems to be high school rather than college but i guess he's only eighteen right so it's not like he's too old to get educated and haven't the royals always had to get the best education to them so the has to graduate or he won't become emperor thing doesn't sound too weird for me and i guess his education was neglected before so that's why he has to be educated now
<START> this is a very amazing movie the characters seemed so realistic to me it was hard to believe they weren't real people being from the south i thought judith character seemed especially real and as everyone else has mentioned she does an outstanding acting job the characters are not beautiful and look nothing like the average hollywood stars their imperfect bodies and personalities seem so much more natural and real br br one reviewer mentioned that the main character alice had no good reason to run away from home which is true she didn't have any moral or upstanding reason to run away such as escaping child abuse etc i thought that she was just fed up with dead end jobs in a working class life and wanted to flee down to florida where her friend lived the appealing and privileged life of a college student in miami the actress shows alice's confusion uncertainty and questioning turn into and willingness to take control of her life with impressive naturalness the film also shows how alice is trapped in situations with seemingly no options causing her to panic take action and reach out for help br br at first the grainy filming style put me off and made me think that it was a very low budget or homemade movie but in actuality it is very well done the home movie quality really makes you feel like you are there with the characters a part of their rv trip across the country this is definitely a film worth seeing although i don't quite understand all the descriptions of it as a heart warming coming of age tale it is rather vulgar and disturbing at times even if it is not completely sad in the end
<START> first i have to say that i don't like since fiction movies at all so much but there are some movies i liked really this is one of the others i've the same opinion like some most others here the film is still going on in my back but the few effects are really not enough to watch the whole time i think what they have done well are the animated sceneries with 3 suns and 4 moons but its the only i liked there are no intelligent dialogs are there but its a great film for everybody who loves lara croft or some other girls in hot pants br br for the directors stop to try again please
<START> this is one for the golden turkey book it's another of those putting on a show flicks the dialogue is turgid the music is terrible the costumes may be the worst ever and the nick castle choreography is hilariously dreadful check it out oh ye who love bad flicks only perry como is tolerable
<START> not finding the right words is everybody's problem in this vaudeville type urban comedy they don't know what to say and they don't know how to say it which is why they embark on the potentially humiliating enterprise of pre arranged speed dating unfortunately they all come across as cardboard characters rather than real people the story follows a conventional three act structure getting to know the sizable cast in their sorry single lives the actual dating circuit and a final stretch of romantic fallout showcasing some of the new found couples' follies because it's all so predictable i'd say that as a narrative is a failure as a comedy most of the time it's too goofy to be really funny thumbs up to von she stands out from the soap opera crowd as the aloof independently wealthy miriam great makeup on her too heavy eye shadow meets skin tone lip gloss creating a brooding and bohemian yet girlish effect thumbs up also to stefan as the bavarian love machine and as the hot they bypass the communication challenge by way of the timeless body language of copulation
<START> i love this movie i know some people might say that it was not a great movie but i really disagree the comedy is classic mel brooks style and the actors were superbly chosen this was my first exposure to cary elwes and dave and what a first impression they made cary elwes shines as robin hood the only british robin hood mind you he has great comedic timing and the right attitude for this type of film dave is obviously much bigger now but at the time this was his first movie and he did an outstanding job as the characters were all very well planned out and all added their own little quirks to the movie i highly recommend that you rent this movie and enjoy it with a nice bowl of popcorn and some close friends
<START> or better yet watch fandango if you want to see a really intelligent and funny male college age road flick rolling kansas sounded promising in fact the program guide gave it 2 5 out of 4 stars which usually means it's fairly watchable but i pretty much fast forwarded through it usually road trip movies have great music but i can't even recall whether there was music the only high point was a small role with rip torn as a wise old hitchhiker guru otherwise the jokes and timing missed all along the way the four main characters are unknown actors and i don't remember seeing any of them in another movie oh yeah i see that hayden church was in it but he's in everything good bad or indifferent this movie is about as funny as watching someone else stoned when you're not
<START> as many of today's movies are guilty of the plot isn't exactly stellar the movie doesn't move anyone and certainly this won't warrant any award outside of perhaps but then again who really cares br br eddie murphy and robert de niro team up to produce a very funny at times hilarious movie that i really enjoyed russo and shatner played their small parts well as well man i hope in the future my wife ages as well as miss renee has br br moving along this buddy cop flick produces high laughs in a reasonable amount of time the movie is enjoyable enough to avoid the wait for video dvd release and instead to go ahead and check it out br br eddie murphy is at his usual top form and is downright enjoyable to watch de niro has molded into this type of role perfectly br br i really enjoyed this movie and think that any true movie fan in need for a good movie or just a good laugh will really enjoy showtime br br top performance murphy hilarious enough said directing job nice nice action scenes used murphy and de niro together like a charm russo fed off in a nice supporting job br br my rating 7 out 10 it's not going to move you or anything but it's an extremely enjoyable movie br br it's showtime was a great success
<START> paranoid park is about alex a 16 year old skater who causes the death even if accidentally of a security guard as the movie goes on alex deals with little issues like his parent's divorce and the sexual heat of his girlfriend jennifer played by taylor momsen who you can currently see in gossip girl while he's consumed by guilt i had seen just one movie by gus van sant so far elephant and i can assure you that he kept all his mannerisms while doing this one once again he crosses time lines once again he uses weird filming techniques like the never ending shots of people walking maybe you like these filming techniques i know i don't the plot feels unsatisfactory to me its almost to simple to be explored for such a long time the feeling i get same with elephant is that gus van sant tries too hard to make an artistic movie which causes the movie itself to loose substance also gabe was pretty bad as alex there's a difference between looking alienated or detached and looking like a robot if you're a fan of mr van sant then watch this otherwise skip it br br 3 10
<START> lets get one thing out of the way i am a huge bruce campbell fan i have the evil dead series have the action figures and have seen bubba ho tep i am a fan of cheesy laughable horror flicks and know how to appreciate the whole it's so bad it's good deal br br i wish i could say the same about this movie i watched this movie with high expectations i wanted it to be good campy something from the bc we have all come to know and love it started out promising enough but after the first 20 minutes i resided to watching the rest of this sorry excuse of a movie as if i had just been shot with tranquilizer darts br br the idea itself isn't a bad one two men don't get along both killed by the same psycho woman half of one man's brain is transplanted into the other's head they argue disagree and the comedy ensues br br what killed me is how extremely unorganized and boring it was it had potential even as a camp flick to be so much better than it was the plot was boring even bruce's zany physical slap stick couldn't make it work br br word's cannot even properly express the ridiculous robot that bruce's wife's brain ends up getting put into easily the worst looking robot i have ever seen anywhere even for a b movie the whole idea is dumb br br what the hell was going through bruce's mind when he made this steaming pile is beyond me why ted raimi didn't go running to his big brother asking him to slap some sense into bruce and not to mention some lessons about making an enjoyable movie on a budget is beyond me br br shame on you bruce
<START> finally third time lucky this film has been always been on my mind but my first viewing i forgot about it and only caught the second half of the film then only a couple months later i had the my second chance of watching of it so i decided i would record it only to discover that my timer went off late and again i missed the first half of the flick i wasn't going to allow that to happen again so when it came on tv again i thought bugger it i'll wait until it comes on then i will record it and it was a good choice i would have just watched the film but they always put on around midnight br br after discovering a hole in their crowded cell nine prisoners escape their confinement to track down the key of the universe which a fellow prisoner known as the counterfeit king said he had hidden they think that this key could be an opening for a hidden loot of counterfeit bills on this journey they naturally see this as an opportunity to pick up their lives before they were although things don't turn out the way that they intended to with most of the criminals plans going astray br br 9 souls is an perky spiritual journey from japanese director which flung it's viewers into a film of two totally different halves the first half of the story plays out more like a psychical comedy with the criminals bonds and the situations they find themselves being the selling point but all that makes way to a moralistic and consequence drama packed second half where the real trouble begins with some quite nasty and bloody moments replacing the goofball tone it started off with while the first half is quite amusing with its on the road screwball doodling and offbeat banter but it's really the genuinely haunting latter half with it's peculiar turn of events that hit you so hard with some surprising touches that make you really sympathise for these very human characters even though they are not truly innocent from their crimes you just become entrenched by these flesh out characters in the first half that when you see them spiral into their downfall you know it's an effective drama when you become shell shocked in the dramatic change the nine characters get enough screen time to truly understand their personal story and what weakness would eventually bring them down the way the plot works out is that and are the lead characters and we mostly see it from their perspectives the escapism tale is an unquestionably engaging character study that's clear in it's goal and puts to you many questions on society and the path you choice to take to escape life and free yourself from these restraints br br while the symbolic story is full of clarity and vividly told the visual element doesn't go by unnoticed because there's just a dreamy and trance like vibe that channels itself into the unique atmosphere what highly contributed to that factor and gave the film a lift was the sweepingly moody instrumental rock soundtrack the mellow atmospheric gel it was able to create in many scenes left me rather breathless with the everlasting emotions it was able to provoke simply beautiful and downright powerful control on that front the pacing for such an long film 2 hours seems to breeze by and editing is swiftly done because we are just so wrapped up in it all the hypnotic photography is crisp in detail while the performances by the cast as a odd bunch of criminals are that of high quality with each one providing enough personality and features to separate themselves br br i found 9 souls to be a pleasing and quite an amazing surreal film that stirs up the emotions and then it smacks you with an almighty wallop when it changes direction highly recommended
<START> family guy has been hilarious for so long but i feel like it lost it's sharp and random humor at the start of season 6 although i enjoyed blue harvest it felt like the remaining episodes were wrapping up episodes where the producers made little attempt to fulfill family guy's reputation of american social satire br br i have seen all the episodes from season 7 and i was utterly surprised and happy that family guy has found their true colors again season 7 delivers a lot of fantastic episodes and with a lot of jokes about the current situations in america which is exactly what we need right now more fun br br i feel that the simpsons has lost its spark all together this show however has made a terrific recovery from going down to proving how perfectly satirical they can be great job
<START> this is the worst film i've seen in a long long time never mind the fact that so many useful things keep appearing on this island how convenient the acting is beyond poor from the outset its like one of those really badly scripted soft porn films on channel 5 a complete waste of time and i cant remember the lead actors name but i cant believe he still gets work i've never seen him act i've seen him in lots of films but i've never seen him act here are a few of the blaringly obvious errors apparently petrol lighters still work even when they've been soaked in sea water also according to this film you can walk into the sea naked but come out wearing bikini bottoms i'm guessing the camera man and editor were students there are plenty more errors but i'm ranting now besides its no so much the errors as the cast the script and the whole film avoid at all costs
