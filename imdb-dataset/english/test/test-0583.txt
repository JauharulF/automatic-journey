<START> i watched this movie only because i was under the impression that i was going to be treated to a cheesy horror flick i mean look at the tag line they're men turned inside out and worse they're still alive does that not scream cheesy horror movie to you and the then there's the title itself what a perfectly apt title for a horror movie i thought unfortunately i wasn't aware that the real title was properly translated the island of the br br so about an hour into watching this i realized that this was not a cheesy horror movie at all it was a cheesy adventure story about slimy fish men from atlantis men turned inside out no there was nothing of the sort i was grossly disappointed br br damn you misleading taglines i want those 81 minutes of my life back
<START> the what now yeah i thought it was a stupid name as well chris carter remains blissfully unaware of the scum in his writing staff starting off with the usual cheery x files teaser a baby getting run over by a train this episode well i can't really say it goes downhill because to be honest it was never going uphill br br poorly written with us feeling no pathos for any of the characters except maybe that baby at the start the writer makes us hate characters before brutally killing them off it's the worst technique ever are we supposed to feel sorry for the characters of hate them don't ask me br br not only is it boring and un scary but it's like watching a really bad omen sequel with overblown and disgusting death sequences and rotten special effects although to be brutally honest that's the least of my worries br br sara b began her x files career with a whimper and thankfully ended it with one as well br br verdict br br in the words of my maths teacher mr horrible awful
<START> this show is a show that is great for adults and children to sit down together and watch the stories are a little slow for adults but they are still good there are lots of children in my family boys and girls and it is hard to get them all to agree on what to watch but they always agree with each other when they want to watch the mystic knights it is a wonderful show and i hope that they will continue to keep making it all of the kids in my family and myself think that vincent walsh is the best of them all we have seen that he has done lots of other work and think that he is doing a great job we wish all of the actors actresses writers directors and producers the best of luck and would just like to say keep up the good work
<START> i actually liked this movie sure the acting was flat there was no plot and the villain was the lamest that i've seen michael as dante is worth laughs in his own right with an incredibly funny catchphrase and evil laugh but its worth seeing just for the worst explosion you will ever see outside of the power rangers tv series you'll know it when you see it honestly this movie must have the budget of a low grade porno i almost stopped watching after an hour but i recommend watching through the whole thing at the very least there's plenty of eye candy for all to enjoy recommended for viewers with a high tolerance to poor movies
<START> well now this strange movie it was listed as a comedy but i certainly found nothing to laugh at actually i am struggling to find anything positive to say about this film oh here i go alex is not bad in the lead role and i did not pick the ending for a change but apart from that this has no great direction solidly two dimensional characters and is not funny enough to be a comedy or serious or dark enough to be any form of decent drama i would really avoid ever having to watch this movie again and think it does nothing to benefit any of the working class characters it is attempting to portray i found it hard to empathise for any of the characters and was not given enough information on the lead character jimmy to believe his motives best avoided
<START> it's the best movie i've watched this year excellent detail and storyline for a remake br br it presents to you a what if situation wherein the island of japan could totally be wiped out of this earth a thought provoking life and death situation and not to mention all life on earth well in this particular japan it also presents a great and genius solution to this massive tragedy br br horror action suspense sci fi documentary love story and all the human interest story you can get you'll find everything here but i also warn you that it is a real tearjerker the casts actors and all are all excellent better than any hollywood movie br br the thing is this could really happen to anywhere on earth now let me ask you this after you've seen it what would you do if you are faced in this life and death situation
<START> ok i've now seen george zucco in at least four separate horror suspense films recently as i worked my way through various 50 pack collections and i have to say the guy had a limited range but he was good at what he did he wasn't karloff but prc was lucky to have him br br but the poor guy was stuck in a kind of back water ghetto of horror films and he wasn't good enough to take them to the next level of interest not with the thread bare screenplays and direction and budgets he worked under that's the case here br br this movie is well slow stodgy and unexciting for the most part the heroine seems to be doomed to be a rent a center version of judy garland the hero is bland as white rice and the poor guy playing the monster doesn't even get a good transformation scene out of the deal his make up effects aren't scary at all he looks like a slightly more shaggy version of a farm hand is all br br it's not a total waste zucco looks good on camera he chews the scenery while managing to deliver some terribly affected and contrived set speeches without flinching or losing the flow there are some moody b w shots here and there that don't completely suck br br so all in all this movie helped some c through z level actors pay their rent for another month and it never sinks below a certain hacked out level of quality watch it once if you like george zucco or just feel the need to see every wolfman themed movie ever made
<START> was this supposed to be funny this is one of those films that just doesn't work the first one bruce almighty with jim carey had some very funny moments this one had none br br steve carrell who was brilliant in bruce almighty fails to deliver here his performance is very ordinary and he can't carry it off like carey did br br the one good thing about this is i only paid 1 95 to rent it it's a movie for children very young children who have only seen about 4 films or so in their short lives br br it's interesting to note that where jim carey stars in a film and they make a sequel without him that it's usually a huge turkey anyone remember son of mask imdb worst 100 films of all time avoid this one movie lovers
<START> the director of this movie must have been mentally ill or even high when he accepted to direct this movie i'd rather stare at my ceiling for 5 hours straight instead of being punished to watch that stupid movie my parents make me watch it as punishment don't watch it the director of this movie must have been mentally ill or even high when he accepted to direct this movie i'd rather stare at my ceiling for 5 hours straight instead of being punished to watch that stupid movie my parents make me watch it as punishment don't watch it the director of this movie must have been mentally ill or even high when he accepted to direct this movie i'd rather stare at my ceiling for 5 hours straight instead of being punished to watch that stupid movie my parents make me watch it as punishment don't watch it
<START> i have wanted to say this since i first saw the movie i still will not allow any of my children or grandchildren to watch this at least not until i tell them and they understand that it is completely fiction the only thing that i saw that was correct was that animals went onto the ark everything else was false lot and noah fighting on the ocean like a pirate movie make sure you tell your kids the real story before you allow them to watch it but really until they are old enough to understand that it is not real they may have a messed up vision of the bible this was the worst bible movie i have ever seen bruce and evan almighty were much better and had more to teach let your children watch those
<START> there are many different versions of this one floating around so make sure you can locate one of the unrated copies otherwise some gore and one scene of nudity might be missing some versions also omit most of the opening sequence and other bits here and there the cut i saw has the on screen title witchcraft evil encounters and was released by shriek show who maintain the original us release title witchery for the dvd release it's a nice looking print and seems to have all of the footage but has some cropping aspect ratio issues in italy it was released as la casa 4 witchcraft the first two la casa releases were actually the first two evil dead films retitled and the third la casa was another film by the same production company filmirage which is best known here in america as ghosthouse to make matters even more confusing witchery was also released elsewhere as ghosthouse 2 except in germany where ghosthouse 2 is actually the ogre demons 3 ok i better just shut up now i'm starting to confuse myself br br regardless of the title this is a very hit or miss horror effort some of it is good some of it isn't i actually was into this film for the first half or so but toward the end it became a senseless mess a large vacant hotel located on an island about 50 miles from boston is the setting as various people get picked off one by one by a german speaking witch hildegard knef photographer gary david hasselhoff who wants to capture witch light and his virginal writer girlfriend leslie cumming who is studying witchcraft are shacking up at the hotel without permission along comes real estate agent jerry rick farnsworth who's showing off the property to potential buyers rose annie ross and freddie robert champagne brooks also tagging along are their children pregnant grown daughter jane linda blair and very young son tommy michael manchester as well as oversexed architect linda sullivan catherine hickland hasselhoff's wife at the time once everyone is inside their boat driver is killed hung and the boat disappears so they find themselves trapped and basically at the mercy of the lady in black br br so what can you expect to find here plenty of unpleasantries one of the characters has their lips sewn shut and is then hung upside down in the fireplace and accidentally slow roasted by the rest of the cast there's also a crucifixion witches eating a dead baby a swordfish through the head someone set on fire a possession a sesame street tape recorder the virgin getting raped by some demon a guys veins bulging and exploding thanks to voodoo doll pokes and some other stuff from a technical standpoint it's a nice looking film with pretty good cinematography a decent score and good gore effects the hotel island setting is also pretty nice blair particularly at the end and ross both seem like they're having fun and knef is great as the evil witch even though people like to ridicule hasselhoff these days he's not bad in his role either br br on the down side despite all the gore the film seems somewhat dull and it gets monotonous after about an hour the supernatural themes are muddled and confusing too when characters are being swept into the witches lair to be tortured and killed the filmmakers unwisely decided to superimpose the screaming actors over some silly looking red spiral vortex effect that looks supremely cheesy and the witch lair itself is vacant and cheaply designed with unfinished lumber and while most of the cast is at least decent a few of the performances particularly the actress who plays hasselhoff's girlfriend and the kid are so bad they're constantly distracting
<START> role reversal remake of the major and the minor has jerry lewis stepping into the part originally played by ginger rogers but unfortunately this anemic outing is missing a lot more than just ginger lewis attempts to pass for a child when boarding a train he's successful but the deception leads to a string of comic and romantic confusions sidney sheldon adapted the screenplay tossing in musical moments for dean martin playing yet another in his stable of second bananas and a jewel robbery subplot which is dire diana lynn who played the wily teenager in the original film plays lewis' love interest here she's cute jerry isn't 1 2 from
<START> this was one of the most emotional movies i have seen passion pleasure pain despair sorrow healing cleansing and love br br the entire movie was spellbinding everything was done so well the adaptation from the book the actors the sets the camera shots br br this movie touched me deeply in so many ways it reminded me of the despair that loosing your love can have and the time it takes to heal that wound you may love again but will always be risking the pain that comes with separation br br is this not one of the most important age old questions br br is it better to have love and lost br br than to never have loved before br br ascension
<START> they just don't make cartoons like they used to this one had wit great characters and the greatest ensemble of voice over artists ever assembled for a daytime cartoon show this still remains as one of the highest rated daytime cartoon shows and one of the most honored winning several emmy awards
<START> i must preface this comment with a sort of admission i suppose i just have a soft spot for the original 60s 70s tv series i think the filmmakers here blew it from the get go as far as casting in a supposed remake audiences would look for reflections of the hip athletic clarence williams iii or the cool with it michael cole and so forth instead we get giovanni ribisi as a poor little white rich boy who comes off as just pathetic like he is in all his roles in the office i used to work in i amused myself once by creating a fake movie poster casting various actors as members of the office staff guess who i cast as the dorky son of the company president danes does ok as the new julie but none of the characters have much to do as the story just sort of sits there mired in conventionality so it's quite forgettable besides what was i talking about
