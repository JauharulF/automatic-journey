<START> i shot this movie i am very proud of the film it was a great experience which shows up on the screen hussey is an excellent collaborator who had a vision and was able to capture the movie in the exact way we envisioned while prepping the film the sets are amazing and well crafted for each character john york and his team built sets that not only fit the characters they worked well in shooting the film allowing us to move seamlessly through walls and from one set to another each character has an amazing arc which makes for a great story i feel like all of the actors gave excellent performances i disagree with some of the other comments that say the acting was not good watch it and decide for yourself
<START> viewers of independent films know that once or twice a year they are going to see stories about dysfunctional families and they have come to expect them and it's becoming more of a challenge to keep them fresh but here despite the good cast it just seems more of the same story is about the travis family who is trying to recover from the suicide of matt kip who was a very promising high school swimmer ben jeff daniels is the father who withdraws from everyone and has never treated his other son tim emile hirsch as well as matt but he does communicate of some sort to his mother sandy sigourney weaver who finds his stash of pot and starts to smoke it br br spoiler alert sandy also starts to flirt with much younger men like the check out cashier at the grocery store but when she attempts to buy more marijuana she gets busted and hauled off to jail she doesn't tell anyone what happened but she does discover bruises on tim's body and also that ben has taken a leave of absence from work after all this happens sandy falls ill and lands in the hospital where her life is in danger which forces ben to realize that he may have to come to terms with losing another part of his family br br this film is written and directed by dan harris who has worked with bryan singer on x2 and also the upcoming superman film and while his script allows these characters to have genuine moments of expressing their pain and confusion the story for me just has too many things thrown in the script touches on so many different areas that you need a scorecard to keep track of them all including drugs sex love infidelity abuse neglect experimentation with homosexuality and a life threatening illness if all those scenarios weren't enough for you harris then tacks on a plot twist at the end that's supposed to sum up and explain most of everyone's feelings towards tim while i did roll my eyes at least 2 or 3 times with the way the script kept one thing after another i must admit that i didn't hate this film and i have to credit the actors for that everyone has at least one good scene somewhere in the film but i wish the story would have concentrated more on weaver and her character than hirsch weaver is exceptional and with a sharper script she could have had a role that maybe would have led to an oscar nomination but instead we get endless scenes of hirsch at parties or his shenanigans with the neighbor next door harris shows he can be a good writer director but with this effort he just throws so many different things at the audience that the material just becomes labored and contrived
<START> i remember viewing this movie when i was a kid i recall it terrified me immensely and it stayed with me all these years i spent a couple of years trying to find it online didn't remember the title only the storyline after searching and searching i came across a vhs that was being sold on e bay i was excited and when it finally arrived i jammed it into the vcr and couldn't help but feel a bit nostalgic needless to say i was slightly disappointed this wasn't the movie i remember watching as a kid it was boring at times and i found beryl reid's incessant extremely annoying both performances by reid and flora robson were good overall but the movie wasn't scary i think any movie is worth viewing to form you're own opinion but sometimes well
<START> eisenstein created the russian montage theory and this film is his finest example it took years before someone could utilize his ideas and make them work the limey 1999 nonetheless the baby carriage scene really demonstrates the discombobulated nature of granted like most movies it gets long in some parts the beauty of the film is amazing one of the best silent films i have ever seen
<START> mansfield park in its second half is my favorite of austen's novels and fanny price my favorite of her heroines so i'm saddened by the unhappy fate she's suffered in her big and small screen representations the only good reading of the character i've heard was done for radio by amanda root who gave it the same quality as she did the character anne in the film of persuasion a stern sure heartfelt moral centeredness if the actress had been younger she would have been good visual casting as well but the that have reached our eyes to date have more resembled respectively mary crawford ruby the scullery girl and in this incarnation a jovial serving wench or possibly tart with her high moral principles pulled down a peg br br well i had hoped for better but had feared worse the serial had a solid edmund in an actor who was best at likable saps and the perfect i e perfectly abominable mrs norris otherwise it was dullish the film which was apparently intended as a deconstruction or some other bad theatrical idea came off as a mixed up burlesque after such disappointments and the more recent disappointments of this production's sister pieces the new persuasion and northanger abbey i couldn't help but have mixed expectations for this one and on the whole it left me feeling slightly better disposed to it than not it condensed the novel intelligently and in the end left me with much the same feeling as a comic book version might on the other hand to do so it had to rework most of the characters except the crawfords and it incidentally diminished or eliminated most or all of the most memorable things in the book including its most famous character and what should be if it isn't its most famous scene br br the character is the officious aunt norris always ready to direct other people in what to do but always managing to avoid having to do any of it herself here one gets no sense of that at all and with her goes much else her remark that cuts through fanny considering who and what you are sir thomas's discovery that she has forbidden fanny a fire in her room all these years and his roundabout apology for her fanny's honesty in acknowledging during a visit home that aunt norris for all her faults could manage the household better than either of her sisters but then that entire trip is missing from the story and so is most of what goes on at the theatrical rehearsals and most of what sir thomas on his return and in fact sir thomas himself and his wife are different from what they were above all the scene in which crawford proposes to fanny one of austen's most complex is simplified to a bare telling missing from it is fanny's staunch upholding of what she knows to be right and what she knows to be very probably true against all the distractions crawford and anybody else can throw at her to a male reader now no less than when it was written it reveals with unmatched clarity unmatched at any rate as far as i know what a woman goes through in trying to deal fairly but firmly with a man she has reason to distrust it's a brilliant scene in the novel on tv it's just a scene br br and fanny oh fanny when will we see your like
<START> my daughter already wrote a review of this movie in my sign in but i want to add a few words br br velvet' was one of my two favorite movies as a child the other being 'the wizard of the cinematography the acting the script and the music all came together is such a wonderful little heart felt drama that it can still bring tears to my jaded eyes based on a book by enid the script followed the book quite well the characters are so thoughtfully created it's easy to become emotionally involved with the entire family and the quaint little irish village in which they live the premise complete outsider believes in her horse and herself enough to chance a try at the greatest horse race in the world is awe inspiring to any young person especially a young girl in the 40's a time when girls were sometimes ignored as humans beings let alone athletes you would have to be terribly hard boiled not to appreciate it's merit br br but the perspective i cherished most about this movie is the unabridged innocence in it's moral message it's almost magical how 'mom and apple the movies were back then i was really taken aback by the imdb reviewer who asked 'was the world ever really this trusting ' and then proceeded to chastize the director for his complacency regarding overnight travel involving the two main characters my answer to his question is an unequivocal yes the movie going world was that trusting in the 40's br br my grandparents remember taking my mother to this movie when it was released then my mother took me to see it when i was young and my daughter was lucky enough to be born at a time when she could watch it repeatedly on video tape now we have it on dvd it's been a family favorite for generations albeit generations of horse lovers it was never about sex it's about coming of age it's about believing in yourself and working hard to reach your goals also so old fashioned it wasn't even about the prize money it's about the girl child who understood her horse had what it took to the best' and yes the director was indeed concerned with elizabeth taylor's lack of physical development because the book made a big deal about velvet brown liz taylor's character having to cut her hair and bind her chest so that she could pass as a male jockey when she went to the grand national this was a guys only sport back then i think there have only been 12 women ever to compete in this race it's almost insulting that anyone would bother to think the lolita thing about this particular movie besides anyone having had anything at all to do with an adolescent girl and her horse would know that the only thing they ever think about with stars in their eyes have four hooves and a tail br br and now for a great bit of trivia the stunt riding was performed by the now famous whisperer' monty roberts i believe he is given mentioned for his riding in the movie credits br br i give this movie a 10 out of 10 i never get tired of watching it again
<START> i felt last night's episode was slow and kinda of boring at times i honestly don't think it has to do anything with the writing because i know the story was well staged and tried to keep things in place i thought it wasn't that bad but overall i didn't enjoy it the most blame has to do with the director of that episode stephen williams i always hated stephen williams's directing if jack bender continues with this episode from the season premiere he would have kept it in a good pace and keep things float to keep things interesting i'm glad jack bender is directing next week's episode and it'll be much better and i'm glad he got first episode to direct and i'm curious what he will pull off this time since stephen williams had directed too many episodes before br br i always keep thinking that stephen williams needs to be thrown off from the show he doesn't even do anything interesting with the show br br why does the opening have to be done with a target thing while being in the helicopter it was so boring bad perspective of camera work too
<START> the various law order and csi franchises had better be glad doesn't pass through the lady cops and would all be enthralled and the males be subject to such soul shivering badge melting warp speed kicks wouldn't you just love to see david caruso's horatio and that know it all on csi get hush puppies pulled from their respective asses ice t might start crying and get back on the trail br br low low budget bad but enthusiastic acting and a vision at what nightclubs offered to its patrons funk bands soul singers the last vestiges of old style circuit entertainers that dance troupe james brown wilson pickett otis redding and a host of others came from those clubs to glory while their peers labored on in local or regional stardom rudy ray moore came from that background and the character of is a mix of the bold black who through he shouldn't have went to the joint the swine didn't have a warrant how his middle aged self maintained a loyal stable of kung fu is a mystery only a student of cults can explain but all that is beside the point it's a glorious home movie of a legendary performer that compared to the mirrors of actors ranging from established hollywood to indie film hits its mark a fun dumb movie
<START> i think the movie was one sided i watched it recently and find the documentary typical of western movie makers that was biased without substance the fact is prostitution do exist everywhere in the world not in alone and not because of this fish business there prostitutes were there way before the russian and other business people arrived in poverty is indeed endemic in africa let alone and this is not because of fish fillet business in fact the fish industry has helped millions to support their families on their daily life this movie just tarnish the good image of this peace loving country as for the arms trade the film could not substantiate if there is any truth in that indeed looking critically at the films one is doubting the authenticity of the film maker it seems that their trying to prove their point by using a few characters which can be done for anything really yes is a poor country yes there are prostitutes and street children but they are not the product this business it is just a common scenario in most poor countries indeed the world over even in the western world what a load of rubbish br br the pilot themselves are talking of sending weapons to angola which is more than south of and the war was in also miles away from the director could not give evidence how these weapons were transported from to br br in short the films lacks focus and respectability it is quite easy to find the character anywhere in africa and has nothing to do darwin's nightmare or fish fillet what a load of rubbish br br the truth is the nile perch has not decimated all other species in the lake contrary to what the movie portrays and also less than 25 of all catches from lake victoria are exported the rest is consumed locally so lets get that one right
<START> what a waste of time i expected better from cameron diaz i guess it wasn't really her fault for being in a terrible film the film does not capture the beauty of europe and wasn't successful in leading the audience into suspense or wonder weak attempt at storytelling and narrating dialogue is dull and wasn't able to convey what i sometimes think simplicity is beauty no love energy electricity on screen too bad 1
<START> this telecast of the classic musical sweeney todd does not do the production justice but is still quite enthralling br br firstly the most enjoyable aspect of this version is the production design from the wheeling multi set to the startling then the staging is excellent right down to the slashing br br the main failing here is in the performances people give oh they're believable all right but it is quite frustrating when nobody seems to be hitting their cues on time in a song as fast paced as say kiss me in fact the actress playing johanna is not only off tempo to a dismal degree but also slightly off key and angela lansbury's slightly overdone cockney accent is a bit irritating one more thing too what exactly is so bad about judge turpin's performance of johanna that it is banned from the american theatre but not the cannibal anthem a little priest br br otherwise this is an excellent production it's a thrill to watch people do what they love and i'm not even talking about meat pies with a twist
<START> i went to an advance screening of this movie thinking i was about to embark on 120 minutes of cheezy lines mindless plot and the kind of nauseous acting that made the postman one of the most malignant displays of cinematic blundering of our time but i was shocked shocked to find a film starring costner that appealed to the soul of the audience shocked that ashton kutcher could act in such a serious role shocked that a film starring both actually engaged and captured my own emotions not since 'robin have i seen this costner full of depth and complex emotion kutcher seems to have tweaked the serious acting he played with in butterfly effect these two actors came into this film with a serious focused attitude that shone through in what i thought was one of the best films i've seen this year no its not an oscar worthy movie it's not an epic or a profound social commentary film rather its a story about a simple topic illuminated in a way that brings that audience to a higher level of empathy than thought possible that's what i think good film making is and i for one am throughly impressed by this work bravo
<START> this movie was definitely scripted with ff vii fans only in mind i am someone who has never played the original game and watched it with a friend who was a series fan from a visual and technical standpoint this movie is just as good as the spirits within if not better but from a story standpoint i was pretty lost one major plot weakness that stood out to me was the scene where all of the children dying of were brought to the healing reunion by the three all told there were about 15 kids in all hmmmm i thought that this was an illness of pandemic proportions i understand why they did it that way time budget but it just seemed cheesy after all the explanation about how the bad guys needed to collect all of those who had cells so that could be reincarnated the subtitle version that we had some fan sub from the internet was a pretty direct translation and therefore probably added to my confusion br br it did prick my interest in ff vii however and i spent a few hours on the ff vii wiki reading about the main characters and the plot once i read the advent children wiki things made a lot more sense if you are a video game or sci fi fan this movie is a pretty good flick but like a previous review said it comes off like a 90 minute fight scene you never really get to know any of the characters and the story does just seem to jump from scene to scene without much explanation even though some explanation just might be required thank goodness for
<START> after the success of the first two 'godfather' films in 1972 and 1974 respectively francis ford coppola embarked on an ambitious attempt to bring home the reality of the war in vietnam which had concluded with the fall of saigon to the vietcong in the plot was loosely based on the book 'heart of darkness ' a story by joseph conrad about kurtz a trading company agent in the african jungle who has acquired mysterious powers over the retains much of this including such details as the severed heads outside headquarters and his final words the the br br in the film sheen plays an army captain given the mission to penetrate into cambodia and eliminate with extreme prejudice a decorated officer who has become an embarrassment to the on his journey up the river to the camp he experiences the of the us forces high on dope or drunk with br br although as a result of cuts forced on coppola the film was accused of incoherence when first released it was by the most serious attempt to get to grips with the experience of vietnam and a victorious reinvention of the war film in 1980 the film won an oscar for best cinematography and best br br apocalypse now was re released in 2001 with fifty minutes as a result the motion picture can now be seen as the epic masterpiece it
<START> viva variety was a unique hybrid program that was both a parody of and a tribute to the programs it represented br br it was most directly a mock up of the classic 1970s favorite the sonny cher show with thomas lennon and kerri kenney playing a divorced show biz couple who were somehow forced to host this program together the female of the pair towering over the male and the constant barrage of insult humor the couple tossed at each other plus sketch comedy bits and performances from what are most kindly described as specialty acts br br the hybrid was the mix of fact and fantasy of course there was no mr and former mrs and the program's announcer johnny was likewise equally fictional but all the acts that performed were certainly real and some were even entertaining but there were also some acts that would have clearly been better suited for the old chuck barris gong show br br the show itself was really more like an extended sketch from sctv it was borne from the mtv series the state after all and some would suggest that it would have been better as a five minute bit in the mix of a program like that one rather than a stand alone series but viva variety certainly should get high marks for original concepts and even though it was often more odd than funny it was certainly worthwhile especially when they road tripped to las vegas and brought in even glitzier acts to perform it's unlikely we'll ever see anything like this on television again
