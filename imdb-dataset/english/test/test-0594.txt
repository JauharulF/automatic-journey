<START> i first saw the couch trip 1988 on late night television years ago and instantly fell in love with it the funny thing is i usually catch all the comedies made but have never even heard of this one until i saw it dan ackroyd is plain and simpley hillarious period he has made a couple great movies with belushi and don't forget saturday night live but i think the couch trip is probably his best and funniest with a good supporting cast of charles grodin david and walter matthau this piece of cinema shines with comic gold ackroyd's wife donna even does a fine job here my favorite moments of the film involve ackroyd and david charachter lawrence those two played well off each other so if you haven't seen a good comedy in take a trip back to 1988 and rent or buy the couch trip i just did amazon 78 cents what a bargain too bad i got hit with a 2 50 shipping fee oh well still well worth it any guy will love this flick check it out
<START> christopher lambert attracted me to this movie what a waste the plot has more holes than my string vest the special effects were not very good it did not take much to figure out who the creature's mother was and the creature owed more than a little debt to predator anti this movie could have been done a whole lot better it does raise one interesting point however when is hollywood going to discover the rich vein of european folklore out there just waiting to be mined
<START> a group of teens that have broken into a huge department store are attacked by a crazed police man exciting and suspenseful throughout and refreshingly devoid of extreme violence and gore but those aussie hairstyles and accents are a bit much to take and they can induce headaches but this is still a good thriller 7 out of 10
<START> not only why but what were they thinking this must have been some br br sort of payback to gus van sant because this is one of those odd movies br br that never should have been re made it purports to be hitchcocks film br br frame by frame but without the magic or the tension or the great film br br making rent the original instead spare yourself
<START> the falcon and the snowman is based on a true story christopher boyce and andrew lee the titular traitors played by timothy hutton and sean penn received their code names from the kgb why boyce was an avid and lee was a coke head the movie is based on a true story it's based on the book of the same name another reviewer asked what was their motivation disillusionment it ain't ideology it ain't pardon my bad grammar but i'm making a point here what was it if it wasn't disillusionment or ideology in a word greed by the time of the boyce lee case money became the great motivator and not ideology don't believe me then look at the walker family spy ring which was broken in the late '80s three spies did the worst damage to our national security in the '70s and '80s john walker who began his career as a spy in the '60s christopher boyce and andrew lee all three sold out this country for thirty pieces of silver if you aren't familiar with that phrase i suggest you read the bible
<START> i don't believe i've seen a horror movie this bad since hell i don't believe i've ever seen a horror movie this bad the acting alone was enough to make one cringe the bad acting went way beyond horror film cheesy it was just plain awful and did you check out those god awful special effects when the demon which looked more like a cheaply constructed puppet came out of the wall i couldn't tell if i was supposed to be frightened or laughing my ass off as a huge fan of the horror genre this film was more than mildly disappointing i couldn't help but notice the director is from portland or which just happens to be my own hometown i must say i'm deeply ashamed if i could i'd give this film a negative 500
<START> i had been interested in this film for a long time especially after reading a couple of online reviews of the dvd edition however i kept its purchase because of the excessive price tag and utter lack of relevant supplements when it went out of print earlier this year i finally gave in but the entire order which included a number of other highly desirable titles got lost in transit luckily the dvd has been re issued at bargain price and i'm sure glad i picked it up br br anyway this is one strange film and a genuine sleeper initially confusing but striking occult tale which manages to hit bullseye with respect to both its forbidding small town atmosphere and the inherent eeriness of the sinister goings on a small cast responds perfectly to a terse absorbing and intelligent script lead martin in particular makes the dialogue sound better than it actually is with his nuanced performance as the town doctor head of the witch's coven l q jones and moore both of whom also produced the film offer solid support as the no nonsense sheriff and his comic strip aficionado assistant br br the plot merges elements of various earlier films dealing with witchcraft and the supernatural and not only the obvious titles the fact that the town is held under a spell which can't at first be identified for instance brings instantly to mind the similar affliction of one specific bourgeois household in luis bunuel's sublimely surreal the exterminating angel 1962 the children' angle was borrowed perhaps from village of the damned 1960 there have been many films especially of a recent vintage where the satanic rites of a witches' coven are shown from the city of the dead 1960 to the devil rides out 1968 but since the proceedings take place in modern day america albeit in remote surroundings and revolve around elderly witches seeking a 'renaissance' the film they recall most of all is rosemary's baby 1968 br br the occult scenes accentuated as much by foggy exteriors as by the shadowy lighting of the garishly decorated house where the diabolical events take place are presented in a completely matter of fact way as to make them unsettling and extremely effective particularly the opening sequence involving an army tank crushing a car the rampage of a devil doll a concept which has been done to death over the years but here it raises an undeniable frisson a surreal dream sequence set inside the ice chamber where all the victims are kept since they can't be buried a sequence where the witches attack a doubting member of the coven a beheading committed by a horse riding medieval knight and the lengthy 'black finale with the witches accompanied by the respective child they will be 'taking over' all dressed in red except for a black clad martin presiding over the ceremony which culminates in ritual mass suicide br br the film also has the guts to deliver a downbeat 'curtain' it's so refreshing to come across a title albeit a low budget production from a major hollywood studio columbia that contrives to go so completely against the grain like i said the film is quite weird extending also to the editing and the score it's odd too that such a classy and cinematic horror offering sic should come from a tv director most often associated with westerns and other family fare by the way the same theme was dealt with almost in the nth christopher lee peter cushing collaboration nothing but the night 1972 which lee produced himself a film i foolishly missed out on some 20 years back when it was shown on local tv and which has been m i a ever since br br p s this review of the brotherhood of satan will certainly contain spoilers but then the synopsis and artwork featured on the dvd cover manage to give everything away anyway
<START> i absolutely hate the idea of made for television films for me usually involve jane seymour or jaclyn smith as the mother of a sick child who is dying of a difficult to treat disease all done in such a sugary manner that the audience doesn t need tissues it needs so when deadly voyage a made for tv film by the bbc and hbo based on a true story i vaguely remembered from a couple of years previously turned up on the tv schedules i sat down waiting to be bored senseless i was surprised br br no strike that last sentence i wasn t surprised i was shocked here is a tvm that grips you tighter than a great white shark in fact deadly voyage doesn t deserve to be relegated to the tv schedules it should have been made and distributed by a top hollywood film company due its absolutely terrifying premise and what s more it s unlike papillon and sleepers completely true br br for those who don t know the story possible spoilers as to plot sometime in the early 90s a bunch of africans away on an ukrainian freight ship bound for france in order to work there of course it was an attempt at illegal immigration but the crew of the freighter had already been fined for allowing illegal immigrants onto their ship from a previous journey and not wanting to get into anymore trouble with maritime and immigration authorities the crew murder the africans after discovering them hiding in the hold all except one african kingsley who manages to escape from the firing squad but who must try and survive aboard the ship but the problem is the crew are hunting him and france is still several days voyage away br br just typing the above paragraph reminds of how good deadly voyage is what a remarkable story and once again it is unlike many stories that claim to be totally true it s very well written directed and acted especially by sean pertwee why isn t that guy a big name star and most of all it s a tense claustrophobic disturbing thriller that i can still remember vividly six years after seeing it for the one and only time i look forward to seeing again br br but you ve got to ask yourself how can a tvm be better than most of the hollywood action blockbusters that came out round about the same time oh hold on i ve just had a disturbing thought about jerry doing a remake with tony scott directing and with denzil washington playing kingsley brad pitt playing pertwee s role massive artistic licence taken with events etc let s keep deadly voyage a superlative tvm rather than a poor blockbuster
<START> too fractured to be enjoyable too loose to be interesting and too clumsily photographed to be tolerable mr lonely is an interesting idea ruined by really bad film making like a ken russell film at its worst or day of the locust remade by amateurs mr lonely might have seemed like a good idea on a few scraps of paper no script you see and a free holiday to somewhere but in the end we have a widescreen film that seems as if it was made by film students whose parents told them that everything they did was a brilliant creation or did i get the film maker right mr lonely is a waste of resources trying to be gawd quirky and deliberately off kilter it ends up being annoying and indulgent and pointless what's the point of going to a commune in scotland what a stupid idea in this film about hollywood delusion maybe wanted to remake godspell well the result is god awful oh and there is some subplot like leftover footage from including werner herzog nuns and a plane add slo mo drifting and violin music all wistful and melancholy add james fox who seems to hope he might be seen as daring like in performance and the result is amphetamine fantasy alphabet soup in widescreen it might have been fun to film but the result on the screen is a mess imagine american pie band camp with food poisoning
<START> kidman and law lack the chemistry to make this sloppily directed poorly written romance melodrama work on any level other than kidman pouts and br br pines wistfully for her absent lover law she's just met him when he's whisked off to do battle for the south in the civil war and they've only exchanged about 5 sentences and one kiss yet they're totally smitten law's main direction throughout seems to be look vacant and shell shocked but sensitive ' rene zellweger is about the only spark in this dreary script but she plays it way too broad and over the top like she was starring in annie get your gun ' yee hah boy howdy something about her character felt more like it belonged in a monty python sketch the one from holy grail' where the peasants spend all their time wallowing in muck making mud pies for no reason kidman is a smart enough actress to stay out of her way whenever she can their scenes together are like a comic book hidden inside a victorian era novel br br whenever the action bogs down into total tedium which is frequently all the writers do is shout cue the simon type villain ' and ray winstone comes galloping out of nowhere to do his unspeakably dastardly acts like kill and torture innocent god fearing townspeople in the name of loyalty to a fast fading br br confederacy all other times he's missing in action which is preposterous even in this cornball script there is a plethora of other talented actors who give credible performances in small roles these are the characters law meets as he does his johnny trek from the front lines where he has deserted to the hopefully loving embrace of kidman back in cold mountain ultimately though none of these characters matter law has no time for them or their lives each of these little mini movies has the same tired theme war is gol durn heck and turns otherwise decent christian folk into rabid animals br br and the script is far too predictable too heavy handed moreover the pacing of the story is dreadfully slow you spend the entire movie waiting for romeo and inevitable reunion with kidman wringing her hands and sighing law overcoming incredible odds and dodging bullets and when it finally comes you just don't care anymore you'll be looking at your watch wondering how much more of this clap you have to endure br br i give it one star out of five for the battle scenes there is a potent anti war message here the incredible lack of concern for the loss of life by the generals on both sides of the conflict is powerful stuff but it's only about 15 minutes of this 150 minute dog
<START> what can you expect from a direct to dvd film you know what you are getting yourself into when you rent this the quality of the cinematography reminds me of reality tv shows br br why are they shots always up so close to the actors and why are they always centered there isn't anything to look at and the actors are that great looking so that blows br br the writing and dialogue is just plain awful that intro scene with the british guy is hilarious just try and listen this words they hardly make any sense just goes around in circles the lines in the rest of the movie sounds like they were pull out of romance and sci fi novels as if the writers had no idea what they were doing the characters definitely sound like they have no idea what they're saying br br this is a terrible movie i feel bad for the actors tied to this project embarrassing
<START> this seemed to be a lackluster film to me that betrays a low budget with poor cinematography and not all that great of a job of editing it may be of interest to those who know something about submarines during the world war ii era but i recommend that all others beware many of the scenes in this film were flat and some of the actors were a bit weak the story about the men getting called back to duty during a short leave seems realistic enough but there's no real pacing or tension in the story i also had a tough time understanding what the actors were saying partially due to some strong english accents and perhaps some due to an inferior job of sound recording i give this a 55 100 most folks will want to steer clear
<START> i can't believe how bad this film is for starters the movie deals with the legend of big foot and a group of people having a close encounter with the creature the premise is interesting and having lance henriksen in the cast aliens gave the untold a promising outlook unfortunately that's as interesting as it gets this looks like a direct to dvd release or so i guess this is basically a production less affair with probably the worst editing with a constant fading to black in between every scene i've seen in my life and acting that will sure make you cringe why lance henriksen picked this is completely and the movie takes cues from just about any other genre movie from blair witch project the video scene and predator to alive this is supposedly based on true events but the only truth to be found herein is just how bad this movie is i'm usually not a harsh critic and believe me i did try to enjoy this trash but eventually did not do yourselves a favor and steer clear from this dvd br br i'll try to put it mildly this movie is pure garbage and it made me want to take my gun and shoot my neighbors or ask blockbuster for a refund br br and lance shame on you 1 out of 10
<START> mild spoilers br br with the exception of the terminator and total recall i don t think arnie s action adventure movies are up to much they re better than his comedies for sure but that s hardly saying much the problem i have with his all action blockbusters is that they re overblown and lacking in any sort of morality br br morality i mentioned in my review of terminator 2 the scene where good guy terminator blows the kneecaps off the swat team are we to think that because the hero maims people doing their job instead of killing them we will admire him in someway this is the problem with eraser when james cann s character is revealed as a traitor within the us marshal department arnie s character john kruger goes on the run with a witness he s protecting but in several later sequences kruger kills a fairly large amount of working with the villain are we take it they were all traitors too surely many of them were honest men who were trying to stop kruger because the bad guy told them kruger was the traitor it s a rather uneasy thought that kruger killed several people who were trying to genuinely up hold the law br br despite costing one hundred million dollars the special effects t all that impressive look at the scene where kruger lets go of the jet wing and scrambles to put on a parachute it s obvious as the action intercuts that it s a stuntman who s doing the free fall sequence while arnie is in a studio in front of a blue screen eraser is also a film that has unnecessary cgi featuring killer alligators not only unnecessary cgi but unconvincing cgi too there s also a few plot holes like in the opening scene involving a couple of witness protection people that the mob has caught up with kruger opens a car trunk and pulls out a couple of bodies and starts a fire thereby throwing the mob of the scent kruger is next seen rearranging the dental records via computer of the couple he s saved it would be logical to do this but would all the couples dental records be kept on computer most importantly of all are we to believe the us marshal department keep a freezer full of bodies for such events br br so they re you go a typical arnie thriller long on unlikely set pieces and short on intelligence and it s interesting to note that eraser didn t make much of a profit at the box office as the production costs almost outweighed a potential audience figure after eraser arnie didn t do much more business at the box office save for terminator 3 rise of the machines which was an event movie and it ll be interesting to see if he ll be remembered as a politician rather than a movie star
<START> 1989 was already a year in where eddie murphy wasn't that longer hot and started making movies that soon would be forgotten funnily enough it was also the year in where murphy directed his first film but it also would be the first and last experiment harlem nights wasn't exactly what you can call a success even if it was great to see the two best black comedians together namely murphy and richard pryor don't blame it on the actors as they all played their roles like you expected them do even if you have to face again the typical murphy laugh the worst thing from harlem nights are both the scenario and its terrible decors everything is set in the roaring twenties and everybody has their profit from the forbidden clubs sugar ray pryor and his adopted son quickie murphy are gathering easily dollar per day but of course soon the mob and the corrupt police come around the corner to claim their part of the cookie sugar and quickie aren't guys who give their money for free and have their own plans you can watch harlem nights that's for sure but if you puke from the moment you hear the name murphy you better avoid as after all this movie is nothing but a lame excuse to see some good jokes
