<START> its incredible to me that the best rendition of this amazing story remains a cartoon made by walt disney in the 1940s but its true here another clumsy attempt sputters confuses and alienates would be viewers with admirable effectiveness while successfully antagonizing those of us who have actually read the story irving's original work is short by any measure and making a feature length film is bound to be a challenge one can either completely rewrite the story a la tim burton which is a discussion for another time or pad the bust line of the old girl with unintended detail the latter is what is attempted here and if i may say pitifully so unimaginative and thoroughly modern new facets to character personalities such as religious in crane or wanderlust in good old bram bones ruin the story's intent and betray a severe lack of talent by the filmmakers by the time the tale's famous climax approached i had completely lost interest its the kind of film where you expect to see a stagehand smoking in the background
<START> the first feature length muppet movie and excepting maybe the muppet christmas carol the movie the world over are still looking for as a guide disney has done the muppets a dis service and this movie proves it over and over again featuring classic comedians and guest star cameos keeps to a simple but original plot classic muppet lame jokes paul williams genius in song writing and electric mayhem madness and comes off with an amazing movie especially when you realize that the major cast are puppets only croft has come close to genius with puppets half of the fun today is playing is that cameo actor actress still alive i can only hope frank oz and dave goelz and the rest of the surviving muppeteers can somehow rescue and revive kermit and company from the deadly grasp of disney
<START> without doubt a great all round show that if shown today would attract a huge following bodyguards was only 6 episodes and a trailer but deserved a few more series to really bring it up to speed with outstanding performances from the highly talented and versatile sean pertwee and the dynamic louise lombard it really did put it up with the likes of the the sweeney and thief takers the story lines are based on the diplomatic protection services and with great filming and story lines and scene locations it stood out from some of the junk that gets churned by other tv production companies i do not think that it has been shown on terrestrial tv either such as sky or freeview witch is a shame as if it were to be shown nowadays i am sure it would get a large viewing audience so i hope one day the guys at carlton tv decide to release it on dvd cheers nick
<START> god did i hate this movie i saw it at a sneak preview 13 years ago and i still have bad flashbacks it was without a doubt the worst movie i ever paid to see it was badly written badly directed and surprisingly considering the cast badly acted i would rather be thrown off a rooftop onto razor sharp spikes and then have my skin peeled off than to sit through it again can you guess i didn't enjoy it
<START> i was in 6th grade and this movie aired on pbs during a series called ' i distinctly remember sitting on a couch watching the movie with tears running down my face at the end in the film jesse the main character forms an unusual friendship with a girl named leslie due to a very simple but careless mistake one of the pair dies at the time i found the story very powerful because the fatal mistake is exactly the type of mistake a kid would make and so any kid watching the film will find it very easy to identify with and feel the emotional weight of the tragedy that ensues br br last year i finally tracked down a vhs copy of the show i probably should have stuck with my memories watching the show as an adult i was absolutely shocked by what a horribly made film this was my girlfriend had a similar memory of the movie as well and she too was pretty sad about how bad the movie was compared to her memories br br many adults probably have a good memory of watching this movie when they were kids i strongly advise that these people leave their memories intact and avoid seeing this film as an adult
<START> this is more of the same thing that made this cartoon popular but who's complaining it's always fun to see the poor coyote try various contraptions to get the road runner and then get pulverized by every one of those inventions br br the underground cave chase was different from the normal fare and was clever it gave us an aerial view of the chase in a maze like structure i didn't say it was hilarious just different from the normal above ground antics br br this one along with some other road runner shorts are featured on the looney tunes golden collection volume 2 and the transfers of them are spectacular the colors are magnificent
<START> a fine young cast is wasted in this empty mawkish manipulative film that tries to be a combination of both a cute comedy and an insightful drama the plot moves so slowly that the 90 minutes seems endless as characters do nothing but mope and emote the dialogue is filled with stilted cliches and fortune cookie attempts at pseudo philosophy br br apparently aiming at being a moving and profound look at life and love the film ends up being merely pretentious the only real weight is the burden that the talented cast is forced to carry as best they can but never fear they are held up by the puppet strings of the contrived plot
<START> this is probably the best cinematic depiction of life in a manhattan ad agency the pressure to perform client and agency demands the parties the creativity the money the cool surface with powerful corporate undercurrents br br toss in parenthood for dustin hoffman br br the movie is textured and deep it follows his internal relationship as he tries to understand and live with what's going on his relationship with meryl streep and her friend who becomes his friend and his the relationship with his son br br while meryl streep was great did she set the record for least screen time to win an oscar she sure can deliver when she is on though
<START> the most die hard worshippers of john wayne will cringe when they watch the lawless frontier even for a poverty row studio this one is one stinkeroo br br unusual for a western we have a criminal who is a sex crime perpetrator earl plays a halfbreed white and indian who for reasons that are not explained pretends he's a mexican hokey accent and all sounds like the of advertising fame back in the day br br he and his gang happen upon gabby hayes and his daughter sheila terry they really don't have anything worth robbing but just wants an excuse to kidnap terry and have his way with her she hears the dastardly fate she has in store and she and hayes flee the ranch br br where they happen to meet john wayne who's on the trail of the bandits they also run into one very stupid sheriff who believes wayne is one of the bandits again for reasons i can't quite fathom br br it was a tough way to earn a living grinding out horse operas like these for the duke fortunately better things were on the way
<START> aaah the thing br br to see a horror film in which not only is every character over the age of thirty but distinctly unattractive makes a refreshing change and reminds me of those distant times when actors were chosen because of their talent and their ability to play realistic characters rather than because of their teen appeal on a magazine cover and carpenter chooses a production designer and a cinematographer who can actually create realistic environments rather than over styled parodies and there's no gimmicky 'twist' ending or cameo celebrity appearance or lame pseudo romantic subplot br br and i really miss on set physical effects with all those 20 year old kids trying out crazy new ideas with vats of blood and latex and early animatronics in the 5 years between 1979 and 1984 we saw alien the elephant man poltergeist the howling an american werewolf in london the thing the company of wolves a nightmare on elm street what an era for horror effects and don't get me started on the death of matte painting the matte work in this movie is beautiful and seamless br br what do we have now third rate cgi former music video directors and professional that makes even 'gritty' horror movies look like glossy mtv videos br br now i'm going to go netflix 'the
<START> where do i begin i sat down ready to laugh a bit and i was blown away this movie is just perfect it's indescribable jackass number two in all honesty was grosser more obscene funnier and more entertaining than the first this was just what i needed tonight br br there are so many scenes in this movie that will make you say oh my no way or ouch perfectly mastered and set up each event and scene were coordinated way before and therefore made it even more perfect i loved every minute of it i'm just going to say that there was even a scene where it was necessary to censor particular footage in order to prevent an nc 17 rating it was so hilarious that they had to put it in anyway amazingly good br br 9 10 incredibly funny do not miss out
<START> if you want to see a film with no guns blood sex shouting angry people hero bad guys girls or even clumsy love words and you want to see a film in which every shot has the meaning of love this one is a must see film for me i've been waiting for a film like this all of my life
<START> calling this a sunday school movie might be generous because even as a christian i found the religious message so one dimensional that i wouldn't want to see it at my church the message is read your bible go to church and sign up for fire insurance so you won't get left behind at the rapture there was no love i guess when you get right down to it i don't believe in the god portrayed in this film the guy who was supposed to have all of the spiritual answers came across like count dracula br br aside from the spiritual religious element the script was tedious saying the same thing over and over that might have been to make up for some of the acting which was unable to deliver a convincing line the first time so they just said the same thing over and over br br i did enjoy the final scenes i thought it made a point without hitting someone over the head or stooping to a sunday school formula the movie wasn't all bad just most of it br br i am in favor of more clean movies that are well done and that present truth in a non preachy way this wasn't one of those i am sorry to say i took my family to this film wanting to support that kind of movie now i'd like my money back
<START> a brief history of time the cosmological content of this documentary is fascinating the thoughts provoking and the man brilliant yet i had a hard time enjoying this documentary br br the way the family members and professors are interviewed feels so unnatural these members were interviewed on specifically built sets and were directed uncomfortably mostly their accounts came across as very acted and forcefully directed the deliberate non inclusion of asked questions manipulates the given information into a very harsh and impersonal format br br i do not know who are responsibly for the interviewing but they did a dreadful job and with that took away from the viewing experience br br overall still a fascinating documentary well worth seeing if only for the interesting concepts presented
<START> this film is unbelievable on any level it fails as an action film because no one would be fooled for a moment that the props actors and scenery are realistic it fails because even the most gung ho would see through the hollow chauvinism portrayed by the film a hypocritical might is right mentality
