<START> and what is its genre the backstage expose story what theatrical life is really like behind those broadway and other curtains it certainly has a lot of competition singin' in the rain both i and ii 1929 and 1952 42nd street golddiggers of you name the year dames of 1934 noises off 1992 from the farcical side and a star is born i and ii from the 1930s and the 1950s from the tragical side not to mention summer stock of 1950 the list keeps rollin' along so what makes this movie so special and why are there so few comments about this stunningly great movie have so few people actually seen it how amazing to see a younger frank langella pre dracula and pre frost nixon by 30 years how amazing to see the fresh and talented tom hulce so pre amadeus and yet another superb stiller what a wonderful line up of talented people at their very best from so long ago and such a script who was this david so full of realistic disillusion and pathos compared to the usual sentimentality and feel good comedy as especially exemplified by the star is born like episode where the heroine achieves broadway while the langella character has to content himself with still another provincial tour br br langella's subsequent hysterical and sadistic blowup against the star struck latin teacher and his granddaughter in which he vents his fury and frustration is just one of many fantastic and psychologically real moments in the film the latin teacher and his love affair with backstage life certainly echo marlene dietrich and her seduced professor in the blue angel of 1929 another in the series of mercenary and cold hearted agents like kevin mccarthy who was preceded by burt lancaster in the sweet smell of success 1957 and succeeded by alan alda in 2001 in movie history the sexual liberation of the hulce character recalls similar incidents in o'neill's great comedy ah wilderness br br and what a tribute to the vanished of long ago the red mill of victor herbert rose marie and the vagabond king of rudolf the desert song of sigmund etc what satirical of bits from the great plays like romeo and juliet tributes to the theater itself as by the star langella the richness and depth of this movie are simply endless and to be saddled by such a title who could have an inkling of what this great movie is about from such a ridiculous and title but on the other hand what title could one have applied to such a magnificent drama which might have lived up to its stirring emotional content br br ps i just saw 2009 frank langella in his latest acting spectacular as richard nixon in frost nixon how this great actor after 30 years simply goes from triumph to triumph
<START> bride of chucky starts late one night as officer bob bailey vince sneaks into the evidence room at his police station amongst all the horror film in joke props he steals the remains of the chucky doll that serial killer charles lee ray possessed way back in the original child's play 1988 he drives the remains to an isolated area where ray's ex girlfriend tiffany jennifer tilly slashes bailey's throat takes the remains back to her trailer there tiffany stitches staples chucky voiced by brad dourif back together again using a 'voodoo for book brings him back to murderous life thing don't go as tiffany had hoped chucky turns out not to be the man of her dreams after all so she locks him in a play pen at which chucky is less than happy while tiffany takes a bath chucky escapes electrocutes her using that book brings her back to life in the shape of a female doll dressed as a bride neither want to be stuck in plastic bodies have to work together to get to a cemetery in new jersey where ray's natural body had been buried with the amulet needed to switch their spirits back into human bodies the bodies of tiffany's neighbour jesse nick his girlfriend jade katherine heigl who are both on the run from corrupt uncle chief of police warren kincaid john ritter will do nicely br br directed by ronny yu i love bride of chucky the script by don mancini is great fun very fast moving highly entertaining references plenty of other horror film with good affection from the opening sequence where we see jason voorhees hockey mask from the friday the 13th films freddy krueger's razor blade glove from the a nightmare on elm street series michael myers mask from the halloween franchise to the clips used from bride of frankenstein 1935 when it virtually recreates the same scene bride of chucky never takes itself seriously which is just as well there are lots of one liners self referential gags that scream 1996 made trendy a few years earlier it doesn't seem afraid to poke fun at itself the horror genre in general i love the scene when jesse jade are having a clichÃ©d slushy romantic conversation that chucky hears he makes funny derogatory comments gestures throughout that's not to say that there isn't a damn good film in there as well because there most certainly is director yu manages to create good atmosphere a real sense of fun both human plastic sets of characters are likable shine as each pair suffer their own sets of domestic problems that the trail of corpses that they are leaving behind would obviously cause technically bride of chucky is great for the most part has that big budget polish about it at about 25 000 000 i should hope so the only thing that i will say is that some of the puppet effects by kevin are a little stiff unconvincing i can't remember any cgi scenes in bride of chucky either thankfully the film doesn't neglect the blood gore with a cool slit throat nails blasted into someone's face in presumably a hellraiser 1987 homage people impaled on shards of glass someone being obliterated by a huge truck a ripped off lip piercing various stabbings gunshots the acting is pretty good dourif as chucky is very funny as he spouts the one liners out i also like the scenes with tiffany at the beginning find her very sexy when she's wearing all that fetish gear i can't be the only one surely i personally think bride of chucky is a fantastic film total entertainment from start to finish great humour horror in equal measure at only 85 minutes long it never becomes boring or dull a personal favourite of mine watch it as soon as you can
<START> what do you get when you put lou diamond philips todd bridges barry corbin with a bad toupee and an alien all on a train you get a very bad movie called alien express or dead rail that would be more entertaining on comedy central's old series mystery science theater 3000 you name it this awful movie suffered in areas of acting plot storyline and special effects in fact the exterior passenger train shots looked like the production staff used a common ho scale model in front of a painted background the rest of the special effects goes downhill from there br br the plot is very predictable and is similar to two 1970's movies called horror express and a disaster movie called the cassandra crossing at least the cassandra crossing had a better cast an engaging storyline and real train scenes br br if you want a good laugh and a movie to mock at a b movie party then watch this otherwise alien express derailed long before departing from the station
<START> it is terrible it is like somebody gave a kid a faulty video camera and 30 and told them to make a film even then you'd get a better and more professional film than this the story is so dumb you can say there isn't one i don't think the guy who made this knew what to do at all watching foreign art movies all day long isn't enough to make somebody an instant director the acting is very bad really kindergarten level and the writing is just plain awful the only scene i didn't hate was the one with the caravan accident but even that only means it was just slightly less horrible than the rest of the film how do people get finance for this stuff i don't mind alternative films but shouldn't they at least not be a big steaming pile of cow manure i would call of amateurish if it wasn't an insult to amateurs this would not even be a good film if you were drunk or drugged
<START> this flick was even better then for the great strength in these two films lie in the brilliant character acting by guest and little second second city troupe if one finds this movie boring or pointless god help 'em they just didn't get it it is a mockumentary something at which guest and levy have a genius for at the end of the movie where guest's southern down home dog lover tells us that to relax after the show he went to israel to work on a or when he tells us that is an ancient art and we see a hieroglyphic br br of an ancient egyptian holding a tiny ancient egyptian in it's hand i realized it is moments like this that make life worth living thank you mr guest and mr levy and god bless you
<START> shivering shakespeare could be considered the first classic of the our gang talkie era by now hal roach studios began to hit their stride in making talking pictures and shakespeare is the happy result br br the gang is appearing in a version of quo vadis produced by kennedy the cop's wife the kids don't find the play very fun to be in and are distracted by people in the theatre and cannot remember their lines among the funniest bits are kennedy the cop as the giant who pulls off his makeup to fight an overzealous man in a bull costume and the terrible dancing girl played by director bob mcgowan's daughter br br several filmographies mention that shakespeare has the first pie fight in a talkie this may be true seeing as they tried different speeds with the film during the fight buster keaton's brother harry is at the receiving end of one of the pies very funny and an early gang talkie classic 9 out of 10
<START> i am not a movie maker but i know it is hard to tell a story and draw people into it in only seven short minutes i think a good movie is one you don't want to end eric did a great job of developing the charater of the and making him seem human loved the music and the voice used for the i am looking forward to seeing what eric has in store for us in future films this is one movie i didn't want to see end great job
<START> when a stranger calls is actually a pretty good movie i had never saw the original and so when i watched this i thought it was unique when when a stranger calls was advertised on the television the trailer gave away the ending well i never saw the trailer so when i saw this film i was surprised at how good it turned out to be i walked by it one day and decided i'd buy it and now i'm lucky i did because i thought it was a very pleasing movie that is a nice little film to own it is getting a lot of unfair treatment and if you're interested in this movie at all don't listen to all the negativity camille belle is not as bad of an actress as everyone makes her out to be and she did a great job in this movie so all you haters get over yourselves lighten up and actually try to enjoy this movie for what it is a fun teeny bopper popcorn flick if you haven't seen it please do for it is a lot more enjoyable than a lot of the other slashers being made recently
<START> clearly this film was made for a newer generation that may or may not have had an inkling of charles bukowski's work the autobiographical henry character in bukowski's stories was brilliantly portrayed to perfection by mickey rourke in 1987's also starring faye dunaway anyone who has seen should certainly see to get a better look at how bukowski wrote his character lacks the greasy seediness of bukowski's screenplay and the fearless hopelessness of his loner hero the inadvertent humor that bubbles through in the dark desperation of misadventures doesn't work for dillon as it did so admirably for the overweight filthy blood soaked rourke rourke's character makes the pain and pleasure of the previous night's a place setting for yet another grueling ugly day in the life of a drunken misanthropic unknown writer dillon's character misses these marks in favor of a strutting handsome relatively clean looking wanna be writer that scarcely passes for any moment in that of story dunaway's sleazy heroine wanda is the perfect complement to the ne'er do well henry the women in can't hold a candle to dunaway's and the use of more profane sexual subject matter in proves to be more of a crude distraction than a tip of the hat to bukowski's raw and unapologetic portrayals of dysfunctional relationships i was stunned at how many of the exact same scenes were used in marisa tomei buying all the stuff and charging it to the old man is an exact rip off from br br if you want to see the best bukowski stories on film see and 'love is a dog from hell' which also goes by the title love'
<START> how i wondered why i hadn't seen this in theaters or even a single commercial for it and then after i saw the movie i realized i was duped hardcore i am a big transporter fan and a big blade fan so when i saw this i imagined some killer fight scene between two lots of gunplay a whole bunch of stuff instead i got the ryan phillippe movie with a brief cameo by statham and snipes the guy that does the audio and video in the crime lab got more screen time than wesley it was like renting a jackie chan movie expecting a bunch of kung fu and getting erin i expect bad movies from hollywood but actors like snipes and statham should treat the fan base better
<START> i have watched this show for a while only because of my cousins and i hate it first the girls dress in the same style clothes and they have the same first letter in their names come on i could to better than that then the villains spare me first we have a monkey with part of his little brain showing then we have a gay version of the devil a pink hillbilly a gang green gang whit is ironic that's their name a spoiled princess once again ironic that's 'her' name among others i have also found that there is no male hero in the show not that i'm sexist or anything i'd rather watch sailor moon it's much better than this if someone else wants to watch the show in the room that you're in find a way to break the television believe me it'll save you a half hour of torture br br rating i'm giving this just what it deserves a 1 out of 10 whatever you do do not watch this
<START> the greatest effort plus the finest cast ever assembled in a movie by the director tim robbins and susan sarandon and sean penn on the front row someone said that this movie is good because directed and written by tim robbins but i convince you that sean penn and susan sarandon had give me a truly superb performance that i cried my heart out their acting is so real no doubt about it that this movie is rated 4 and 3 4 out of 5
<START> good not great little horror film with a high creep factor not to be confused with a 1991 movie by the same name or the more recent 2001 campfire stories central tale of stranded teens telling ghost stories around a campfire in spooky woods nicely leads into and ties together the different stories that make up the bulk of the movie watch for ron livingston office space band of brothers and jennifer macdonald in a spirited sexy segment the honeymoon solid acting and a few truly scary moments make this an above average chiller good example of interesting story line coupled with quality ensemble acting resulting in a whole greater than the sum of its parts surprise ending of the main story adds nice creepy twist although some may see it coming movie is not available on dvd but can be found on vhs
<START> no way i hated granny first she is way too tall of course she is it is tom whoever's brother who's playing her and i hate that thing she does when she brushes her fake silver hair back but there are funny parts in this movie for instance the fact that every single actor looks v g very german and also that they think that even when left alone they should pretend that that guy tom is their actual granny or something i specially liked not that moment where charlotte leaves and starts walking to the nearest gas station to ask for some help she suddenly finds herself in the middle of some woods where were these before nobody dares explaining and turns turns turns a r d like a ballerina looking at the stars and ignoring the fact that granny's behind her ready to strike but anyway the music wasn't so bad the haircuts were okay and the ending terribly provocative mmmmm wish i had the german version
<START> this movie was difficult for me to watch stan looked very old and ill compared to what i remembered and ollie was heavier than i ever recall in another film most difficult though were gaps in the script production where i found myself wondering how did they get from here to there it took nearly half the film before i could deal with the dubbing of non american actors that was also a distraction br br although i miss great actors such as laurel and hardy will there ever be great actors like those of the old studio era this film helps me understand why actors sometimes bow out in their prime
