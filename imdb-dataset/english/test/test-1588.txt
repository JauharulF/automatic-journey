<START> out of this movie br br sorry to say this showed at the cleveland international film festival our copy did not have subtitles so i asked the festival crew if there was a problem with the print received not so i was told the director wants it this way br br again sorry to say my french is barely high school elective level more than 3 decades ago much of the initial dialog is in french so i'm sure i missed the nuance and many details in between my understanding of a few key words br br i've rated this a 1 primarily because of the irony of a director who once worked doing subtitles refusing to put subtitles into a movie to be seen by an american audience excuse me even if most americans wouldn't know where europe was on a map not even a film festival audience should be assumed to know the native language of a given movie even if a few of us don't know finnish i would still expect subtitles for the few dolts who aren't sophisticated enough to have expertise in the 37 different languages presented i'll put up with this ego from david lynch not from
<START> sherlock holmes and the secret weapon starts in switzerland as the world's foremost detective sherlock holmes basil rathbone outwits the nazi's manages to smuggle a brilliant scientist named dr franz william post jr out of the country to the relative safety of london but is london as safe as holmes thinks dr has engineered a revolutionary new bomb sight that will change aerial bombardment forever he has agreed to give it to the british government but those nazi's want it just as badly holmes arch enemy professor moriarty lionel atwill plans on stealing the secret of the bomb sight selling it to the nazi's add the bumbling inspector lestrade denis of scotland yard dr love interest charlotte verne assassins mysterious scientists a puzzling coded message holmes has his work cut out to keep dr alive so he can deliver his bomb sight br br directed by roy william neill sherlock holmes and the secret weapon was the fourth in a series of fourteen holmes films made between 1939 1946 to feature rathbone bruce as holmes watson the script by edward t lowe jr scott darling edmund l hartmann is based on the short 'the dancing men' by sir arthur conan doyle isn't the tradition holmes murder mystery as it's more of a wartime adventure story to neglect what holmes is all about the solving of complex crimes mysteries is a big mistake as far as i'm concerned the involvement of the nazi's the war as a backdrop to the story feels out of place awkward just didn't sit too well with me the dialogue isn't great professor moriarty feels almost like an afterthought as if they couldn't come up with a villain for it as a whole it's far less engaging than other's in the series however at least it's short br br director neill does his usual efficient job but you have to cut it a little slack bear in mind that it was made over 60 years ago it has no real style or imagination lacks both atmosphere intrigue as well br br technically the film is ok if unspectacular the black and white cinematography is fine although i understand that a computer colourised version is also available the acting is alright bruce do their usual comic relief turns rathbone's hairstyle in this looks ridiculous i'm glad he changed it for later instalments br br sherlock holmes and the secret weapon was a disappointment when compared to some of the other excellent entries in the series there is very little by which i can recommend it everything that made the other's so good seems to be missing here leave this one till last watch some of the better ones first for die hard fans only
<START> the basic plot of this film has already been detailed in several other comments so i won't bother i'd like to first commend the producer cast directors and crew for creating a wonderfully engaging film on a meager budget a small fraction of standard hollywood fare that doesn't look cheap these people have a drive to make something new and entertaining while not spending a fortune doing it this is essentially art for art's sake i know i know some of you will decide that this is not art but something less and that's fine i for one am glad that people like these will continue to put forth the time and effort for our benefit without expecting huge dollar payoffs br br now to the criticism i feel that the scenario presented is credible to a point it's wonderful when everything works out and the hero heroine saves the day and all's well that ends well what gets me is the blatant manipulation of events so that blind luck is responsible more than courage and strength br br when lee was attacked but not severely injured somehow she washed up on a mud bank right next to the dead guide then miraculously his loaded revolver is still in his holster and it actually works after some cleaning and fiddling finally when lee is attacked on the mud bank and jumps in the water once again the croc fails to kill her she ends up with her hand in his her mouth and manages to repeatedly pull the trigger ultimately to blow the croc's brains out literally br br i came to the conclusion that having lee go hand to mouth with the croc was just a way to end the film with the human in triumph based upon what i have seen the croc's attack and continue to hold on until the prey stops struggling croc's will spin around and around to dismember and drown the prey that happened to the first 3 victims but not to lee she had teeth marks but they were not deep br br i think that the ending would have been better had the croc won frankly thereby proving his dominance of the his territory for millions of years but then how many of us would have been upset or disappointed that the pretty girl didn't get out alive
<START> the blue planet series is without a doubt one of the greatest documentaries ever made on the ocean for five years filmmakers worked tirelessly on the series getting footage that has never been seen by anyone i e in the title the deep br br i highly recommend you watch this series to see the fish outside of the small pictures shown in textbooks is truly a treat but only a needle in the vast haystack of the sea that blue planet covers from the open ocean to tidal pools coral seas to the deepest darkest part of the ocean itself the bbc takes the viewer on an almost magical journey through the ocean br br i have to admit one of my earliest dreams in life was to be a marine biologist and after seeing this series the dream was revived i have studied the oceans of this world for years and have seen countless documentaries on coral and dolphins whales and but in all no one has managed to capture the life beneath the waves quite as well as this group of people br br watch the 'blue planet' series in it's entirety i promise you won't regret it
<START> by the acting in this movie it is sometimes hard not to imagine that the cast are who they portray themselves to be unbridled passion and acting at times make this a very enjoyable and engaging movie wouldn't even have known about it except for hbo late night and the biggest reason i like uk films much better than american ones are that the actors aren't afraid to act out what is needed
<START> perhaps i'm one of the only avid horror fans who thinks that the recent overload of asian shockers is so over hyped films like ringu or the the eye Â which are praised all over the world Â simply didn't convince me and they looked more boring than frightening well this blunt opinion doesn't go for the south korean gem a tale of two sisters this is a stylish and utterly complex psychological terror tale that really gets under your skin the plot based on a local folklore tale might be a little too confusing to get this film listed among the all time greatest genre achievements but the atmosphere and tension building surely provokes feelings of great respect this is one of those few films that are impossible to label the events in two sisters qualify as mind bending horror as well as intense family drama and a deeply psychological portrait besides a mesmerizing story a tale of two sisters also has all the great elements that i feel are usually missing in asian horror films like compelling music good acting and innovative camera work the mansion were the family events take place is brilliantly illustrated like a truly creepy place where secrets and danger lurk behind every door several sequences like the dinner with relatives or the nightly appearance in the girls' room are pretty much the ultimate in eeriness they really made me feel uncomfortable and i do like to believe that i've seen my share of spooky horror a tale of two sisters is a terrific movie adventure and a definite must see for asian film fanatics a little warning for people with a short attention span though this movie forces you to have your eyes and ears focused at at all time it's also a film that requires repeated viewing even though no one will never really get it for a full 100
<START> the first time you watch this movie you may hate it but the 2nd time you see this movie i guarantee laughs all around the owners of the dogs are so that you can't help but look at them and laugh from the littlest toy poodle to the announcer everything will make you laugh and you may learn every single nut there is
<START> what a lousy movie took me 3 times to finish it the thing i disliked the most was the infantile sense of humor jokes made by a 10 years old child not funny pretty annoying actually for example when the detective cant get a place at the bar he yells she's taking it all off and then they all run fast slapstick kinda' rush so stupid and also a guy sitting at the bar smashing fruit to work out his post traumatic stress disorder on the bar and the bartender is supplying him with more and more fresh fruit thats supposed to be funny and i mean i love good ol' exploitation gore flicks and saw a lot of terrible movies but his one is plain bad and also the gore is not that exciting don't bother i wouldn't recommend it
<START> this is another film i missed out on italian tv as a kid notable for its quintet of ageing stars most of whom had never made a horror film in their life fred astaire melvyn douglas douglas fairbanks jr john houseman and patricia neal it deals with the long concealed past crime coming back to haunt them it takes the form of a ghostly dead ringer for the girl they all loved alice krige but whom they were forced to dispose of after an unfortunate incident when she humiliated their egos fairbanks who was the one responsible for the deed has twin sons craig wasson and so krige directs her revenge upon them as well soon one of the latter fairbanks himself and even douglas and houseman all wind up dead therefore the remaining wasson and astaire decide to confront the ghost at the scene of the crime where they also have to contend with a couple of sinister tramps who somehow do bidding i was looking forward to seeing these veterans on their last legs douglas died before the film had even premiered though by that time he had already completed another role while it proved own inauspicious swan song but ghost story went through too many changes of mood â while maintaining a sluggish pace throughout and emerging overlong into the bargain â to be anything but a failed curio having dollops of sex including full frontal nudity from wasson and gruesome make up effects muddled the waters all the more and marred the old fashioned elegance inherent in jack another notable of long standing cinematography
<START> i see this movie as a poor tribute to the old slasher movies because it really doesn't hold a candle to the 70's and 80's gold era of horror this is of course where personal taste comes in br br this movie just falls into the category of new generation of slashers in my book the cast is the typical ones 18 24 years and potential models i'm personally quite tired of that image in horror movies the old movies at least had some variation in people one or more fat people and dorks in general just plain looking persons of course having a couple of good lookers is fine they always been there but when the entire cast is just a bunch of nice racks and butts it's getting silly i mean ok yeah i like to watch hot chicks but not in a horror that is supposed to reflect some ordinary people getting hunted down by for example a knife wielding maniac you expect the people being hunted to look something like any random person you see on the street i think there are of course a few movies with just good lookers that is perfectly alright but they aren't many wrong turn is one example of the better ones br br next point is the killing scenes that slashers should be all about in this poor movie all you get to see is 2 3 frames of sudden high pitched sound scream and music in crescendo and that's it the little you do get to see isn't very graphical at all not for people who have seen some horrors during the years the old school slashers compared to this had much more and better death blood and gore not to mention the killers in those movies who surpassed the one you'll get to see here br br as for true horror fans it is more fun and exciting to watch horrors with new approaches because of the that pops up the killer in this one doesn't add anything new and fresh to the genre in my opinion i have to agree with what someone previously stated as well the cgi is something i hate to watch personally i the makeups in that sense i'm conservative unless the cgi is really well done but most importantly is to set a good setting of mood which allows you to get into the movie a good background story is one very good thing also revealing and explaining too much of everything in a movie to the viewers takes away all sense of mystic that adds very much of the mood and doesn't give you much to think about just as an example keeping the killers background a complete mystery for the viewer is a good move in many cases i mean if everything about the story or the people in it has to be explained or shown in detail then it's not much content left over for the viewer at all to ponder about that's like watching a porno movie and hope for a great story in the meantime br br why the old school slashers still works at least for some people is because they are established cult movies from the era when they were a new thing making new ones of that sort today is admittedly hard the exception might be for people who are newer to that sort of horrors of course i have noticed that many people does like this sort of horror movies so there are of course not a right taste for horror movies br br but for people out there that might share my opinion here you have a frame of reference what to expect of this flick
<START> i saw this tonight with moderate expectations if tartan films have picked up on something and are releasing it the that's generally a good sign however i'm not normally a fan of julie walters generally disliking her comedy roles sorry to any fans but it's a personal thing i just don't find her funny in comedy br br this was magnificent though a great performance by all but and walters are exceptional plenty of laughs plenty of pathos great timing and a wonderfully paced film such a coming of age film wouldn't normally be something i'd expect to like so much but i can't recommend this highly enough and watch rupert as he matures into a fine fine actor
<START> the film is about the battle of stalingrad for those of you who don't know anything about it it was the worst battle in the second world war over 1 million people died in the course of the battle this is the only film that i've seen that seems to have actually captured how bad things were in the war between russia and germany what i really liked about it is that the two ideologies nazism and communism were nowhere in the film unlike most american films the germans are not seen as blood thirsty murderers but what the average german foot soldier was a person br br the film revolves around four soldiers fighting in stalingrad they were transferred there to try and take the city the film follows these men from august of 1942 to early 1943 during this time they learn about the horrors of war and try to find a way out of the battle br br through the entire film one feels the desperation of the entire battle unlike enemy at the gates the film makers didn't try to put some sappy love story or dress up factual occurrences of the battle this film may be fiction but it conveys what happened in the bloodiest battle in world war ii
<START> this is a good enough movie and you probably won't be disappointed but it again has roy scheider right after he did french connection playing a cop with the name they also use the same too memorable from bullitt at first you'll think you've seen the car chase before if you have his face still in your memory the car chase is a great one but as in many car movie scenes it has some technical and editing errors check puppet on a chain and french connection ii for some other good long intense chases
<START> this must be one of the worse movies that i have ever seen on a par with blair witch and just as annoying the flashing helmet lights made things difficult to see and i think that should take heed as there are moments with strobing that makes this movie even more annoying i think if they had been quieter they might have found a way out then when you think the geek might come up trumps even he resorts to a nervous breakdown oh and when is the guy who is having sex realise that when the girl says she can hear something she can really hear something one of these guys must have at least seen scream where they draw your attention to such things it is also a big let down when a premise offers so much promise and then someone writes the script so sorry folks i got this on weekly at the video shop and i would still like my money back
<START> i watched this movie three times at different ages of my life and always did enjoy it very much indeed this can can is an authentic explosion of joie de vivre like stanley donen and gene kelly musical but in french way and a jean renoir nice tribute to his time his friends lovers music and dances it is at same time a show business chronicle of that age full of affection and french mood it is too a clear tribute to the impressionism people who likes impressionistic painters will like this picture it is particularly a tribute to toulouse lautrec and of course to jean renoir father pierre auguste you will find hear a trustworthy and splendid colored recreation of some renoir master work excellent casting scenery sound effects and music even it tell us about the creation of parisian moulin rouge obviously it is a fiction story and not very original by the way as it fall down in the very well know moral that the show must go on but the jean renoir production is great br br
