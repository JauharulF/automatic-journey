<START> if you've seen atlantis 1 then you'd know that what made that film truly great was brilliant animation and a good script this movie was so sloppily drawn and animated the story is also dopey i was so disappointed in this half baked drivel that i couldn't make it past the first hour and man did i try the one thing this film had was that it expanded the mole character making him both more sympathetic and three dimensional take it from me judge this junk from the cover on the video box the cover is poorly drawn disney schlock clearly grabbing for an easy buck from an unsuspecting parent if this was a stand alone flick it wouldn't be so bad but riding on the coattails of a brilliant piece like atlantis makes it utterly
<START> i first saw this movie when i was about 12 years old it has been one of my favorites since it's so perfect in all it's glory complete with awesome soundtrack cheesy dialog and it was both hilarious and terribly sad the first movie i really just had a fit about at the end i won't ruin it for you guys but boy is it a tear jerker i just remember feeling so sad for gary what a bunch of cool characters in this movie it's genius they are all so great even the nerdy girl gary doesn't like she had a nice little body though i can't believe all the girls go for rick he is such a sleaze ball with his handkerchief tied around his neck ha ha ha when watching this movie be prepared for lots of sex jokes complete with sexually transmitted diseases almost but a love story at heart with real problems dealing from insecurity to life altering decisions that make you think and feel genuine sorrow for the cast i love this movie if you like valley girl another all time classic you will too
<START> was simply one of the most touching and sincere movies ive seen in a long time the story of an adopted girl who on her 9th birthday learns the truth about her parentage she sets out in an endeavour to find out more about her real mother and learns that her mother is now a terrorist br br the greatness of the movie lies in its simplicity mani generally has a tendency to create unreal and pompous overblown characters in this movie every person seems real and their interactions are touching and sincere this is the reason why this ranks as one of his best movies br br the movie is emotionally draining and tugs at the heart of the viewer as the 9 year old and as her adopted mother are simply brilliant their relationship is the cornerstone of this movie there are some notable flaws here particularly the scene where learns that she is an adopted child is jarring and seems totally unreal it is hard to believe that such sensitive parents would break such a news in the manner that they did another flaw is surprisingly enough the brilliant songs they again seem forced and stand out not gelling with the rest of the script br br having said these this still is one of the most poignant and beautiful movies to come out of india in a long long time this beauty is not just in the script or characters but in technical brilliance as well ravi camera work is sheer poetry all characters perform and the realistic humour especially in flashback scenes are entertaining br br a sincere 9
<START> dirty dancing i think everyone has seen this movie at one time or another i can remember as a kid i loved this movie and watched it over and over again without tiring of it br br now that i'm a little older i bought the dvd recently and still wasn't disappointed with the performance br br swayze and grey create the atmosphere for this movie even though it's claimed they don't get along the chemistry in the movie is unbelievable as the movie proceeds we are sucked into their relationship and believe every single one of their actions br br the soundtrack is amazing the music only adds to the romantic mood of the movie and adds to the relationship between baby patrick br br the last scene makes this movie who can ever forget the famous line puts baby in the corner the song is perfect and the dancing is amazing br br i would recommend this movie to anyone at any age it's just a fun movie anyone can enjoy 8 10
<START> sex lives of the potato men is about the sex lives of several men involved in delivering potatoes so there are no surprises there it is in fact pretty much what you might expect from the title that is it's a quirky comedy involving sex and potato men at times the film works it's an edgy sometimes uncomfortable comedy about the lives of some rather unimportant and rather average men who are having problems of various sorts with women where the film clearly does not work and why it failed at the box office is that the quirky uncomfortable parts are perhaps just a shade too quirky and uncomfortable instead of laughing during the scene of a man suspended from a basement ceiling masturbating over another man while he makes love to his wife i think most of us just kind of groan awkwardly and wonder what andy humphries was thinking well perhaps we are shown what he was thinking all too clearly
<START> track listing 1 outta my head 2 lash take me away 3 4 machine gun fellatio the girl of my dreams is giving me nightmares 5 butterfly 9 growing pains 6 grace good thing 7 giddy up 8 james lick a lounge 9 k lee 1 1 1 10 the international noise conspiracy smash it up 11 cartman shock living with you 12 pollyanna rebound girl 13 filler machines don't sleep 14 giants of science complete this progression 15 rocket science hyperspace 16 the cruel sea three legged dog 17 dog home entertainment system 18 drag secret design 19 chemical heart acoustic mix 20 come on jp mix br br loved this movie sure it wasn't hollywood material some people complained about the script acting but thats the beauty in australian movies
<START> the worst ever korean movie the plot is ridiculously complex unbelievable and the film creates not a single shock it builds up suspense well enough then leaves you agitated providing no shock or jumpy moment whenever there is a chilling moment you are not bothered by it as you're still trying to work out who is who and what is going on it goes something like this a modeling company recruit 4 people for a modeling career but the owners are not what they seem they have model dolls of everyone and a strange girl is seen walking about the place and the owners have no recognition of a girl it turns out that everyone is there for a reason and thats as much as i could grasp the ending is a muddle of killings and you don't know who's a doll who's real and who's dead i don't recommend it to fans of korean asian horror films
<START> i don't know how people can watch this the only people who enjoy watching this are those who have no feelings and emotions and enjoy watching people die houses burn down car crashes babies die and cast members being killed off every week its the most absurd thing on television and i still don't know how it pulls in the ratings its so depressing i can imagine the writers sitting down and saying 'so who shall we kill of next week then' or house shall we torch in a months time ' br br its the most depressing absurd and most stupid thing on tv at the moment and i cant understand peoples motives for watching this depressing pile of crap anymore
<START> i don't even understand what they tried to accomplish with this movie i mean really you got this guy running from a bunch of cats because he's dead but in order to be really dead this girl has to shoot them and they leave a corpse even though normal people can't see them because their dead the script already has a hole in it the size of nebraska then you have the main character played by susan who just drones up her lines in a monotone boring voice and with so little emotion on her face she might as well have starred as a female terminator robot it's absolutely horrendous and i don't even understand how i managed to see it all the way to the end of the movie the end being just as stupid as the entire movie mind you and with absolutely no reward in it for the viewer what so ever they might as well have called this movie the little movie that could choo choo ka choo
<START> the greek locale for parts of the movie were very beautiful and the photography get all my votes and that's about the extent of my raves for this movie i found that all the characters were narcissistic archetypes found so often in the american culture and were shallow and uninteresting susan sarandon and gena rowlands are easy to look at but i found their characters very narcissistic and unlikeable for many other reasons when gena rowlands sings at a party it made me wonder how this woman could think of herself as a competent star of the stage i was tempted to hit the mute button until she finished singing molly ringwald was herself and raul julia's character was so lecherous he was downright creepy the movie was much too long for my liking and i could not sit through it again even at the point of a gun
<START> this was one of the best half hour horror suspense fantasy shows of the eighties without a doubt granted the show had a barely capable cast with every single episode and it stank as far as production values i e the sets went but darn it i have to give it some credit for being gutsy with the plots i mean the plot of each episode was edgy enough that even i a hardened horror movie shock film and 70's grind house buff got a little sickened and creeped out great show just great regardless of what the other reviewers have said here my favorite episode was called bug house yeah that was the title i think anyhow it still gives me the willies every time i think about it to this day almost 20 years after it first premiered other shows like tales from the darkside the outer limits and of course the twilight zone were definitely better production values wise but in my opinion they ain't got a thing as far as plot lines go when compared to this sick little show it definitely paved the way for the even more graphic cult classic phenomenon that was tales from the crypt
<START> i shall begin with a disclaimer this movie is not recommended for anyone who lack interest or have never played the game before watching the movie relies on the audience's knowledge of each character in the game to convey story plot elements and it does so very subtly do your homework before watching this wonderful piece of cg film and i promise it'll be that much better br br with that in mind this film has some of the most spectacular cg sequences i have ever witnessed the whole experience felt like an extra long fmv sequence from the game on steroids yeah the attention to detail in each scene especially in the heavy action oriented ones is so impeccable it left me with a sense of awe br br i believe the soundtrack is simplified so as to help the audience focus on the animation quality more than the music again for those who are familiar with the story and background the music should not surprise anyone although the timing and placement of each soundtrack from the original accompany each scene and mood to the point where the music simply enhances the animation br br once again i myself having only played through once thoroughly enjoyed this piece of art from square enix and that is the feel in most scenes choreographed and organized like a dance br br in short if you enjoyed the music or the game final fantasy 7 this film will blow you out of the water if you're in the unfortunate majority who has not experienced the goodness known as on playstation or pc doing so before watching the movie will allow for an exponentially greater experience br br finally i just want to make a note of the quality in animating this film characters move with fluidity each scene background comes to life and tells its own story for those who criticize the thinness and dependency of the story plot i urge you to the animation facial reactions subtle clues that bring about another level of entertainment above the typical narration method of story plot delivery br br square enix and the great tetsuya has set a new bar for quality animation and storytelling advent children has ushered in a new era for cg animations allowing the subtleties that lie in each character to speak volumes in and of themselves br br thanks square enix the wait was well worth it
<START> i rarely give ratings less than 5 but in this instance i must weigh in elmore leonard is a great writer with many wonderful complex books original characters crisp dialogue invigorating plot twists films based on his books go way back to hombre paul newman mr bronson and out of sight clooney lopez among others even when done so so the films at least have some measure of story essence coming through this one it is simply not a worthy addition to the catalog br br the acting is bad i do not know why because these are very capable people here and the story is handled with stupidity the characters are re arranged the chemistry is missing the actors and actresses are mis cast br br since elmore leonard is a really great story teller i would hope that anyone who does not know his work would be dissuaded from reading his books because they saw this disappointing rendition of one of his stories br br the story is a sequel to get shorty if you have not seen that film do not watch this if you have seen get shorty do not proceed to this br br i saw be cool a few years back and tonight have been re visiting the vid the first time must not have made such a negative impression because i had forgotten how dismal this sequel was br br fortunately i think no less of those who appeared in this film for having done so they probably expected something more get shorty was original and great fun travolta i nearly always like but he is so much better in tarantino's pulp fiction and in the preceding get shorty he was clearly unable to enjoy whatever was going on here br br and i hear freaky deaky another elmore leonard book is in pre production for 2008 release hopefully they can pull it off br br read the books they are almost all great
<START> this movie was simply amazing the writing was incredible as well as the directing and acting the story instantly gets you interested this movie is one of those movies that has your heart pounding the whole time as always damian is brilliant his on screen acting is as powerful as any hollywood actor the cast in this film is perfect each character made the story more complete the cinematography was captivating and it uplifted the movie i was totally stuck to the screen and couldn't stop watching it there was no getting up for popcorn or anything this movie is one of the best all year maybe even the best definitely rent this movie i recommend it this movie if u want to see great filmaking or just for pure entertainment
<START> this film to me deserves a lot of praise because even though i am not a surfer or skater i remained inspired throughout the whole documentary br br the depth of history and development of these two extreme sports emphasised what they were able to do for two groups of individuals the dedication that these individuals had have is truly inspiring and it was because of them that others can now enjoy and do what these guys founded br br unlike most other documentaries this one was cleverly put together the amount of footage that was recorded and survived throughout the decades is outstanding and it was because of this that some of the greatest editing i have ever seen was put together and resulted in the subject remaining focused without the urge for them to retort to recent footage of the more famous surfers and skaters that remains popular today br br the film explores areas such as the success such accomplishing new tricks winning competitions and gathering fame as well as failures such as injury or burning out br br it was also fulfilling to hear the experiences come from the skaters and surfers themselves and not from second hand information this resulted in a better picture to be drawn br br overall a truly outstanding effort
