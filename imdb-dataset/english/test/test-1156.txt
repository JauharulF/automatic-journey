<START> this film isn't a little bad it's not even kind of bad it's horrid you know you're in trouble when charo shows up in a film she must have had the week off from love boat george kennedy at least he's a gamer he's in there trying actually he's all right and it's good to see martha raye jimmie walker's okay there's slightly better acting than in airport '75 but what film doesn't have better acting than airport '75 one thing i liked about this film is that it had more going on than a lot of other disaster films plot wise at least they made an attempt at subplots what really hurts this film is the special effects ugh not too special if you ask me this is the kind of film that at 2am is truly truly funny if you've been up having fun with your buddies and you're looking for something to laugh at
<START> errol flynn had quite a gift for comedy that was sadly rarely exploited given the right material this film demonstrates that he could have happily been quite at home in cary grant style gentle comedies out of his various forays into the genre this is certainly the best patti brady gives a fine performance in the child part and eleanor parker looks simply stunning throughout the film an added bonus is the wonderful hattie mcdaniel who is sadly underused in this film a welcome presence none the less flynn carries off his comedic duties with the same easy style that he brought to his swashbuckling roles the fact that he makes it look like it's easy doesn't mean that it is a super little family comedy great for the christmas period or any other time you feel like being cheered up
<START> scratch is a documentary about djs and their art of scratching from that one line description of the film you would have no idea how entertaining and educational this little film is it is a joyous and vibrant celebration of a cool subculture which is little known it's filled with great underground hip hop music and you get to see some top djs e g dj q bert dj shadow and mix master mike from the beastie boys showing off their stuff going into the film i wasn't sure that scratching can really be called an art form or that the turntable can be viewed as an instrument in its own right scratch completely changed my mind on these points what these guys do with their is truly amazing it is definitely some kind of art and the turntable if you know how to use it can be transformed into an instrument that you can play as much as a drum or a guitar and you even get a lesson on the basics of scratching from dj q bert e g how to use the to get different sound effects all these djs in their own way were inspired to take up the art of scratching after watching herbie hancock perform his song rock it you remember that song don't you live at the what got their attention was not hancock himself but his dj and his scratching not only is scratch about scratching but it does some scratching of its own thanks to the creative way in which this documentary is shot and edited there are moments where clips are quickly rewound and then forwarded several times which mirrors in the film medium what happens when a dj quickly moves the record on his turntable back and forth while using his that sound whether you're a fan of hip hop or not you can count on scratch to give you a very enjoyable night at the movies after seeing it i had an itch to go buy a turntable of my own and i mean this as a compliment
<START> what ho this one is jolly good i say jolly good ol' chap or should i say ol' bean my mastery of british terminology is a little dusty anyway my biker boots and i walked into this screening with no prior viewing experience of wallace and gromit i'm happy to say that my boots and i walked out pleased to have made their acquaintance br br while not as adult accessible as toy story w g still manages to be clever enough to provide the grown ups with a little humor that will most definitely soar over the heads of the young 'uns who are too busy guffawing at the were to have any clue that something is amiss i highly suggest that you pay close attention any time you see books or words on the screen because there are quick glimpses of puns that you'll miss if you aren't paying attention my favorite is a book of monsters that refers to the loch ness monster as tourist if you've ever been known to say i can really relate to kevin federline or if you're just illiterate then not only will you miss out on these jokes but you probably should be spending your time learning to read instead of going to movies consider this a public service announcement br br the most impressive aspect about w g is its clay animation thanks to the tedious process it took five years to finish the film according to the press notes there were some days when the optimum goal was to merely accomplish 10 seconds of completed film folks i sometimes have trouble finding the motivation to finish responding to a handful of emails or adding captions to pictures for my reviews a point that is proved by a lack of pictures in this review so i can't even imagine having the required patience for that br br i really like the rough hands on quality of the claymation figures the fact that you can see fingerprints in the clay is a nice personal touch how can you not be impressed with clay characters that show more expression and emotion than paul walker and keanu reeves combined the curse of the were rabbit is as director nick park calls it the world's first vegetarian horror movie that should entertain both kids and adults alike relying on and as a male who prides himself in his shaggy haired cool bearded masculinity i hesitate to use this word cute and oh man i probably shouldn't use this word either lovable characters rather than outdated m c hammer references w g is proof that dreamworks can create entertaining animation when it chooses cleverness over the cheap joke
<START> black rain is a superb film but watch out for the dvds currently being sold for as much as 300 apiece i have the dvd and it's terrible very tiny non anamorphic image that has to be blown up to resolution killing size acceptable sound this is a primitive dvd that absolutely has to be rereleased br br btw i also own the laserdisc and the vhs of black rain the vhs is a huge step upward from the dvd and the laserdisc has far and away the best picture of them in the black sharp big picture simple but very good soundtrack buy the vhs and avoid the preposterous prices these scam artists are demanding
<START> i remember this in a similar vein to the young ones we'd stumble back from the pub and watch this or tape it and then spend weeks replaying the lines to each other br br we called one of our mates after the brilliant episode in which daniel peacock has a bit of on his nose by the back street abortionist br br lots of great lines remember at 5 30 in the morning you can only get white bread from a brown man take it easy guy gandhi as a local shopkeeper br br tony was definitely on there in the episode they were teaching ralph daniel peacock to be a barman it's no good amanda i'll never make it as a bar man helen lederer teaches him to ask people about the match see the match last night i thought played well after a string of failed conversations the curly haired arsenal star was sitting at the bar see the match last night yeah i thought i played well br br we still do odd stupid lines now reg and ralph or ralph and reg reg reg reg reg reg reg br br lots of very surreal silly moments and very surreal songs from the the back street abortionist a personal favourite with the great ending line and he'll mark your packages 'return to sender br br good old danny peacock you added a lot to some young evenings sir br br update i found a couple of episodes on tape i'm going to the gandhi sketch to youtube
<START> this movie starts really good br br after half of the movie it wraps to a religious christian crap br br some really christian with psycho problems are talking about good and believe in christ or you go to hell br br don't watch it it's pure propaganda and its pure wrong br br this movie starts really good br br after half of the movie it wraps to a religious christian crap br br some really christian with psycho problems are talking about good and believe in christ or you go to hell br br don't watch it it's pure propaganda and its pure wrong
<START> the definition of a vampire is an inhumane corpse supposed to leave its grave at night to drink the blood of the living nearly nails this concept on the head minus the clichÃ© of pointy fangs and neck biting being an r rated movie i knew this was actually going to pertain to vampires actually being vampires which means that the characters in the movie are going to do what vampires actually do without restraint and rightfully lack any glamorous moments in comparison to twilight having viewed chan wook park's preceding oldboy i had very high expectations of br br i anticipated some awkward plot sequences with our anti hero known as priest sang and was very impressed by his performance as a holy man who is forced into this quandary of being humane and obeying his thirst as a vampire spoiler after the initial premise of him surviving the defective blood transfusion he starts to crave blood and discovers his super strength and his flying ability the screen shots do his transition phase without overbearing on exposition he starts drinking the blood of the dying and those who wish to be euthanized for moral reasons the oft tragic and dysfunctional love affair the priest has with the manipulative tae is very riveting as they are played by the host's ho song and actress ok vin kim the special effects are properly placed in the backdrop and while it doesn't offer anything new in the ways of stunts and cgi it didn't impose itself into the plot driven and character developed premise the story and the pivotal plot points are very perverse and grotesque yet very original in its own korean style br br there aren't many negatives i can say about sometimes i ask myself if the priests transition phase could have showed more of the priest having an emotional crisis with his transformation but then again this would have made the movie 3 hours long the movie was long to begin with on the same token vampires really don't have much in the way of expressing emotions to begin with as mentioned before this movie is very tragic so don't expect anything hopeful while watching this br br overall is delightfully dark morbid and original i strongly recommend this movie for serious viewers who are past the teenage phase of twilight this is definitely the korean answer to the swedish let the right one in which is also a good movie
<START> when one thinks of soviet cinema the propaganda masterpieces of eisenstein or the somber meditations of tarkovsky generally come to mind they're great films sure but generally not the most entertaining material out there however the countries within the iron curtain apparently enjoyed their escapist musicals just as much as the states had in fact from the 1930s up until the 70s forty of these song and dance extravaganzas were released to much adoration by the public however they are completely unheard of in the west so this documentary attempts to rectify that situation it does a terrific job of both showcasing these films and putting them into the proper cultural context despite the fact i've never been a fan of musicals i found this documentary to be completely compelling from beginning to end it goes to prove that no matter how many films you manage to see in your lifetime you're only skimming the surface of whats out there br br as for the film clips themselves they're very entertaining while some of the musicals are blatant propaganda showing workers singing of how much they love working under the regime some of the films particularly the later ones look quite accomplished from a production standpoint plus they are all extremely campy because of how alien they are to my western eyes there's a few similarities between them and the american musicals i'm used to but the presence of strict government enforcing of a message gives them a surreal edge they certainly don't resemble the musicals made in the west this documentary is both one of the most bizarre and entertaining films i've seen in recent memory and its an absolute must see for any film buff 9 10
<START> an elite american military team which of course happens to include two good looking women and a guy who can't quite grasp teamwork lots of bats some terrorists and a team that acts like the gang that can't shoot straight all thrown together in a jumbled plot with mediocre acting this one has nothing much going for it the characters are not compelling even the setting which has great possibilities looks like something out of the middle of rural pennsylvania not an exotic forest in eastern europe br br the bats are certainly ferocious looking they can even pick up a man and fly with him for a few feet harpies or chop off an arm you see delta force surrounded by hundreds of bats with a guys shooting assault rifles and pistols at them and bat flopping to the ground it would be like trying to shoot skeet with a rifle from a distance of 3 feet utterly clueless the dialogue is unrealistic with boy girl jokes and flirts in the middle of tense parts of the mission one of the team is blown up by a mine and the first one on the scene just stares sadly at his body stunned not even bothering to take cover or secure the area in fact after the rest of the group shows up he talks about how the area is laid out like a minefield thanks for the heads up bub br br if you want a contrast in how a horror movie involving a small military group can be done well on a low budget check out outpost harvest is not the movie you want to see in fact i think i'm going to give it a two instead of a three if i can make it through the second half seems unlikely at this point
<START> at first i didn't think i would like this movie but as it progressed it became better and better i love music and i was impressed with how well cage could fake the movements of playing a mandolin my son was with me and he also like the movie a lot for its music and the story and the way the story unfolded slowly showing how won the girls heart the acting and the story were both well done and well directed at first bravado was irritating but soon he grew on you the twists in the plot were intriguing especially the relations with the germans i would like to see this again to follow all the side plots i also want to buy the sound track to hear the music again
<START> a couple are split apart during a vacation early scenes lead us to believe barney jeff bridges' character has kidnapped the girl in an unexplained but premeditated abduction the film plays out some years later where despite a new love interest jeff kiefer sutherland is determined to solve her disappearance br br the storyline is definitely intriguing but there have been some really bad decisions made during the making of this film culminating a pretty shoddy piece of work br br ok here we go the abduction scene aside from two major continuity errors there is a point where sandra bullock and kiefer sutherland are made to perform a little signed pet love ritual that's drowned in over sentimentality to the point of nausea we know they're in love the i do solemnly swear never to leave you speech only moments prior was ample thank you jeff bridges' robot accent is another example what is that for starman is back and it seems after a decade on the planet he's turned nasty the entire plot is then able to be resolved by the introduction of a needless character who by a rather fortunate twist of fate has quite miraculous powers of observation the climactic sequence itself has essentially been done before only much much better it's riddled with further annoyances and another blinding continuity blunder i could go on but something positive needs to be said at a stretch kiefer sutherland is the only one to save face with a fairly decent performance br br the 1988 original of the same name changed from the dutch title 'spoorloos' for english speaking audiences was recommended to me only for an online rental company to send me this later hollywood version by mistake i was surprised to find both having been directed by george sluizer and would be interested to know his motivation for the remake i am reliably and thankfully informed it is of a much higher quality in all areas including plot for that but it really doesn't take much doing
<START> there's a thin line between being theatrical and being just plain forced forced acting forced takes forced plot even forced photography there's people who say the movie develops that way because it's from asia but i don't see any kind of forced elements on seven samurai or sonatine there's a thin line between being fiction and every work of art it is in it's way fiction and being just unlikely in a more personal way i just don't feel anything with the movie it doesn't take me anywhere and i just can't believe in the fictional world it is proposed it just doesn't feel right there's something in it or through that just doesn't click
<START> i watched sea of dust at the rhode island horror film festival in providence it was the festival's featured film and won best picture out of i think a couple hundred entries the director and a few of the stars answered questions after the showing one star suzy lorraine was even hotter in person than in the film and she was an eye catcher in the movie br br this film is independent yet it has a lot of cinematic touches that give it a quality feel it even has an original classical style musical score br br i am a savini fan and he's the star villain here in black cape he's more of an evil force than a real person i think he is sucking the souls out of people and using them as soldiers in a twisted attempt to establish his version of the kingdom of god on earth in his view christ was all about suffering and savini intends to make everyone suffer br br the main story line that holds your interest is about a young doctor stefan who is sent to investigate the strange events savini is causing in an isolated town he proposes to an aristocrat chick on the way but her sob father tells him to get lost then he meets up with a strangely possessed but alluring country girl i think she falls in love with him but she also tries to kill him as do a number of hot women in the film br br i found the scenes shot in the woods to be the creepiest and most eye catching with strange people along the road the evil little twin girls scared the hell out of me br br the film has a lot to it too much to list there is a lot of blood torture and gore hot chicks licking blood off of guys' fingers a terrified girl's head explodes that was unexpected throats get slit some brutal stabbings br br then they play it for laughs sometimes poking a bit of fun at the whole evil black forest genre br br if you're a fan of hammer films and ingrid pitt it is fascinating to see her in this movie she offs one of the leads by plunging a cross in his skull excellent the guy who played multiple in silence of the lambs is great in an axe fight br br the movie is surreal and with the ending i'm not sure the events happened or if they were in stefan's head because of his rejection by his would be fiancÃ©e he returns in vengeance and that scene is brutal br br the director also talked about the theme of religion being misused to back wars and killings i can see that for sure savini's view of religion was scary br br this was a strangely exceptional movie with some stars like savini and pitt a lot of good supporting cast including hot babes great gore scenes action and all the time you're wondering what the hell is going on and what is going to happen next br br this deserves ten stars because it's an excellent independent film effort i don't think it was low budget but it had to be way less than a big studio budget and yet they managed to make something really attractive unique and thought provoking
<START> this is one of the most ridiculous westerns that hollywood ever made gary cooper plays a former confederate officer wanted by the law he meets up with a moron named played by leif erickson who is a u s marshal with no knowledge of firearms is on his way to dallas to see his fiancee played by ruth roman senor father has plenty of men but they can't seem to be able to keep an eye on his cattle which are regularly by the marlow brothers will marlow played by raymond massey has financed the loan on the estate making things completely absurd he even has the power to call for mortgage payments before they're due simply because he feels like it br br since is a boston boy who can't fight since he only became a marshal so he could visit his fiancee just another instance of more plot nonsense are we to assume that you only have to pass a written test to get this job wait a minute this guy couldn't pass the written test either he switches identities with reb hollister who of course is an expert gunman reb takes the liberty of greeting girl with a passionate kiss while looks on like an idiot gary cooper hollywood's number one stud is in fine form here as reb before the movie's done not only does he take job he steals his fiancee also and ruth roman as falls for him so hard and so fast that she gives chump leif erickson the brush off before the films little more than half over br br there isn't a shred of plot credibility in the whole film so despite the good cast and lush photography the film is a dud and cooper's character is a complete heel to boot the film also stars barbara payton as marlow's girl a beautiful and talented actress who squandered away her chances unfortunately by making too many headlines for the wrong reasons i strongly suggest you pass this one up
