<START> being a retired medical health field in the i never get tired of seeing this film paddy was a friend of my college comp teacher visited him us during several back in 1958 his writing ability has stood the test of time the hospital is as fresh as it was in 1971 i can watch it every week still find something new so many of the supporting cast members went unto bigger better roles in both tv film george scott made only a few comedies but his timing patter are as good as jackie gleason steve mental humour rather than slapstick wins in my book every time and still a family film with only 1 four letter word during entire film
<START> it may not be a 10 out of 10 but for me the jokes didn't fail i've seen it many times when i was younger and again on dvd i believe and i laughed each time the humor is simple and fun this film was just one of many small flicks disney was throwing out at the time i found the parts where the people out of the invisible loop saw people invisible there expressions were priceless great film if the opportunity to ever see this arises i recommend seeing it for a good oh fashion laugh my favorite character in all the dexter series would most definitely have to be dean higgins i love his voice and hearing him get upset especially seeing his expression at the end was just pure hysterical for me
<START> of course seeing a few boom mikes doesn't mean anything does it lord rudy ray moore and martin really put this one together didn't they i laughed a lot as often happens in these types of movies but i don't know what i was supposed to laugh at because i laughed at so many other things i am not saying the movie was bad but i will say that a little more editing would have done wonders i am a huge fan of blaxploitation so i don't think that it was horrid but i know that the human tornado was several times better than this i think that those who can make it through this movie might need a colt 45 or two afterward i mean it really helps you to not notice the boom mikes when you watch it again
<START> this is a very sweet coming of age movie very funny and russell crowe is amazing those who know him only from gladiator will be surprised to see the range of his acting abilities arthur his character is one of the best onscreen nerdy virgins i have ever watch this movie how can we get it re released in ntsc format br br
<START> it's a horror story alright but perhaps not as you know it the real monsters in this flick are humans while the monsters are human and prey as weird as that may sound i see this as monsters inc for horror film fans br br sure the effects are of a std horror film the monsters are there as in any monster based film the gore is there as well there even is a slasher in the shape of dr decker played by david cronenberg i see flash of cillian murphy as dr jonathan crane in batman begins here or is it the other way round and it is decker c who are the bad guys the monsters want mainly to mind their own business off intrusive humans more or less misguided wanting to join there society br br by the end of the film you actually grow to like the quite little monsters and the dog not perhaps what you had expected from the first few scenes
<START> i have watched this movie at least ten times i do not agree with the previous comments this is a tongue in cheek movie and some of the acting is meant to be stilted men like paul cowley are few and far between women like linda unfortunately are a dime a dozen the sad thing here is that although similiar relationships like this rarely lead to murder and frame ups it is an all to familiar scenario boy worships girl girl doesn't know he exists they grow up man sees woman he fantasized about down and out and rescues her bottom line she never did love him he came along at the right time and she used him thomas is excellent as the nerdy but adequate paul his portrayal is sensitive and touching madsen is perfect as the femme fatale what really moved me was the final scene paul says he eventually cried but not for linda his wife but for the unknown girl he had watched from a distance so many years ago and longed for and loved and i loved the close up of thomas at the end
<START> preston the power and the glory was unseen by the public for nearly twenty or thirty years until the late 1990s when it resurfaced and even showed up on television in the meantime it had gained in notoriety because pauline the citizen kane book had suggested that the herman mankiewicz orson welles screenplay for kane was based on screenplay here as is mentioned in the beginning of this thread for the film on the imdb web site kael overstated her case br br there are about six narrators who take turns dealing with the life of charles foster kane the newsreel representing ralston the henry clone thatcher's memoirs bernstein jed leland susan alexander kane and raymond the butler each has his or her different slant on kane reflecting their faith or disappointment or hatred of the man and of course each also reveals his or her own failings when they are telling their version of kane's story this method also leads to frequent overlapping re tellings of the same incident br br this is not the situation in the power and the glory yes like kane it is about a legendary business leader here it is tom garner spencer tracy a man who rose from the bottom to being head of the most successful railroad system in the country but there are only two narrators they are garner's right hand man henry ralph morgan and his wife sarah this restricts the nearly three dimensional view we get at times of kane in garner henry when he narrates is talking about his boss and friend whom he respected and loved his wife is like the voice of the skeptical public she sees only the flaws in henry br br typical example although he worked his way up tom becomes more and more anti labor in his later years unions are troublemakers and he does not care to be slowed down by their shenanigans henry describes tom's confrontation with the union in a major walk out and how it preoccupied him to the detriment of his home life but henry's wife reminds him how tom used and violence to end the strike apparently blowing up the union's headquarters killing many people so we have two views of the man but one is pure white and one is pure black br br i'm not really knocking the power and the glory for not duplicating kane's success few films do including all of orson welles' other films but i am aware that the story is presented well enough to hold one's interest to the end and thanks to the performances of tracy and colleen moore as his wife sally the tragedy of the worldly success of the pair is fully brought home br br when they marry tom wants to do well in part to give his wife and their family the benefits he never had but in america great business success comes at a cost tom gets deeply involved with running the railroad empire he expands it and improves it constantly but it takes him away from home too much and he loses touch with sally and he also notices eve helen vinson the younger woman who becomes his mistress when sally learns of his unfaithful behavior it destroys her br br similarly tom too gets a full shock which makes him a martyr in the eyes of henry eve marries tom and presents him with a son but it turns out to be eve's son by tom's son tom jr philip trent the discovery of this incestuous causes tom to shoot himself br br the film is not a total success the action jumps at times unconvincingly yet it does make the business seem real note the scene when tom tells his board of directors about his plans to purchase a small rival train line and he discusses the use of for financing the plans came from a wealthy background so he could bring in this type of detail so on the whole it is a first rate film no citizen kane perhaps but of interest to movie lovers as an attempt at business realism with social commentary in depression america
<START> when the circus comes to town and places the lion's cage directly over bugs bunny's home bugs ends up somewhere in the range right between freaked out and intrepid despite the title bunny it's only at the end when bugs and the lion perform acrobatics but even leading up to that it's quite funny what bugs does to escape getting eaten somehow he always manages to use the other character's weakness against him and then pull any convenient object out of thin air bugs later ended up in the circus in big top bunny i liked this one better as the latter got drug down a little bit by giving the antagonist an eastern european accent i know that it was during the cold war but still i recommend this one br br and with the end we can affirm that it'll never be aloha oe for this cartoon
<START> fun story of a regular guy with big dreams this low budget film really hits home showing what it is like trying to become an acting success great performances by lou myers and brian's neighbor alex i giggled alot and even cried a little br br
<START> this is a haunting short film both james franco and rachel miner deliver performances that hurt ring true and stay with you since this is called a tragic story this isn't much of a spoiler but i wanted to change the outcome even though it is right for the story because i had already come to care about these people i can only think of a few short films that have had that effect on me beautifully shot acted edited high caliber work all around even to the use of just the right sound and or music to advance the story the end credit song finished the job wringing even more emotion from me this is first rate from beginning to end kudos to the writer director and all involved br br this is my first review of a film in the comments section i promised to do so in exchange for a copy of the dvd the review could be good or bad just my honest opinion this is it and it's the least i can do i am so glad i got to see it
<START> lights of new york was the first all taking feature film coming in at a brisk 57 minutes and directed by bryan foy of the famous vaudeville family br br the story has two dopey barbers cullen landis eugene palette yearning for a chance at big city life and getting involved with gangsters and bootleg booze one of the guys gets framed for the murder of a cop but is saved at the last minute by a gun moll gladys br br much of the story takes place in a night club called the night hawk which is run by a crook named hawk wheeler who has his eye on a pretty costello who is the girl friend of landis costello gets to do a brief dance and we hear harry downing made up to resemble ted lewis sing at dawning in his best al jolson style br br the acting ranges from good palette and to awful a couple of the actors muff their lines but then keep right on with the scene as noted elsewhere this was intended to be a short 2 reeler and was made on a shoestring budget yet the sound quality is surprisingly good the voices all register clearly and there is a neat cinematic touch in the silhouette death br br the film was a box office smash even though it was shown as a silent film where theaters were not wired for the new sound technology no one expected this little film to gross an amazing 1 3 million it briefly made stars of costello and landis and certainly launched palette on his long career as a star character actor br br co stars include mary carr as the mother robert elliott as the detective eddie kane as the street cop and tom dugan as a thug
<START> george cukor's the women remains one of the glittering gems of 1939 hollywood's most golden of golden years the film crackled and sparked and it's absence of males was a subtle touch hardly noticed because of all the fine entertainment br br flash forward we see fifth avenue in new york city in front of saks large crowds bustle along the avenue but something's off the shot reveals only well dressed attractive and young women creepier than i am legend the visual concept continues inside the store and later at a large fashion show what nyc fashion show doesn't have at least 5 gay men the no men rule is rammed down our throats creating an alien world off balance and distracting br br enter meg ryan first seen digging in her garden wearing a ridiculous get up complete with her retro curls and flailing arms i immediately sympathized with her husband and could understand why he looked elsewhere later in the film she morphs into an older jennifer aniston look and keeps her arms at her sides this seems intentional as if to say look i can still be relevant ryan's character is loaded down with a coven of miss matched friends insert sex and the city comparison here who if it were real life would despise each other annette bening plays the power bitch who during the course of the film realizes her life's dream doesn't really make her happy jada pinkett smith is the power lesbian all with no use for any of the men who aren't there debra messing is some sort of baby factory that eats a lot eva mendes is an odd choice for the bad girl to say the least she looks fake acts fake and any humor she tries to demonstrate falls flat someone's comment on here that she looked trans gender was spot on other various stars show up to rearrange the furniture on this titanic br br the only thing that would have saved this would have been the brilliant casting of jennifer aniston and angelina jolie they could have named their price tucked their tongues firmly into their cheeks and pulled off something very clever and profitable but no hollywood thinks of itself way too highly for that kind of exploitation instead we're given this thing that lumbers along awkwardly with no sparkle entire sections of dialog from the original are lifted and plopped down into a scene with awful results at one point ryan exclaims something along the lines of this isn't a 1930's movie no meg it's not
<START> this film shows a serious side to the often thought of as gore fest works of fulci not a lot of blood and guts here but a fine tale about murder and the lives affected by it br br a real find considering it was made in 1972 and will soon celebrate its 30th anniversary br br check this one out but be warned it is hard to find br br ron
<START> honestly i loved michael although there were give me a pillow i need to take a nap parts it was cool i think everyone did a great job in this film and nora ephron is in my ok list of directors br br it's nice to see john travolta as a pot bellied angel it's not very often i see one in a movie some people might call this a boring movie but for me i loved it angels and all
<START> fred astaire is reteamed with rita hayworth one year after their big hit for columbia you'll never get rich that was the movie which put hayworth on the hollywood map yet her performance in this wan romantic musical hardly gives a suggestion why she was so suddenly popular down buenos aires way a tyrannical hotel owner demands that his four daughters marry in order of age one may think film takes place in the 18th century but no it's modern day 1942 astaire is an ex hoofer turned gambler who goes back to dancing to earn some money getting mixed up in impersonating a letter writing admirer to hayworth's stone cold society beauty fred gazes at rita with a brotherly smile but she's so mannequin like lip synching to her songs like a wide eyed wind up doll that all romantic sparks quickly sputter they do dance together quite comfortably however and the jerome kern score is unmemorable but not too bad from
