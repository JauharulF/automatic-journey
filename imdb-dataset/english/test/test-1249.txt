<START> a couple move into their dream home unaware that it and its neighbours have been built over land formerly used as a cemetery the film is said to have been based on a true story although how much of it is supposed to be true is not disclosed the plot is hardly unique see spielberg's 'poltergeist' 1982 within a short time they experience various supernatural phenomena these range from the disturbing mysterious shadows the serious illness of the daughter to the frankly ridiculous toilets continually flushing and garage doors going out of control there is little depth to the story once it has become established that the land had been used as a cemetery we do not learn anything more the plot does not seem to develop the characters are not particularly well drawn or in any way memorable nor is the atmosphere particularly special the film could be disturbing to some viewers there is no sense of catharsis or any kind of positive message from it
<START> so americans make t v series based on movies whilst us brits make films based on t v shows it should never work but on this occasion it does because of a sublime meeting of character and actor cliches are sometimes justly so and leonard was born to play this is one of the great comic creations kind of how norman bates would have turned out if he'd been melancholic instead if murderous
<START> worse than mediocre thriller about an abused wife who goes on the lam after she is linked to the death of her husband and sister determined to prove that her husband is alive she follows leads across the state her peril increasing at each stop chasing after her are the traditional 'good cop' and 'bad cop' pair of partners one is convinced of her innocence the other more interested in closing the case and getting home this pair is often able to corner their suspect but never quite to capture her all the main players meet up in a remote town in the desert and the truth begins to unfold with deadly consequences for some br br wow this was a bad movie the lead acted as if she was the cops couldn't find a suspect if he or she is in the police station this happens twice and everyone else is as one dimensional as can be avoid this one at all costs br br
<START> i remember watching this as a child as part of the children s film foundations friday film specials on cbbc and have recently happened upon a copy br br in the twenty or so years since my last viewing this film has lost nothing br br it is an atmospheric tale which entices with cornish folklore and adds elements of truly creepy imagery of the ghost of the young miner billy br br shot in the wonderfully scenic port area of cornwall the film utilises the mixture of rugged coastline and abandoned tin mines to make the setting truly believable br br there is much packed into this drama something long since lost from children's television today and well worth a look if you can track down a copy
<START> is it a poorly acted cliche ridden pile of trash of course anyone who doesn't realize that when they pick up the box in the video store probably doesn't have any right judging movies in the first place thus i will now rate the aspects of the film that we actually care about on a scale of 1 to 10 br br violence and gore 4 for this genre there are very few deaths and the gore is almost non existent anyone looking for a little blood should probably look elsewhere the only redeeming quality is the fact that kids are doing these awful things which raises the bar a little br br suspense 1 okay i feel bad for anyone who gets scared by this trio of dorky looking kids br br nudity sex 7 lots of boobage from three different women one of whom is the mtv vj julie brown there are two sex scenes but little is shown in them br br unintentional humor 4 there are a few good laughs with the kids trying to act scary but all in all it's just bad not funny bad br br overall 4 it's not unwatchable there are a few fun moments and enough nudity to keep your attention for the entire movie however only watch this movie if you're a big fan of the 80's slasher flicks this definitely falls on the lower end of the scale but it's not all the way at the bottom the real downside is the disappointing ending it almost ruined the movie for me
<START> i was so looking forward to watching the documentary self of the mastermind behind boondock saints one of the most aggravating and pointless movies i've ever seen but the makers of overnight buddies ex of the mastermind in question also need to learn how to make a movie various unsavoury remarks yelling obscenities into the phone and enjoying his alcohol do indeed make mr duffy look like a putz but it doesn't shed any insight into why the guy got a contract in the first place what his creative process or vision is what's boondock saints even about how hard is it to meet patrick swayze what are these strange institutional machinations in which our disgusting heroes are caught because the film doesn't try to answer these questions in any coherent way it doesn't end up having doo to say about hollywood either so who cares
<START> this latter day fulci is a totally abysmal concoction dealing with an incurable gambler brett halsey who decides bluebeard style to pay off his ever rising debts by seducing some of the ugliest bitches you will ever lay your eyes on and who just happen to be wealthy widows the fulci penned script also contrives to incorporate a few blackly comedic elements which only result in some unfunny business involving a corpse which won't stay put an opera singer victim who won't stop singing etc not to mention a doppelganger theme straight out of the student of prague although in this case the two personas communicate via pre recorded radio messages in the end i can't say i'm surprised that this film shows no sign of the sophistication of mario bava's hatchet for the honeymoon 1970 which it resembles in several ways and that it is content to merely pile up the disgustingly gory but none too convincing effects of dismembered limbs and squashed or melting faces with which alas fulci had by then become completely associated
<START> san francisco oh you marvelously town thank you god for destroying it and making bricks fall on our collective heads and for pummeling into oblivion tens of thousands of your innocent obedient sheep oh lord who art so merciful in thy heavenly ways these should have been the lyrics to the title song of this oh so inspiring and utterly mindless film br br the movie starts well enough with gable discovering a cinderella with a highly annoying but much appreciated operatic voice and she soon shoots to stardom one of the many problems with our cinderella is that she is played by jeanette macdonald who if one takes the time to look through all that make up and 30s glitz facade realizes that she is kind of ugly too ugly to be playing this role anyway yet gable and everyone else fawn all over here as if she were some damn beauty or something another problem with cinderella is that her character is so utterly humble wholesome innocent god loving kind and generous enough to make you vomit for a full hour macdonald plays her admittedly one dimensional role with the sort of ahhh oh and ooh that serves to annoy rather than make her sympathetic br br tracy has been better and had better roles than playing this clichÃ©d heart of gold god loving non child molesting priest who boxes in his free time as if priests have anything to do how cute even the ever reliable gable is not up to his usual standard he is far too animated and his character is far too selfless for someone who is supposed to be an ambitious western scoundrel though this obviously is the script's fault br br the plot is basically this gable and his rival holt play ping pong with cinderella using her as the ball how well first she is working singing for gable then she works for the square holt then she goes back to gable only to return very soon to holt and of course both want to have her as girlfriend wife and if the earthquake hadn't interrupted this table tennis plot it's a safe bet that she would have been bouncing back and forth another ten times the wishy washy little princess that she is br br there are many far too many in fact musical numbers it's almost as though they tried to make the first disaster movie musical ever how silly the stuff she sings in gable's joint is okay but when she starts belting out those high pitched annoying whines during the opera segments that is when i felt that my ears were and unjustly attacked by enemy sound fire in fact there is an opera number that lasts 6 damn minutes 6 may seem like little for those who haven't had first hand experience with such horrors of audio torture but it's like with dog years a dog's year is equivalent to seven human ones a minute of opera is equivalent to 100 minutes of chinese torture or a dog urinating acid on your leg br br i thought this was a disaster movie but it's more like a near disaster movie i read that some of the dialog in this film was written by a silent era film director jesus the melodramatic and only occasionally amusing proceedings get interrupted by the real star of this movie namely the earthquake only after well over one and a half hours when joe the earthquake finally does shake up the city and our clichÃ©d characters in it i almost felt like saying thank god death and destruction are finally here unfortunately joe comes too late into the movie to save it from its increasing mediocrity the scenes of devastation are very good but even the earthquake part of the movie gets ruined pun by a highly annoying religious ending you see gable who professes to be an atheist all along without actually using the word itself finally finds macdonald alive after having searched for days and suddenly he is converted into a believer because cinderella is alive how stupid all that tells me is that gable's character is a weak minded moron br br the movie ends on a very dumb note indeed gable having said thank you to god for saving his girl and he does his on his knees finds god sees the light and the movie's little old devil gable converts himself into a believer how very god american an ending br br of course no one thought of asking this god why the hell there was an earthquake in the first place the sad and unintentional irony is that gable in the end becomes a sucker all along he had made fun of suckers who fall for the scam of them all namely religion and in the end he himself becomes one now that's what i call a triumph of the human spirit another irony is that the ending was supposed to have improved gable as a person but i see it quite differently on the contrary it took only one big joe to turn gable into a god fearing meek little obedient believer who joins the world's sheep family and as if this intellectual downfall of gable's wasn't pathetic and disappointing enough this first ever earthquake musical ends with a truly hair raising take this word as you will noble and hope beautiful mass choir scene dozens or hundreds of earthquake survivors and proud proud citizens of frisco spontaneously or did god perhaps arrange it sing all together the title song in hope for a better brighter joe less future hallelujah if you are a sucker for hollywood sentimentality do not skip this movie
<START> there are no saving graces in this dreadful stagey boring snooze fest which brings to mind the ransom of red chief br br even though there are some big stars in this film the acting is almost uniformly terrible br br glenn ford normally a laid back kind of guy hams it up with forced emotion br br donna reed is so over the top as to prove laughable br br leslie nielson is woefully miscast and is terrible br br the son is such a repulsive little brat i found myself rooting for the kidnappers br br the only decent performance in this mish mash is the relatively minor role of the butler br br perhaps i'm being too harsh on the actors after all all they did were to read the lines given them in the script ah the script that turgid piece of contrived dreck that would like to tug on your heart strings but merely turns your stomach
<START> there is a point in the film where the female boss of the death machines a multi ethnic trio to please everyone being inclusive i think it's called these days talks about using leverage on a business man except such is her delivery that it sounds like at which point this viewer perked up thinking this dull film was turning a corner into new world of kinkiness but it didn't the boss lady had to do the talking as the death machines did not say a single word during the whole film and talk she does interminably there is action in the film but it is not that exciting and the plot staggers from one clichÃ© to another the three mute death machines live to survive another day at the end of the film hopefully there wasn't a sequel
<START> pretty terrible but not entirely unwatchable another review mentioned predictable and that's almost an understatement you can make a game out of guessing what the next line will be every character is either stereotype or archetypical the good guy in a bad situation the struggle between older and younger priest on acceptance and discipline the repressed sexually emotionally deprived woman returning to the small town after failing in the big city engaged to the feeble minded beau from youth the unredeemable bad guys two lost boys looking for a sense of family they're all here and none of them with even the remotest spin of something new from the first few minutes you can figure out exactly what will happen by film's end the story isn't entirely lame but direction acting even from a cast with some talent everything is thrown together without skill as to the storyline we've all seen it before in a movie called sister act this is also one of those films where inattention to small details show up in an even more glaring light as example the nurse and our hero drive into town but park several blocks away from their destinations post office and hardware store yet both walk across empty parking lots for no apparent reason or the passage of morning to night during a scene that seemingly should occur in no more than half an hour the movie is filled with that kind of stuff and then tags on an improbable denouement
<START> this is one of those movies where i just want to move my feet and dance around the house it's a very positive and happy type of music the movie has some sad parts but mostly the music is what makes me happy gary busey did a great job as buddy holly buddy holly kept on going even tho his pastor his parents and the nashville record producer told him no buddy holly didn't give up on what he liked i didn't know much about buddy holly until i watched this movie i've been to the surf ballroom where he last played but didn't give much attention to it until i watched this movie it's an incredible movie with lots of fun so get on your feet and see this movie
<START> after reading the novel which is about a one hour read watching this film became a sad disappointing experience just as he did in prince of egypt simon wells somehow managed to direct a script that took away all the drama and mystery out of its source material and turned it into this homogenized nonsense now i'm a sucker for cheese and camp but this movie made absolutely no sense there was no joy in any of the performances or any humor there were no thrills and that silly bookend with character of throwing his hat in the air was the last straw i felt very violated when this movie was over and i still refuse to believe it was only 90 minutes it went on forever i wondered how the studio and director could have ok'd such a lousy script but then my friend pitched the movie to me exactly as it was and i said wow that sounds great but what happened to the movie
<START> i must say it was a let down overall its great to see the way sen has handled the issue of schizophrenia i am not much knowledgeable on this and got whatever it was depicted in a beautiful mind and here too its interesting portrayal br br but the thing that caused the let down for me was the artificial dialogues and over use of english its true that a new class is being formed has been formed in india which talks in english even at home but i am sure its not as formal as in the movie moreover waheeda did not seem very comfortable talking everything in english dialogue in bihari tone was seemingly much more realistic and digestible br br the second thing its about the abstract flavor she has tried to give to the movie i generally like movies with open ending but here there were many loose ends its like cut pieces are joined together to make the movie also there seemed no central theme to the movie for sure was the main line but intermingling sister sister mother daughter adding doctor azmi relation no real use of brother wife relations all were not required and made the audience loose track of what actually did she try to depict br br on the whole a watch for people who like off beat movies a must avoid for the ones who just see movies as an entertainment tool
<START> as i've hopped from film to film at the sxsw film festival this film from the opening night has stayed with me curious because it is a dark comedy with quite an absurdist premise br br a family of hyper stressed fundamentalists in a small community of like minds is changed by an auto accident three of the four have the same near death experience in which they are fully opened as each receives a reversal of the concept of original sin i won't spoil this scene with the specifics the fourth a middle school cheerleader is not just the only one physically hurt but also is unchanged and is now witness to what has become her crazy apparently spiritually bankrupt family every new moment brings a new outrageousness as they have become innocently naked and frank in every way horrifying her and then the community br br forgiving the has the most beautiful sexual awaking scene between a husband and wife that i have ever seen to the sarah song deliver me a song that can now bring tears to my eyes br br the cast is terrific robertson dean as the dad vince as the son and as the cheerleader daughter are excellent mari blackwell plays peggy the mom's questioning neighbor and best friend perfectly a much more nuanced fleshed out real character than what might have been everyone in middle america knows a peggy and theresa willis positively glows as betty the mom there are lots of risks taken by the actors playing the three changed characters and these risks pay off br br i hope this film gets a wide release if so i plan to see it again br br very accurate review at http www com phil forgiving htm
