<START> ladies and gentlemen may we present the worst of all disney remakes although the name of this movie is that darn cat it should have been that darn teen or fbi agent the cat didn't get any real good scenes ricci's character was more annoying than funny doug e doug didn't get any good lines even dean jones's cameo role couldn't save this movie the only really good characters were the town's only two auto mechanics but their scenes were only brief in all i'd say that if you are considering watching this movie go get something more intelligent like a barney video
<START> the movie is nice well pictured but no originality br br this movie is directly copied from the hitch where salman plays like a date dr like will smith and govinda like some fat jerk who is desperate to get in love with her boss by the end the movie comes to an old indian style the bride's father doesn't like the bride's lover and gets some other groom and govinda the bride's lover comes in the end and saves her from the new groom and a fancy dance and stuff br br the comedy was real good no doubt when the hitch meets hindi would be more funnier br br ultimately worth a watch but when it comes on tv after few months
<START> now really can u call that a movie i knew some of the movies that japanese people do are good for nothing but this bad i mean i fell a sleep three times at this movie no horror at all some tiny percent 0 2 0 5 comedy action let's just admit that it has some but the scenes are poorly filmed the actors are pathetic none of the actors did a good job in it's own role the were not convincing the script is also awful i mean this movie may be great really but for the 60's in not 100 sure i recommend not to see it unless you want to get so bored as i did i can't quite figure hot this movie got it's rating it's over over over rated this is a personal opinion of course i don want to offend anyone but who could like this crap so i hope this helps someone not to loose some time enjoying this movie nevertheless it's your choice
<START> inherited this from my x's dvd collection when he left with my best friend enough said watched it one night when there was nothing on the telly nothing new there then and got a very pleasant surprise very british you no hardly any budget no faces you know or have even seen before the accents were a bit thick for my liking but after a worrying start a bit too close to home in my case it began to grow on me apart from the some unnecessary jokey cutting that really didn't add anything i found the film throughly uplifting very real natural performances throughout left me wanting more from an ending that came suddenly too soon highly recommended
<START> i like dark humor and non pc stuff but not if it is with no purpose but to elevate yourself bashing a group of people without any trace of self irony is crap br br there are people who could make concentration camp jokes funny but whoever made this film unfortunately failed even in the very easy task of making fun about turks in germany it is a very easy task but if your are the germany equivalent of an inbred redneck inbred southerner from a village where virginity is often lost to farm animals you certainly will fail at this and also at life i have heard and seen so many funny stuff about minorities in germany but this movie this piece of crap being listed here is an insult to the next worst movie sucks like the calf the makers of this movie met some years ago
<START> i didn't have much faith at the beginning but as a costa citizen i can confirm that the movie shows the reality that we live day by day and shows a lot of things of our culture such as our way to speak our music our way of standing up for our rights without any fear without any weapons br br i'm really proud of the job they did and of how they didn't forget along the movie the message they wanted us to receive not caring for the money but actually working with a short budget letting us appreciate the beautiful scenarios and the great photography br br i strongly recommend seeing this movie you will not regret it
<START> back in august there was a country ish buzz to movies big hits like urban cowboy every which way but loose smokey and the bandit were all the rage for that reason i suspect the producers of this movie chose honky tonk freeway as the title hoping it would help the movie's box office receipts by drawing in that same urban cowboy crowd instead honky tonk freeway bombed at the theaters and i suspect it do so in part by being burdened with a poorly chosen title thats same problem burdens it now on video and thats too bad because its a pretty good movie and in a comedy style ahead of it's time no matter what probably anybody who can remember 1981 will enjoy it br br its too bad this movie bombed but i think it would have anyway even if it hadn't been saddled with a poor title its a movie ahead of its time one could look at this movie now and see that its clearly a father or great uncle anyway to the kinds of comedy made today for its day honky tonk freeway was pretty full of innuendo and a kind of frankness about life that didn't get popular in comedy till much later on while clearly its a child of airplane its more mature and while its certainly no knocked up it clearly points in that direction the characters are more comedy mature in that they are low key and don't ever think anything they do is anything other than serious the jokes are in the choices of what to emphasize and the camera views and the way the view themselves and their situations br br but more than that honky tonk freeway is a real time capsule a great look back at the exceedingly early 80's the people in this movie are dressed and act as everyday people of 1981 did it was clearly meant to reflect the times and be a sly comedic comment on everyday life around them br br i don't know if my review is helping you but this is really a good sometimes kind of excellent movie thats worth renting if you want to see how a lot of faces that are familiar today looked when they were 30 years younger beverly d'angelo is so young its hard to realize its her sometimes so are beau bridges and terri garr terry garr was just about to become the toast of hollywood as her next movie after this one was tootsie which finally made her a star howard was arguably the biggest current star of the the day when this movie was made back in 1981 howard was the star of the big hit tv show wkrp in he played its lead character the rascally night dj daniel stern was just about to break out as a star as the grown up narrator voice of the lead child character in the popular 80's sitcom the wonder years there are also several faces that are no longer with us these days its nice to see hume and jessica tandy as a an old married couple on a journey jessica tandy would finally pick up her oscar ten years after this for driving miss daisy there is also the great geraldine page in one of her final movie appearances though she'd had a brilliant career she didn't get her oscar till four years after this in trip to bountiful for which she richly deserved it and she died very soon after getting that award br br plus there are lots of other faces in this movie actors who aren't big stars but who have done tons of supporting work many are familiar even if you can't think of their name br br this movie is a pleasant little diversion a bunch of people with a variety of problems set out from various locations each for their own individual unrelated reasons who all in a vaguely altman esk way end up heading towards florida and unbeknownst to them a in the little town of florida which happens to be reeling from the effects of being bypassed by the recently constructed interstate nearby which did not construct an exit to which effectively takes the town off the map br br and thats also what this movie is about fascination with the whole idea of the interstate system which had only recently been completed it had taken a generation to build from when it was authorized by congress around 1960 through many years as different parts were built and then went live and by 1980 most of the system had finally been built and all connected together and first the first time the promise of what the interstate system would be had turned into what is and people were enchanted by it everybody by 1980 was pretty much an interstate freeway veteran in the sense that by then everybody had used parts of it and knew how it worked and how it was different from other roads in that it had no red lights or stop signs only on and off ramps and that it went to places that were formerly less accessible by 1980 anyone could drive anywhere in comfort and without having to stop for anything except to eat and sleep and a bathroom and this was all new then br br the ending is anti climatic and isn't that satisfying albeit its one spectacular moment what makes it great is it's the journey not the destination that makes honky tonk freeway timeless in spite of it being such a product of its day forget its title instead let it take you down memory lane
<START> was this supposed to be a comedy the black cape and skeleton mask are hilarious there is like zero plot the movie starts out with an archaeologist and his assistant they make a small mention of their dig site being cursed and then lo and behold in drops halloween costume man dressed in the shiny black cape with a skeleton mask face holding an axe so he kills off these two people then we cut to the woods with a bad imitation of predator only the commandos are being hunted down by halloween costume man who is now riding a horse more commandos show up but these people are supposed to be disguised as a hiking group yeah production probably ran out of commando costumes can you say low budget anyway they come upon a lone old indian guy sitting in the woods he's just too funny and he starts babbling about something but you really don't know what he's mumbling about so they flashback to some indians getting killed none of it really makes sense and then we go back to our commandos where more of them get killed and that's really basically the plot it's so laughably bad you just can't really look away because you want to see just how low it sinks you could make the same movie with a camcorder a halloween costume and a bunch of your friends with fake guns don't see this thing if you want a horror movie if you want a comedy maybe or just skip it and get something like the real predator
<START> mr and mrs smith is one of the not too well known early american hitchcock's movie but if lifeboat wich unfortunately also belongs to this category is an underrated masterpiece not all the movies signed by the master of suspense in that time the early 40's are really worth seeing and to tell the truth not discovering this film isn't really a lost br br mr and mrs smith is an average and conventional screwball comedy where it's rather hard to find the hitchcock's touch maybe you can catch a glimpse of his shadow wich isn't much in the cruelty that carole lombard is sometime capable of but it's well hidden in an impersonal package in a vertigo scene where two of the characters are trapped on top of a trade fair attraction and maybe in the character of the mother and that's about it even for the hitchcock fan there is little to connect with br br and for the screwball comedies amateur there isn't very much more none of the situation are exaggerated enough for being really funny and we're far from the masterpieces of hawks for instance and if one or two scene are quite amusing there're not even the funniest in hitchcock's filmography who created comical situations in almost all his movies even psycho could be considered full of very dark humor so there is really little to save in this movie that can without annoying anyone or maybe only both hardcore fans of hitchcock and screwball comedy who are in love with carole lombard stays one of the not too well known early american hitchcock's movie
<START> if you were enjoyed by watching guinea pig then you'll like this movie to psycho the snuff reels is a nice pseudo snuff movie with lots of sex elements actually the effects are not so realistic like in guinea pig but its still pretty gory br br psycho the snuff reels contains 70 minutes of sex fetish and then torture scenes first 20 minutes is like a normal porno movie after that you'll see fetish sex scenes and last one is a torture scene the guys torture and rape girl they cut off her legs hand tongue in the end guy rapes girl in her stomach and after that other guy beat him and cut off his balls sounds pretty sick isn't it br br like i said it's pseudo snuff movie psycho the snuff reels is pretty rare japanese movie and as i know it's really hard to find it but if you are crazy about that sort of films i believe that you can find it
<START> i have mixed emotions about this film especially as it compares to its forerunner br br an american werewolf in london that film had it's funny moments it was still more of horror tale than anything else this updated version now set in paris does not have that edge at all and simply isn't in the same class but it does have some good things going for it that the first film did not have and overall it's still fun to watch br br so werewolf purists aside most of whom think this film is pure garbage compared to the london version i'll still give it decent marks since i don't care what others think i liked it even though i agree london is better and i prefer that version too br br the first 30 40 minutes of this movie is strictly played for laughs including a hysterical scene with a balloon in a restaurant it also introduces the lead female character played by julie delpy i don't see enough of this actress she doesn't seem to make that many films or least ones i hear about over here in america this french actress has a face that is classic beauty so the film got points for having her in it and she looks great br br when the horror starts it can get scary and the special effects are good i also liked the lack of profanity in this film unlike the first one no f words and no lord's name in vain amazing br br however there are plenty of sexual remarks and there is one scene with a guy running out of bar tied to a cross which was blasphemous to me the soundtrack is heavy metal which isn't appealing to a middle aged guy like me either this film is geared a lot more toward 20 somethings if that helps anyone br br it's entertaining just don't expect it to live up to the first film
<START> wow another kevin costner hero movie postman tin cup waterworld bodyguard wyatt earp robin hood even that baseball movie seems like he makes movies specifically to be the center of attention the characters are almost always the same the heroics the flaws the greatness the fall the redemption yup within the 1st 5 minutes of the movie we're all supposed to be in awe of his character and it builds up more and more from there br br and this time the story story is just a collage of different movies you don't need a spoiler you've seen this movie several times though it had different titles you'll know what will happen way before it happens this is like mixing an officer and a gentleman with but both are easily better movies watch to see how this kind of movie should be made and also to see how an good but slightly underrated actor russell plays the hero
<START> the third film in a cycle of incomparably brilliant exploitation movies and the third masterpiece in a row aka female prisoner scorpion beast stable aka den of the beast where i live of 1973 is a film that differs from its predecessors in some aspects but that equals or arguably even surpasses them in brilliance the entire original series with the wonderful stands out as the absolute highlight in wip cinema and all of the films especially the first three uniquely combine exploitation and art house cinema like no other movie does beast stable is the third and second to last film with the last one to be directed by genius director ito and in my opinion the greatest of them all the first film 701 of 1972 is an absolute masterpiece of exploitation cinema and simply the definition of exploitation art in the equally brilliant first sequel dai 41 ito added more surrealism and symbolism the third film beast stable keeps up the surrealism allthough not quite to the same extent as the second and features even more social criticism than its predecessors topics like poverty forced prostitution and the exploitation of the poor are central themes of the movie br br this third film is ingenious and sublime in all aspects and arguably the greatest of the generally brilliant cycle to me it's this one with the first one as a close second once again best stable is both very artistic and very exploitation like the visually stunning film features an enormous amount of brutal violence and sleaze again as well as sequences of enormous surrealistic beauty the stunningly beautiful is once again brilliant in her role of nami aka i absolutely worship this wonderful actress and i'm sure i'm not the only one to do so the rest of the performances are also great especially is great as a police inspector who is obsessed with catching the musical score is the same throughout all three films with bushi sung by herself as the main theme which is great since the score is simply put pure perfection as its predecessors beast stable is an absolutely brilliant masterpiece of exploitation art that no serious lover of film can afford to miss the entire cycle ranges high on my personal all time favorite list beast stable is arguably the most brilliant masterpiece of them all 10 10
<START> this is one of the most touching films i had ever watched no movie has effected me the way this one did this is a great film and you have to see for yourself i'm normally impregnable with these sob story movies but this one did it for me i was in tears at the end you'll yearn for the friendship that is portrayed in this movie if i can give this movie a billion stars i could
<START> this was a film based on the novel written by the modern literary god that is koontz i refuse to believe that studio bought the rights to this movie for anything using the genius' koontz name ever since my sight became poor enough to require large print i have been unable to read this book as i had at least twice a year since first reading it i missed the book greatly and was unable to find it in large print br br i was hoping by renting this movie i would at least get my vicarious watcher's pleasures but this movie was a travesty because of subtle plot points it is my belief none of mr or most decent authors for that matter books can be crammed into 1 2 hours of film br br it will be the wise network cable or other wise who buys the rights to this novel and makes a multiple part television movie i e mini series of this book the right way br br one a star out of five would that i could go lower
