<START> there were heist movies before this one and indeed the likes of rififi were an obvious influence on it but the red circle is more than just another entry in an overpopulated genre and with this film director jean pierre melville has managed to create something that both thrills on the surface and gives its audience something to think about being cool is just as important a feature of the modern crime movie as guns and gangsters and melville delivers that with this film in droves the tone of the film is very relaxed too and melville allows the bulk of the film to bubble under the cool exterior the story has a number of angles but the central character is corey a thief who is released from prison his release coincides with the escape of infamous murderer vogel who slips from under the nose of police commissioner mattei during a train ride the first thing corey does upon release is steal some money from his former boss rico and the second thing he does is recruit vogel and a sharpshooter to help him pull of a jewel heist but rico and the police are hot on the thieves' tails br br the film is bolted together by four excellent central performances alain delon is calm and calculating as the film's anti hero while gian maria looks formidable in his role as the escaped murderer franÃ§ois pÃ©rier is good also as a dubious club owner while the real standout performance comes from andrÃ© in his role as the police commissioner the film runs at almost two and a half hours and is not exactly a thrill ride however the director keeps things interesting by keeping the action focused on the important elements the film does feature crime film stapes such as shootings but they are kept to a minimum the first two thirds of the movie are really just building up to the suspenseful heist scene towards the end rififi was most famous for its heist sequence an intricately designed scene in which nobody speaks a word the heist in this film is similar in that it is also wordless and i have to say that i preferred the scene in rififi but melville's skill in direction and the calm and composed way that it plays out make good of it the film boils down to an exciting climax that rounds it all off nicely overall this might not appeal to all crime film fans as the action is more than a little bit slow but the red circle is an excellent film and deserves its reputation as a masterpiece
<START> double shock is one of the many good columbo episodes which reaches the level of a good movie br br it has all the elements we like in the columbo episodes we get the laugh when columbo makes something clumsy and it happens more than once in double shock i can almost guarantee that you will laugh several times if you decide to watch this episode br br we also get the riddle as usual with an almost perfect murder but something about the murder troubles columbo the end is the usual we get the story about how columbo solved the mystery br br this is another good columbo episode and i will rate it 7 10 it is close to 8 10 br br just one more question the acting peter falk is very good as usual
<START> in case you're wondering the buffoonish loren c n of cryptozoology is a living idiot and any information he's provided is to be tossed out with the trash the guy simply is a news paper clipper br br as for the story line it was was a predictable train wreck the actors were mechanical the lighting was awful and the props clothing was cheap br br bobcat should have starred over the clowns in this film i was physically ill after seeing ten minutes of it br br there are insane retarded monkeys still in charge of films i see br br dan
<START> personally i have no problem with the acting nor the script i do have a problem with the giant bird it was simply awful plain and simple br br one's first impulse is the roll around laughing when one sees it what were they thinking budget be damned the monster bird was a monstrous joke br br of course in my opinion if the producers could obtain actors such as and morrow then they would have the special effect people come up with a much better beast oh well what is done is done this will be the case of the eternal joke on them that was unintended
<START> i rented this one by accident i lifted the video up and looked at the back and thought shameless blair witch rip off then in a moment of carelessness i grabbed 'the thinking it was something else my horror upon arriving home and realizing my mistake was far more terrifying than anything this film had to offer boring characters bad acting and a feeling of 'we saw the blair witch project and could do the same' permeate the action to the point where watching on fast forward will lead you straight to the credits i'm not one to fault film makers for being lazy or desperate but after this yawn fest i felt the need to warn everyone don't waste your time you have a life
<START> i'm from texas so i thought i knew big hair but the female villain in this movie had humongous hair whenever she was on the screen i couldn't concentrate on anything but her hair take about stage presence there seemed to be a lot of people with hearing problems in this movie also there was a traffic warden writing out a parking ticket who somehow didn't notice the owner plunging toward the car screaming at the top of his lungs until he hit the car then there was a guy in a phone booth who couldn't hear a huge bulldozer coming at him until it was 5 feet away all the hit men in this movie seemed a bit deaf no one had to sneak up on them the one handed 'hero' of this movie was so whiny and ineffective that it was funny the bar fight was pretty funny there is a priceless scene where the hero and his girlfriend just had sex and judging from their expressions it wasn't good for either one of them it made me laugh out loud this movie is on the 50 movie pack martial arts set if you want to see a lot of bad movies with a few decent ones
<START> o dear god i suffered having to watch this film four times in my sisters house and was it dreadful a story of sex and guns and very cheap unexplained acting unless you are at gunpoint being told to watch this avoid it ja rule just proved he cannot act ving rhames also gave the most dreadful acting ever in any of his films there was not one part of this film made me laugh or make me jump or feel any emotion i would be surprised people actually enjoyed this i have seem some dreadful films in my life but this would be in my five worst films ever the music in it wasn't good and the storyline i think was made up by a couple of guys who ordered a pizza and just sat down wrote ten bullet points and then made it into a film absolutely dreadful
<START> i have to agree with all the previous commenter's this is simply the best of all frothy comedies with bardot as sexy as marilyn monroe ever was and definitely with a prettier face maybe there's less mystique but look how marilyn paid for that i don't think i've ever seen such a succulent looking female on screen so perfect that even a gay man like me got excited by it and not just for purely aesthetic reasons if the idiot really want to do their a number they are really going to need to up their standards as no church mice need apply here her breasts the rest of her figure her adorable voice the hilarious way she shakes as she walks across a room only to arrive in front of a man breasts literally pointed as if in exquisite confrontation br br i think boyer is one of the greatest leading men in all of film history no one played opposite more great female stars than did he garbo dietrich k hepburn colbert and here bardot among many others and he was also in with leslie caron and had small parts in 'how to steal a with a hepburn as well as being in the deneuve movie 'the april although not opposite her the only thing i could disagree with in remarks is that even the loud obnoxious music over the opening credits is appropriate i mean bardot is not meant to be subtle on top of everything else and her essential loudness i don't mean her voice is part of her irresistible and one might even say exemplary charm br br vidal is thoroughly handsome even if pouty brigitte says toward the beginning 'i don't know why i am in love with you you're not even handsome ' br br dear dear bardot truly one of the wonders of the 20th century not to mention the joy that she is still with us when so many of the truly characterful are passing away so fast in all her eccentric glory
<START> this is one of the most anti traditional war movies about was i have seen instead of the typical films that stress glory and perhaps super human characters like john wayne this film is the exact opposite stressing the de humanization that also happens in war the story concerns the japanese who are stranded in the phillipines after the us returned in late 1944 early 1945 by the time the movie begins the japanese have clearly been beaten but because of the insane logic of bushido they cannot allow themselves to consider surrender at one of many poignant moments the lead character is told at the beginning of the film to report to the hospital since he isn't capable of fighting due to his tb the problem is that the hospital won't accept him so his commander tells him to once again go to the hospital and if they won't accept him he should blow himself up with a grenade well this happens just in the first five minutes of the movie a lot worse things befall this soldier and the few because they won't surrender plus there is a case in the movie where a soldier does try to surrender but is gunned down this happened a lot later in the war because so often the surrendering japanese soldiers booby trapped themselves to blow up when they came near in addition the film shows the most vivid depiction of starvation and the accompanying madness of any film i have seen in addition cannibalism cowardice and betrayal all accompany this very gritty realistic and depressingly realistic film you simply couldn't have made a better film of this type horrible but great
<START> the movie goes something like this run around run around someone killed lots of freaking out and then one of the group yells to pull it together or just calm down repeat this as many times as their are characters left in between these things you get to enjoy blank black screen these are not quick but rather several seconds long i kept thinking what a waste of film every time it happened yes it does happen more than once if you can believe it br br i notice other mentioned blair witch and it did remind me of that in the way the camera was bouncy however this movie takes that to the extreme every single time the characters move the camera is bouncing sometimes so much that you can't make heads or tales as to what you are looking at that brings us to lighting way too dark in some areas i get that they are trying to make us feel like we are in a cave but i'm watching a movie here it would be nice to be able to see br br then there is the ending i actually blurted out loud are you kidding me i was watching alone too dumb dumb i think the ending was purely the effort of the people who made this disaster to shock us after so much time of boredom with a so called twist at this point of the movie you could have seen the monster picking his nose and it would be considered a twist truly horrible you have been warned
<START> not entirely sure how i stumbled upon this movie but i'm so glad i did initially we were put off by the fact that it was subtitled but even my dyslexic brother who hates to read especially at the weekend enjoyed this film i found the script fantastic and the way it was delivered in such a dead pan manner only added to the puddles of pee on my sofa not entirely sure whether it's quite so funny to the native danish as the comedy seems to be enhanced by the of the subtitles and the ambiguity of the translation i haven't watched many danish films or any for that matter but judging by this film i'm guessing they're not constrained by the same political correctness as elsewhere gawd bless 'em making the character of a breath of fresh air because let's face it special needs are funny there are so many great one liners in this film it puts american sitcoms to shame
<START> portrayal of fugitive ex felt entirely natural his demeanor his voice his appearance all of it spoke to when he entered a space i as well as characters on the screen could feel he didn't belong there and that his determination to be there spelled trouble br br i read somewhere that mr actually took kendo japanese swordsmanship training and that would explain his comfort with the katana which showed magnificently in every if you watch the movies from the moment he draws to the moment he the sword you feel as though you were witnessing something inevitably ugly he'd even spin the katana quickly to flick off the blood before it and it would happen in an effortless instant br br nakamura rendition comes across as a rendition it feels as though he were trying too hard to be someone else or tell someone else's story as a result every time i tried to engage i'd lose my grip because he didn't seem to have a firm grip on the role himself as though it were awkward for him br br the swordsmanship in the tv series was entirely old school hollyweird too camera cuts to disguise mr awkwardness with the katana slow action targets sitting still etc extremely bad from a viewer's perspective there was a moment in the episode the castle wall attack when mr nakamura drew his sword like a child it was embarrassing he handled it as though it were heavy i almost fell off my chair br br and let's be frank the story is about an excellent swordsman period swordsmanship is an issue br br realism isn't however the swordplay in the movies was excellent and manga like as was intended i'm sure the baby cart was outfitted with a cluster of automatic rapid fire operated by a 3 year old yes manga style it's how the story seamlessly weaves historical cultural accuracy into basically superhero fantasy that makes the movies captivating read musashi historical legend i couldn't really sit through the tv series episodes they just felt cheap see the movies first and you'll know what i'm talking about
<START> in short this movie is a declaration of artistic bankruptcy br br almodovar is easily the most important european film maker of the 80s and 90s no other living director has shaped the style and contents of present day european cinema more than him it is therefore not easy to say that his latest effort is not just another disappointment after two lackluster films but rather a complete and total disaster confirming that he has run out of ideas out of humour and worst of all empathy for the characters he creates br br that is not due to the complexity of the story all almodovar films are almost impossible to summarize this time in fact it's rather easy if you are familiar with his earlier work broken embraces is a remake of law of desire only this time the director is straight and the jealous jilted lover is a millionaire br br for those of you not familiar with that film i'm doing a summary if you don't want to know too much please skip this paragraph a blind man who used to be a famous movie director seduces a sexy buxom woman reading a paper to him after a chance street encounter yes really that's how it starts just then he gets a visit by his agent and best friend he mentions to her that he has learned from the paper that a certain millionaire has died which takes the story 14 years back he can still see and is about to direct his next film he stars the inexperienced mistress of the said millionaire as the lead as he is instantly smitten with her the millionaire discovers their affair via silent videos made by his gay son which he has lip synched by an interpreter a few great scenes cecilia roth after violent quarrels the mistress escapes with the director to a seaside resort where he learns that the millionaire who produced the film had it released in the worst possible edit destroying the director's reputation the couple decides to return but has an accident in which the director turns blind and the would be actress dies back in the present he learns that his agent has preserved the film's negatives and starts to reconstruct it br br as in bad education there are various sub plots to beef up this rather thin story and as in bad education the result is more confusing than satisfactory for instance the agent's son who works as a dj has an accidental drug overdose which is completely unnecessary for the plot and also interpreted rather badly br br mostly however the actors are not to blame but the way their characters are written blanca as the agent has so many skeletons in her closet that not even a brilliant performance can save the character from ridicule is an old man's dream of a protagonist living in an artificial world where an english alias and a few sweet words can seduce any super model and penelope cruz is the embodiment of this old man's sexual fantasy her character is completely lifeless it remains thoroughly incomprehensible why she would go from one old man who at least helped her family to a slightly less old man who isn't charming enough to convince as either a romantic hero or a passion fuse br br but all these shortcomings wouldn't make this film so awful however almodovar does the worst possible thing of a director or any type of storyteller running out of ideas he quotes himself something he has increasingly done and to very little benefit the film within the film which broken embraces uses as a plot driving device is actually women at the verge of a nervous breakdown 1988 only this time it is called chicks and suitcases this rather unimaginative title may give you a hint how this beloved classic is treated here while the dialog making up the final ten minutes of broken embraces is a frantic over the top exchange of screwball one liners in the original film here it is a stern colorless pesky business encounter br br in conclusion this is the d o a brainchild of an exhausted creator of past marvels pretty much as awful and disappointing as the last indiana jones feature maybe not so many people would agree with that because almodovar used to be such a genius i'd rather offer my respect to his accomplishments by humbly asking the reader to watch all about my mother or tie me up or high heels or matador all of which bear witness to almodovar's unique and unmatched talent a few more film like this and his legacy may very well be destroyed for good
<START> this movie was the slowest and most boring so called horror that i have ever seen i would include a comment on the plot but there was none i do not recommend this movie unless you are prepared for the biggest waste of money and time of your life
<START> set in venice mainly on the visconti's death in venice is a triumph of filmmaking combining the excellence of dirk characterisation and expert photography of the resort area in all its various daily moods for those who love venice this is a film to cherish br br music frequently heard throughout the film heightens the drama the mood it creates is not always happy but then what else would you expect with a title like that br br there is not a lot of dialogue in the film rather sparse in fact it's mainly background noises and chatter and laughter among the hotel guests the intriguing part is to interpret the exchange of glances between gustav von a composer of some renown and a slim teenage youth who see each other from time to time across the tables of the hotel dining room on the beach and at odd unexpected places around venice they seem to acknowledge each other's presence shyly at first with little more than the suggestion of a smile but later with a strong and riveting and urgent gaze br br each viewer will have his own interpretation the composer has lost a child of his own is this behaviour an expression of yearning for the child he loved is it perhaps a sexual attraction towards this fragile young man with his dazed somewhat girlish stare could he be discovering some new inspiration for a yet unwritten musical masterpiece who knows br br from beginning to end this film captures the true spirit of 19th century venice the elegance of the ladies the deck chairs on the sand the children frolicking in their neck to knee bathing costumes the glow of sunsets and a general feeling of satisfaction with the world while some may think the pace is rather slow at times the film has an overall gentle quality but with a simmering indecision between two repressed human beings be prepared for a sad and beautiful ending
