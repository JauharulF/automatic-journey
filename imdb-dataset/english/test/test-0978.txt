<START> do the following get a copy of this movie and a friend wager the friend 10 that they can't sit through this entire movie they cannot divert their gaze or be distracted by anything now watch your friend win or lose you get 10 of entertainment br br it angers me to no end when people see a movie and are quick to give it 1 out of 10 or sum up their thoughts with it sucked and when asked why they respond just because arrgh that is why this movie exists it's sole purpose is for me to say there this is a horrible movie that is 1 out of 10 br br this movie is absolutely appalling br br while the recent trend of movie parodies has forced them to become increasingly formulaic this movie falls short in every single aspect it's not funny it's not entertaining and for some of the parodies it's completely inaccurate horrible acting unfunny dialogue a witless story terrible special effects one inane gag after another and to make matters even worse there isn't even gratuitous nudity to somehow make it even fleetingly worthwhile br br this movie leaps past idiotic stumbles over stupid and lands face first on moronic even i who loves a good check your brain at the door movie found myself physically agitated watching this this movie isn't even hard ticket to hawaii so terrible it's good bad it's just bad br br note i actually challenged a friend to watch this as described above not only couldn't he make it all the way through but he had a headache and needed a couple minutes afterward because he felt a little ill true story br br i could not accentuate this rating any more a resounding 1 out of 10
<START> 2002's the bourne identity is one of my all time favorite movies however many fans of the book have complained that the movie had very little to do with the book's plot br br the assignment is the real deal it's odd that no one on the bourne identity threads has mentioned this movie at all well i did br br besides the excellent plot i personally found this movie to be as good as any espionage movie i've ever seen with the possible exception of the bourne br br identity itself br br the action is all completely realistic i especially liked the protagonists' training regimen which was very inventive br br the feel is dark and gritty there are a few surprising plot twists the acting is excellent br br if you like this genre i cannot recommend this movie highly enough
<START> another well done moral ambiguity pieces where the anti hero makes it hard to decide who to root for br br if nothing else the beguiled silenced anyone who said there were no good parts for actresses in movies at least in 1971 there were four excellent parts for actresses in this film and all were well cast and well executed br br pamelyn ferdin did a fine job as amy and would go on to play wanda june this must have been the first time an adult male box office star shared an extended kiss with a twelve year old girl on camera wonder if there was much controversy about this at the time it was probably polanski's favorite scene given the fate of amy's turtle randolph it is no surprise that ferdin grew up to be a hardcore animal rights activist br br geraldine page was likewise excellent playing a complex character with just the right amount of restraint it is interesting that she died just three days after elizabeth hartman committed suicide throwing herself through a fifth floor window as they had also worked together in you're a big boy now br br hartman who looks like she could be blair brown's sister was wonderful as edwina and should have gotten an oscar no other performance was even close that year but given what we now know about her you wonder just how much of her performance was a studied effort and how much just came from inside her edwina shows such raw pain it is difficult to watch like marilyn monroe's incredible performance in the misfits the viewer is probably seeing a whole lot of her own demons in the character she is playing br br finally there is jo ann harris who is stunningly perfect as the flirty carol for my money harris was the sexiest actress of the 1970's combining sensuality with intelligence and humor she was the best reason to watch the most wanted television series and the only reason to watch wild wild west revisited hard to believe that someone who could bring all that to the screen never became a big star
<START> this is a catastrophe movie set in london starting multiple hurricane and tornadoes on scotland are displaced towards east downing england coast and later the south after several hours of heavy the london barrier above thames is short from running over and it paves the way for disaster then a colossal tidal wave travel relentless down east causing devastation and lives of millions of londoners are in danger at the center of the story is a tom a who tries to save london from the effects of giant wave trying to convince the authorities that the town dike was unsafe furthermore a marine engineer robert carlyle and his ex wife samantha they are trapped into the barrier and dropped to sea meantime the secret government agency hq ruled by nash joanne whalley under direct orders of deputy minister david suchet attempt to control many displaced and avoid more dead approximately 200 000 they have a little time to save london from total catastrophe br br perfectly acceptable drama disaster with alright acting magnificent tom as a who predicts catastrophe and excellent robert carlyle and as ex matrimony rekindling their love the movie packs impressive flood scenes brought to life by the breathtaking computer generator special effects better than the classic of the 70s such as inferno and similarly to and day after tomorrow' although isn't a clear denounce we know that the flood is caused by the greenhouse effect and global warming which originates the ozone hole the motion picture is well directed by tony mitchell i would recommend this movie to people who like disaster movies another adaptations about floods are the following 1976 by earl bellamy with robert culp and barbara hershey rain 1998 ' directed by mikael with morgan freeman and christian slater ' flood a river's rampage 1979 ' directed by bruce pittman with richard thomas
<START> if you want to see how to ruin a film study this one very closely in fact it is so bad that people should buy it for that reason alone especially note how most of the scenes look as if they were knocked up in about 5 minutes realism escapes this movie on every level the overall impression is that someone was given a below average script wannabe actors an average director and absolutely no budget whatsoever with a formula like that it just had to be doomed br br i rented this once and i swear i got stupider watching it if you are a humanitarian buy this horrible horrible movie and burn it unwatched as a favor to the world it has no discernible plot bad acting and then tosses in something about evil ugly women just to really cap the whole thing off i would suggest watching paint dry before this stupid waste of a tape seriously the paint would be better i wish i could give this negative 10 stars
<START> this movie is a laugh and a half from the first scene where we have an appearance of mel torme as a big bad jaguar drivin' stud muffin gang leader and that's a giggle fest in itself to the final image of mamie van doren now a rehabilitated angelic teen strolling out of the prison errr loving girl's home run by iron fisted nuns you can't stop shaking your head the cast of this movie is a cheesy list from mel and mamie to the talentless paul anka all i wanted through most of this movie was for him to just stop singing and the king of forty year old teens dick gloria talbot playing a humorless teen girl with more than a few chops judo not acting i last saw in the horrible misogynist 50's romp leech woman with a hairstyle so bad it looked like a dead woodchuck that had been squashed by a mac truck br br mamie is a bad bad girl she smokes swears runs wild hits teachers and runs around with gang leaders she dumps her idiot jaguar driving boyfriend chip who we see in the first scene trying to rape a blonde girl before he falls off a cliff nice guy and proceeds to take up with dick instead whether this is a step up for her is anybody's guess mel shows up at a party she's at with her new beau and accuses her of pushing the nasty chip off the cliff while i'm sure that she would have liked to she wasn't there a stupid fight scene between and his gang and mel and his jazz freaks ensues with some hilariously bad moves on both sides br br mamie ends up being sent to girls town a reform school errr loving home for erring girls run by sister iron pants and her fellow sisters of correction she annoys the nuns and us by scatting tossing off sullen one liners and just generally showing how bad she is she quickly runs into gloria talbot playing one of the misbehaving girls who gives her a chop so that she knows her place she meets a limp noodle of a girl who's obsessed with paul character why this little drip becomes her br br there's a long bit of movie where nothing much happens except st paul of anka keeps showing up and proving how saintly he is he sings way too much in this interval until you want to smack him in his huge to just make him be quiet and little sister played by princess of father know's best fame calls her to tell her she's in trouble turns out it was sis who went out with the and now mel's blackmailing her because he found out the girls all break out to go save her with a hysterical fight scene between the girls and mel and his boys this is after a race between mel and dick that is just so stupid that it boggles the mind the overage teenagers in this corny movie have a fabulous good time romping through what is basically a silly badly written and morally preachy film that accomplishes none if its aims unless its aim was to make you laugh out loud
<START> love sublime says the title another blurb during the promotions of the film talked about inner vs external beauty well in this case the beauty you decide inner or external is provided by scantily clad or is that scantily dressed undressed zeenat aman who the director raj kapoor called a volcano of talent while the film was being made one can't accuse him of sarcasm of course after all he was promoting his own film br br the paper thin plot is about a woman with a disfigured face who has a er well proportioned body a great voice thanks to lata mangeshkar with whom the hero shashi kapoor falls in love he doesn't want her face only her voice the acting is desperate and even the 4 is because of the music with lata mangeshkar giving some good numbers the rest is of course bunkum avoid save your money inner beauty vs outer beauty you need not be an einstein to figure out which one the director was concentrating on
<START> the concept show 4 families of diverse ethnicities in the fairfax district of l a preparing for the family get together at thanksgiving i loved soul food and how to make an american quilt i think there's a law that alfre woodard has to be in all these movies which similarly offered a pastiche of family traditions and was prepared for a treat instead i felt tricked they trot out about 40 characters and all but two are one note cliches with no finesse whatsoever the writers and director should spend a few more years learning about life and learn how loving people of different generations actually do relate instead you have a bunch of a holes getting together on turkey day to act like extra obnoxious a holes now to an extent this is what thanksgiving is all about but not this misguidedly and why bother having julianne then giving her absolutely nothing to do this was a chore to get through and mercedes ruehl is a standout but i give it a 4 10
<START> this is a very well written movie full of suspense right up to the end the setting is beautiful in contrast to the frightening action taking place there it is not your typical suspense movie but a movie well packed with interesting twists and surprises which leave you wanting and hoping for a sequel i recommend this film to all suspense lovers
<START> i just wish i was eloquent enough to say how good this movie is br br i it's hard to say br br maybe i'll just say what comes to mind br br i laughed i really laughed i couldn't believe it i laughed and it wasn't bitter laughter it wasn't cynical laughter it was the laughter that is generated by genuine joy br br joy that's a foreign word for me i don't feel that word often but i did while watching this movie br br will maybe it's will's face he is a great human being smile on my face and there's a twinkle in my eye that line in one of will's songs describes him perfectly he has joie de vivre trey is a lucky lucky boy to have a daddy like will jada is a lucky lucky woman to have a husband like will he is someone special br br happy i actually feel happy it's a strange feeling i don't feel this way very often it's just so nice to see to see other people really happy i mean really happy in this movie i did as will says in the movie maybe i'm not happy with just maybe i want you know watching this movie made me think so do i br br fun being yourself we all know we're supposed to be ourselves but it feels like we're punished if we do so maybe it has to be earned maybe it's something that we show after having not been ourselves for a long time that's why i just loved the ending will eva mendes kevin james amber julie ann emery all dancing at the wedding dancing without inhibitions no they we're not drunk except on actually being happy i can understand that at least i think i can at least i enjoyed seeing them happy really happy br br women and men i don't know anything about relationships but i do feel watching this movie i feel like connecting with someone striving pushing wanting to be with someone it seems to make life something else entirely i don't really know i'm just guessing but i felt something watching this movie i felt like that connection must be must make life worthwhile br br that's the kind of movie this is it's funny it's clever it's tender it evokes feeling it made me think that maybe just maybe life is truly is a wonderful thing br br want to laugh want to feel really good want to get some answers about girls and girls answers about guys watch hitch you will get it all br br go will you are a great human being
<START> warning this could spoil your movie watch it see if you agree br br to think that we as humans can not learn from the past the futuristic society portrayed glamorized what hitler believed obliterate a race of people in this case men for the benefit of society it made me sick to my stomach also the plausibility of a y bomb is insane even in war our instinct for self preservation will prevent the extinction of humanity we made mistakes in the past ie japan hiroshima and nagasaki in '45 but because of that we avoided a bigger mistake in '63 during the cuban missile crisis
<START> i should know better i've seen too many of rob lowe's early work to expect anything good from this movie even if it is about hockey br br here we have yet again another tired sports theme kid has potential for greatness has the apparent to go far if his cocky attitude doesn't screw things up and boom he comes out of it as that helluva player kind of champion is that all that can be said of sports movies surely there must be other feats that athletes undertake br br nonetheless this movie has got to be one of the biggest everybody's interactions are just downright silly and not in a stupid funny kind of manner and i can't think of any ancillary qualities that could enliven my position not the actors certainly not swayze who plays lowe's reluctant mentor not the story not the music and very little from the skating sequences br br normally i'm a sucker for 80s movies even if they do tend to be a little fishy i e north shore the karate kid but this doesn't even make for good 80s trash for a good 80s sports movie check elsewhere there's plenty of them out there
<START> probably because this is columbia's first film in color the colors look different specially in the indoor scenes they seem to be stronger sharper and the result is a bit unrealistic but very pleasing randolph scott is the sheriff a good guy but the real star of the movie is a very young glenn ford who is an outlaw that wants to change evelyn keyes is the woman that starts falling for ford and claire trevor is the countess that runs the saloon there is a funny character called nitro that does not think twice before blowing it i particularly enjoyed two moments of the film one when there is a tremendous horse stampede and you see thousands of horses there was no computer to help at that time so i presume they must have gathered all those horses no easy task another moment is the final shootout technically very good there is also quite a fistfight seeing this western made in 1943 with such great action scenes makes you come to a sad conclusion they don't make them anymore would they be able to in case they wanted i have my doubts
<START> nickelodeon has gone down the toilet they have kids saying things like oh my god and we're screwed br br this show promotes hate for people who aren't good looking or aren't in the in crowd it say that sexual promiscuity is alright by having girls slobbering over shirtless boys not to mention the overweight boy who takes off his shirt the main characters basically shun anyone out of the ordinary friend sam who may be a lesbian beats the snot out of anybody that crosses her path which says it's alright to be a b ch this show has so much negativity in it that nobody should watch it i give it a 0 out of 10
<START> in a quiet town a couple of girls witness the murder of one of their friends to a strange young boy named milo who lives on the other side of town after the murder his body is found in a river and his pronounced dead so sixteen years later a weddings draws the girls back to their childhood town and claire a school teacher becomes obsessed that milo hasn't died as she has recurring visions of him and her friends are dying one by one and no one believes her when she claims milo is apart of it so now she sets off to find out the horrifying truth br br when i came across this film i was pretty sceptical about it especially when it had from the creators of anaconda on the front cover but reading the odd little plot outline on the back of the video case it sounded alright and rather refreshing for a change well guess what i thought it was a good idea at the time but it was a totally different story when it came to watching the film it just seemed to try to hard to be smart and very psychological based but that latter element didn't come off that well for me and it was basically a prolonged and mostly unconvincing thriller hey i'll admit it had its moments but hardly enough to make it neither effectively chilling or memorable but a bravo to the filmmakers at least the story isn't a rehash of those slasher imitators that followed scream and shock horror there's no self referential humour actually there isn't even a hint of humour although maybe it was too serious especially since the plot is rather absurd but that's not its main problem what a disjointed plot we get i didn't know about to much that was going on as it seems to skim a lot stuff in favour for some supposedly shocking and disturbing sequences no more like irrelevant scenes and yawn inducing clichÃ©s that we see from time to time also you can see some influences from some good 70's horror films one being don't look now this when our main character keeps on seeing the figure of her past in a slicker the other would have to be one of my favourites alice sweet alice with the person causing the trouble wearing a yellow slicker and committing grisly deaths interesting idea but it comes across quite shallow and too many faults pop up i liked it more when the scenes dealt with the character's childhood as the performances and circumstances had something creepy about it but when it leans into their adulthood its tired and uneventful for most part and the performances weren't awful but incredibly mundane and hardly involving is a good way of putting it most of the dialogue had me groaning in disbelief at how contrived and awkward it was you'll be yelling no duh at the screen because you just can't believe what you're hearing the police detective gets the brunt of it br br quality wise the film isn't bad actually it's better then your usual straight to video i would say very slick stuff with some inventive and prominent camera angles and a faint score that works reasonably well another factor that stood out and was a key to building on the moody atmosphere was the creeping sound effects and that bicycle bell does leave a ringing sensation in your ears the setting of a quiet elementary school was well done and rest of the action takes place in a house but just don't be expecting any real suspense or surprises as the execution of these are non existent the deaths aren't pleasant and they're mildly bloody and it's more the aftermath to what happens to these bodies which tries to disturb you the villain in this piece the mean spirited child milo was mildly unnerving well that voice and yellow slicker does make an imprint to begin with but it does seem to lose its effect when we come to the films conclusion the cheesy tag lines on the video compare him to move over jason watch out freddy and this isn't child's play chucky but you got to be kidding me right he's labelled the new face of evil yeah sure all he needs is to be taught some manners and problem solved overall the film just left me with a sour taste as i've could've gone without seeing it i probably wished i did br br just don't expect too much in this blur of a film or even better just skip it as you won't be missing out on much really
