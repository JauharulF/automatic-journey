<START> worst film ever nothing more needs to be said aaron carter is utterly repellent and the rest of the cast should fire their agents immediately it really is a terrible terrible movie from beginning to end i wish i could be more eloquent in describing the movies many oh so many flaws however i cant be bothered get too angry to form proper sentences br br in short i absolutely hated everything about this movie and not in so bad its good kinda way br br it was unadulterated drek br br gavin
<START> whoever likened this one to raiders of the lost ark certainly knew he spoke he might as well have likened it to some of the adventures of the pulp heroes that followed kay reminds one more than a little of both lamont cranston the shadow and clark savage doc savage the shadow quintessential man of mystery and the very first dark knight was also thought to be one kent if one were to take savage's first name first and add to it the kent you end up with voila clark kent funny innit like indiana jones isn't above pilfering the artifacts of an ancient civilization though his thefts are often more blatant and less charmingly roguish than jones's unfortunately this two parter is a far cry from subsequent serials from any era in terms of overall quality one of the first indications that something is amiss vis a vis the cinematic storytelling is a scene where desperados on horseback quite literally breathing down his neck simply watch as escapes their clutches in a hot air balloon why they don't bother to shoot down the balloon is just one of the many movie making mysteries that plague these two films br br the second half of this two parter is even worse than the first granted this was one of the first ever serials and as such should be cut a bit of slack but there are limits even to tolerance at one point the capture of the hero is effected not on screen but in the narration itself talk about cutting corners fritz lang happens to be one of the greatest filmmakers to ever make films unfortunately for those of us who admire most of what he did the spiders is a bitter pill indeed to swallow
<START> but had to see just how bad it could get the plotline was thin to begin with but it just kept getting worse a female genetic engineering grad student uses her research on accelerated to artificially create a male because a biological weapon used in ww3 killed off 97 of the worldwide male population the surviving men are either high prices gigolos in back alley clubs or crazed lunatics in run down football stadiums plotting to overthrow the 'lesbian the entire process resembled the microwaving of a large bowl of jello press a few buttons and ding you get a baby not only that but he will age to mid 20's in a month and then begin to age normally how convenient eventually poor adam gets bored with the secluded cabin in the woods where his creator had raised him and steals her car to 'see the city' br br this begins 90 minutes of unlikely chases convenient plot twists and several subplots that we never see resolved as adam quickly learns what men did survive are treated as outcasts criminals because they are dangerous beasts that cannot help there genetic predisposition to violence the propaganda machines have been in full swing scaring women into believing all men are rapists and murderers this has led to lesbianism being the norm the fall of christianity female only reproduction via cloning and oh yeah world peace among other implied results all of which seem unlikely given that only 30 years had elapsed since the war adam stumbles from one bad situation to the next all the while being genetically programmed to be non violent and unable to really do much on his own behalf with the fbi on his trail looking for fresh meat and his creator trying to recapture him for herself it seems he learns that violence is not limited to the male species after all br br all in all i would not recommend this movie br br i did however enjoy veronica cartwrights portrayal of the 'love to hate her' director of the fbi and julie bowen didn't do bad as hope the geneticist either
<START> let me preface this by going on record i am a huge george clooney fan and i love john in 'the office' well i was and i did br br this was the world's worst hang nail and it took minutes to rip it off the stupefying boredom was interrupted only by my frequent efforts to read my watch and estimate when it would be over br br every funny scene was in the previews all three of them there was no real story no character development and the script was just plain bad i've had a that was more enjoyable br br the title should have been bad this movie is a lock for a razzie it should get a whole slough of razzies i want my money back
<START> based on actual events of 1905 silent film the battleship potemkin concerns an imperial russian ship on which abominable conditions lead to a mutiny shocked by conditions on the ship citizens of the port city odessa rally to the support and in consequence find themselves at the mercy of imperial forces who attack the civilian supporters with savage force br br potemkin is a film in which individual characters are much less important than the groups and crowds of which they are members and it achieves its incredible power by showing the clash of the groups and crowds in a series of extraordinarily visualized and edited sequences amazingly each of these sequences manage to top the previous one and the film actually builds in power as it moves from the mutiny to the citizen's rally to the massacre on the odessa steps the latter of which is among the most famous sequences in all of film history filming largely where the real events actually occurred director eisenstein's vision is extraordinary as he builds not only from sequence to sequence but from moment to moment within each sequence some of the most memorable images ever committed to film br br to describe potemkin as a great film is something of an understatement it is an absolute essential an absolute necessity to any one seriously interested in cinema as an art form purely visual cinema at its most brilliant often imitated seldom equaled never bested br br gary f taylor aka gft amazon reviewer
<START> this superb 40's post war classic tends to be overlooked these br br days when it was released in 1945 it cleaned up at the 1946 br br oscars mostly at the expense of it's a wonderful life ' both films were up for best film best br br director and best actor all won by years' frederic march br br and dana andrews along with an amateur actor harold russell a br br real life soldier who lost both hands in an explosion play the br br returning soldiers finding life is very different from what they br br remember myrna loy is superb as march's wife who has to keep br br the family together while he has been away the tear jerking br br scene where march and loy are reunited is magnificent all three br br men find that they have problems readjusting to post war life not br br least russell coming to terms with artificial hands and his finance br br cathy o'donnell trying to be too helpful sam is quoted that he doesn't care if the film makes no br br money at all as long as everyone in america sees the film so they br br will appreciate what these men went through if any film is worth 10 out of 10 it is this one
<START> this cheap and rubbish film is about a nasa test rocket that is sent into space with a cargo of animals it vanishes for a while then unexpectedly returns crash landing in a forest unleashing a vicious mutant creature br br like many films of this type night fright features dumb teenagers on down to 60's surf music before being killed none of the murders however are even remotely memorable as we don't really see anything one thing we do see however is that one of the teenagers appears to be about 40 years old and sports a quite impressively silly haircut br br for a creature feature to work it really has to present its monster to the viewer properly in this film however we only get the briefest glimpses of the monster it seems to sort of resemble the alien from robot monster but i'm not sure as the photography was so dark i simply couldn't make out what the hell was going on a lot of the time although my gut feeling was that i probably wasn't missing very much
<START> don't get fooled by the and the comment below this is just 1 poor movie the way george katt played his character the soft gangster makes it very annoying to watch the conversation in the opening scene is a dramatic display of this de in the rest of the film the character's head seems to be somewhere else his emotions don't match with the things that happen in the film the things he says as a voice over doesn't add anything to the film it just makes zeus an even more spineless character with is head in the clouds br br the story and the film was put together with a total lack of fantasy all parts of the film were poorly stolen from other modern directors let's hope jon will use his own style and ideas for his future films
<START> the whole movie seemed to suffer from poor editing every scene seemed to take forever to unfold and when they did i felt like i had waited a long time for very little to happen i guess i missed the whole point of the movie either that or there wasn't one
<START> this greatest movie gives us clue to the depth of our souls in most deadly moments of our lives my heart is shrinking every time i saw the scene of hanging i have no words any you must see this brilliant picture
<START> i first saw this movie at a video store and being the bam fan i am had to rent it to see what it was all about since i have a huge and stupid note the word stupid sense of humor i found this movie absolutely hilarious some of the parts are pointless and random but that's what makes them so amusing you'll need to think things like getting slapped in the face and bashed on the head with a watermelon are funny in order to appreciate this movie i was really impressed br br i was also surprised at the acting these people actually did a good job nothing oscar worthy but well enough to get past the amateur level teens and young adults would probably find this more entertaining because of the modern slang and situations used i wouldn't suggest watching this with your parents and vice versa br br all in all the acting was great the script was hilarious and the story is really something you can relate to
<START> br br never ever take a film just for its good looking title br br although it all starts well the film suffers the same imperfections you see in b films its like at a certain moment the writer does not any more how to end the film so he ends it in a way nobody suspects it thinking this way he is ingenious br br a film to be listed on top of the garbage list br br
<START> no is a very high rated anime in almost every review page you'll find on the web so i really wanted to know why and i was anything but disappointed br br if you can get past the very bizarre but rather funny first episode you'll find yourself in a very entertaining and much strange world a very well drawn perfectly animated world that is br br i can't tell much of the story without spoiling it so i'll just say that it's a high school comedy and yet it's not i can't really say what it's about really br br seriously i'm a huge anime fan and i've got around 50 full series and i'm not kidding when i say that even though i haven't finished watching it is actually standing in a very high rank in my personal collection i fell in love at first sight with this one and i assure you that at the very least you won't be indifferent to its irresistible charm trust me i don't go around giving a 10 to every thing that i watch
<START> i saw the movie while i was in a class a few years back in high school i thought it was a thought provoking movie that made you want to look into the power behind riddles i think the type of people that wouldn't like this movie would be those who don't like solving things or those who get frustrated when they can't solve riddles its a good movie based on a true story that happened in my home town of toronto ontario so if u want a real record of the things that happen in the alleys there watch this movie and for those who only watch movies to point out plot holes and character flaws realize that in real life this same stuff does happen but thats all i want to say on that the riddles are good some are hard some are not but the movie also leaves you wanting more more riddles more explanation just plainly more something more i want to add is that the ideas within this movie the underground riddle world does exist but there is a lot more to it to find it you can not look for it to never look for it would be no way to find it leave your mark and it will find you
<START> just re saw this last night and to put it bluntly style instead of substance we can already guess that there had to be a lot more to jerry lee lewis than what is depicted here the jerry lee lewis character in this movie is not depicted as a real human being for one minute throughout the entire hour and a half plus running time but then again all the other characters are only one pencil stroke from being total cartoon characters br br let's take the beginning we see jerry lee and his cousin jimmy sneaking over to the black jazz club and we see jerry getting his inspiration might be possible we see how the two cousins choose different paths in life also possible then we cut to jerry lee playing the piano as an adult now played by dennis quaid and it's thrilling and a little scary cut to a scene where he first meets his second cousin myra from then on the whole thing turns into a recap of certain events played out in a style befitting a news reel on high speed br br not that the movie is not a little entertaining and it's great to hear new versions of the songs that made jerry lee alec baldwin as jimmy is also a reason why you should at least take a look at this an indicator of his greater successes in the years to come winona ryder as myra is the most one character in the film she teases she sobs she chews gum and play coquettish and that's about it there is never for a minute given a reason why she ended up being the third mrs lewis and speaking of wives where are the first two that is why this really can't be classified as a biopic but more of a inaccurate news reel we see jerry get his first song played on the radio we see his second single going into the top ten we see his third go to no 1 and so on then comes the inevitable downfall absolutely no basis in reality br br to conclude another minor quarrel the movie takes place from '56 to and still myra says i am only 13 right up till the end
