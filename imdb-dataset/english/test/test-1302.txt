<START> jack webb's movie 'the d i' came about from the real life investigation into the deaths of several trainees in a swamp in paris isle in the 50's as always webb being the patriot that he is came to the defense much like all the rest of his shows i actually found this movie tame by 1957 standards i served in the army and can understand the intensity of the training at parris island camp death by some so this movie can never come close as does 'full metal jacket' i think this is a good movie which is more patriot than it is actual but again think of the time period it was made 1957 and what could be allowed and said on film at that time i have always found jack webb to be clean cut and very loyal i know many have criticized the film as one sided and government propaganda if you feel this way watch 'full metal jacket' with r lee ermey i am a webb fan and enjoy the movie for it's merit not accuracy as i have said webb believed in this country and held institutions to high moral standards lapd dragnet adam 12 emergency etc just sit back and enjoy this one from a very strict moral time period in this country don't be too judgemental of mr webb mark lockwood texas
<START> i love the way he experiments ab tak was a thrill to watch just as much satya and company was the new comer also lived up to his role and nana patekar was at his best was really irritating but i think he fit the character he was playing he had really ugly teeth the story has a great progress and no songs in the movie makes it better i only wish he signs up urmila for his other up coming movies i think they are the best director and actress combination i have seen i have not seen as yet but i am looking forward for it i for some reason don't find that exciting to watch on the screen unlike urmila
<START> what to say about dead end road br br lets just say that edgar allen poe would have been so ashamed the acting writing effects and everything in this movie was just horrendous that doesn't even do justice this movie was the biggest piece of garbage i have ever had to sit through that is also why i stopped it about 20 minutes before the ending because personally i didn't care what happened to the characters i have seen bad but this was definitely the worst i got hyped up for this because i am a fan of poe and this was just bad just bad br br what upsets me more is that you can't rate films with negative numbers
<START> it was the first action movie made in banned in ussr hollywood action style it is not even close to the hollywood action movies of that time the plot is childish the directing is so so this movie succeeded because it was first of its kind in russia even though i watched it many times i have to admit it was kind of naive and i did not like it this is not the best example of russian action movie this is just the first experience
<START> i walk out of very few movie screenings and this movie managed to become one of those that i couldn't bear to watch any longer as far as the awards it won goes the ones awarded by turkish festivals are not credible in my opinion my only explanation for the queens festival award was to think that somehow a layer of comedy was gained in translation as the subtitles helped distract attention from the horrendous performances br br at the beginning of the screening i attended the presenter briefly talked about the history of turkish cinema and at one point mentioned that early turkish cinema was appropriately named stage cinema since many of the filmmakers and actors involved were people from the theater scene br br ironically this movie falls right into that category english speakers reading subtitles may think that turkish is a naturally loud language and attribute all the yelling in the movie to that but observant native commentators will immediately notice that all the actors are performing with exaggerated loud voices you could attribute this to the amateur nature of all actors but the biggest source of yelled out dialog is the main character played by the only professional actor in the movie not surprisingly his background is in theater my guess is that in response to his loud delivery of lines all other amateur actors raised their voices as well hence turning the whole movie into a series of unnatural performances br br put on top of all of this a storyline that develops at a snail's pace you get an extremely boring movie br br i have to say i also have a personal problem with turkish movies that depict entirely rural life with shallow uneducated characters ever since one of the best turkish movies ever made turkish filmmakers seem to be not able to avoid the appeal of the rural part of the country this is only interesting in small doses and if it is as beautifully orchestrated with excellent writing and directing as in most often however it is extremely boring and frankly somewhat embarrassing to native urban turks rural communities make up a neglected part of the country and while this provides good material for comedy it comes at a huge cost to image br br a western audience member whose only exposure to turkey is this movie will undoubtedly think that turkey is like afghanistan i wish filmmakers would realize this and let go of their passion for the stories of the rural man and stay loyal to the majority of the country who live in cities that put metropolitan areas in europe to shame
<START> this excellent musical movie in beautiful technicolor is so wonderful it's enough to make every person of irish descent feel proud full of the joy and celebration of all things irish a fine cast with brilliant settings and superb theatrical trappings lovely irish music and the superlative irish tenor voice of star dennis morgan 'tis the luck o' the irish to have such a marvelous movie to enjoy over and over again not just just for st patty's day mind you but for all year round br br one of the jewels produced by jack l warner during his heyday as studio boss in burbank in the 1940s br br shame on warner brothers for not having this fine picture available on home video and dvd
<START> this film tries to skewer the studio era in hollywood and the morals of the 1950s guy stone is intended to be a rock hudson type but both the script and actor matt end up channeling a smarmy cruel baritone voiced version of george hamilton instead which makes for an unpleasant character br br guy stone is such a reprehensible human being that the audience has trouble liking this waste of human skin unlike hudson who was sweetly promiscuous stone is a hateful person who knowingly uses and then throws away the sweet handsome young men who share his bed every few hours br br veronica cartwright is jerry stone's celibate lesbian manager cartwright is very good but the director doesn't quite know what to do with her the fault lies in the dialogue which is a bit clumsy and the film suffers for it br br carrie preston's sally owes more to ellen greene in the little shop of horrors as written preston's sally is good for a laugh but little else newcomer adam greer is lost in this movie he cannot act and seems to have been cast for his hot body and good looks br br like many recent films straight jacket is a dramedy a comedy film which switches messily to a drama about two thirds of the way through the film and like almost all straight jacket fails miserably br br despite the expensive services of skywalker sound the sound quality of the film leaves a lot of be desired the over use of the musical soundtrack creates a distracting amount of cues as well br br the film really doesn't managed to satirize anything about the 1950s unlike singin' in the rain which perfectly captures hollywood's ambivalence about the advent of sound as well as the studio mentality about formula films straight jacket doesn't manage to depict hollywood in the 1950s at all well the dialogue sets and behavior of the key characters are nondescript rather than dead on stereotypes of the 1950s hollywood the same can be said for the lampooning of the general mores social trends and fads of the 1950s as a whole compare the transformation of guy's home to the dead on satire of the 1950s home in little shop of horrors there is no comparison little shop hits the nail on the head while straight jacket doesn't even know there is a nail br br motivations too seem haphazard rick foster is supposed to be a principled liberal yet he falls almost immediately for a materialistic schmuck like guy stone rick is fine with guy's closeted status for many months but when it comes time to go to italy he becomes conflicted for reasons that are completely unclear and even though sally appears to fall in love with freddie during the party this plot point simply disappears a few minutes later without comment rick comes off like a gay man from the 1990s not a gay author of the 1950s indeed modern morality this film which it shouldn't if it were really a satirical look at homophobia in 1950s hollywood br br plot holes in this ragtag film also abound saul repeatedly says that he's going to turn freddie stevens over to the feds but never does so allowing freddie to out guy jerry and saul's plot to in guy never makes any sense nor does sally's sudden decision to take the blame and although guy has admitted he is a homosexual apparently it doesn't matter and he ends up a famous star and playwright anyway br br unfortunately none of the production values manage to save this film the cinematography by michael is pedestrian at times the film almost looks like a filmed play rather than a motion picture especially the scenes in saul's office everything is restricted to medium shots and the film has an incredibly static the editing by chris doesn't do the film any help either long scenes which would benefit from the insertion of close ups or shifts in point of view remain uncut whether this is due to lack of coverage or bad editing is not clear but the overall effect is to create a sense of lethargy br br the film relies heavily on cgi effects of guy's home created by visual effect designer thomas dickens but the cgi looks clumsy and hokey and it is very noticeably amateurish br br my overall impression of this film is that the jokes are cheap and easy the plot muddled the characterizations wildly inconsistent and way off the mark the satire nonexistent the performances overbroad and off the mark and the comic timing off it's almost an amateurish film it is as if someone took a high school production and threw 10 million at it
<START> sex drugs rock roll is without a doubt the worst product of western civilization the monologues are both uninteresting and pointless in the rare monologue that captures the audience's attention it is quickly lost through overly long repetition and unnecessary additions the hells angels at mcdonalds comes to mind i guess one man show needed some filler material to give a length that he thought justified the price of admission br br i would rather sleep with my aunt and be hung upside down and drained of my blood than see sex drugs rock roll again
<START> charles chic sales is absolutely terrific as the sole member of the family willing to testify against a gangster they saw murder a policeman and an informant he fought at bull run in the civil war and his patriotism runs high even after his son in law is beaten and one of his grandson's is kidnapped by the gang intimidating all the other members fear of his grandson's death is no excuse he says he wouldn't want his grandson living in a country run by gangsters anyway the conflict between civic duty and personal safety is driven home sharply in this oscar nominated story walter huston is also a standout as the hard driving district attorney threatening the family with perjury if they don't back up their identification of the killer in court the rest of the cast including the sleazy killer ralph ince are all excellent and the film is snappily directed by william a wellman there's also good suspense as sales disappears just as the trial is about to begin
<START> the comments of the previous user are harsh indeed one wonders if they have even seen this beautiful sweet film as for being so nasty about it in front of the writer director well thats just plain rude for those who grew up in the eighties it is an artful piece of nostalgia and a sweet story well acted and produced irish film making sure has a lot of bitter angry people involved with it and the spleen venting comment made about this is evidence of it as people we have a choice give out and moan about the people who actually go out there and make stuff or make something yourself i know which one is easier do yourself a favour and watch this film and see how a short film is made you won't be disappointed
<START> this is one of the funniest shows on tv today it hits the mark 99 of the time usually after watching a sitcom after a few years the actors become to cartoonish as if they are trying to become the beloved characters they play these actors have in my opinion stayed true to their roles the chemistry is still there the writing has not gone down and i still look forward to watching it the family dynamic still seems real and the situations after all this time are not so far fetched to make it seem the writers are reaching into an empty bag trying to keep the show on for one more season it is one of the few shows i watch without the remote in my hand for quick switching
<START> without a doubt this is the worse movie every made period yes it's worse then dolph lundgren's 1989 punisher yup worse then the 1979 1991 captain america movies oh yeah it's even worse then christopher reed scripted superman iv quest for peace movie that movie was so bad that the guy who played nuclear man only starred in one other film and it was only on t v op br br this movie is d quality i had a chance to watch it on the scifi channel back in 1997 i had heard it was pretty bad but had nothing else to do that night so i figured i check it out what a waste of an hour and a half i would have been better off watching reruns of different strokes besides having the lamest special effects and worse acting i've ever seen the whole script was just awful and not well directed at all thankfully a new fantastic four movie is being done and hopefully this version will do the heroes justice i was hoping for a new spawn movie in the future but it has yet to materialize br br do not rent this movie if you happen to see it being televised on cable check it out be warned though you'll most like be flipping the channel after the first 15 mins
<START> this movie examines the now infamous conference where top nazis gathered to discuss the organisation and implementation of the final solution first off i want to say i was amazed to see kenneth branagh play a nazi with the slicked back blonde hair he certainly looked the part but he didn't really act the part well there was none of the menace cruelty and in the end he came out looking like a grinning cheerleader keeping the meeting going the real would not have let the conference get out of control the way it did in the film br br the best performance of all was undoubtedly colin firth who played dr william the man who wrote the 1935 nuremberg race laws and who gave legal to everything the nazis did firth's performance was stunning the main vocal opponent to what was proposing the best part of all was when he was verbally dressing down one of the nazi thugs the thug muttered i'll remember you and firth replies you should i'm very well known the film is historically accurate but let's boil it down to what it really is 90 minutes of a group of men around a table discussing shouting and bragging there's no excitement no real conflicts except the brief argument it's just 90 minutes of talking same room same table same people br br i'm not sure if the dvd is worth the money i for one felt short changed
<START> a sparkling movie bb is a marvel she's sultry she is a feminist she is still very much in love br br the movie features paris in the 50's it is wonderful to look at the sites the cars ds and br br a simple but very enjoyable romantic comedy the music is horrendous it almost on the other hand it is hilarious but it is probably the only thing amiss at least looking at it with 21st century eyes br br the movie comments on the french manner of treating infidelity it is that sense modern a movie like un elephant se did it in an 80's way but the basic premise stays the the same br br thanks to makers for providing bb with this opportunity
<START> this movie was probably one of the worst movies i've seen in a very long time a friend of mine grabbed it off the shelf at the video rental store and all but forced me to watch it an action we both deeply regret ehh where to start the writing the acting the quality all of it sucked br br quite possibly some of the worst writing ever displayed in a movie the dialog was worse than i thought it could ever be in the movies blatant dialog such as how ya doing not that great doc directly after an attempted exorcism of a man's daughter and then his wife's attempted suicide of course he's not that great was at some points kind of funny if not horribly written planned out and obvious the general plot of the movie the writing and the way it worked horrible it was like the writers could come up with nothing better to do then write a bunch of crappy dialog and throw in as many sex and nudity scenes as they randomly could the only almost good sex scene between the preacher and the tattooed girl was filmed with such poor quality that it looked more like a cheap porno than a feature film oh yeah and they never actually got the deed done br br the acting horrible i think the only good actor was the short spanish guy who played miguel del and his part was written horribly the worst acting arguably paul whose acting combined with shitty music a gun and a half naked bluish white girl running around in the woods made the movie almost unbearable to sit through he even screwed up his own death scene one that should have been easy to nail although most everybody else's acting was horrible as well br br the lack of characters also added to the overall suck level of the movie there were just enough characters so that almost half of the characters died that same amount of people became possessed at one point and then the remaining characters couldn't be counted on one hand like 50 thumbs down br br p s what is it with the climax of exorcism movies happening in a stable anyways
