<START> it purports to be the life of paul the apostle it opens with him involved in a loin cloth wrestling match with a priest the pharisees were called that because they separated themselves from the being forced upon the jews by their gentile rulers the point is that saul would never have been involved in greco roman wrestling period br br then we have the two men saul and the priest reuben a totally extra biblical fictitious character shown being washed down in the nude in a roman style bath house again the torah which saul adhered to religiously condemned in the strongest possible terms looking upon the nakedness of another man br br reuben is shown being the one that pushes saul into destroying the church again the text of scripture doesn't matter for their it is paul that says that he laid waste of the church and breathed out and slaughter against the church br br the movie shows sprinkling paul not immersing him when the text of scripture says it was that did it br br their is no mention of mark or his turning back so the writers of the script are forced to have paul and argue over paul's desire to preach in rome as the basis of their separation br br no silas on paul's second and third missions no timothy ever no titus no no no noooo james is said to have known jesus for a long time rather than it saying as the text of scripture does that he is jesus' brother br br why not just call the movie frank the fictitious apostle at least that would be closer to the text of scripture
<START> elizabeth ashley is receiving phone calls from her nephew michael he's crying screaming and asking for help the problem is michael died 15 years ago br br this film scared me silly back in 1972 when it aired on abc seeing it again years later it still works br br the movie is a little slow and predictable the deaths are very tame and there's a tacked on happy ending but this is a tv movie so you have to give it room elizabeth ashley is excellent ben gazzara is ok and it's fun to see michael douglas so young and those telephone calls still scare the living daylights out of me i actually had to turn a light on during one of them br br a creepy little tv movie worth seeing
<START> garden state must rate amongst the most contrived and pretentious films of all time the plot is a simple one involving a young man returning home after his mother's death and discovering love but really the plot isn't important what is important to zach writer director and star Â is that he is able to hang from the plot all the necessary of an or 'arty' film we therefore are presented with endless cute and quirky characters and scenes that don't exist for reasons of plot or character development but simply to give some artistic credibility to the film Ã  la wes anderson or so hopes unfortunately and somewhat astonishingly has not only fooled many on imdb but also some critics who really ought to have known better br br of course gratuitous use of the quirky alone does not make garden state a bad film what really makes garden state a stinker is script he simply does not have the writing skills to carry this film off and the dialogue and characterisation are abysmal often has to resort to blunt devises and symbolism to achieve what he can't achieve through the writing for example the numbness of the character is shown to us by his indifference to an impending plane crash this can't be worked into the plot and so has to take place in a dream later he is shown fighting back against his circumstances by screaming into a bottomless abyss life a bottomless abyss very clever mr those two scenes must rank amongst the most ludicrous and contrived ever seen on a cinema screen br br on the plus side the acting is passable despite the lack of material for the cast to work with by which i mean a script and i do admire natalie portman for her efforts as the love interest a character so badly written and implausible that she is little more than a mindless doll that moulds into his fantasy woman br br it apparently took 3 years to write the script for garden state 3 years to write a script this bad he really is inept hopefully therefore it will be some time before he makes another film
<START> how much longer are we to persist with this flawed belief that once a director produces great ground breaking work all future work can't be all that bad after all he made such and such br br mulholland drive is a case in point and is in fact unmitigated rubbish the performances are excellent particularly from watts and theroux but a good film they do not necessarily make what lynch has clearly forgotten is that just making a film unnecessarily wierd only works when it takes the audience by surprise when the audience is expecting the film to not make sense then the film has to have some substance to keep the audience interested lynch succeeds in the first half of the film with the murder mystery set up with lots of twists and red herrings and then plop the story into a quagmire of bizarre and pointless segues methinks lynch realised how muddled the film was becoming and threw in the lesbian and scenes to the audience awake and to stop the male viewers from standing up and leaving br br watching the film at the preview i was surrounded by who had no more idea of what was going on than i did but left the theatre commenting on the layers and layers of lynch's film making excuse me but these people are the same nitwits who stand in art galleries staring at that have been painted white commenting on the courage of the artist at painting such a brave work br br films like these are made because a lynch is trading on his previous work and b because people convince themselves that film is art and therefore must be good i a number of the about what they actually liked in the film and only response i recieved that wasn't a broad layers type of answer was that they liked it when the chicks got their kit off br br nuff said
<START> i'm sure some people will enjoy it and find it powerful or have some sort of personal connection with the characters and story but from an unbiased stand point it's not very well done the film revolves around atypical angst ridden teenagers each one playing out a different stereotype making us believe this is what it's like to be a teenager we get to see a bit of each teenager's lifestyle but the entire project just came off as pretentious to me whether it be the constant low angle shots of tree branches in the wind or the black and white interviews with the students there was nothing new or original showcased in this movie and nothing i needed to see yes it deals with some strong subject material and the dramatic scenes are played and acted well but the entire project seems unnecessary especially when it seems almost an exact replica to van sant's elephant one dealing with suicide the other with a school shooting as i said some people will probably enjoy this and the director writer clearly had some sort of inspiration to make this movie based on the death of a close one so it's nice the movie was made with some heart in it but i feel it's incredibly ineffective and when dealing with material that can be so easily clichÃ©d to do something original with it i would not recommend this movie
<START> if you are a bit masochistic and like to waste some time you should try this one i wasted enough time myself watching it so i will waste no more explaining why it is so awful be warned oh i see that i have to fill 10 lines or more here we go every year or so some people think it is fun to start shooting a low budget film about the scary monsters of the underground that hopefully will prove to be some sort of a hit the cavern is one of those i didn't have high expectations about this one but the acting is so bad and the production so poor that i'm seriously thinking of asking for a refund one more line about a useless movie oh i'm done
<START> being from the buffalo area i was well aware of the movie having read many articles in local publications i was most impressed with the movie especially its clever plot the acting and the local scenes nice to see so many older quality stars in the various roles i feel that especially those of us over 50 will find the movie excellent and you can leave the theater feeling that your time was well spent
<START> all i can do is laugh wow i like jim movies i really do i mean chopping mall is a classic but this what happened to this guy he used to make funny horror movies that tried to be good but this was hardly even funny i mean i guess it was because i laughed the villain is incredible i mean horrible cgi it looks terrible and the movie has no gore and no nudity as redeeming qualities it is rated pg 13 a movie named bone eater you know won't be a blockbuster movie you know it probably won't have a smart script a movie like this may rely on gore but no it doesn't rely on anything really it's just crap check it out if you want to laugh though but don't expect a good movie i hope jim wynorski goes back to movies like chopping mall and ghoulies iv because this and komodo vs cobra ain't cutting it
<START> ted made a lot of great horror and fantasy films i am looking for all his films to see i could not find this one for 3 year until i unexpectedly found it in youtube to tell the truth i wanted to see more ghosts and less talks here it looks like in 1999 2001 ted had a crisis maybe in money his features of this time look more like real low budget thrash z garbage movies but i do not claim him to be a bad director this time everything happens the ending has some nice creepy details and suspense but the whole film was long dull dialogues br br only for real ted's fans br br www myspace com
<START> some movies are off beat but enjoyable but many movies are just mind numbingly weird fits not so nicely in the latter category many seem to like it because of endless guest appearances and a total lack of sense but those two things can only take a movie so far and simply doesn't have any other merits to its credit br br delights itself on plot improbabilities its main character gus is a cussing 10 year old on a roadtrip across an imaginary country trying to collect game pieces to win 500 million when interacting with adult figures none of them seem to notice or be concerned with the fact that he's 10 years old at first it's incredibly funny but it quickly becomes just too unbelievable especially considering the people he runs into and the fact that he seems so unfazed by a lot of the disturbing to someone that age imagery going on around him gus has no depth and as an anti hero who has no problem causing misery for others to get his game pieces it's hard to feel sorry for him when he encounters trouble br br that trouble is provided by a slew of guest appearances each mistreating gus in more and more strange ways besides making the already worn out plot even more unbelievable and less enjoyable the characters share lack of depth and are equally unmemorable the character's actions can get a little interesting but the actors themselves don't add anything to them thus negating the whole point of getting big names they could've been played by anyone and the character would've been the same these guest appearances seem to have been signed more for marquee value than anything else br br should be interesting it's a unique idea but there's too little semblance of sense in the script for it to work incidents that should have a lasting effect on the anti hero and the viewer don't as the movie quickly moves from incident to incident in the hope that something will eventually make the audience feel sorry or understanding for gus that never happens as by doing so nothing is allowed to connect it just jerks back and forth as if on a conveyor belt one incident after another with a story so nonsensical it ceases to be enjoyable and a main character who never evolves to care for himself or anyone else on a higher level has little to offer except a brat sneaking around and trying to get rich why should we care about that
<START> after having problems in chicago the solomon family moves to a remote north dakota farmhouse to start anew but their attempts at an idyllic farming life is disrupted when their teen daughter jess kristen stewart and her 3 year old brother ben start seeing and being attacked by supernatural beings who won't allow them to live in peace br br the starts off decently although it eventually becomes a generic horror film that's a lot more humorous than frightening after reading the premise i thought this could have been a decent movie since it sounded creepy and it held potential unfortunately the film didn't live up to its potential although i should have expected this since the trailer was awful the screenplay was probably the worst part about it it was full of silly sequences and bland dialog the characters were not developed at all and most of them were acting like a bunch of idiots so it was hard to feel sympathy for them br br the directors did a horrible job at building up suspense they mainly relied on cheap scares like loud noises and random jumps the music was really over the top and it just made it easier for the viewer to telegraph the next scary moment i also didn't like how they pretty much just used one location for the whole movie the house was the centerpiece of the story and that's where the majority of the filming took place so it got a little boring after awhile to see the same area also i didn't like the close ups of the actors during a conversation the camera would continually jerk from character to another in the span of five seconds and it got really annoying the directors did create a decent atmosphere and they do get some points for making their movie stylish however since we have come a long way in terms of style and effects it's not really that hard to make your movie look nice especially if you are working on a hollywood film br br the acting was atrocious and if this movie had been released in december i'm sure it would have received several razzie nominations kristen stewart showed some talent in panic room but you wouldn't be able to tell she has talent by watching her performance in the she was okay at acting scared and that's it the rest of the time she was dry and unconvincing penelope anne miller was just awful when it came to everything it sounded like she was reading her lines and she had some of the worst facial expressions i have ever seen dylan mcdermott was just very wooden and he showed almost no emotion john corbett gave the best performance and he had a couple of good scenes the twins who played ben were also decent and managed to out act many of the adult actors overall this lame horror film is not worth watching because of it's blandness and lazy film making rating 4 10
<START> pretty pictures with a cool sound track do not constitute a 'movie' like all pop promos pretentions are are outdone only by its' unjustifiable budget one dollar spent on this aimless purposeless dross was one dollar too many stick to penning pop songs bono
<START> everyone told me this movie was downright not good and sick etc so i finally rented it and i was amazed i thought the torture was gonna be much much worse but it did get shocking near the end but that was about it i wouldn't call it a horror movie maybe a mystery or something under the category of silence of the lambs and or kiss the girls it did get stupid at times but the rest of the movie kept me on the edge of my seat 7 10 br br rated r for strong torture violence language and sexuality
<START> i'm really surprised seeing all these positive reviews for this movie don't get me wrong it's not that i don't like kind of movies' br br while i very well can enjoy a good mindless hollywood action blockbuster like die hard 4 0 i like the 'dogma' kind of movies or 'real life as it is' movies just as much if they are well made br br a good example is 1998 no music no dramatic camera angles no special fx no fancy locations just a good story combined with excellent acting and the result is an excellent movie br br is nine lives devoid of dramatic camera angles special fx and fancy locations yes is it a good movie i'm glad you asked br br the answer is absolutely not br br first of all everyone is raving about the acting performances i'm terribly sorry but you can act all you want but if the story and the dialogue is not believable the acting falls on its behind immediately and that is exactly the case with nine lives br br not once did i have the feeling while watching 'nine lives' that i was watching real people having a real conversation i had the feeling i was watching actors trying to come across as 'real characters' while they were were saying things a 'real person' would never say under the circumstances br br you can hardly call it a spoiler but there are some dialogue excerpts below if you think that reading ten lines of ridiculous dialogue will ruin your movie experience stop reading here if you want a good laugh continue reading br br the dialogue was often so ridiculous that it was tragical you want examples plenty of those in 'nine lives' br br br br picture this couple visits their filthy rich friends in their new mansion woman sees this castle of a house and says to her husband br br woman i could get used to this meaning the expensive house man don't woman why not it could be man no they are who they are and we are who we are woman i like the sound of that we are who we are br br she likes the sound of that her man is acting like a jerk but she likes the sound of that then an elderly couple walks past them holding hands this is what the woman comes up with br br woman look they are like children after school they lived through so much shared everything i love you br br they are like children after school and then the most overused clichÃ© lines you ever heard finishing with 'i love you' she says this while her man is being a jerk to her yes very logical very realistic not if anything this kind of dialogue made me wanna strangle some of the characters in the movie for saying these horrible horrible things br br example 2 br br elderly mom dad and younger daughter at a funeral dad i didn't realize andrew was religious mom it's for comfort daughter it's for strength mom life is fleeting dad and daughter burst out laughing br br yeah this one liner cracks me up any time especially at a funeral sorry i must have missed the joke here br br and it goes on and on and on br br how about the camera work don't even go there would be a compliment it supposed to come across as 'realistic' instead you miss half of the actors facial expressions the only thing left to watch in this movie while half the time the camera is aimed at someone's back or side instead of the face br br conclusion well don't say i didn't warn you it's a good movie to rent if you want to make out with your date or something during the movie because you won't even care whether the movie is playing or not after the first five minutes br br overrated and more boring than watching grass grow kinda sums it up
<START> the story starts off in the home of a little girl who is going to have a birthday party and both the mother and father seemed to act rather quiet and reserved with each other they proceed to give their daughter her present which is from both of them and it stuck me funny the expressions on the two parents faces as they gave their child this gift it was almost like 'i hope she likes it' there is a killing in the film and catherine mary stewart julia reaper 2000 gets involved with the case because of family ties julia is working hard to become a doctor and this particular murder disrupts her entire life rob lowe kevin finney view from the top 03 is a next door neighbor in the same apartment dwelling as julia and he eventually goes to bed with her and tries to help her in other ways this is not a bad film but it is certainly nothing to go crazy about unless you like a film location in canada and a good looking catherine mary stewart a native from canada
