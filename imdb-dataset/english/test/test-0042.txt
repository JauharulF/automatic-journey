<START> this seventh yes you read right the seventh puppet master movie shows how the demented group of dolls came to be by a french puppeteer who uses them to get revenge on a group of ancient mummies who are after him once they learn that he holds the secret to life it was taught to him by a sorcerer also on the run before he died he used this power to bring normal puppets to life this sequel is basically nonsense sprinkled upon even more nonsense like most of the puppet master sequels due to the pg13 rating we don't even get any entertaining puppet murders come to think of it there are no damn puppet murders if there was one franchise that needed to be cut off it would be this one no more god please no more
<START> i am a huge rupert everett fan i adore kathy bates so when i saw it available i decided to check it out the synopsis didn't really tell you much in parts it was silly touching and in others some parts were down right hysterical br br any person that is a huge fan of a personality of any type will find some small identifying traits with the main character of course there are many they won't but that is the point br br if you like any of the actors give it a watch but don't look for any thing too dramatic it's good fun br br i might also mention you can see how darn tall rupert is i mean i knew he was but he seems even more in this film he even seemed to stoop a bit due to the other characters height in this he is tall i mean tall and for you rupert fans there is a bare chest scene wonderful
<START> i just viewed eddie monroe and i was very impressed the story was easily paced as the plot unraveled to a surprise ending heartwarming performances action humor and drama filled the screen topnotch acting by some talented long islanders great script this is the best film that fred carpenter has made to date he should be very proud of this work doug brown's score is on the mark craig morris is the next tom cruise or brad pitt hard to believe this is a low budget independent film just imagine what carpenter can do with a hollywood level budget paul last film and he is greatly missed and loved by all he was a wonderful successful talented actor and a great human being he will watch over us all and we will never forget his dynamic smile and spirit great job to all who participated in this film a few cherished scene stealing and humorous cameos to break up the serious content you will enjoy this film go see it
<START> journalist bob blistering scattershot and sometimes suspect account of actor john belushi's rise and fall becomes a wholly misjudged movie a nebulous fantasy directed by larry as if he were doing something edgy and vital michael chiklis years before his breakthrough on the shield is put in the unenviable position of portraying belushi taking a post mortem trip through his life recreating those saturday night live skits which are now part of tv history it's like watching someone try to out lucy lucille ball it can't be done the reason why there was such sorrow at belushi's death was because he was one of a kind chiklis makes a commendable attempt at looking the part and he's funny in an early scene trying to escape from the morgue still it's an uphill venture and no actor no matter how talented could have saved it from
<START> it starts quite good but after a while you start to expect more from this film than you are actually getting everything becomes unclear and unclear it stays czech filmmakers were good 20 or more years ago but after they transfered to capitalistic country here it is czech unofficial but well known mentality copying copying copying of everything they consider good when they see it in another movies or countries or elsewhere i think that this is a good example of making art and politics and horror and humor and film and money and it remains me of the one flew over the cuckoo's nest which can not be compared to this film in the way of art and actors and story and politics i think this film is boring it could be done better at least they tried sorry guys not recommend
<START> the only reason i am giving a second star is for the first half of the movie this was a good rendition of the story i enjoy seeing a few fictional characters added to add some color to a well known story but the second half was horrible yes there were violent aspects of this story but the writers of this movie chose to only include the violence and forget about the good things god did for the israelites towards the end of the movie scott looked as though he were getting messages from the big giant head instead of talking and hearing from god this rendition had some huge problems with deviation from scripture and big surprise there are no favorable deviations their portrayal of moses as this screaming naked lunatic who did all of this against his will is totally false it showed a moses who had to scream in order to get god to talk to him wrong the scripture says god spoke to moses all the time and not just after a temper tantrum they got the people's complaining right but failed to show that god spoke to moses at in an audible voice that the followers could hear and believe chapter 19 they also forgot the pillar of fire and cloud which guided them in the day and night br br what was the whole joshua thing the righteous peace loving jew who would not fight until moses threatens him wrong he was known as a great warrior what about the great speech that moses gave the army telling them god had helped them enough and now they were on their own wrong they only won through god's help as shown in their own scenes with moses lifting his staff and what was that sorry looking ark of the covenant instead of it with gold this movie was on a tight budget and attached little gold chips to it oh yeah it was a molten calf not a straw one with little chips tacked on someone forgot that they came out of egypt with a huge amount of gold tribute from the egyptians you wouldn't know it from this sorry looking bunch br br by the way the part about them slaying the israelites after the golden calf incident says men and does not mention women and children which the movie delighted in showing the viewers oh yeah manna wasn't the only thing sent from heaven don't forget the birds for meat also the bible mentions jethro bringing moses his wife and children and then says jethro went back to his own land it does not say that moses gave up his family br br oh well if you know nothing about the real story read exodus for yourself if you know the real story you will hate this version
<START> as a writing teacher there are two ending i never allow my students to use then i woke up and then i got run over by a truck i am now going to add then i got a bump on the head i feel it's utterly unfair to use these tricks to cover up a lack of imagination the whole issue of could have been handled with some intelligence and craft yet in this film they either couldn't or wouldn't do that i'm not saying it's totally worthless but it is so predictable in its progress except for the stupid ending there are even gangsters who go to the police to get help from this guy they should have done him in immediately it's just a forgettable borderline horror sci fi film with nothing new to offer
<START> in an early scene luca david and james jeff are walking down a neighborhood street in chicago admiring the bucolic architecture when a woman angrily arguing in french on a cell phone passes by them prompting james to remark there's nothing hotter than an angry french woman a few blocks later they pass an old filipino woman also angry also arguing on a cell phone and luca remarks for referential effect there's nothing hotter than an angry elderly filipino woman br br the humor in jeff i want someone to eat cheese with is best characterized by the word quotidian the film is a conversation we might as well be eavesdropping rather than go for antics the film relies on character flaws and human curiosity to deliver laughs while it's not innovative it is far from banal and even if james views himself as being rather jejune we know that he is fairly average and this him br br self betterment is the primary theme of the movie sarah silverman who plays beth is excellent as the catalyst of change she revitalizes james and so reminds him to live a better life even so achieving some idyllic dream is not the end of these characters but rather something simpler that they might pick up what pieces there are of the life they love just to keep for themselves at least enough to carry on br br a movie about life lessons can be overwrought as it can forget to connect with its audience i want someone to eat cheese with is subtle and winsome and while its moral may not be inspiring it is still resonant this is low key comedy but it will stick with you
<START> what could possibly go wrong with a movie that includes a bunch of italians pretending to be and some vague lava octopus crustacean thingy as the hell induced hellspawn devil fish br br everything is what goes wrong i tell you br br this is a very good mst3k episode because the heckling in right on the ball which without fault is easy to do considering this movie is a piece of junk with a lousy and boring plot br br 9 10 for version 1 10 for un version br br
<START> milo is a complete rip off of the 1992 slasher flick mikey if you actually check it up both films have the same tagline but if you want to watch an incredibly funny film with absolutely no plot whatsoever well then this is the film for you the acting is terrible and the flashback scenes are overwhelmingly confusing the story behind this atrocity is simple milo is a kid with serious family problems his father is an abortion doctor who keeps unborn in a jar nice and was desperate for a child of his own he figured out a way to bring one of these aborted children to life and he named him milo br br aside from all the bad acting terrible directing annoying sound of milo's voice and the ear piercing sound of the bell on his bike if you take away all that badness its still a bad but funny attempt at a film br br i'll give it a bank busting 1 out of 10

<START> yeesh talk about craptastic this thing is brutal horrible voice dubbing even more horrible acting and no discernible plot apparently there are some great chase scenes but the problem is you have to get to that point first and i just couldn't the 20 or so minutes i endured felt more like a root canal than a movie i suppose i could have fast forwarded it and i recommend you do the same unless you have very extreme pain tolerance or your a masochist i don't fall into either category i still have a migraine from this thing so i'm about to perform some dental surgery without anesthetic just relive the migraine bottom line horrendous 0 10
