<START> not many people remember the carey treatment and i can't say i blame them br br blake edwards did this during his lean years i e between pink panther movies and for a story of a doctor turned detective coburn working to solve a murder in his hospital it's actually pretty forgettable br br coburn is dependable as always and o'neill is beautiful as always but there just seems to be something missing from the proceedings the story twists and turns aren't very involving and even the climax which is supposed to be nerve wracking is gut wrenching instead br br a missed opportunity altogether and an unfortunate one at that since it was based on a michael crichton book br br oh well at least crichton didn't write a sequel to it br br one star carey on coburn
<START> the story of tom garner opens with his grand funeral and is told through a series of elegant flashbacks narrated by his faithful lifetime friend henry henry and his wife debate whether tom was a great man and a genius or an utterly worthless scoundrel the film is beautifully written acted and directed and i highly recommend it br br tom was the fabulously rich and successful owner of a large railroad dominating his board of directors and his competition terrorizing his employees slaughtering tom's ambitious wife sally was responsible for all of tom's success when he met her he was illiterate and entirely content with his work as a for the railroad sally teaches him to read and takes over his job while tom goes to school he starts to rise one step at a time through the railroad hierarchy until he eventually takes over as president br br but as tom becomes a business tycoon his marriage to sally gradually falls to pieces his spoiled son despises him and he takes up with a much younger woman the aptly named eve with predictably catastrophic consequences in his business life tom is a total success in his personal life a disastrous failure much like the hearst figure in citizen kane tom symbolizes the best and the worst of the capitalist system br br spencer tracy is terrific in the role of tom garner and the business scenes ring with authenticity colleen moore is also excellent as sally both of them age beautifully in the multi generational story the film was written by preston sturges but is nothing like the screwball comedies for which sturges became famous
<START> this movie was playing on lifetime movie network last month and i decided to check it out i watched for the first 20 minutes and then shut it off b c i am sorry but plot holes that are integral to a movie's plot make the movie nothing but garbage br br the movie is about a woman who accidentally runs a child on a bicycle off the road leaves to get help returns only to find out that it's being called a hit and run and there's a hunt for the 'monster' that hurt in the end killed her br br this is a movie about a female in an affluent neighborhood who has 2 small grade school children and who is an active sociable woman and yet in order for this movie to work it needs to be believable that she does not own a cell phone sorry but that's complete bs especially when everyone else seems to have one they used theirs to call 911 when they found the girl lying on the side of the road when our lead female left the scene of the crime to go phone 911 at some when the lead female comes back the ambulance is already at the girl's side and there is chatter about how horrible the person is who hit and left her br br just dumb sorry but i am not willing buy that this woman doesn't own a cell phone which is needed for the movie to work please don't insult my intelligence movie thanks maybe if this took place in 1970 or 1960 i'd buy it but it's clearly a present day 1999 at the time movie but wait if she had a cell phone there would be no movie pfft br br the woman clearly knows about technology since she had computers in her house ones the kids played games on so all the movie had to do was make her cell phone dead in the car making her resort to another way to call the cops leaving out a cell phone altogether just created a ridiculous plot
<START> my wife and i both remembered this film being a lot better than it is when we rented it last weekend we wondered if we were watching the same movie we had seen 22 years or so ago we both agreed that we were probably remembering the tv series which in its one hour segments was compelled to actually wrap up plot lines this movie leaves many loose threads as has been mentioned by others here basically every main character's story line is left unresolved br br gotta like the title song though
<START> i loved this show i think the first time i tried rocky road ice cream was due to this show wasn't the shop located like right on the beach or something i actually wrote back and forth with marci for several years i lost touch and wish i could reconnect now as adults anyone know where she is now i wish they would put it out on dvd i seriously doubt that since i think there maybe like five or six people who even remember the show airing in the first place they just don't make shows like this anymore do they i wonder if it would still hold up in this day and age do you guys know anyone that could burn dvd's of the show they taped on vhs i'd be willing to pay within reason
<START> another slice of darkness and denial hiding beneath the surface of american suburbia imaginary heroes chronicles the lives of the travis family all recovering following the suicide of their eldest son br br the pair at the center of the film is mother and son sandy sigourney weaver and tim emile hirsch both acting out in different ways as a result of the death while tim experiments with prescription medication and his own sexuality sandy regresses to her former self smoking marijuana and coming to terms with an old act of infidelity br br the relationship between sandy and tim is explored well especially when references are made to both of them being outcast from their own family sandy due to her affair and tim initially due to always being in the shadow of his more successful older brother considerably less time is allowed for sandy's husband ben jeff daniels who in a devastating depiction of denial orders sandy to make an additional plate of food for his dead son and place it in his old spot at the dinner table michelle williams' older sister penny is underwritten and could easily be taken out of the film br br despite its long runtime imaginary heroes doesn't explore its many subplots as much as the individual stories deserve while some of the movie's black comedy doesn't translate as well as writer director dan harris may have liked and the depiction of a disturbed family dynamic isn't depicted as strongly as the many other films out there with similar ideas but despite some issues the central performances from weaver and hirsch are stunning and easily carry the film to its successfully subdued conclusion br br rating b
<START> sorry about that but if you have seen this epic you will obviously know of the utter disregard for the actual text of the bible now i'm not exactly the next in line for sainthood but i do know the basics and the basics were this god wanted to wipe everyone of the face of the earth because he believed they have been corrupted to the point of no return he chose noah the diamond in the rough and his family to be spared due to their ways noah builds an ark as instructed by god to house he his family and two of every creature while he floods the rest of the planet those are the basics in this movie you have other people roaming around the seas such as peddlers and pirates but i thought that everyone was wiped out i guess the executives at nbc have never been to church there are other inaccuracies i'm told but being the average joe i have no idea what they are sorry back to the movie it was inaccurate as stated before the acting stunk but some of the effects were good i'll give it that but as a whole i've seen a better and more tasteful rendition of the story done as a little scene on the simpsons god help the nbc executives come judgement day 3 10
<START> kevin spacey is my favorite actor of all time he is without a doubt on other's lists as well when it comes to great actors he even pulled off a good irish accent in ordinary decent criminal as well but kevin spacey as a mafia leader or even a burglar i'm not so sure he could go that far the movie to me just didn't make any sense and the some of the story just didn't feel solved to me br br i know once again that imdb is going to make me write ten more lines but i'm not so sure on what i could say about this movie because i am still trying to figure it out silly isn't it but i'm pretty sure that more than a few of you imdb users have been in the same predicament as i am in right now where you just want to say a line or two about a movie but now you have to do ten lines wow that should do it d br br 3 10
<START> sean connery is very good as the great lord of the rif and defender of the faithful this is an adventure movie with arabs germans and the usmc all coming to grips at one point or another there is also a lot of humor in the interplay among the main and supporting characters the story is based on the true incident in which a wealthy greek american businessman was kidnapped by the in the early 1900s milius has substituted candace bergen and her two children as the victims of the kidnapping and this opens the story to a lot of literary license br br on the other hand the movie gives milius the opportunity to remind the viewer of two of the most famous though mostly forgotten political quotations of the tr era brian keith very good as tr says alive or the dead and john huston also good as sec of state john hay asks the japanese ambassador at a white house dinner you you
<START> this film got roasted by the boys at mst3k but it's actually a neat and nasty piece of low budget film noir the plot is tight the characters are believable within the good boy gets obsessed with bad girl genre the pacing is solid the climax is well handled and the cast is bolstered by several fine character actors true most of the time you want to hit the protagonist with a brick but he's actually quite effectively creepy when he plays the mastermind the scenes between him and his dad are quite powerful in a minimalist kind of way sure it's depressing but that's the point good movie
<START> this is a very moving film that takes a new twist on somewhere we've all been a relationship as it's about to end kristen thomson's performance as tessa desperately trying to hold onto her connection with bobby for just one more day is extremely convincing and moving and takes you right into the story who hasn't been faced with the end of a relationship and at least wanted to shout out tearfully just one more night when he does give her one more night the journey that these two people share makes you pause and think about how precious every truly close relationship can be and how each one whether permanent or not should be treated with respect rather than simply thrown away
<START> yes we all know about dan schneider's odd little fascination with making shows with young kids and is no exception see young girls wiggle their toes and stick their tongues out for the camera and wear skimpy clothes and bikini's yes it makes you wonder if these shows were made for teens or for some older degenerate crowd either way the show isn't that good when compared to dan other shows like the far superior amanda show drake and josh br br the show is about a brother and sister carly and spencer living alone and having to get by on their own while their father is off in the army and their mother is strangely absent from their lives carly has a mean spirited friend named sam and they do a very well produced award winning web show called with their little school friend freddie the episodes deal with their lives in and around the web show and their hi jinx at school br br carly is a young all knowing web personality business woman producer played by miranda cosgrove a young actress who relies on talking very very loudly and fast to get her point across and making odd faces her brother spencer is a somewhat mean spirited dim wit and eccentric artist played by jerry trainor who tries a bit to hard to be like jim carrey and whose comedy style seems to be aimed at the young male audience who'd like this type of joey gladstone humor then there's sam puckett an unlikable mean little lying thief of a brat who needs an attitude adjustment played by jeanette mccurdy who clearly wears hair extensions as you can see them disappear then reappear from scene to scene and finally there's freddie benson the web shows nerdy cameraman and technical adviser who has a major crush on carly but will obviously get nowhere with her who's played by nathan br br other secondary characters come and go such as mother grandfather annoying teachers and many of their annoying little school friends to round out the cast most of the comedy is mean spirited like blowing up the doorman as a gag throwing a water balloon at a teacher and knocking over the table of young girl scouts selling cookies all of the adults come off as complete idiots while the children are all knowing and certain main characters have absolutely no morals lying cheating stealing and violence all are acceptable in this children's show created and written by dan schneider yes it's a children's show what more could the young viewers ask for well with dan schneider we can expect to have the young girls dress in tight clothes and bikini's and do some odd things like sticking their tongues out for the camera and eating br br shows like this are just what the young crowd likes though and i guess no worse then any of the other garbage nick shovels at its young crowd there's always fans to be found for anything seen on tv at least this is a bit better then most of the stuff seen on nick like that horrible naked brothers show
<START> perhaps the best movie ever made by director kevin tenney well his witchboard is not on the top of my all time horror list this one is a strange fascinating mixture between pin and child's play both better than this one but not so better sure the plot is contrived and perhaps too predictable but the actors are good rosalind allen is very pleasant to the eye and so is mckenzie god bless her for the shower scene the child actress is very good in interpreting the disturbed daughter and the pinocchio puppet is scary enough to give you a few thrills down the spine for a b movie not bad at all
<START> it was probably watching this tv movie that got me interested in the debate as to whether anna was really daughter anastasia since seeing it i have made a point of watching various documentaries and also bought a book despite the evidence that has been discovered since the film was released i sometimes still think she was such is the power of amy irving's acting in this 2 parter which is somewhat liberal with the historical facts but packed to the brim with tear jerking drama and irving's totally convincing performance br br i was not consciously aware of irving before this though i must have seen her without realizing it in carrie another favourite film in i never felt for one moment that it's only a film for me this woman was anastasia and when part one ended with her in the railway carriage meeting members of the royal family i knew that come hell or high water i had to see the second part i just wanted to see how she would prove that she was who she claimed to be and as the story progressed i felt an intense hatred of rex harrison's character though i greatly admire him as an actor br br when i saw the movie listed again in the tv guide i convinced my mother that we should watch it and afterward she thanked me for doing so being almost as keen as i had been to watch part 2 then i bought the video and can totally recommend it anastasia is one of those rare tv movies that you simply must watch for the sheer enjoyment of watching the finest acting i have ever seen on tv and it doesn't really matter whether you believe the legend or not
<START> what could've been a great film about the late poker pro pre poker craze stu the kid unger turned into a disappointment br br you can tell the filmmakers were working on a short string budget everything look filmed on the cheap timelines seemed a bit off to me br br casting michael from the sopranos was also a bad casting choice he looked too old to play the baby faced stu he looked way too healthy for a coke addict if you look at footage from the 1997 main event the real stu was so skinny and he practically had no nose from too much cocaine so he wore those sunglasses to hide them and i kept expecting adriana to pop up and yell chris tu br br also they skipped over the fact that he had a son from angie's previous relationship that committed suicide in the late '80s br br every time i saw vincent van patten appear i kept thinking he was going to announce show tunes going off in head like he does on the br br if you're looking for real footage check espn classic because they rerun the 1997 main event every so often or try youtube avoid this move like a bad beat
