<START> his has to surely be one of the worst gay themed films of all time who told any of the so called actors that they can act bad sound bad script gestures so overboard that they defy reality a nightclub scene with only one actor and dubbed crowd scenes br br after seeing other low budget films similarly made i was prepared for something innovative but not plain pathetic br br parents and friends really should not encourage anyone to make such tripe br br and the dvd no menu access its worse than a vhs tape once you start you have to watch the whole thing through luckily the fast forward button works with this film and dvd nothing else does
<START> from the english accents to the so unnecessary violence after violence showing moses as a murderer people who actually believe in the old testament will just sit there and shake their heads i am not a religious person at all but even i felt as though the writers of this movie were trying to turn us all against god and the jews when moses picked up that rock and threw the first stone at the woman to kill her for committing adultery i wanted to stone the writers i can't believe in this day and age that hallmark and abc disney would attempt to show such garbage as this don't we have enough problems in this world already
<START> in the literal sense br br reminds you of those cops and robber or cowboys indians role playing games you played with your 8 year old friends br br tedious and un inspired the storyline was obviously written to make bad acting and dialogue seem as part of the plot but all it does is showcase it i cant believe john badham let his name be associated with this piece of crap this could have been done better by a high school film buff who had been given the camera lighting filmstock and editing br br destined to be a time filler on sci fi channel when they've overused everything else from their library and barely better than the paid programming shill downstream
<START> this movie is about three teens who have been best friends for the longest time and go on the most messed up ride of their life when heroine becomes the choice drug in their town these three teens find themselves wrapped up in it all this movie portrays heroine addiction very well and is something you can't stop watching mtv has never been the best at doing made for tv movies but this one has to much good content to not watch it i enjoyed this film at the beginning i thought it would be the worst movie i've seen but then as it went on it got better and i couldn't turn away
<START> i am a huge randolph scott fan so i was surprised and disappointed to find he is barely in this film the movie really belongs to robert ryan who is the hero in the jam and the one embroiled in the love triangle good grief gabby hayes gets more screen time than mr scott in this movie for many viewers that is not a problem but i am from the walter brennan school of sidekicks not gabby hayes although i will say that his lines were a bit more humorous than annoying in this film than in many of his films with randolph scott and john wayne br br personally i found the movie very slow going with a convoluted plot that was muddied even more by the unnecessary romance subplot by convoluted i don't mean impossible to understand or figure out i just mean too messy for its own good br br the direction is uninspired and the two main bad guys have the most unsatisfying come uppance at the end the whole movie comes across as fake unrealistic and poorly filmed br br just so you don't think i can't find anything good here br br on the plus side anne jeffreys is very sexy in her all too brief parts of this film not sure if it is actually her singing or someone else but whoever it was had a very pretty voice ms jeffreys also had a couple of nice acting moments the script needed either a lot more of her or to remove her character altogether as it was her nice few moments weren't enough to help the film br br lastly there is mr scott he looks fantastic in this film and is the no nonsense lawman out to set things right some folks complain that his characters prior to 1950 were too goody goody perfect but that's never bothered me at all i'll take him goody goody pre 1950 or gritty and violent post 1950 either way randolph scott was a real western hero br br it saddens me to have to say it but i would have to recommend passing this film by unless you are a die hard fan there are so many better scott films out there that this one won't be missed
<START> and parading around a 14 year old girl in a thong swimsuit is one of them to fans of this movie i'd like to ask would you allow your daughter to walk around a resort dressed like that and would your 14 year old be able to handle the reaction she'd get from men if yes i'd like to know why on both counts a suit like that is a clear invitation to men it's hypocritical to suggest that's not br br and on another point what teenage girl would ever claim her father was her lover without the excuse of severe mental problems that's almost as disgusting as the swimsuit br br simply put some things are just not funny or appropriate and they never will be
<START> contains spoilers br br this is a peter film if one has seen his bbc masterpieces and the war game one will recognize the style and his voice within seconds after the start made in 1971 it is set in a very near future when the vietnam war has escalated even more and now seems to involve china nixon is still president and civil disobedience and protest is dealt with violently using outwardly civilian with citizens' as judges because prison building can't keep up an alternative is introduced the punishment park delinquents can choose between severe prison sentences and a man hunt in a hostile environment in this case a 85 km trip through the californian desert at if they reach an american flag at the end without being caught by national guard or riot police they will be set free or else they have to serve their sentence or be dead as we will see the film is made in a completely documentary style with three european teams covering a tribunal and the course of two groups already sentenced scenes jump between the tribunal tent the hunting troops and the hunted condemned scarce off commentary gives us raw background information time temperature etc the tribunal scenes show a kangaroo court on the one side and a wide range of personalities on the other ranging from real terrorists over to clearly innocents e g a total pacifist who can't even hurt flies the defense lawyer who does take his job seriously has to take abuse from both sides what makes these scenes especially eerie is their resemblance to the rhetoric of todays administration to the detail meanwhile some unfortunate events in the desert make clear that the of the game' don't really apply the question remains open whether it is rigged from the start or arbitrariness by the troops due to those events that leads to the outcome i suspect it is both at the end we are back at square one with the next group going to punishment park this description may indicate a heavily biased or even demagogic propaganda movie but that would be misleading the behavior all participants were as usual with looks and sounds real the tribunal scenes may even contain text material from real contemporary trials i'd say that this could be sold as the 'real thing' without problem with the forgotten faces the reaction was we can't send that or nobody will believe our real newsreels anymore because this is indistinguishable from the real thing with punishment park it ought to be the same effectively banned in the us as far as i know this is a must see that hasn't lost its power or its relevance especially today
<START> this movie is bad so bad that my mother who can barely stand the suspense of disney's snow white was chuckling through out the entire movie my first warning should've been that it was in the 5 50 bin at wal mart but i have actually found some good movies in that bin so i can't fault if for this debacle the second warning should have been that when the cashier rang up the dvd it was actually 3 88 again i have never been one to ignore the cheapies this movie is definitely not for people looking for something good to watch and it most certainly isn't for everyone that enjoys the occasional bad movie if you need background noise while you are doing something like playing cards with some friends then get this but if you are looking for something to actually watch don't even bother it was really disappointing because there were a lot of good actors i felt like i was watching a chocolate version of willard
<START> if you enjoy sitting in the dark both literally and figuratively for ninety minutes then this is the movie for you br br a waste of actors resources and audience time ultimately a waste of space don't be tempted by the resume there is nothing of any further substance beyond it the film lacks all of the basics that you might expect from the genre plot character development denouement the cast may perhaps take heart from the knowledge that in this instance their efforts will be entirely forgettable and given time their careers may perhaps improve br br absolute tripe
<START> we sought out this hard to find vhs after watching two excellent merchant ivory pictures back to back knowing it was an instant box office failure a failure as a rental i thought it might be worth seeing anyway based on m i's reputation too bad nine years ago it was very much a liberal agenda objective to trash the founding fathers and indeed they had some success in eradicating the founding fathers from many american classrooms including for example new jersey whose eradication of our great founders quickly ended when the washington times shone the spotlight of truth into the nj school board and their subversive deed a small part of this was headlining the alleged sally hemmings thomas jefferson connection disregarding the inconvenient dna findings which failed to support the wacky agenda never mind they got james ellis an author of dubious reputation to put it in a book and columbia university sealed the deal by giving ellis a pulitzer br br as to jefferson in paris the liberal agenda spin begins in the opening scene wherein james earl jones is claiming to be the son of jefferson the spin simply continues in flashback mode to paris the unmistakable truth is that even if a person assumes the lie is true the hemmings allegation would be an insignificant detail into the larger matter of prolonged and vital diplomatic mission to paris as well as to the netherlands where he secured crucial financial backing for america when our infant nation was without funds br br besides the liberal spin job there is nothing else of interest in this drab and tortuously dull movie some of the other history is indeed accurate adding credence to frame the lie but this movie takes one of the most interesting moments in american history and reduces it to a remedy for insomnia br br please do not ask me why liberals set out to trash the founding fathers because i don't waste time explaining the acts of such people don't ask them either they usually respond to such questions with the same answer shut up
<START> this is one of those tweety and sylvester cartoons that made this legendary pair second only to bugs bunny in terms of looney tunes popularity br br besides having all of the stock situations for this duo sylvester feeding out of garbage cans the i i a putty tat line etc s o s also stars granny who is one of those types of supporting characters that these warner bros classics had in abundance to enrich the color and flavor of them this time out the cat and bird are aboard an ocean liner and the gags that are extracted from this situation are creative and lively br br what a day that was in cartoon history when friz freleng decided to pair his sylvester with the departed robert clampett's little yellow bird
<START> never have i sat down for six hours straight to watch a miniseries but changed that i'm not going to lie i know some aussie flicks can be pathetic and boring actually i quite like aussie flicks myself but maybe i'm biased but is on a completely different lane although not historically accurate as we are continually reminded the show combines superb acting an excellent script and the addition of humour to provide us with an entertaining and emotional perception of life in a pow camp in wwii br br keep in mind the show was not supposed to be a documentary so don't let any factual errors disappoint you br br this series exposes such creative writing by john doyle aka roy who is known more for his comedy than anything else and an excellent director and actors move this creativity along perfectly if you want to see how much hard work went into this series visit the official website it is really interesting and you'll learn a lot about true accounts of br br if you haven't seen yet make sure you are doing nothing for a whole day because you'll want to watch the series in its entirety
<START> solo is an action movie about a terminator like android that is constructed and trained for the military when a flaw is discovered he is issued to be rather than face death he chooses to flee into the jungles of central america where he takes refuge in a village the military chases him into there leading into a big action feast br br mario van peebles does a decent performance the android his movements and gestures look mechanical enough to get the job done actual scientific realism is abandoned in order to make a good action hero and it works out the action scenes aren't that spectacular but they aren't all too bad either the acting from the other characters is pretty bad but i was not expecting anything too good the special effects were decent as well br br solo is decent as an action flick but very forgettable it lacks the substance that most movies possess but if you just want to pass a couple hours without much thinking this will get the job done
<START> based on a william faulkner short story two soldiers is a top notch short film a movie that has enough story emotion and great cinematography for a feature film and definitely leaves you wanting more in the end the story involves two dirt poor mississippi brothers one only a kid the other old enough to volunteer for the war effort shortly after the japanese attack on pearl harbor the younger brother played brilliantly by newcomer jonathan doesn't want to let his older brother go and he sets out on a quest to enlist in the army himself ron perlman gives a gruff but touching as the army colonel who decides to help the kid br br because it is only 39 minutes long this gem will be hard to find it will most likely be confined to the festival circuit for now but remember the name aaron schneider this picture marks him as a director to watch
<START> the 221 episodes of the lone ranger were originally broadcast on abc from 1949 to 1957 and then for many years they played in local syndication for most of the original broadcast years the series was abc's most watched piece of programming br br the new dvd set from pop flix contains the first 16 episodes 15 sept 29 dec 1949 and for some reason unknown to me episode 22 from the fifth season for a total of 17 episodes the same 17 available on last year's mill creek entertainment release so these are probably in the public domain these sets pretty much render the legend of the lone ranger movie superfluous as all three episodes that were combined in 1952 to form the movie are included in these releases br br the early episodes hark back to radio as there is considerably more voice over narration used as an introduction and to introduce key plot moments br br the series itself was pure kiddie western with clear cut good and evil distinctions and no romance the title character played by clayton moore started out texas ranger john reid the first three episodes provide the background for his transformation to lone ranger status his partnering with the indian tonto jay and the taming of his horse silver br br there is an unambiguous code of positive morality infusing each episode the lone ranger is totally good but he adopts the guise of evil while a masked man in the west was normally feared by the good citizens and an indian was the lone ranger is feared by those who would do evil one persistent theme is that when the lone ranger and tonto first encounter an average citizen they are greeted with suspicion and by the end of the episode the citizen has been convinced of their value the trademark ending was a secondary character asking the question who was that masked man br br to really enjoy the series you must accept it for the simplistic morality tale it was intended to be if you don't take it seriously and keep wishing for some self reflexive campy parody elements you will only get frustrated br br then again what do i know i'm only a child
