<START> one of the enduring classics from mgm came out in the closing years of world war ii it's the film that made young elizabeth taylor a star she had done a few films as a child actress before national velvet but when it came out her place in the movies was assured ironically enough biologically she'd be growing up fast enough after national velvet was out and her next struggle as an actress was to get substantial adult roles because casting directors only saw her as innocent little velvet brown who loved her jumping horse br br i'm not sure of how this would work because horses have to have confirmed and the pi's are a subject not dealt with in national velvet all we know is that he's a reckless and horse in the hands of reginald owen and after he breaks free and causes considerable damage owen gets rid of him for a nominal price to the local butcher donald crisp br br at the same time as these things are happening mickey rooney comes wandering into the lives of the brown family which consists of crisp wife anne revere and daughters angela lansbury juanita quigley and elizabeth taylor and their little brother butch jenkins rooney is a former jockey who's now on the open road and heading for the brown family where his father was once a horse trainer for anne revere's family it's he who sees the potential of the pi short for pirate as a jumper and it's elizabeth who convinces crisp not to pass up this chance br br elizabeth taylor was so sweet and innocent in national velvet the good book says you have to have faith like a child and she has it to spare she infuses rooney with it to have faith in the heart and ability of the pi and to leave a little over for himself br br anne revere won a best supporting actress award for national velvet she's a very wise mother who has hidden depths to her that the audience doesn't suspect it turns out that back in her youth she had a taste of fame and glory swimming the english channel and her prize money saved all these years she gives to her daughter that scene is probably what won her the oscar national velvet also won one other academy award for film editing br br over 60 years after it made its debut national velvet as a family classic hasn't lost a thing its depiction of life between the world wars in great britain is still a standout and national velvet launched a movie legend can't do much better than that for high regard
<START> i would hate to have anyone watch this inspired by a true story movie and draw any conclusions about the true event few things they did get right were overshadowed by the things that were just not true ed gein never dragged anyone behind a car never met up with anyone at the graveyard and killed them no proof he returned body parts to the graveyard the things he did were awful enough why try to make it worse br br this movie ranks among my 10 worst wastes of eye strain in the light of the moon is a much better film on the subject it is more factual and the acting is superior in contrast to this one
<START> my brother got me hooked on carlin back in the 70s i always loved his observational humor that is looking at every day things and finding the humor in it like asking the question have you ever tried to throw away an old waste basket you can't do it they keep bringing back to you and asking questions like why is the word kill more acceptable then the f word while making prefect sense with the discussion br br however during the 90s his stuff was less funny and more angry what he seemed to be doing was holding a mirror to society's face and say 'take a look ' at this point his shows were less of a comedy show and more of a gripe session but in all fairness he always made a tremendous amount of sense he really made you think br br here was carlin old and new he starts out about the fun one could have by getting old and later slamming the the state of the world again making perfect sense br br this was his best since jammin' in new york and as it turns out his last br br i think what 'the was to john wayne or 'a prairie home to robert altman 'it's bad for ya' is to george carlin a fond farewell to a true great icon love him or hate him i think he will be remembered
<START> i just wanted to say i liked this movie a lot but i also want to ask about something does anyone know the artist song name of the song that the young boy cant remember his name now plays on his cd player when his dad and 2 men comes and takes the tv and the cd player that song is so freaking cool even though i cant understand a word what they're saying feel free to mail me the artist song name at x hotmail com thanks a lot in advance repeating i just wanted to say i liked this movie a lot but i also want to ask about something does anyone know the artist song name of the song that the young boy cant remember his name now plays on his cd player when his dad and 2 men comes and takes the tv and the cd player that song is so freaking cool even though i cant understand a word what they're saying feel free to mail me the artist song name at x hotmail com thanks a lot in advance
<START> overall i enjoyed the movie scarlett i am a huge fan of gone with the wind i have read the book and seen the classic movie many times i even have a small collection of scarlett o'hara ornaments and other things i must admit that gone with the wind is my all time favourite book and movie vivian leigh and clark gable are remarkable actors and two of my favourites unfortunately i was unable to read the book scarlett but i was excited to see the movie truth be told the movie is not any where close to the calibre of gone with the wind and neither are the actors however joan whalley kilmer and timothy dalton were pleasant actors in the roles and at many times joan sounded like vivian leigh in her portrayal of scarlett dalton also portrayed rhett well at times it took some time getting used to the different actors but overall i really enjoyed it being the fan of gone with the wind as i am one major disappointment was that joan did not have green eyes and scarlett o'hara and vivian leigh both did i also found the lord fenton absolutely appalling and i did not like his character if you are a gone with the wind fan and or enjoy romantic stories see the movie scarlett however do not expect it to be remarkable like gone with the wind it is far from it although it is interesting with the new characters and so on i am happy it is not a remake and some of the events in the story was what i imagined the continuation to be of the scarlett o'hara and rhett butler love story if you haven't seen it today get it all tomorrow is another day
<START> you will be able to tell within the first 30 seconds of this film whether you want to finish watching it the film opens with images of planes landing at an airport one plane after another diving into a mirage filled runway you will be able to accurately guess that this movie is not about a story at first viewing it's even easy to think the opening images are repetitive shots of the same plane the initial drama is in the of your perception which is built on your willingness to experience the film simply as a series of images if after this opening you want to see the movie you will not be bored you may even be mesmerized the movie may be an emotional experience it may be an intellectual experience it may be both judging from the dvd commentary which is essential it was primarily an emotional experience for herzog and at one point he talks explicitly about how the film is a collaboration between filmmaker and viewer there's plenty of room for the viewer to make of this film exactly what he or she wants to make of it take a gamble
<START> while this film might not be the next evil dead hell who knows maybe it will it has only been out for a year it is worth a look don't expect a 10 million film cuz you'll be disappointed do expect to be entertain to laugh and to enjoy the experience all in all this film is much better than many if not all of the low budget horror films out there i have seen films that spent more than 10 or 20 times what this film cost to make and turned out times worse the effort that was put into this film far out weighs the set backs it faces by having a limited budget movies are meant to entertain and this movie sure does that in fact this film might even open up new doors for you in movie watching it's available on netflix if not your local video rental store so watch it then decide
<START> the characters are annoying immature and flaky madison being the most annoying of all ooh a cold spot such a dire threat any ghost in that house would have fled in self defense to make a long story short this movie is boring seeing a chair flying across a room may be creepy but that's about as intriguing as it gets i watched it once and when one of my kids wanted to watch it again i was tempted to take a baseball bat to the tv set rather than watch this rubbish again if you want a good horror movie or even a passable comedy this isn't it the only good part of the whole thing was the roach scene and by the end of the movie you ended up feeling sorry for the roach
<START> the most disposable movie in the history of cinema this one is a strong contender why wasting so much money for such a pointless useless work the only difference between the hitchcock classic and this poor imitation is color wide screen and leila's walkman a movie which's supposed to generate thrills and fear leaves me completely indifferent br br no you' re going to tell me it will urge the young generations to see the original this psycho 1998 is a giant spoiler br br they could have done something different for instance by casting an actor closer to bloch 's bates an obese man they content themselves with an obnoxious rehash a pox on it and long live alfred hitchcock
<START> my roommate and i have another friend that works at a local blockbuster video he finds truly awful movies for us and tells us about them one of them was a christmas horror film starring former professional wrestler bill goldberg as a killer claus we didn't watch it immediately but we didn't think there could be anything worse apparently we were wrong we were shown this slasher film starring ken shamrock versus a murderous scarecrow at first we thought ken would actually be the killer scarecrow and that's why we wanted to watch but he wasn't and that made the movie even worse what absolutely ruined the movie was the teen drama if you want to save your brain cells from trying to escape from your head never ever watch this movie
<START> steven seagal's intent is to be commended and his acting in this film is equal to that in many of his others if you ignore the fact that he is supposedly portraying a brilliant scientist the problem i had was with two items of the plot which stretched my suspension of disbelief beyond the breaking point br br first how is it that a carefully engineered variation on a nasty germ whose antidote must be just as carefully researched and engineered by a big lab is cured by drinking tea from a flower growing high in the mountains and that grandpa's family seem to be about the only people who know anything about this br br second and this one really takes the cake having gathered up enough of the cure to fix a whole town wouldn't you expect the army to land the helicopter and start rushing bags of flowers to all the homes in this small town no they instead decide to sprinkle the flowers all over the town and force the sick people to go out and gather them up all over again just plain silly unless under native belief the power in the drug somehow depends on one's having gone out and gathered the flowers oneself br br add in the cardboard nature of the villains and the unsuitability of the title and you might think my vote on this movie is actually high
<START> it's times like these i truly wish i was a more avid reader of clive barker's literary repertoire since very few things feel worse than not being able to fully comprehend a movie of this stunningly caliber based on the novella cabal the story of involves a amount of lavish and bizarre creatures and settings in an underground society of demonic ghouls a normal guy becomes linked to the strange world called through his dreams and his psychiatrist coerces him into believing he is responsible for a series of gruesome murders of families in recent months thinking this to be true he retreats to located under a rural cemetery where he is reluctantly accepted the shrink however is right on heals with a diabolical scheme to whip out the community of br br wanting so much to love this movie i was very let down in the long run i have regretfully not read the story so barker's fantasy world and the purpose of it and all these monsters was horribly confusing and the premise was painfully uneven i understand how the final cut was diced to hell and even barker show's moderate dislike for the overall product but i just didn't get it even if it is crucial to read the story i feel like it should at least be translated to film in a way that it is still comprehensible for those unfamiliar with the literature if cabal is as convoluted as this film than barker really milked a dead concept couldn't help but feel a bit bored after a while especially when things started getting increasingly ridiculous somewhere around the jail scene i realized just how bored i was like a police department fearlessly going to war with like it happens every week no one seems to think the idea of immortal monsters is a tad strange i did like the visual effects and all that crazy sh t that went on in especially that porcupine lady and that big headed sob definitely an epic flick when you consider the massive quantity of effects and convincingly morbid decor david cronenberg fills his position well as the loony shrink with his cool zipper head potato sack mask but we all wish he had done some behind the camera work to help save this heap br br so if you have a boner for clive barker material and fully grasp what exactly is why they show the creatures during the opening title sequence terrible idea and why these creatures reside there and how some punk kid shares a telekinetic link to it you should probably check out i'll look for cabal one of these days and hopefully gain some perspective or maybe i'll just forget this travesty completely until then this is a poorly constructed and fairly tedious mess of a movie watch hellraiser instead
<START> the connection with james dean in a short plan we see emilio estevez toying with a teddy bear remember the first scene of ray's rebel without a cause moreover the main conflict is estevez versus sheen father against son as in east of eden the soldier has come home and nobody has been able to communicate with him even his sister a psychology student what a derision the mother a crude matron a superb kathy bates gets bogged down in she 's not able to understand that her values religion family have become a thing of the past specially for someone like his son whose innocence was betrayed the father an irresolute man under his wife's thumb although he tries hard to play the macho wanted to make up for the mediocrity of his life so he saved his honor by forcing his son to do his duty the scene in which hatred for his father explodes is very intense the actor director gives a restrained performance as lee students used to do and his final burst of anger is increased tenfold so
<START> i was surprised how much i enjoyed this sure it is a bit slow moving in parts but what else would one expect from rollin also there is plenty of nudity nothing wrong with that particularly as it includes lots of the gorgeous brigitte there are also some spectacularly female dead bit more perhaps but most effective there is also a sci fi like storyline with a brief explanation at the end but i wouldn't bother too much with that no here we have a most interesting exploration of memory and the effect of memory loss and to just what extent one is still without memory my dvd sleeve mentions david cronenberg and whilst this is perhaps not quite as good as his best films there is some similarity here particularly with the great use of seemingly menacing architecture and the effective and creepy use of inside space as i have tried to indicate this is by no means a rip roaring thriller it is a captivating nightmare like movie that makes the very most of its locations including a stunning railway setting at the end
<START> valley girl launched nicolas cage's career and was an 80's version of romeo and juliet it is a definite example of an 80's teen classic nicolas cage deborah foreman and elizabeth daily all have brilliant portrayals in this movie but it will never top fast times at ridgemont high as the ultimate 80's teen flick because if it weren't for fast times then the 80's generation of teen flicks would just be a big blow to the head that's for sure
