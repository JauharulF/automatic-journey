<START> this movie is about a group of women perhaps not of the highest repute who are heading to a small fort to take over a recently departed uncles property where they plan to set up shop upon arrival in a nearby city they find no one will go there even though its only 15 miles away so they walk when they get there they find there are no soldiers but a good amount of people who have taken over use of the fort and built up a small city nearby they soon find that something isn't right here and fort mcmillan ft doom as the locals call it is in some serious trouble br br rather than go into the plot line i will make some comments about things i noticed about the movie first off the acting is very flat only a few of the people seem to be real enough to believe in my first though was poor acting but at the end i watched some of the outtakes and these same people became alive so my only thought left is this is how the director wanted it on top of the bad acting i have a great problem where the people don't react right to a given set of circumstances take for example no one would take them to ft mcmillan for any price even though its only 15 miles away yet when we arrive at the fort we find it is well maintained by a decent population of people all of whom must get supplies from some one not to mention mail etc it is supposed to take place in yet we can see the railroad car has electric lights they aren't on at least and a locomotive engine that is at least 30 years later not one of the general style of so popular at that time there are also places where you can see paved blacktop and maybe a car at one point didn't want to bother to go back and look and other anachronistic items if they had followed the rules of the world they made and let the actors be actors it might have gotten a 4 from me instead of the 2 i gave it and they rewritten it about 4 more times it might have done even better
<START> i saw this film purely by chance it was shown very late or more correctly very early one morning on television i had woken up and was having trouble getting to sleep and this film came on br br it deals with a subject covered many times elsewhere it certainly isn't as good as educating rita despite a couple of additional twists and has a very predictable ending br br despite its very obvious shortcomings i did enjoy the film and this was thanks to the acting of some of its players rather than the story or the piece as a whole br br i am a big fan of sam neil and have seen him in many different films including dead calm the piano sirens children of the revolution event horizon man and the ubiquitous jurassic park he was very good but he could have played this part with his eyes shut br br some of the acting was in my opinion dreadful rose byrne for example and some of the elusions were rather heavy handed all the board woman in empty lives all dressed totally in white for example br br however two actors who i hadn't or don't remember seen before impressed me a lot as frances frank kennedy and especially matthew newton as her son david he in particular was very convincing and i would like to see a lot more of him
<START> the cell is an exotic masterpiece a dizzying trip into not only the vast mind of a serial killer but also into one of a very talented director this is conclusive evidence of what can be achieved if human beings unleash their uninhibited imaginations this is boldness at work pushing aside thoughts to fall into formulas and cliches and creating something truly magnificent this is the best movie of the year to date br br i've read numerous complaints about this film anywhere from all style and no substance to poorly cast characters and bad acting to negatively criticize this film is to miss the point this movie may be a landmark a tradition where future movies will hopefully follow the cell has just opened the door to another world of imagination so can we slam the door in its face and tell it and its director singh that we don't want any more personally i would more than welcome another movie by and would love to see someone try to challenge him br br we've all heard talk about going inside the mind of a serial killer and yes i do agree that the genre is a bit overworked the 90s were full of movies trying to depict what makes serial killers tick some of them worked but most failed but the cell does not blaze down the same trail we are given a new twist we are physically transported into the mind and presented with nothing less than a fascinating journey of the most mysterious subject matter ever studied br br i like how the movie does not bog us down with too much scientific jargon trying to explain how jennifer lopez actually gets to enter the brain of another instead she just lies down on a laboratory table and is wrapped with what looks like really long twizzlers and into another entity the cell wants to let you see what it's all about and not how it's all about and i guess that's what some people don't like true i do like explanations with my movies but when a movie ventures onto new ground you must let it do what it desires and simply take it in br br i noticed how the film was very dark when it showed reality maybe to contrast the bright visuals when inside the brain of another nonetheless the set design was simply astonishing i wouldn't be surprised if this film took home a few oscars in cinematography best costumes best director and the like if it were up to me it'd at least get nominated for best picture br br i've noticed that i've kind of been repeating myself not because there's nothing else to say but because i can't stress enough how fantastic i thought the cell was if you walk into the movie with a very open mind and to have it taken over with wonders and an eye popping feast then you are assured a good time i guess this film was just a little too much for some people writing it off as weird or crazy i am very much into psychology and the imagination of the human mind so it was right down my alley leaving the theater i heard one audience member say whoever made that movie sure did a lot of good drugs if so i want what he was smoking br br out of 4
<START> is a beautiful animated film with some dark undertones it features a kid sized story of longing and love with ecological implications but it is not preachy hayao miyazaki has fused andersen's little mermaid with japan's native myths and his trademark steam punk flights of fancy and the result is very rewarding there are some scary moments of storms and flooding but they are thrilling not horrific br br if you've ever wanted to run with the waves along the shore ride on a jellyfish as an elevator completely transform yourself or make a friend for life is a fable for you
<START> peter segal's 1995 commercial hit now cult classic boy' is a hilarious film an evergreen entertainer chris farley is a talent which we'll never ever forget br br boy' is a simple story told in the funniest zany way possible farley spade take a journey which is filled with unstoppable laughter even the rob lowe portion is damn funny as a kid i remember watching boy' again and again and again it's been of my childhood favorites and it will always remain to be even today when it comes on t v i stick to it as a die hard fan i am quite possessive about this film br br segal's direction is super chris farley might have died in 1997 but remains alive for me at least what an actor watch his work in boy' he's so much at ease he delivered fantastic performances later on in films like hills 'almost heroes' but his work in here remains as his best to date love you farley spade on the other hand is as good as ever he's an excellent actor in all respects br br boy' rules 100 thumbs up from this writer
<START> just watched this movie over the weekend and i must say i thoroughly enjoyed it the 2 italo american actors are excellent as usual michael imperioli and john ventimiglia it is obvious that the director was influenced by 2 great films of the past directed by italians primarily he was influenced by dino and his film il it is the story of 2 young men who meet by chance and become friends one is extroverted and the other is introverted they enjoy the whole day together and by the end of the day the shy one learns that there is more to life than his usual routine monotony the same thing happens to albert de santi unfortunately il has a very similar ending and this apparently influenced the director of on the run because he uses the same technique but with a twist i had expected something but was surprised to see that it turned out to be the opposite if you watch both movies you will understand the other film that influenced the director is after hours directed by the great italian american scorsese i highly recommend all 3 movies
<START> possibly one of the best most horrible b movies ever as in it's so bad and random it's kinda hilarious and i don't know how to feel about it reminds me of cabin fever there's just something about that kid jumping off the porch doing karate and yelling that's intriguing since a lot of people have already outlined the plot and everything all i'm going to do is sum up the quality of the movie with one quote i'm the park ranger who's going to f ck you up yeah enough said if you're looking for quality or a really scary movie i don't recommend it but if you like these sorts of films then i guess you would enjoy it i don't know how but i guess some people would
<START> i don't know what neighborhoods the folks who wrote the rave reviews for this movie live in but i'm glad i'm not there if they don't comment on the cartoonish ness of this thing okay we learn to suspend our disbelief in films like the die hard series but seeing little jodie knock off a whole street gang with a glock as a novice yet c'mon all she needed was a bald head and a ripped t shirt and she would be bruce willis br br apparently jodie being the executive producer blinded her to what a joke and waste of her money this would be or she was living out some kind of fantasy where she is the only blonde and everyone else is a brunette black or hispanic even the dog is black little blondie is the only good one and except for a black police officer everyone else in town is some nasty minority out to get her has your fear of your acting talent declined so far that you think the only way you can get noticed is to be the only bright spot literally on camera in a dark morose and somber neighborhood film cast apparently she thought she was in the wrong movie the dark knight br br ridiculous plot holes furniture chewing acting gratuitous violence look girls now you can do it too spend the time with your family instead of watching this drek
<START> this low budget film about a writer who goes to work in a london casino has an awful script wooden performances and not much to recommend it of course it will appeal to highbrows for whom mainstream is a curse word and who automatically add 20 iq points when they hear a british accent apologies to jeff foxworthy br br the script is full of holes has he written a book yet or not cliches relationship trouble she works days he works nights and provides so little insight into such basics as character motivation that it requires a voice over narration just to move the story along br br in an attempt to keep the audience from dozing off it includes a street fight scene that is about as realistic as a high school production of julius caesar br br if your idea of scintillating dialogue is i'll see your ten and raise you twenty then run to see this movie otherwise save your money br br
<START> okay wait let me get this street there are actually some morons on this site who reckon this is one of the better if not the best halloween sequel i even read someone saying it was just as good as the original pah what nonsense don't believe them i've watched every halloween and clearly unlike some people knows what makes at the very least a good horror movie and this shower of s is one of the worst horror movies i have ever seen in my life frankly if i was john carpenter i would sue the person who wrote this either that or go around to his or her place with a hunting rifle seriously halloween sequels in general are nearly all rubbish two was crap three was stupid four is alright five is well five h20 alright resurrection painful yet in many ways i find this to be the worst of a very bad bunch of sequels why well let me just embark on some kind of rant not so much a review but a mindless rant on why halloween 6 the cure of michael myers is one of the most abysmal movies i have seen in a very long time ok where should i start ah yes the plot oh boy the plot basically the plot is a heaped together mess containing cults signs of thor and some other crap it's just stupid it really is the film tries to be flashy and intelligent yet its heaped together in such a horribly made way why does michael myers got to have a reason for killing people simple enough explanation micahel likes to kill his relatives that would suffice but no we have to have a man in black and mysterious cults and signs of thor and utter crap god its so bad it made me want to cry it really did the writers have tried to add to the character of myers but have actually managed to do the entire opposite apart from wearing a mask and a boiler suit which is a completely different colour by the way myers just isn't the same guy from the original or even two heck maybe even four thats another thing why has myers become a jason parody i thought it was meant to be the other way round yet myers is so similar to jason all he does is endlessly kill people in gory ways in the original he teased his victims took his time and as a result the whole thing was far more suspenseful in this he just walks around hacking people to death i mean in the space of half an hour we had equalled the amount of kills in the original it was just ridiculous oh and myers in this seems to have a really big head i mean its huge and hes put on loads of weight what else is crap oh yeah the return of tommy jarvis thats pretty bad in fact all the characters in this film are crap bar dr loomis of course i can't stand the little kid i wish he had got it he's really irritating our heroin is boring and not interesting and her whole family are a terrible bunch of actors the mother is rubbish the brother is bad and the father i mean was this his first part or something he was like a cartoon villain for gods sake he was actually more evil than myers by the way his death is one of the most abysmal i've ever seen i think even friday the 13th wouldn't come up with something so entirely laughable what else is rubbish oh yeah tommy jarvis don't know the name of the guy but he really can't act he tries his best to be serious and all that but i just wanted to laugh at him i wish he had died in fact if everyone had died it would have been quite good really there is dr loomis a horribly aged and dieing donald pleasence by all account despite him being on his last legs pleasance is still the stand out in the brief amount of time he features its such a pity that such a corner stone of this franchise had to say farewell in garbage like this what else is rubbish oh yeah the bit where the radio dj gets it firstly how the hell did michael manage to get in that van when five minutes ago he was in his house secondly it was just a pointless kill which may boost the body count but is just another peace of nonsense which adds to the drivel that is this film its in fact that death which said it all for me in that it was pointless a lot like this film
<START> cliche romance drama movie with very simple plot but very good cinematography and script the screenplay directing and acting was also good the flow of the movie is kind of manipulative in order to bring the audience to tears through the excellent love music and circumstance which works but later on after the movie makes one feel raped in a way jones makes her character very memorable and lovable though a deeper story could have taken this movie to a higher level but still the movie delivers for it's genre only for hopeless romantics big love story fans big soap drama fans 50's cinemascope cinematography fans and fans of the lead actors
<START> if b movies tired and corny scripts and golf carts dressed up as some sort of futuristic mode of transport are your sort of entertainment you'll probably enjoy this otherwise forget it the topless though completely irrelevant did give a few seconds of amusement
<START> savage guns video title is a dirt cheap bottom of the barrel spaghetti western in which the survivor of a massacre hunts the bandits who killed his brother and left him for dead catching up with them in a town controlled by their crooked boss br br despite plenty of violence this manages to be both dull and colorless with bad characterizations and almost no imagination or humor br br lead actor robert woods lives up to his name with a wooden and uncharismatic performance that fails to generate any warmth or sympathy whatsoever in other words the viewer never really roots for him despite the fact that he's the protagonist br br the worst scene in my opinion is the annoying dance hall scene where a woman sings in a heavy and terribly unsexy german accent it was the worst scene in blazing saddles and the worst one here
<START> hey now i have never laid eyes on a manga comic but apparently this movie is based on one ah well such is life anyway this is a pretty bizarre to say the least movie as things literally spiral out of control in a small japanese town people are becoming obsessed with the spiral and this young girl watches her friend's father videotape a snail and later in the movie people start becoming snails it also seems this boy's dad becomes so obsessed he somehow commits suicide in a household appliance there is some bizarre humor here that might be at home in a tim burton movie but there is some nastiness gore like only the japanese can do with justice as with a lot of japanese films though the ending is the ending and did anything get resolved well not to my mind it didn't there are some hints as to why this is all happening but they aren't explored and there's a lot left to either the imagination or else it wasn't deemed important still though there are lots of things for the eye to feast on and if you aren't obsessed with everything making perfect sense this is well worth seeing because it's just so original and bizarre my favorite was the father with the spinning eyeballs personally 8 out of 10 stars
<START> this might have been an excellent flick however as many other people think so do i it is poorly done due to the languages transfer if the entire movie must be read then it kind of takes away from the movie and becomes something else it does have an excellent rating as far as i am concerned and i couldn't wait to rent it but once i did it was a real let down out here in boardman ohio i could not find an english version to anything similar this movie was also compared to dark hours and this we will not get to watch in boardman ohio it is not available so i guess we will never know how good the movie actually was
