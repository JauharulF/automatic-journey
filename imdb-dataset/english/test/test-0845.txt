<START> now i like the bollywood films and i'm very glad they have recently gained success in the uk however latest effort is a deeply flawed film from start to finish br br the idea of a modern bollywood take on amadeus was quite an exciting one that is until the two supposed appear on the scene looking as if they have never touched a piece of manuscript in their lives patel is a very good looking man and the film plays to his narcissistic sensibilities but he is never once believable as a modern mozart in terms of acting all he can do is stand there and pout his expressions hair and clothes all look the same throughout including the scene where he is supposedly when in fact he appears to have nothing but a slight sniffle bobby deol playing the role does his best to liven up what little wooden script there is but alas just comes across as a little bit angry when he is supposed to be fuming with jealousy br br bollywood films are widely renowned for their stunning set pieces and colour schemes but looks like a drab bbc drama reproduction in fact the closest thing comes to is hollyoaks as it blatantly hides a really bad script behind beautiful people looking well beautiful he has yet to reach mediocrity the same could be said for the totally forgetful songs br br in short latest offering has no boom bang wallop or twang instead it merely plods along with its head held low hoping to catch your attention with a soft tap on the shoulder and that is not good enough at all
<START> now i like victor herbert and i like mary martin and allan jones but it would have been nice to see a real biography of victor herbert walter connolly as herbert does have a decent resemblance to him in his latter years br br jones and martin sing beautifully though the herbert music is just there to adorn the plot line concerning these two musical performers jones's john ramsay is a frail character very similar to gaylord in showboat who jones also played br br as for mary martin it's a mystery why she never had a good hollywood career she did films with bing crosby and dick powell as well as this one she performed well but movie audiences didn't take to her the best musical moment in the film is jones and martin in a duet of thine alone the recordings i have of the song are individual and it was written as a duet there's also a pleasant scene with jones and martin riding bicycles swapping herbert songs as they ride br br the real victor herbert with his womanizing and his irish patriot background and his musical training in germany where he developed a love for all things german would have been a fascinating study he was also a cello virtuoso before he turned full time to composing i have to take strong exception to the reviewer who said cuddles would have been a good victor herbert as irish hello br br nice movie but the real vic would have been so much better
<START> combines director david cronenberg's traditional love of blood and gore and exploding heads with the more confusing aspects of a reality twisting david lynch film and it actually works effectively i won't bother trying to give even the bare bones of a plot synopsis here because it'll only cause more confusion all you need to know is that the film is about a virtual reality computer game that is so incredibly lifelike that it becomes difficult to tell the difference between reality and virtual reality the film almost seems to abandon its technology fearing point at the end but then it throws in the final twist in the very last line of dialogue br br there's also some very gross sexual imagery based around the in the protagonists backs as well as some very gross acting from jude law he manages to come off as naive and stupid and boring and any other annoying habit you can care to think of jason jennifer leigh comes off much better and everyone else can be called a supporting character including willem dafoe in a functional if unspectacular role as a money crazed mechanic overall is a very effective sci fi film about the possibilities technology can present and the possible consequences it will receive
<START> this movie should have been billed as three movie summaries linked together to form a full length feature film including lots of shots of people slowly walking down dark corridors and streets be warned the first hour of this movie is simply a re hash of the first two aztec movies as told by the main character the actual movie doesn't start until the thing is almost over i must say the overacting on the part of the bat is quite hilarious br br as for the robot i thought a robot was a mechanical device that may or may not resemble a human the robot consists of a radioactive reanimated corpse encased in a lead robot body as tom servo put it he's not that impressive he doesn't even have knees that and it takes the robot about an hour just to lumber across the room but once he catches you watch out he'll disintegrate you with a touch powered by radium ease br br this is a great movie when accompanied by joel and the bots otherwise you're just a glutton for abuse
<START> i managed to record the dion brothers off broadcast tv with the commercials back in the early 80s i've loaned it to many friends all of whom agree it's one of the best b bandit movies ever made one day while walking to my nyc apartment i saw stacy keach shooting a scene for his tv series mickey we had a moment to chat and i told him how much i enjoyed the dion bros and considered it a pure classic he thanked me and said it was one of the best and most memorable film experiences of his career he was very friendly and sincere and i was grateful for the few moments he took to chat with a fan this is one classic that needs to be on dvd
<START> a very enjoyable french film this film has many twists and turns in the plot and is superb i have found that when i lend this dvd out to a friend it seems to do the rounds before getting back to me it is really all about a man making sure he finds the right girl to settle down with
<START> back in the 70's a small time texas filmmaker named s f directed a handful of surprisingly decent low budget drive in horror flicks which seem to have developed a small cult following over the years before viewing his first film don't look in the basement i wasn't too sure what to expect but i sure as hell didn't expect it to turn out to be the only texas horror i thought was better than the chainsaw massacre i don't know this might actually be my all time favorite horror movie br br we begin in an isolated insane asylum at first it seems like a rather laid back place to get mentally healthy considering all the patients are allowed to roam around freely and whatnot as if it were their house i guess it is none of them seem all that dangerous only delusional the residents include a love nympho a 700 year old woman a man child a spaz a guy who thinks he's in a war a woman who thinks she has a baby and a guy who thinks he's a judge one day out of nowhere judge kills the doctor with an axe shortly thereafter the wanna be baby mama kills the nurse ten minutes into the movie and things are looking really ugly perhaps the new nurse will know what to do then again perhaps not giving away more would do more harm than good it's best to plunge head first into this one knowing as little as possible if you can appreciate honest to god with horror then you will not be disappointed br br if you liked scream if you liked wrong turn if you go for that unoriginal over produced over scored digital hollywood garbage then chances are high you just wont see the beauty in this one don't look in the basement being a first attempt makes the quality all the more shocking the atmosphere and the graininess fit into the location and the score like a glove unfortunately good ol' s f used up most of his good ideas on his first movie although the next entry in his texas sized is somewhat of a masterpiece that is if you're into extra sleazy mean spirited like someone i know if you fall in love with first two and absolutely must find out what else he had to offer check out don't open the door and the house where hell froze over don't look in the basement has everything that successful horror needs no stars no budget no digital effects just an original story brought to life in an insane asylum with a dozen cast members and a somber subtle score and of course the twist this is real horror for the real horror fan 10 10
<START> problem child was an okay movie but did it really merit a sequel i don't think it did the original movie's only redeeming asset was gilbert gottfried and he wasn't even good in this sequel br br i can't really put my finger on why this movie was bad for starters it just wasn't funny even when i saw this as a nine year old i didn't sympathize with junior michael oliver at all his character came off to me as whiny self loathing and perhaps most importantly a rebel without a clue he appeared to hate every woman that his father ben john ritter dated for the sole sake of hating them it also doesn't send a good message to kids with divorced parents who constitute over half children in the u s these days when the one woman ben decides to almost marry is a southern aristocrat who is vindictive and who happens to hate children as it is br br and as cool as i thought it would have been to see original snl cast mate laraine newman come back to the big screen she couldn't even save this movie i also found it strange that she was a white southern dÃ©butante whose name was that sounds more like an african american woman's name but of course that has nothing to do with why i disliked this movie br br i think the movie didn't work because you had antagonists you were supposed to hate along with protagonists you weren't supposed to hate john ritter's character was supposed to be a good parent who tried desperately to teach his child right from wrong without conforming to authoritative parenting instead he came off not only as a wimpy parent but also one who was desperate to find a wife in a matter of days regardless of how well he knew the woman did i mention this sends a bad message to children of divorced parents br br in a nutshell the rest of the things that went wrong with this movie included amy yasbeck unnecessary and unexplained return to play an entirely different character that young girl who was even more obnoxious than junior completely uncalled for toilet humor and even more outrageous and outdated homophobic humor involving the dog catchers the movie was just a mess and really doesn't deserve a dvd release if it hasn't been given one already it should just rot on vhs along with all the other bad forgettable 90's comedies
<START> you can't take this movie seriously the plot is predictable and trite the acting often over the top the dialog laughable but it all adds up to great fun three career girls in the late 1950's find their way to the big city and all the evils and temptations their mothers probably warned them about married men alcohol premarital sex abortion etc br br then there's amanda farrell joan crawford who did succeed professionally but whose personal life has been sacrificed for an office with her name on the door br br this movie may have been believable 50 years ago but now it's just great campy fun rent buy it and enjoy
<START> subspecies is set in romania where two american college students michele laura mae tate lillian michelle mcbride arrive to study local folklore with the aid of local friend mara irina there they rent rooms in a hotel become curious about the mysterious ruins of a nearby castle it turns out that a powerful evil vampire named anders lives there who has stolen the from his father king angus scrimm takes a fancy to the three girls starts drinking the blood of mara lillian meanwhile michele falls for a guy named stefan michael watson who just so happens to be brother michele stefan decide to team up rid the world of the evil br br directed by ted this film seems to be quite highly regarded amongst genre fans while it's not terrible i certainly wouldn't call it very good i could't really see anything much to get excited about subspecies is a rather slow going film not that much actually happens while it does try to stay close to certain classic vampire lore there's all this nonsense about a some little monsters that grow from the tips of severed fingers for some reason subspecies could have been a half decent film if not for the fact that it's dull i really can't remember that much about it good or bad the character's are alright but some f the dialogue is silly there's a scene which bugged me near the start when the girls are at the castle ruins one says they have to go because it's getting dark yet it's still clearly the middle of the day very bright there's also a scene where one of the american girls finds a coffin that hotel's attic doesn't really seem that bothered by it i am not being funny but is some bloke whose house i was staying at had a coffin in his attic i would be very very worried if you know what i mean i don't think i would ever want to watch it again there's no real threat the plot is weak that mixes classic vampire themes with silly subplots i was distinctly unmoved by it all not the worst film ever but hardly the best either br br the film looks alright with nice locations some local scenery although you feel the look is down to the budget rather than the makers attempt a authenticity there's not much gore apart from a decapitation some broken off finger tips for no apparent reason the makers throw in some average looking stop motion animated monsters that really don't do anything or have much significance to the story br br filmed on the cheap by charles band's full moon entertainment production company in bucharest in romania the production values are alright better than many later day band productions the acting isn't great with many of the cast putting in below par performances while genre regular angus scrimm has a small cameo at the start there's a little bit of style here on occasion with a few scene reminding heavily of the original nosferatu 1922 in particular the bit showing shadow coming down the stair with his long claw like fingernails standing out br br subspecies is a film that many seem to like for reasons i don't quite see i thought it was throughly average at best overall rather dull followed by subspecies ii 1993 bloodlust subspecies iii 1994 subspecies 4 bloodstorm 1998 the film vampire journals 1997
<START> i was unlike most of the reviewers not born in the 80's i was born on may 14th 1994 despite this my life was very much in the style of the 80's when other kids had i was playing zelda on my nes etc now this movie holds a special place in my heart already despite me being only 15 years old at the time of writing this review i because of my 80's style early childhood watched many tv shows and saw many movies that other kids didn't see and this movie was one of those and one of the greatest too br br it starts off in the los angeles home of alvin seville simon seville theodore seville and david seville david the chipmunk's adoptive father is in a rush to get to the airport as he is going on a business trip around europe his taxi is almost there and the chipmunks help him pack while they are talking alvin expresses his will to come with dave and to see the world even though technically dave is only going to europe so to alvin apparently only america and europe qualify as ''the david is leaving the chipmunks in the care of miss miller much to the displeasure of the boys soon dave is off to the airport and the chipmunks are left at home with miss miller later at a local cafÃ© the chipmunks are playing a game of the world in 30 against the brittany jeanette and eleanore after losing the game to brittany after having his hot air balloon eaten out of the sky by a crocodile alvin get's in an argument with brittany about who would really win a race around the world two diamond smugglers sitting at a nearby table klaus and claudia overhear their argument and needing a safe way of transporting their diamonds over the world decide to fool the children into delivering them for them they set up a race around the world where each team will have to deposit a doll in their own likeness filled with diamonds at drop offs around the world and receive a doll in the opposing team's likeness filled with the payment for the diamonds to that they were the winning team would then receive a 100 000 dollar reward they do this because they believe that jamal an interpol agent who has been hot on their heels for some times now would never suspect them because they are just kids however this seems to be redundant because on their travels the kids do not have to go through any security checks and are never even questioned about the dolls i suspect that neither would klaus or claudia if they had taken the diamonds there personally and so begins a great adventure this film is a classic and i see no reason why anyone would not like it it features great animation and top notch voice acting not to mention the kick ass music pardon my french p my favorite song is without a shred of doubt ''the girls and boys of rock and an amazing rock song that cannot be topped it's also my favorite moment in the film other notable songs include kind of suggestive for a kid's film eh and as well as and to see the not to mention the main theme of the movie heard during the opening credits performed by the royal london philharmonic orchestra the scene with still brings a tear to my eye in relation to the song i first didn't think anything of it but when i grew older and learned about life it became clear that that song was a little bit suggestive that song along with the fact that the animators insist on the audience knowing the color of the panties this is especially apparent in the scene in egypt when the are being chased by the arabian prince's men when eleanor leans over the side of the hot air balloon basket and her skirt defies gravity completely while this does nothing to draw from the overall quality of the film it's one of those unexplained things like why nobody in the world seems to mind that there are 4 feet tall chipmunks walking around and speaking in incredibly high pitched voices and treat them just like they would any human child anyway a bit after that scene the discover the diamonds in the dolls and decide to go find the chipmunks and get home the direction of janice perfects this movie as she and her husband ross jr know the characters better than anyone they even do the voices of the chipmunks and the ross doing the voices for alvin and simon as well as dave and janice doing the voices for all the and theodore speaking of male characters that are voiced by female voice actresses nancy cartwright the voice of bart simpson makes an appearance in this movie she plays the part of the arabian prince a very small but important role the ending is of course a happy one the crooks have been caught the loose ends tied and the film ends when the children dave and miss miller are driving into the sunset alvin complaining about not having gotten his 100 000 dollar reward for winning the race which annoys dave until he finally yells '' and the screen fades to black br br classic ending by the way i hope you found my review of this movie useful and if you haven't seen this flick give it a watch it's worth the money this nostalgic classic from the 80's gets a solid 10 out of 10 br br for the top don't you know we never stop believing now''
<START> legend has it that at the gala hollywood premiere screening of 2001 a space odyssey about 20 minutes into the film rock hudson yelled out would somebody please tell me what the hell this movie is about well i have rock beaten by about 19 minutes 59 seconds this movie made absolutely no sense at all who were those people where were those people what were the rules of the game called quintet are there any rules to quintet were robert altman and his cohorts making the movie up as they went along what was paul newman thinking when he signed on to this maybe ol' fast eddie saw zardoz and thought well if connery can get involved in a futuristic film that makes no sense so can i maybe the good stuff is on the cutting room floor and all we get to see is the incoherent stuff also did all the cast get to keep their individual funny hats you never saw such bizarre looking hats all in one place in your life quintet just confirms what i've always thought when altman's good he's superb but when he's bad he makes stuff like quintet
<START> captain mandolin is a beautiful film with a lovely cast including the wonderful nicolas cage who as always is brilliant in the movie the music in the film is really nice too i'd advise anyone to go and see it brilliant 10 10
<START> the dvd jacket in which this movie came describes it as uplifting and humorous those are not the words i would have chosen not by a long shot i would choose a word like sombre sometimes even depressing which isn't to say that it's a bad movie it's actually a pretty good movie featuring good performances from the leads with enough uncertainty throughout about what's going to happen at the end that you keep watching the uncertainty comes from the structure of the movie it seems to revolve around ellen's reminiscences of her mother's slow death from cancer as she is interviewed by the da so we know from the start that something suspicious happened at the end the questions are what and who br br renee zellweger was very good as ellen the somewhat resentful daughter who has to give up her life and job in new york to return home to care for her sick mother ellen evolves through the movie moreso than any other character as she learns to deal with both the strengths and weaknesses of her parents her relationship with her father william hurt is quite interesting my initial impression was that they were quite close but the warts in the relationship start to show after a while hurt was effective as the detached husband detached not in an uncaring way but in the sense of being unable to cope with what's happening to his wife and seeking escape from it in various ways finally meryl streep as the cancer stricken kate was very convincing in the role seeking to live out what remains of her life in the most fulfilling way possible then dealing with the anger she feels at her increasing in a way watching a family deal with this kind of crisis reminded me a little bit of ordinary people although this movie was far less emotionally intense so not uplifting and humorous with all due respect to whoever wrote the synopsis on the dvd jacket but very good in its own way 7 10
<START> doesn't anyone bother to check where this kind of sludge comes from before on about its supposed revelations ask yourself a question is my skull an open bucket that i allow anyone to dump their propaganda into do yourself a favor and take a look at the bomb shelter mentality of com before you waste your time with this screed br br these sorts of mother earth people's republic of berkeley that openly despise a way of life only because it doesn't match theirs must believe their case fails miserably on facts and objectivity else why resort to willful distortion and blatant one pathetic br br don't be a sap take two seconds and cast a skeptical eye before falling for yet more 'end of the world' hysteria from it takes a village types with a political agenda that's probably even to the left of your own mi moore rather his unthinking followers have really opened the floodgates with this kind of one sided political trash passed off as a cough documentary but apparently they understand the sentiment of an ever gullible public if it's on a movie screen it must be true br br god gave you a brain act like you know what you're supposed to do with it
