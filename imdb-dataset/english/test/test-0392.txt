<START> john huston was seriously ill when he made his final achievement and it's thoroughly his testament uncompromising difficult a thousand miles away from crazes and fashions it will stand as the best last film you can ever dream of a very austere screenplay no action no real hero but a group of people coping with the vanity of life the fleeting years and death the party doesn't delude people for long admittedly warmth and affection from the songs and the meal complete with turkey and pudding but the passage of time has partly ruined julia's voice first crack in the mirror then the camera leaves the room where the guests are gathered and searches the old lady's bedroom for sure hers seems to have been a happy life but it's a life inexorably coming to an end a shot shows towards the end of the movie julia on her future deathbed maybe an unfulfilled life because she remained a spinster with no children to carry on only some poor things yellowish photographs and but are a human being's hopes and dreams all fulfilled look at gretta she 's a married woman about thirty five she's still beautiful and healthy but she knows something is broken what julia is today she will be tomorrow that's why in her stream of consciousness she goes back to her past only to find out how harrowing her memories are a young man committed suicide for her a symbol of her youth now waning the final monologue if we listen closely to it involves us all in this eternal tragedy the doomed to failure human condition john huston's masterly lesson
<START> when it was released in the beginning of the 80's pixote brings to brazilian society the problems of young delinquents and the impact of this in brazilian society i can't watch the movie at that time cause i was too young but now i got a chance and watched it a few days ago it's a very brutal movie but everything is absolutely true and sad pixote is the name of a 12 year old boy who lives in the streets and survive with he stays for a while in a house of detention and when he left it he continues to plan robs with other buns and a prostitute played by the boy is still a marijuana addicted and smell glue with another teenagers to forget his sad reality the quality of the images it's not the best but the movie is totally realistic about brazilian problems and must be viewed and admired
<START> jean renoir's homage to the paris of the late 19th century is beautiful in many ways not only does it appear to have been photographed by toulouse lautrec and it portrays the geographic paris the streets accessible only by staircases the unpleasant end of fleeting popularity and the sexual opportunism of men with a product to sell in an uncompromising picture of show business that is in stark contrast with the picture painted by hollywood there is an obvious comparison to be made with lloyd bacon's 42nd street which had been made about 20 years before featuring ruby keeler as a dancing sensation a fresh faced kid from the sticks who had come to new york to get into show business who saves the show when the star fails you're going out there a kid from the chorus but you've got to come back a star warner baxter's julian marsh is a director who suffers for his art and is unappreciated jean keeps running afoul of genital politics but when he talks about the show he is more like than like julian marsh he's all about the game except for his pointy thing he has a profitable new venture up until his mistress become jealous of the woman whom she recognizes as his next mistress his prospects rise and fall with every coital journey he takes br br takes mistress 1 lola de castro played by maria felix slumming to a dive where he sees franÃ§oise with her boyfriend and first lover paulo the baker and discovers that she is a spirited dancer he uses his charm and the prospect of money to lure to studying dancing so that she may go on the stage the prospect of money and fame charms and she become next mistress as well as an apt student of the cancan which has dubbed french cancan to cater to the current anglophile tendency in the dance br br both 42nd st and french cancan are tributes to show business to modern entertainment that has is own iconography and its own conceit 42nd st is centered around julian marsh a great director of broadway shows which he organizes with great personal energy and dubious sexual involvement the male juvenile is a middle aged twit with replaced by dick powell the pretty tenor with secret wealth to hide on the other hand goes from woman to woman seducing them with the promise of fame hooking them with what must have been a very persuasive endowment one has no doubt that he is heterosexual and quite active scenes abound br br days after seducing away from paulo he has discovered esther a piaf type and begun to prepare her for her job of singing the film's theme song while he plays it on her fiddle that of course arouses jealousy just as she has aroused the jealousy of lola and of course had already the privilege of being a the whole movie is about how has cost him money but how even his troublesome horniness is subordinate to his love for the show how the audience demands devotion and it is this potent combination of phallic persuasion and tempting fame that makes the hero while asserting that a true lover of the show will never profit as much as the money men at the movie's conclusion having the creditors and the jealous babes approaches a new attraction watching the incredible and believe me it is incredible performance of the cancan have you ever thought about being on the stage he asks and the curtain descends meanwhile poor julian is sitting of the fire escape of the theatre listening to peggy new fans disparage his contribution to the show's success i won't even go into 42nd street 's central line oh guy it was grand of you to come br br furthermore i won't go into the glimpse one gets of legendary parisian entertainers including a brief vision of piaf nor of the vision of a paris both urban and rural certainly there is a sample of the styles that engendered and but it is the memoir of an assertive and welcome masculinity something unseen in any hollywood musical with which it might be compared is a pleasant relief from the of 30's hollywood musicals including my beloved fred astaire not to mention dick powell let alone the barf promulgated by mgm in movies like the repulsive american in paris all those fountains we'll save our comparison of that turkey to breakfast at tiffany's and its deconstruction of the american male for another day br br that may have been a hopeful vision in postwar france of a kind of hyper masculine that may or may not have ever existed is practically beside the point that he is a man's man neither john wayne nor edward everett horton is perhaps more on target that he is a man who likes the ladies is never in question i for one wouldn't mind living his life at all i wonder if gabin was that lucky br br at the beginning of this comment i wanted to talk about baz and what sinclair lewis called i never got that far moulin rouge well paris doesn't put that kind of stuff in the seine anymore
<START> i love dissing this movie my peers always try their best to defend it probably out of love for quentin tarantino or harvey keitel but they'll never convince me that this one should be treasured here's some huge reasons why a the plot goes from kidnapping road trip movie to vampire inhabited strip bar slasher flick with no set up whatsoever suddenly something very real turns into something very fake which is like sitting the audience down to a thanksgiving feast then exploding it with dynamite b that untalented juliette lewis is in it c preposterous ideas abound such as actual torso and leg guitars brothers with the last name gecko bad vampire make up jobs cheech marin playing three characters and a crotch based gun that only fires when erect and belongs to a guy who goes by sex machine if robert rodriguez didn't pathetically try to be so innovative with his violence i might've had fun with this obvious popcorn flick the whole like he got the ideas by playing with action figures the only thing even close to being considered my favorite scene is george clooney's laugh out loud cheesy monologue after he kills his blood sucking horny for children terrible acting brother i swear i think they thought it up right then and there this movie's out to offend and ends up offending those who want the offensive horrible movie
<START> you've got to be kidding this movie sucked for the sci fi fans i would only recommend watching this only if you think armageddon was good
<START> my guess is that the producers of this low budget space horror film wanted a serious movie but the director had his heart set on a parody so this is what we get set in an abandoned spaceship 1000 years in the future and peopled with characters and props right out of the 90's the set is some industrial complex maybe an oil tanker whatever they use is as is so the controls consist racks of old tv equipment one location is obviously the employees lunchroom and sports an old tv and vcr as well as a water cooler with plastic tiny lister and coolio get the best lines arguing throughout the story the dialog is packed with terms that are pretty dated even now a ok daddy o but then maybe the 30th century is very retro when the captain declares the ships cargo is a load of coffins from the transylvania station you know this is all a put on its a bit of alien part jasonx shameless rip off of all the best sci fi and horror titles at one point casper even tells his pilot to make it so with a straight face this film would have been better if they had just let everyone run with the satire but they keep attempting to make the story serious maybe the backers were on the set that day anyway not a bad boredom killer if you aren't too picky fx are as good as the sets are bad
<START> i had nothing to do before going out one night so i didn't want to watch anything too heavy i picked the perfect film this must have been a gift to barrymore from someone she slept with the director raja has made nothing but silly crap and the writing on this one is just atrocious in what high school can you register without a parent present and no proof of age or former schooling they let kids all come to the prom with no shirts in skin tight leotards ass shorts and one girl was dressed as eve wearing only fig leaves she announces that she's 25 and her brother is 23 but there is no from the school parents or lawsuits of any kind against the newspaper for fraud or spying the newspaper boss wants to catch the teacher in an underage sex scandal but doesn't realize the teacher is coming on to a 25 year old so any case would be entrapment they allow a camera in and record peoples private conversations with under age kids i wonder if i hired my younger sister to go back to hs with a camera on her and filmed under age girls for my personnel use i would not get in some kind of trouble no problem didn't she have to take gym or go to the bathroom at some point the secondary characters in this were like cardboard cutouts of what high school students are thought to be and everybody was a stereotype jessica alba is just embarrassingly bad in this mugging for the camera at every chance in what world do the parents not get suspicious when their uber geeky daughter is miraculously asked out by the school stud to the prom and they don't ask the guy inside to meet him like every other parent in history if some guy in my school or any other school for that matter had conned my sister and thrown eggs at her in her prom dress he would have been in a body cast for the rest of his life this movie is so contrived and predictable it's nauseating and why at the end is everybody the alpo girls included cheering for this chick when two days before they hated her br br dumb dumb and dumb
<START> stephen seagal plays the role of a dude who gets talked into driving an armored car for a bank hold up and drives into everything that comes across his path however the police seem to appear on the scene very quickly and seagal smells a rat who gave the police advanced notice the story gets into many twists and turns and the money from the hold up has disappeared and nobody knows its new owner poor seagal gets a bit framed into this hold up and naturally he is out looking for the person or persons who are trying to put him away for a long time in this film seagal tries to be a good guy but the forces of evil are against him unfortunately this is not a great film and rather boring and too long
<START> the voyage here is a search for god the big guy in the sky the big cheese with a beard cunningly disguised as the thirst for ultimate knowledge taking over from leonard nimoy in the directing chair is the shat himself captain william shatner kirk in an attempt at blending the fun corny aspects of the series with sci fi histrionics klingon dialogue consultant really shatner and his co writers have only achieved what is almost an embarrassing parody of a parody where's the danger where's the brothers in arms spirit in fact where is our badly underwritten crew star trek humour is a wonderful thing when it's in the right places and done with a straight lace so befitting what has come before the final frontier some light moments exist but they do not compensate for the lack of serious moments while do we really need another spock revelation really br br some nice sets and little knowingly trek moments aside the final frontier is just a bad movie experience 3 10
<START> bad movie bad go stand in a discount bin carrot top should really stick to low lit comedy clubs it's movies like this that make old jerry lewis films look like shakespeare and john agar like john barrymore thorne smith a fine talent is absolutely wasted her purpose seems mainly to look pretty and oblivious br br the only enjoyable things about the movie is seeing raquel welch doing an alexis carrington type role and estelle harris as a harridan of a landlady the only way i can imagine someone thinking it would be a good idea to make this beyond sophomoric film is if the producers' fourth grade child was allowed to pick the script well maybe his third grader what this film really needs is to be rubbed in the noses of its creators
<START> as much as i hate to disagree with the original poster i found asterix and the vikings quite good and a huge step above previous attempts at animating everyone's favorite br br for someone not familiar with the famous comic series the show would be hard to follow but for those of us in the know it's a pleasure to watch br br first and foremost the animation is far superior to earlier comic adaptations you can tell they took the time and effort to really recapture the look and feel of the comics this time around br br as mentioned there are elements of other asterix titles in the movie and i can see how fans of those titles might feel confused or a bit let down but i was so caught up in actually seeing one of my favorite childhood comics faithfully represented on the screen any qualms i had were minor by comparison minor spoilers follow br br asterix and his faithful friend travel north to rescue the nephew of their village chief who has been captured by the vikings the vikings think that by the boy teaching them about fear they will be able to fly thanks to some poorly worded advice from their village druid in the process the boy meets the viking chief's daughter abba and they fall in love etc etc etc if my explanation sounds convoluted don't worry the plot is easy to follow definitely a great buy you can purchase this dvd through amazon france but be warned your dvd player probably won't be able to play it i had to change the region setting on my computer to view it
<START> i knew the premise of this film and obviously i can't miss a good sounding film especially from master of suspense director sir alfred hitchcock basically tennis champ guy haines farley granger meets eccentric stranger bruno anthony robert walker on a train travelling from washington to new york bruno talks about a perfect murder guy hates his wife and bruno hates his father so bruno suggests swapping murders guy obviously didn't take him seriously until of course when guy's wife miriam joyce haines kasey rogers or laura elliott is found murdered in an amusement park guy of course is the chief suspect and bruno keeps bumping into him reminding him of their plan and giving him more things to help him kill the father he wants dead this murder enquiry and bruno's stalking are threatening his tennis career and his relationship with the daughter of sen morton north by leo g carroll anne ruth roman bruno realises that guy won't do his murder so he decides to plant the evidence at the crime scene to make him guilty guy's cigarette lighter at the amusement park after his tennis game guy and anne who obviously found out the murder plan race to the amusement park to stop bruno and they have a fight on the speeding out of control carousel also starring patricia hitchcock the director's daughter as barbara morton marion lorne as mrs anthony jonathan hale as mr anthony howard st john as police capt turley and john brown as prof collins and hitchcock's cameo is the man boarding train carrying a double bass some interesting dialogue and character interactions some good suspense moments and of course the unforgettable carousel finale a good classic film it was nominated the oscar for best cinematography sir alfred hitchcock was number 75 on the 100 greatest pop culture icons the film was number 32 on 100 years 100 thrills very good
<START> many people remember the waco standoff that occurred a long time ago what most people probably have ingrained in their minds is the cult leader david and the images of the compound burning to the ground after a long standoff a lot of people have the belief that was some kind of madman who thought he was god he was accused of being a child molester and was credited for the breakdown and deaths of his followers furthermore many people feel the cult committed mass suicide when the fbi stormed mount center and when the building was burning most people feel the cult was at fault for not agreeing with the fbi on reasonable terms most people feel the cult was brainwashed by and followed along with everything that he said nothing could be farther from the truth because of strong evidence after the nightmare was over and this one of a kind documentary pretty much proves it br br this documentary is one of the most balanced examinations at the situation that occurred it is much more thorough and highly detailed than anything most people have received in the mainstream media to the shock of many people this documentary will reveal that is was the the fbi and the higher levels of the united states government who were the ones who were unjust cruel and deceptive and not david and his followers what and davidians were doing was just protecting their constitutional rights and the higher powers completely violated and raped those rights the aft had no grounds to storm the compound it was the aft that shot first and they shot from the helicopters from above at unarmed men women and children what is even more shocking is the actions of the fbi when they entered the mount watch it for yourselves and you will develop and new perspective on the u s government there is infrared footage that clearly shows the fbi was shooting with machine guns at the men women and children in the burning compound it will make your blood boil it will make you really angry it will make you wonder as to what kind of people run this country finally it will make you wonder as to what you are being told on the news every night is the whole truth and nothing but the truth this video is frightening and i highly recommend it if one can find it this documentary does not need to be purchased it can be watched for free on google video
<START> i always believed that a film that's plot is centred around a virtual reality video game never sounds as though it's going to be anything special but proved i couldn't have been more wrong this film is unbelievable and whilst highly entertaining offers so much more than that from start to finish this film has you to the point where you can have so many ideas you can not make a final conclusion david cronenberg has a talent for this as he does so many things br br is pure cronenberg the way it's written and the way it's directed is very unique to his style and that can only be a good thing cronenberg set himself a clear target with this film and that was to keep the audience guessing which he did with apparent ease his fondness for the grotesque is not as predominant in this film as it is in the fly or naked lunch but there are still some elements such as the game pods and how they are made that can make the audience wince with regards to his earlier work is more a combination of videodrome and a less violent scanners a pretty awesome combination setting the film in the not too distant future was a really good decision as it allowed cronenberg to be extremely imaginative with the films surroundings and also enabled him to visualise more concepts allowing for less inhibited writing it was important that the film didn't become over confusing and cronenberg avoided this very well by keeping things relatively simple besides if he wanted to make an unwatchable film he'd know how to do it a lot better than this br br boasts an extremely talented cast of character actors and all perform very well jennifer jason leigh gives the standout performance as the game designer who spends more time out of reality than in to it leigh is sexy and commanding in her role as and she really gets her teeth in to the role the emotional range she shows in the film is particularly impressive making her completely believable if you can believe anything jude law is also good and is very convincing in his character's fear of implantation the chemistry between these two is very electric and gives the film an extra bit of flavour ian holm and willem dafoe are just two of the great actors in support who add further depth to the film with very colourful performances the cast of the film isn't huge but definitely has the 'quality is better than ethic which works very well br br as well as being entertaining and thought provoking touches social issues such as control and loss of self this further demonstrates the film as an intellectual vessel and could also explain why it wasn't a huge hollywood hit has so much to offer and although it isn't to everyone's taste those who like cronenberg's work or who like science fiction will almost be certain to like this film it is one of those films that needs to be watched with an open mind but it really is something special
<START> the governess is a moody period piece the meandering story of a jewish woman who upon the death of her father sets out to 1830's scotland posing as a gentile to get work to support her family in london br br rosina or mary as she calls herself in a none too subtle piece of symbolic writing is a rudderless child a socialite with dreams of being an actress she strikes up an alliance with her employer and by accident solves a crucial problem in his research with photography giddy with success they begin a halting and uncomfortable affair while the eldest son of her paramour falls hopelessly and inexplicably in love with her br br and like a child she fails to understand the consequences of her actions in the end betraying those she deceived in order to make a life for herself br br many claim this is something of a feminist manifesto but i disagree whether intended or not this film only resonates with me if i think of it as a cautionary tale in the end greatest disappointment is the truth that she lied happened upon a way to help a man she wanted to be both her father and her lover and in the end contributed nothing but destruction as such the end of the film gives me the impression that nothing she did no one she used made her happy and that is exactly as it should be br br did i need a movie this long and to teach me this lesson not at all on the contrary had it not been for excellent cinematography unique score and my hope that she'd get her come uppance i wouldn't have stuck with it to the end of the film br br fans of minnie driver will likely be disappointed by her uneven performance but may wish to see it anyway i doubt young female fans of jonathan rhys meyers will be able to stay awake for the payoff they expect and i can't help thinking this holds too little cultural detail to be of interest even to photography buffs the 3 points i award the film are solely for its visual style and score on the strength of their other work i assume the actors' performances are so disappointing because of a poor script and worse directing but they are in the end unremarkable
