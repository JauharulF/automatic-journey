<START> though the video technology may be dated this classic musical play now on dvd is the best version of sondheim's most important and polished work on broadway if you've never seen sweeney todd then you must buy this dvd i saw this production in november 1980 at kennedy center in washington and fell in love with a pre murder she wrote angela lansbury subsequently i tried to find any and all of her work among them movies the harvey girls the picture of dorian gray manchurian candidate cds mame dear world and gypsy and many more the rest of the cast is flawless too all in all this wonderful dvd gives us the definitive version of sondheim's opera
<START> although i had previously watched this one some time ago on italian tv i found it to be a surprisingly tolerable potboiler this time round buoyed by an international cast of familiar faces including a bemused joseph cotten as the baron and contrary to many another film of the euro cult sub genre an incident packed plot in place of lethargic pacing br br the creature itself looks a bit dodgy and cotten is a bit too old to be taken seriously as an eager scientist still dabbling in creating life forms out of corpses one would have thought that he would have made himself an army of them by now and not struggling at perfecting his technique still but ms neri does look good in and out of costume and reliable herbert probably comes off best as a lecherous grave robber blackmailer
<START> this is the worst of the toxie series by far the acting in tokyo is horrible and you can understand them about half the time the major problem with this film is all the sudden changes from the original like there's a different girl friend of in this one or it might be the same character just with a different name and played by a different chick why is this film made like a disney movie after about fifteen minutes it starts getting good with the gore and all there's 2 awesome killings then the movie goes straight to poop after the films 20 minutes are up the film is entertainment h ll it's watchable well unless your drunk then don't watch this film you've been warned
<START> according to this masterpiece of film script pun intended charles darwin was full of nonsense when he presented his evolution theory because he made absolutely no mention of any alien intervention for you see aliens sent to the earth and they form the missing link in the evolution theory however the rest of the film clearly seems to emphasize that are a typically puerto rican phenomenon so i don't really know where that fits in are they saying all puerto ricans are aliens whatever it's all pretty irrelevant anyway the only thing you need to memorize is that el is an utterly cheap and imbecilic amateur b movie lacking tension character development and any form of style several duos of people are chasing this goat munching monster remotely resembling the midget version of the pumpkinhead demon through the streets and ghettos of an ugly city we have an untalented and a nagging female novelist a pair of obnoxious cops and the supposedly evil scientist with his dim witted accomplice since they all are extremely incompetent in what they do the monster can carelessly carry on devouring all the latino immigrants of the neighborhood the monster itself looks okay and the make up effects on his victims' leftovers are acceptably gross and bloody the acting performances are irredeemably awful and headache inducing particularly eric alegria is pitiable in his first and only lead role as the overly ambitious employee of animal control yes it's an incredibly stupid film but surely you have struggled yourself through worse and less amusing low budget garbage
<START> this movie is specially for children and i think they will enjoy the movie for older than 10 the movie is not great but hilary swank played very well and without her the movie is very bad but now it gets a 7
<START> i saw this film in a sneak preview and it is delightful the cinematography is unusually creative the acting is good and the story is fabulous if this movie does not do well it won't be because it doesn't deserve to before this film i didn't realize how charming shia lebouf could be he does a marvelous self contained job as the lead there's something incredibly sweet about him and it makes the movie even better the other actors do a good job as well and the film contains moments of really high suspense more than one might expect from a movie about golf sports movies are a dime a dozen but this one stands out br br this is one i'd recommend to anyone
<START> this movie was sooooooo sloooow and everything in it was bland the acting the plot etc it was such a disappointment since the description looked so good do not be fooled this movie is not worth the time it takes to watch it
<START> ah yes it's yet another retelling of the classic sociopathic murderous doctor creates female frankenstein and falls in love br br from the same director who brought you such timeless classics as 10 000 maniacs no not the group and blood feast this unfinished film virtually cries out for the mst3k treatment the doctor's assistant even has overtones of from the classic manos the hands of fate i don't know if the graphic if fake looking violence or the frequent stretches of dialogue free tedium could have scared the crew off though br br the main reasons to bother sitting through this movie are for the hysterical scene the laughably serious ending and the rock bottom production values i actually watched all of the credits after this movie for the same reasons you're inclined to slow down your car when you pass a serious traffic accident that and the sheer genius of the end theme that sounds like a watered down my favorite things played on a toy piano goblin this ain't
<START> i absolutely loved this movie great realistic looking combat footage for one thing and a touching genuine story also the calm understated manner of the lead character makes him very likable the human relationships in the story seemed so very typical and possible of what you could expect in war time the bond between and carel shows the loyalty wartime comrades can have for each other and that is often described in books and interviews with veterans the subtitles do not detract from the story at all and actually serve to underline the problems the czech pilots had in the raf the postwar storyline is a great reminder that for many the suffering of ww2 did not end in 1945 especially in russian occupied countries the cinematography was also very good wish i could have seen it on the big screen
<START> growing up in the late 60s and 70s i could not help but become a fan of science fiction with america's space program in top gear sci fi books movies tv shows and comic books fueled my imagination and opened my mind to the possibilities that exist in the universe farscape is so unlike any other sci fi show yet it has all the ingredients that made shows like star trek battlestar x files and deep space nine personal favorites one of the criticisms of farscape is that the casual viewer can't just jump in and watch one episode and understand what is going on there have been other very successful shows that used multiple episode story arcs and complicated characters this for me is one of the charms of the show i don't need or want to have the story all tied up neatly at the end of every episode like the various incarnations of star trek have done all in all farscape has wonderful and funny characters and a running storyline that says that although humans may be the least evolved or advanced intelligent species in the universe they still have unique qualities and abilities br br unfortunately the shortsighted people at the sci fi channel have canceled 5th season they have stated that the cancellation was based on sagging ratings yet just a few years ago it was their top rated original series and a critical favorite it's a shame that all of the artists who help create this show will be unable to continue their labor of love because of the fiscal problems of the very channel company that made it all possible in the first place br br hey don't take my word for it watch the show watch the re runs and make up your own mind help save farscape
<START> a widely unknown strange little western with mindblowing colours probably the same material as it was used in johnny guitar i guess or something which makes blood drips look like shining nearly surrealistic scenes with twisted action and characters something different far from being a masterpiece but there should be paid more attention to this little gem in western encyclopedias
<START> the evil gang in this movie were called the savages hence the title but minor would have been a better name for this sorry mob of weak actors trying to look dangerous whenever they wanted to kill someone they generously rode their bikes very slowly so that their intended victim could easily avoid them or push them off their bikes their leader had a bad limp but still thought he could take on the hero and win as for karen black she didn't seem to know where she was for most of the film
<START> the greatest game ever played 2005 is an amazingly uplifting infectious underdog film that never really devolves into sappiness or yes it takes several liberties as most hollywood films do but those liberties are forgiven as they actually add to the film's enjoyment not detract from it in fact there are a lot of truthful moments in it you can really tell that it's a rocky type film from the film's outset but who cares directed by none other than bill paxton i know right it's expertly done and immensely watchable br br tells the story of francis played with confidence cockiness and class by superstar to be shia labeouf an amateur golfer from a working class irish french immigrant family living in ma in the early 1900s qualifies to play in the 1913 u s open included amongst his competition is the legendary harry played with immense class dignity and ferocity by stephen ironically is the 2nd underdog in this flick the film starts in 1870s scotland where land developers tell the youngster that they are building a golf course on his home and that golf is a game not for the likes of someone like him francis undergoes some of the same prejudice as a boy in early 1900s the stories converge at the 1913 open br br what's ironic is that even as an adult and multiple major champion is still an outcast in british society due to his upbringing francis learned much about golf from reading books on the subject and is his idol all growing up unbeknownst to they actually met back in 1900 in boston after who won that year's open was touring when francis was only 7 br br in addition to francis and in the 1913 open include friend and champion brit ted ray boisterous stephen marcus and classless chest thumping two time defending champion john mcdermott michael weaver the film really does a good job of showing the different personalities of these men br br redheaded marnie is serene and stunning as francis' supportive irish mum and veteran elias koteas gives a stern reserved taciturn performance as his french dad plucky young josh flitter as francis' pint sized 10 year old caddy eddie almost single handedly steals the proceedings br br paxton throws in a lot of modern details such as special effects zooming in shots to show the positioning of the players and cgi for a lot of the golf shots to keep the film exciting and at a brisk pace so as not to make the film too much of a period piece but the film still convinces us of a specific time and place br br what's interesting is that while rocky like this is all based on a true story so the ending is satisfactory on so many levels an entertaining film about golf set in the early 1900s wow
<START> well folks this is another stereotypic of gay life however the additional downside includes poor acting horrible script no budget terrible sound and let us not forget the impossible storyline br br it is christmas in new york city and our story immediatly focuses on two male individuals apparently lovers for some time one of them has not let his parents the right wing religious zealot types know that he is gay adding to the of the story 'cause this guy is as as gay guys come these days and his parents are coming to him they will stay in his new york apartment where he and his lover have just decorated for christmas br br the story continues to develop around the arrival of the parents who noone will like anyway and how through only obvious and predictable ways they come to learn there son is gay tears are shed as was my interest in this movie br br the cast of charecters seemed like an intro acting course at the local community theatre the lovers in this film are mismatched and there does not appear to be any cohesion to their union br br the landlord is flat and her attempt to be humanistic in the situation are undercooked and certainly didnt help move the plot any further br br the friend who steps to the aid of one of the lovers in his time of need is stereotypic and gives a bad name to the unique art of drag br br although some guys night find one of the lovers to have a nice body again stereotypic imagery it does not help this story br br stay away from this film especially if you are considering a purchase you'll shoot yourself if you do
<START> this film has a brilliant soundtrack and superb acting from some pretty unknown faces i especially like the welsh bad boy characters in it who strut around like american rappers acting tough the banter between jip and is brilliant they come across as being best mates almost as if it were true in real life i have experienced some of the things in this film and let me tell you first hand these folks ain't acting especially the seen with jip and talking and snorting coke danny dyer is priceless as the 'party dealer and has the funniest lines in the film br br i'm happiest when i'm off my pickle feeling the music you get me i knew you wouldn't let me down i knew it
