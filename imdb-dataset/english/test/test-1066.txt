<START> my wife and i loved this film smart dialogue great characters clever plot construction the pacing in this film is non stop couldn't even get to the kitchen for some munchies we have never seen corey feldman this funny taylor nichols plays a good fed my wife loves him on that married man hbo show the ensemble cast were all strong the twist at the end had us cheering that is why we give this film a standing o
<START> the imdb plot summary erroneously makes it sound like it is noah taylor's movie when fairuza balk is the central character it is unbelievable how such a cast of established actors could have been in such an amateurish pointless non movie balk breaks up with boyfriend taylor sleeps with the devil i guess played by dempsey and accidentally kills taylor who follows her about for the rest of the movie as a ghost may be the worst movie i have ever seen
<START> this htv series is beautiful i strongly recommend watching the movie it has got everything it should remarkable script strong characters beautiful scenery and exceptional atmosphere add some ambient score from and you receive unforgettable picture i love every adventure movie from htv i saw return to treasure island smuggler adventurer but robin of sherwood beats them all i would like to thank the whole htv production team and richard carpenter in particular for giving me plenty of adventures and excitement i have got the dvd release in my little movie collection i regret very much movies like these are not made anymore
<START> there are spoilers but trust me i'm doing you a favor br br my friends and i like to watch crappy movies every so often inspired by mystery science theater and our knack for on the spot jokes we set out to find movies worth watching that are in fact not worth watching however trouble comes into paradise when these movies can only be found if you buy them and i am a firm believer in not giving one cent to such a group of talentless scumbags so as another reviewer has said films like this are a reason why downloading movies for free should be legalized i prefer the idea of instead of straight to video you have straight to internet that way the ass bags who made this travesty won't ever turn a profit which unfortunately you know they do they hire a bunch of actors who can't act special effects from a high school classroom rubber snakes you can get at the dollar store constant vomiting of green jell o and the two main characters who seem to switch between being border jumping mexicans who only speak spanish to arabs to being 100 fluent in english random nudity a guy being shot like 10 times including one to the side of the head and living and the most retarded ending in the history of film book cave drawings and hustler magazine the fact that i actually predicted that the jell o puking snake girl would actually transform into a snake about half way through terrifies me br br anyways the movie is great to make fun of but you have to make sure there's at least 4 of you and you're all spitting out jokes in rapid fire because if there's even 1 second of watching this movie where you're not laughing your ass off you will feel physically ill i kid you not my friends and i were eating chicken wings and now i can't even look at such a thing anymore without being reminded of this piece of sh t br br this film is one above alien vs hunter which is by far the second worst movie ever made and i've seen lots of bad movies incidentally it's the same production company as this film and that bald guy is in both as well just thought you might like to know that little fun fact 100 out 0f 10
<START> i'd never thought that i would be caught saying this but i think dog the bounty hunter is more entertaining than this 90's era cop drama walker is very melodramatic and actually set a standard of the genre of high octane cop shows such as csi csi miami and so forth i'm not saying all these shows are bad but they aren't good either i like the karate chop action that walker dispenses on the enemies of justice and the diverse cast of characters as much as the science tech of the csi series but there are some elements that i hate in a show like this stereotypes that's right stereotypes unfortunately this is a show for the of red state america who refuse to part with the old prejudices of yore especially when it comes to crime for example there was an episode in which a kid with psychic powers ventures into dallas where he encounters group of kids in goth punk clothing and they start harassing him now this is exactly what middle america perceives the goth punk culture i mean come on how often do people that dress like that rob and steal from people just minding there own business whenever there are blacks and latinos in the plot it's always about gangs in some impoverished neighborhood okay not everyone who's a minority is a desperate recruit of a gang surrounded by crime drugs poverty again this is what middle red state america sees of these people finally why is the the bumbling sidekick can't you make the sidekick an equal ass kicker
<START> the movie is not bad in itself till you see the original movie hitch 2005 starring will smith the movie is a straight copy with even the dialogs for most part of the movie simply translated from english to hindi the plot in the original is tightly executed the hindi version fails to keep the viewers interested the over the top kind of comedy of david dhawan seems to have gone overboard with govinda hysterically shouting at all times sometimes more time is spent in understanding the reason for that than the plot br br if you know english which i assume you know given that you are reading this see the hollywood original at least watch hitch if you have watched partner to be able to compare this is the least we can do to support the creative geniuses whose work i am sad to say is shamelessly lifted by inspired people like david dhawan
<START> i have been watching this movie repeatedly since it came out even though it is 8 years old now it still cracks me up the jokes are still hilarious and the way the characters are portrayed will make anybody of any age laugh like they've never laughed before enjoy it
<START> long trailer whoever said that has got to be joking this has got to be one of the most in depth behind the scenes or making of documentary ever made how can it be a trailer when several minutes are spent telling the audience how the movie was conceptualized and then brought to the studios this documentary also spends lots and lots of time detailing how stunts were done and the new technologies created to achieve them then it shows us how woo team came up with the fight scenes along with blocking tapes that pretty much put to shame the actual scenes with the actors there is stuff mentioned about matrix reloaded but there's hardly anything really if you are a real fan of the matrix you have to see this documentary the original documentary in the dvd is good but incomplete compared to this one for instance it never explained why keanu wore a neck brace in the original documentary but that is explained in revisited the revisited dvd also shows carrie ann moss spraining her ankle during the lobby scene and being really distraught because she feels like she's letting the crew down and that's just the tip of the iceberg so ignore that just a long trailer review and go check it out for yourself you won't regret it casual matrix fans need not apply
<START> first of all let me underline that im not a great fan of political correctness in fact i like satire or dark humor even if it makes jokes out of minorities the reason why im pretty sure that this racist piece of work is not worth a look is that it doesn't make fun of minorities to demonstrate their condition of living their social circumstances or the way they are treated by society moreover it uses every stupid stereotype and prejudice to strengthen xenophobic feelings and reservations its really a pity but not a surprise that the other comments didn't get that point cause we all had a cheap laugh congratulations
<START> after the highs of darkplace it was never conceivable that and would be able to create anything half as good as garth yet i think that man to man in its own right is as good a show on the good episodes as darkplace i cant argue that 2 of the episodes really that good but the other 4 certainly make up for it if i had to pick 2 great episodes id go for driver steve pronounced pissing and the great garth to already have a bit of understanding of the programme is a real plus as dean learner makes many inside jokes but even if you have'nt seen much dean id recommend this as some of the rants he launches into are genius ie his argument with def over their name all in all a great show which just misses full marks because of the couple of less funny episodes
<START> this movie about a man on the run for killing a mobster is the kind of film you can watch entirely on fast forward once you know who's who and not lose a thing it has an attractive cast but the plot is a virtual writer's guide to cinema cliche and boy does the dialogue
<START> this film was brilliant i absolutely loved it wesley snipes was great for this role and i'm sure blade 2 would be just as good br br blade is by far one of my favorite action horror movies out there and if you havent seen it yet and like vampires and blood all that stuff you should really rent it because i assure you that you'll love it
<START> a mesmerizing film that certainly keeps your attention ben daniels is fascinating and courageous to watch
<START> i really enjoyed the patriot this movie had less violence and was based on a real life threat that could inevitably destroy our civilization one line in the movie from wesley mclaren seagal stuck out in my mind to be very true of our society western medicine is in the practice of prolonging illness and i am in the business of curing it br br
<START> the best thing about the prey is the tag line it's not human and it's got an axe the movie itself is a padded endless insect and wildlife shots make the viewer wanna die no slasher fan will like this garbage watch friday the 13th again and burn any copy of this film you find br br it also rates as one of the 25 worst films ever made
