<START> i am ashamed of myself that i actually went to the theatre to watch this movie when it was first released while i suppose its thinly veiled depiction of the aristotle onassis and jackie kennedy story is well enough done it's a movie that should never have been made in the first place hence my low rating br br the film chronicles the tale of a wealthy greek business shark called theo who woos and wins the lovely young widow liz cassidy of a slain american president sound familiar yes everything except the names br br the cast is not to be faulted anthony quinn plays the greek tycoon to perfection and at least it's some consolation having just read that ari himself requested quinn for the role jacqueline bisset is of course beautiful and sophisticated in the part of for all intents and purposes jackie and james franciscus has the all american good looks of the president br br i haven't seen this movie since it came out nor do i wish to see it again i seem to recall a fair bit of bad language and some general crudeness otherwise i suppose it's a sensational and supposedly intimate glimpse into the jet setting lives of the rich and famous frolicking aboard their yachts beaches pools etc yes the scenery of the greek islands is spectacular the best part of the movie br br of its type it's okay i suppose there are no end of tv movies about the kennedys which i confess to occasionally tuning in to and not to my credit this is basically just another far better to allow aristotle and jacqueline kennedy onassis to rest in peace
<START> the bothersome man is a smart surreal movie that makes you reevaluate what you're doing with your life and what makes you tick when you see these people in zombie like doing everyday events and realize that's what we do and what we want in real life it really hits close to home this is a surprisingly effective movie that at the end leaves you asking questions about your direction and not so much the movie br br andreas is the main character whose life we get a 3rd person view of as he tries to adapt to a new life after being relocated in the beginning he seems to be the most popular guy in town as everyone at work caters to him and he's invited to dinners etc a good example of this is in the scene with his new boss who offers him an envelope of an unspecified amount of cash saying here's a little something to get you started andreas even gets a girlfriend 20 minutes into the movie which he eventually moves in with this seems like an ideal living situation as his girlfriend is an established interior designer attractive and doesn't ever nag about anything he does but andreas is unfulfilled with their relationship as with everything else in this world he then begins an affair with a coworker named who he eventually leaves anne for and claims he is in love with after telling how he feels she tells him that she is also seeing other coworkers and says all of the relationships are nice soon after we see andreas at a train station where he tries to end his misery and to the audience's disappointment doesn't come about still looking for salvation andreas meets hugo who has found a hole which music can be heard coming out of so they embark on a mission to get to the other side will it be better or will it be worse br br the bothersome man shows us society's obsession with appearances and its materialistic mindset it does a great job making fun of us by filling homes with ikea products that the characters spend each lunch picking out i think he is mostly poking fun at the dull scandinavian society and its high suicide rates for example there is a scene in the movie where andreas comes across a man who jumped out of a building and onto a spiked fence also andreas fed up with this world cuts his finger off and then later jumps in front of a train this is one of the most weirdest outrageous scenes i've seen this world created by is equivalent to purgatory where there is no punishment or reward in this world drink after drink andreas never got drunk sex was unfulfilling and no matter how many times he tried he couldn't kill himself this movie reminded me of fight club and how both main characters were kind of out of sync with the world around them in fight club tyler durden creates a second persona that does everything he wouldn't and in this movie the awakened andreas is the equivalent to tyler durden after a while he wakes up and tries to escape the bland life he is now apart of by escaping through a hole in a wall br br does a great job with continuity in this movie meaning when a character has a half full cup in his hand and they cut away then come back they have the glass in the same hand and its not full or empty showing that the shot was done another day nowadays directors are more worried about the sound effects and overlook the little things like is that character wearing the bracelet on the same hand as yesterdays filming since i took tv production for three years in high school it's hard for me not to look for continuity or voice overs which drive me nuts does the little things well he's got great lighting in each shot never leaves you wondering why something is in a shot and brings about an interesting topic this film really worked for me because it not only mocks but the western society and what's wrong with it the only real issue i had was with the man who commits suicide by jumping on a spiked fence because you eventually find out this world has no death but he laid motionless forcing you to assume he was dead and this never gets answered in my opinion br br andreas is the only main character as others come and go and never do more than support his him his first girlfriend anne britt is an interior designer who at the surface seems perfect for him but eventually turns out to be dull this leads him to who he starts an affair with and falls in love with he soon finds out that she was with a handful of other men and that what he felt was not real andreas eventually meets hugo in the bathroom of a bar complaining about how nothing tastes good anymore and how he can't even get drunk anymore he follows hugo home to find the hole in the wall with that is filled with children's laughter and birds chirping br br doesn't have a lot on the resume but the bothersome man is more than a jump start to a great career but a preview of an up and coming director if this is any indication of his talent and potential as a story teller has a bright future and we can only hope that his future movies don't take so long to make it overseas for our viewing pleasure so take a seat and enjoy the ride as director jens takes you from the comfort of your home to the dreamlike world that is the bothersome man
<START> in the late sixties director sergio corbucci made four spaghetti westerns in a row the classics the mercenary the great silence the specialists and companeros three of these all except the specialists are constantly turning up on ten best lists when spaghetti westerns are rated until recently all i had seen was a very poor quality compilation with some english some italian a fuzzy picture and it was nearly incomprehensible now having seen a beautiful widescreen version with subtitles still in two languages however i can safely include the specialists in that group of four classics johnny halliday is very good as the charismatic hud a notorious hand with the gun returning to to investigate the death of his brother who was lynched by the townspeople for losing their savings it involves a voluptuous beauty who owns the bank a mexican bandit leader el diablo who was once friends with hud an honest sheriff who dreams of better days and a small band of hippies well it was the late sixties and hippies were everywhere even apparently in our westerns it's not a desert western shot in the alps somewhere and is lovely to look at there is a bit more nudity than i expect in a western but that's not a bad thing sylvie is lovely as sheba who may be niece or dead brother's girlfriend that's never made clear this film deserves to be seen and once again we plea for a nice dvd with all the trimmings i think the specialists would be as well known as any of other westerns and that's high praise indeed
<START> i took my 4 year old twins to see this movie today and i would not recommend it for children their age br br this movie had many fighting scenes throughout it which i found too violent and my children found scary br br the subject matter was way over my kids heads and the death scene was too scary for a cartoon geared towards children br br i was disappointed because we were all looking forward to seeing this but it just did not cut it if you have children under 7 years old i would not recommend this movie br br also the utter thing made me crazy during the entire movie
<START> recap a band of five young american men all that is left of a platoon hit hard during the offensive during the wwii get the assignment as a forward outpost and to look for enemy activity they're in really bad condition both physically and mentally and think they have struck gold when their outpost is in an abandoned but once plush mansion full with food but after a while there is some enemy activity and it is very odd not hostile but odd it seems like there is a german squad out there in equally bad condition that want nothing more than to surrender br br comments based on a novel and my guess that the novel is much better but the story doesn't seem to translate very well to the big screen indeed it is a different war movie much more about the mental pressure during than fighting and battles but i can almost feel that scenes that must have been full of suspense full of uncertainties and unknown elements just fall flat in the movie it is not suspenseful just different and in many ways absurd many times people just act insane and the reasons are unclear or at best hinted at br br so when this mental pressure fails to come through the main building piece of the entire story i thought the story fell through it wasn't good it wasn't interesting it didn't keep me on the edge and it didn't really send a message actually it did nothing br br the cast is interesting many young actors that then turned into stars in beginning of their careers the acting is good but not stellar and a few characters also fell through into the absurd zone much of that too i feel is due to that this story these characters need the time space and pace given in a novel that they can't be given here and going halfway definitely isn't good enough br br 4 10
<START> this is a solid underrated little thriller that has thrills a plenty with a cool story sandra bullock is terrific all the characters are great and i was surprised by how unpredictable it was as there were only a few predictable moments plus sandra bullock is simply amazing in this jeremy northam played an awesome villain and i know what bullock's character in this is all about because i'm kind of the same type of person i hardly ever go out plus this is pretty well made and written for the most part this should be higher then 5 5 in my opinion plus denis miller was surprisingly better then expected in his small role the scene where northam terrorizes bullock on his boat was quite suspenseful and was one of my favorite moments and i also liked the chase scene in the carnival plus i liked the ending too as it was quite well done even if i did think northam was defeated too quickly there are lots of other good chase scenes as well and it's also clever at times too plus there are quite a few shocking moments as well this is a solid underrated little thriller that has thrills a plenty with a cool story sandra bullock is terrific i highly recommend this one the direction is great irwin winkler does a great job here with excellent camera work adding good atmosphere good angles and keeping the film at a very fast pace the acting is fantastic sandra bullock is amazing as always and is amazing here she is extremely likable tough as nails yet quite vulnerable and i was able to feel for her because as i said i'm sort of like angela i hardly ever go out i really enjoyed her work in this movie bullock rules jeremy northam is excellent as the villain he was sneaky unpredictable and very menacing he was great dennis miller is surprisingly ok and non annoying in his small role and managed to bring some comic relief rest of the cast are fine overall i highly recommend this one 1 2 out of 5
<START> begotten is no doubt someone's attempt at originality but what we have here is art in its most morbid grotesque form so for that begotten has my respect but to be realistic it makes no difference what this abomination is about but for the record br br in the ultimate in incoherent horror we begin in an unknown time in an unknown place right off the bat we are plunged into the psychotic nightmare that is begotten a god is seemingly depressed mutilating himself with a razor i mean really trying like hell to end it all it takes a while why wouldn't it after this ultra morbid introduction something is happening something is rising from the corpse say hello to mother earth what does she do well she gives birth to a thing the thing would have probably preferred to stay in the womb but that's life the psychotic nightmare realm of begotten welcomes the thing the only way it knows how the thing along with mother earth is mutilated by unknown hooded assailants with evil intentions being the only clarity available from this point on things drag as they've never dragged before interesting grim images with a totally decent soundtrack is the high points of the remainder not to give the impression that i don't recommend this evilness because i do but only once and only for people with an appreciation for the dark side br br from my description it may appear that i don't get begotten trust me i get it and yes begotten is art if i've ever seen it everything in this film regardless of how unrelated it may seem is significant that perhaps is the only thing that makes begotten art with that said most of us require some form of entertainment value and this is coming from someone who enjoyed the chooper probably the most intriguing first five minutes i've seen in a film but let's be realistic the next 7 hours and 55 minutes would put one in a coma that is unless it's just meant for some kind of psychedelic purposes in that case never mind but how would one rate such a uniquely boring masterpiece depending on how much your attention span can take it should be either 1 or 10 any other number just wouldn't make a statement it hurts to do this but as far as entertainment value goes begotten just ain't it 1 1
<START> with awful movies like this one being even considered let alone being made it's very easy to see why hollywood is in such serious trouble with bad plots and worse remakes all the time br br i guess the viewer is supposed to be laughing their rear ends off over the 'black' in jokes the up' look and the it's so incredible 'over the top' and so bad that is even past the 'so bad it's funny again' mark and have plummeted right into 'totally embarrassing for anyone br br i'm very very sorry for every single minute i wasted on this one i want my time back br br save yourself the agony do not watch this the only reason for me to give even 1 point in the rating is that 0 wasn't an option
<START> hillary swank is an unattractive piece of work in this unattractive piece of work of a film pat morita desperate for work any kind of work agreed to reprise his role as the karate teacher and bring his brand of karate to the silver screen once again except this time hillary skank swank is the student br br i can just see the hollywood writers getting excited about the idea of having a tormented spoiled brat female take the role from ralph the film does not work on any level and it's boring on every level there's nothing interesting here and not even a lesson for anyone to hold on to the film was made without any thought of making money because it's just so bad br br i would gladly spit on all the actors in this film for having been involved with it and have the writers black listed for their miserable and insulting efforts
<START> thursday june 9 9 egyptian theater saturday june 11 2 00pm uptown theater br br being loved and belonging is essential for most children those born to vietnamese mothers and gi fathers often found neither the beautiful country is the story of one such child rejected by his rural village then struggling to find his american father the film begins with green and wild country but descends into grimy sweaty ugliness and boredom the considerable talents of tim roth and morrison are wasted in pointless and ill conceived roles aboard the rusting freighter carrying and is dying brother across the ocean with what appear to be stock shots of stormy seas new york city offers slave labor and clichÃ© characters while very uneven from it's start the great curiosity of this film is the final segment nick nolte is given top billing among the cast i jokingly suggested he would probably be in the final scene only and was not far from the truth as the journey brings to texas and his father the film takes on a serene and austere simplicity a tenuous cohabitation these two men together into a family of father and son the ninety odd minutes of garbage we have just watched is rewarded by a profound and subtle performance from nolte as they slowly interact the credits rolled and i was surprised to see the names of badlands executive producer edward pressman and west texas native terrence malick
<START> i almost laughed out loud when during the commentary the director said this movie is original with a strong plot line there is not one repeat one original plot line or special effect in this blah movie br br the crows hitchcock did it superbly back before cgi and even with cgi this film falls short of a well done attack scene the creepy crawly boy the grudge did it and did it better the psycho done in cold creek manor most recently however it has been done to death no pun intended disconnected rebellious teen who no one listens to about a dozen films have used this one right down to beetlejuice the stuff from the basement can you say horror doors opening unbidden what lies beneath did it with much more flair creepy farmhouse too numerous to mention br br the backdrop of metaphysics which should have been the central focus gets lost once you figure out what is happening which by the way is pretty early on br br one thing of many actually they never even try to explain in the movie is how they explain to the police that their attacker was sucked down the ooze in the basement so they really don't have a body br br overall don't bother
<START> okay the only reason i watched this movie is because krista allen is in it since i admit to watching days of our lives i know her as billie oh sure perhaps there will be a reason to watch this movie that would be the soft porn area they seem to at that and little else i would hope anyone renting buying this movie rented it only for the sex scene's because if they bought rented it for anything else say quality tv they may die of a heart attack this movie involves little imagination whatsoever while i do have a good laugh at it's stupidity and perhaps i'll buy it myself i am but a fool rent before you buy on this one 2 out of 10 note i have yet to give a movie a 1 star the sensual scene's alone gave itself and up from a 1 if they hadn't a straight 1 in the pot and i want a refund if it hadn't
<START> horrible waste of talent not even worth watching when there is absolutely nothing else to do my hope against hope is that the actors at least got paid well anyway if you're a fan of heather's or luke's you'll be really disappointed by this big budget student film
<START> i first heard of this one while searching the 'net for reviews of another italian giallo horror effort the contemporaneous the perfume of the lady in black 1974 whose r2 se dvd from video by the way i recently acquired Â where it's referenced as being in a similar vein but also just as good having watched footsteps for myself now i can see where that reviewer was coming from Â in that both films deal with the psychological meltdown of their female protagonist stylistically however this one owes far more to art house cinema than anything else Â in particular the work of alain resnais and michelangelo antonioni and specifically last year in marienbad 1961 and the passenger 1975 respectively accordingly some have accused it of being deadly boring Â an epithet often attached to such read cerebral fare br br anyway the film involves the quest of a woman florinda bolkan to determine her movements in the preceding three days Â of which she seems to have no recollection following a series of cryptic clues she travels to the land of nearby locations then bear the equally fictitious names of and Â where she encounters several people including lila kedrova as an aristocratic regular of the resort who ostensibly recall the heroine staying there during her most prominent though are a young man peter and a little girl from mario bava's baron blood 1972 Â the former always seems to happen on the scene at propitious moments while the latter apparently confuses bolkan with another woman sporting long red hair and a mean streak br br while essentially a mood piece this is nonetheless a gripping puzzle inevitably vague events transpire at a deliberate pace Â and where much of the film's power derives from the remarkable central performance which can be seen as an extension of bolkan's role in the fine lucio fulci giallo a lizard in a woman's skin 1971 however there's no denying the contribution of cinematographer vittorio storaro who provides any number of sweeping camera moves and an effective color scheme Â adopting orange red blue filters to create atmosphere and coming up with a saturated look for the bizarre finale and nicola piovani's fitting melancholy score the composer is best known nowadays for his oscar winning work on roberto holocaust themed tragi comedy life is beautiful 1997 br br with this in mind it's worth discussing how footsteps was presented in the version i watched well being apparently hard to get in its original form i can't be sure whether it's uncut here or not except to say that the film ran for 89 minutes while the imdb Â lists it at 96 this edition is culled from a fairly battered english language vhs the dubbing is surprisingly good given the international cast with burnt in swedish subtitles to boot besides the divx copy froze for a few seconds at a crucial point in the story around the 82 minute mark still we do get a welcome bonus i e a 9 minute from the in mp3 format br br i realize i haven't yet mentioned the moon mission subplot to which klaus kinski's presence is restricted incidentally around this same time he had a similarly brief but pivotal role in another good arty thriller with sci fi leanings and also set in a distinctive location Â namely lifespan 1974 as i lay watching the film i couldn't fathom what possible connection this had with the central that bolkan mentioned a recurring dream about a movie she had once seen though not through to the end called footsteps on the moon a somewhat misleading alternate title for the film itself Â amusingly she at first recalls the picture as being called blood on the moon which of course is a classic 1948 western noir with robert mitchum and directed by robert wise that said i took this in stride as merely one more outlandish touch to the film given also bolkan's former employment as a translator at a conference discussing earth's future Â and certainly didn't expect the astronauts to turn up on beach at the very end to pursue the female lead where the sand then turns ominously into the moon's br br the film's plot will probably make more sense on a second viewing Â though to be honest this is best approached as a visual aural experience and one shouldn't really expect it to deliver a narrative that's in any way clear cut and easily rationalized for the record the only other effort i'd managed to catch prior to this one was the middling straight giallo the fifth cord 1971 starring franco nero which i had recorded off late night italian tv some time ago i did get hold of his spaghetti western rendition of carmen titled man pride and vengeance 1968 Â also with nero and kinski Â as a divx after i'd already missed a matinÃ©e broadcast of it Âbut the conversion had somehow proved faulty and consequently the disc wouldn't play properly
<START> this piece of crap doesn't worth a critical review so i'll write some information for those who don't know the background of this movie first off all it is not the first saudi movie they used this wrong info for commercial purpose they lied second they made it for money not for anything else so they picked the jerk who won star academy like big brother it is a popular show and the jerk is popular but dumb cheesy untalented then picked the famous actor mohammed al also dumb untalented but has a popular count how many times i'll use the word popular then email me to get your prize however has popular show and the jordanian actress mais who appeared in popular comic show unfunny so she is famous popular then they picked some saudi actors for blah blah blah the funniest thing is the director he is canadian with palestinian roots i believe that the identity of the movie is the identity of its director wait a minute the screen play was written by an egyptian screenwriter very awful one with some help from lebanese critic famous as critic but actually he is a money collector this group of the multi races money slaves doesn't know anything about the saudi culture they don't represent it but when we know who is behind this garbage all our questions will be relieved bin is saudi prince and b u s i n e s s m a n who doesn't care about the saudi culture or saudi people he even doesn't live in saudi arabia even if he lives he will live in his own world his world is far far far away from the real world the people world so he doesn't know anything or care about anything except raising his endless fortune br br not saudi movie not anything movie br br screw them all br br beep out of 10
