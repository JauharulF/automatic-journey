<START> where do i begin let me say that after having watched the entire film and the special features on the dvd my wife and i watched the whole film again with the director's commentary running i can't remember having ever before endured more than 7 minutes of such commentary for a film it's worth hearing br br i'm not a southern boy but i spent some time around memphis a long time ago and have a feel for the area this film almost smells of the south it's so real samuel jackson one of my all time favorite actors is magnificent as the emotionally bent lazarus and christina ricci gives the performance of a lifetime as rae a woman who's been wounded severely during her brief life i've always liked ms ricci's work but in this performance she's giving 137 of herself every second she's on the screen awards and little statues are not enough to reward her for what she lays before the audience in this film br br there are other places where you can read the essence of the story so i'm just commenting on the work i'd heard the name justin timberlake before seeing bsm but had no idea what he looked like or even why he's famous bumping my head on 60 years old i'm outside his target demographic to say the least after seeing this film i will recognize him he can act he gives a substantial believable performance as the loving soulmate of the county slut br br the director is from memphis and shows reverence for his home region he is also a fine story teller br br and i must mention the music i love blues and the soundtrack for black snake moan is a veritable feast for a blues fan br br i'm writing less coherently than usual because my enthusiasm for this movie is overcoming my sentence structure see this film and i mean now
<START> i know when you buy a used oops excuse me previously viewed dvd for 5 99 you shouldn't have very high expectations but even that was a steep price for this poor boxed disc br br i will give the producers credit for providing a complex challenge for the viewer to determine which is worst the acting the scripting the camera work the special effects they all pretty much tie for just plain terrible oh it has the absolutely worst faked car crash ever used in a motion picture anywhere br br now all this is pretty serious ridicule for a movie fan who proudly features 'police academy' 'naked gun' 'national lampoon's loaded weapon and a host of other campy discs in his collection but at least those folks know that ones tongue should be planted firmly in ones cheek the cast of unfortunately use their tongues in an attempt to deliver inane dialogue and although it is almost beyond my belief the movies characters seem to think they might actually be doing something of value a back room pornographer would be ashamed to release this mess br br oh lucky me bought the worst video ever made at the same time fraternity demon maybe the name should have given me a hint
<START> ok let's see a handsome young stranger is new in town and walks around on the local boardwalk he meets a pretty girl meets up with the obnoxious leader of the local hip young vampires club is dared by them to follow them into this cave gets into a conflict over the pretty girl an epic fight ensues br br no it's not lost boys although you'd be hard pressed to tell the difference since i think even some of the carnival music is the same do you have to pay royalties for sampling a movie even the ending of this stinkbomb is ripped off from lost boys the make up is below par even for a low budget thriller the characters are one dimensional and just exactly how many oh i had this horrible experience scenes of teen angst does one movie need the humor is flat and stupid and everything else is sadly predictable yawn br br the only scary thing about this turkey is the promise threat of a sequel an idea that hopefully every distributor in the country will drive a stake through
<START> i saw this movie in the theatre and it was a terrible movie the way michael oliver who now turn even worse in the sequel is the biggest intolerance i cannot bare junior upset his father because he would not go to school which got his father ben madly insane also the crazy dance ride operator is not fair to junior for not letting him go on the ride and that is as horrible as a serial killer to junior because she made threatening insults to junior which is why i cannot tolerate this movie even if the movie is re released back into theatres in the extended version i still would not see this movie because this movie is not something i can even tolerate in fact it stinks
<START> the two new oss 117 movies has a kind of humor which is both intelligent and dumbed down at the same time which i find extremely amusing it really reminds me of the classic pink panther movies with an almost as good leading man as peter sellers in jean and unlike steve martin completely ruining clouseau is quite brilliant br br the comments regarding the movies' being anti semitic are obviously a case of a complete lack of humor and therefor understanding br br whether you will enjoy or hate this movie really comes down to what kind of humor you have i can't wait for the sequel
<START> i was really looking forward to watching this film it had all the ingredients of a great tongue in but it just didn't come together at all kevin spacey's accent was tolerable except that sometimes he forgot to use it and i would rather not have had to listen to linda fiorentino's pale attempt she and helen were totally lacking in charm and personality thankfully their screen kids had loads so you could find at least some members of his 2 families endearing you could have strained spaghetti with the plot and i'm sure that the script was written by some adolescent schoolboy in a high school english competition that said when i wasn't cringing i was smirking so it wasn't a totally wasted 90 minutes i did find the of kevin's face on the painting very clever and quite funny maybe i'm being a bit harsh but i was expecting a bit of quality viewing and it just never came
<START> i watched this movie as a child and still enjoy viewing it every once in a while for the nostalgia factor when i was younger i loved the movie because of the entertaining storyline and interesting characters today i still love the characters additionally i think of the plot with higher regard because i now see the morals and symbolism rainbow is far from the worst film ever and though out dated i'm sure i will show it to my children in the future when i have children
<START> one of the last surviving horror screen greats conrad dies and has his body placed in a mausoleum with televised before death snippets of the great conrad greeting you as you visit unfortunately for him and his captors conrad's body is borrowed by a gang of four boys and three girls and taken to a huge manor where they drink with him toast him dance with him laugh with and at him and then put him to bed in a casket which just happens to by lying in a room upstairs news of the missing body reaches widow and her friend who happens to be proficient in the black arts and she holds some kind of ceremony that brings conrad back to life so he can in his own words get an eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth well is an interesting bad film sure it is cheap the sets look like they were borrowed which i am sure they were the special effects and blood and guts are done liberally and with little credibility the acting is average to below average with a few exceptions jeffrey combs of re animator fame is in tow but really he does little in this rather thankless role as a horror obsessed teen that needs to steal a dead man's body for kicks none of the kids except the pretty girl playing meg is any good talbot plays the friend of the with withering interest also look for the big i mean big guy that plays the policeman that is porky himself of porkys fame but thankfully for all of us one performance does rise above the material ferdy mayne an oft overlooked actor from germany who had christopher lee features and did star as a vampire in the fearless vampire killers does a more than commendable job as the aging horror icon in public life and a real demon of a man in private life conrad in a bad human being in life living solely for his own pleasures and we see him kill twice before he is even dead obviously none of the swinging teens at that point mayne is able to look very regal speak very elegantly and convey menace with ease if for no other reason one should see for his performance i do however believe that when they showed black and white clips of that they used christopher lee footage anyone have any thoughts anyway one can guess what happens and it does indeed goes out and goes after the kids that disturbed his peace again the formula is trite and overused the acting for the most part is anemic and the direction oh so ridiculous but mayne gives a good performance in a sea of ineptitude definitely worth a little peek watching mayne keep popping up on screens in his mausoleum brought a wry smile to my lips each time
<START> they prove that the cops when they can't find the real perpetrators always blame the parents and accuse them of sexual abuse of their kids these movies always depict the press as a bunch of animals and have the parents coming out of court to feed the hunger to humiliate the grief stricken hasn't anybody ever heard of a courthouse back door in these movies here you have a psychic who tells them exactly what happened and where the body can be found but the police are not told and nobody heeds his findings br br the police are portrayed as blockheads who don't know what they are doing and there's always an outside detective like ed asner who comes in late on the case believes in the parents and solves the mystery br br also after the parents are cleared they don't spit in the faces of the dumb cops who put them in jail took their kid away and accused them of killing their own child br br it looked as if i've see this film many times before
<START> this movie twists the facts of anne and mary's lives into something unrecognizable to make mary boleyn who in fact was a rather dim and foolish creature and make her the good sister is just silly it is anne who was in fact the far more interesting character and that is why it is her life and not mary's that has been told so often br br in response to an earlier review i fail to see how anne's life was so criminal to me it's henry who was the real criminal whatever anne's motives for winning the king and withholding her affections in order to gain a crown and husband has to be taken into context of the time in which these real life events took place anne in comparison to the majority of most of the courtiers in her time was a relatively innocent figure most modern historians discount or have disproven most of the myths and that this movie perpetuate about her and i have never heard of anyone who actually believes the rumour than she slept with her brother this movie is so sensational and false that it is maddening to think that someone without knowing anything about this period in history could walk away believing anything this movie has presented as fact br br i won't even get into the weird filming of the movie but i'm pretty sure that cameras weren't invented in the 16th century so i don't understand why anne and mary are talking to one throughout the movie it's a really bad plot devise and is jarring and annoying to put it mildly br br anne of the thousand days is not accurate either but is infinitely more entertaining and at least comes closer to telling the story of one of the most intriguing women of history don't even think about renting this it's two hours you'll never get back
<START> this flick is worse than awful it took a good story plot and turned it into schizophrenic cinema the photography is extremely amateurish looks like a 5th graders home movie project filmed with 8mm kiddie cameras the editing appears to have been done by somebody having psychotic flashbacks while on drugs and booze with scenes cut short followed by other unrelated scenes then chopped segments of scenes pasted in totally unnecessary and gratuitous nudity missing scenes daytime scenes inexplicably turning into night time scenes then suddenly back to daytime obviously no continuity tom skerritt wendy hughes and james mason's good acting skills are wasted as are the talents of the key supporting cast forget the villain and the anderson women very amateurish acting this movie is a good candidate for a remake even with skerritt and hughes just have it professionally done this time
<START> in this crackerjack noir thriller from columbia which is a combination of panic in the streets and the naked city evelyn keyes is unknowingly the killer that stalked new york evelyn who smuggled some stolen jewels into the country from cuba also smuggled in smallpox it gets by doctor william bishop and when they do find out what it is the hunt is on for her br br for most of the film the treasury department is also hunting keyes but for the smuggled jewels it's not until nearly the end of the film that the health department and law enforcement realize they're looking for the same woman br br evelyn's on a mission also her husband charles has left her flat the cut of all being that he was fooling around with her sister while she was in cuba collecting the gems and contracting smallpox when lola albright as her sister commits suicide over the whole affair evelyn's on a mission get or die trying and that's not an idle threat given the situation br br the film was mostly shot in new york like the naked city and its cast is sprinkled liberally with a lot of familiar names and faces keep an eye out for good performances by connie gilchrist as evelyn's unsympathetic landlady jim backus as a shifty club owner and art smith as fence br br a real sleeper in the noir category don't miss it if broadcast
<START> adela is a rebellious teenager with the attitude that she is right and everyone else is wrong she needs to be the center of attention and she'll act stupid to make it so with her attitude she gets sent to charm school br br there she meets the typical characters in today's cinema the nerd the clumsy one the stepford housewife and the sexual minority things happen and in the end adela learns her lesson so to speak the plot tries to carry a deeper meaning to the state adela is in but utterly fails to deliver at least i didn't buy it so what you are left with is superficial interaction within the same stereotypes you've seen in a million movies before plus the director seems to have a breast fixation adela flashes her boobies a few times too many at least i can't see that they are relevant to the story br br so the film is ok but if you are like me and don't like to watch a teenager pissing people off and making a behavioral u turn in an instant which i found very unbelievable think twice before watching
<START> this is one of my favorite james bond in games because the missions are fun to play they have lots of action in them they can be hard that makes them fun to do the weapons you use are good the way james bond look in this james bond games is pretty you can see pierce brosnan in him which is cool and all the other characters in this game look like the actors that played them in the movie there is no way that you can't have a good time playing this game i loved it also the game follows the movie pretty much maybe a few added thing but it pretty much follows the movie also the this james bond game has pretty good graphics for nintendo 64 and to bad there was no voice over actors in this game but who care as long as the game is fun to play br br overall score out of
<START> carlito's angels is a spoof of charlie's angels that is not afraid to spoof even itself at times however that does not mean that the film is above criticism by the viewers as well it is amateurish and juvenile i think fast motion stopped being funny around 1914 the assaulting rap music often drowns out the dialogue and the film feels longer than it is even though it runs barely over an hour the girls themselves are hot adorable with wonderful lean bodies and even though they never get naked their outfits leave little to the imagination by checking out their imdb pages i found out that one of them alessandra ramos is actually going through with a film career i wish her luck because although this film is bad she as well as the other girls gave it whatever energy it has and i wouldn't mind at all seeing her again on the screen
