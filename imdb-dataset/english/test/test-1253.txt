<START> i like money i stumbled on this brilliant film in a local video store last week wasn't sure what to expect brought it home set up the player and then my journey in to stupidity began the first viewing i did a lot of chuckling no laughing out loud really it wasn't until the second viewing the movie really started to take a hold on me and the humor was that much funnier it reminded me of austin powers first viewing it was all right then the real fun began telling people about it just talking about each scene and the set up i'm making all my friends watch this movie everyone i know this movie may very well be one of the most accurate future movies ever made this movie is more then just 84 minutes of entertainment it's a warning to the future of our civilization mike judge the fantastic mind who brought us office space has brought us a vision of life in the automated future luke wilson's dead pan humor as average joe enhanced the movie that much more watch this movie then once you're done read more write more think more for the futures sake if not for your own
<START> cheesy 80's horror co starring genre ken foree and rosalind cash along with brenda bakke are some of the featured players in this tale about a haunted health club goofy dialogue and some nasty gore effects make this movie watchable not bad but no great shakes either br br recommended for the bad dialogue and acting b movie fans only br br b
<START> ho hum just another flick with steven seagal pretending to be some spiritual being but bashing heads and killing like it was nothing he of course justifies it in the end by donating the money to an orphanage how sweet lay the world to waste and we'll ignore it if you take care of a little girl this time he is partnered with ice cool anthony criss gotta have someone to lay all those cringe inducing lines on man and there are plenty the dialog is pure crap br br they go after bad guys nick mancuso and kevin tighe two people that were born to play the scumbags br br he's squeezing mari morrow and impressing soap star sarah how cute br br i guess if you gotta have some july force excitement this may suffice if nothing else it will help you get your degree in
<START> ignore the comment before mine the show is comic genius most underrated show ever 3 reasons why reason 1 the flashbacks are hilarious who cares if they have absolutely nothing to do with the story they make me laugh so hard it hurts and isn't that the idea of a good comedy programme people who think this isn't funny just have no sense of humour who cares if they are random its a t v show you can do what ever you like with it and people say its not realistic neither is a cartoon its animated reason 2 the jokes are just generally hilarious seth mcfarlane and the other writers are funny everything from the star wars references to making fun of celebrities i love them all and reason 3 the story lines are just brilliant and funny they set up all of the jokes with their crazy nature and wackiness just all the more funnier br br i caught this one late night on bbc2 and have never gone back i have all 7 seasons plus the kind of movie thing griffin the untold story i have several t shirts posters and my collection is still growing i've never got a collection of any tv show before but this was so funny i just had to get everything br br just watch season 3 and trust me you will be hooked for life the funniest show ever created and i hope it never ends
<START> i think this movie deserves a 10 out of 10 because it is hilariously funny from start to finish the plot is simple and straight forward but it keeps you watching and there are so many laughs that you really start to love it when i went to see this movie i hadn't heard much about it and i didn't know what to expect i thought it was going to be an old ladies' type of film like calendar girls or something but it took me completely by surprise even though i am still a teenager and the film was probably not directed at my age group i still found it excellent and i think that people of all age groups would like it i think it is a shame that it is not at all famous and it deserves more publicity so that more people will go and see it and realize what a great movie it is
<START> this show is the worst show ever norris and his family write it produce it direct it etc etc the only reason i ever see it is because my goofy wife likes it how many times can norris fly though the air from plain sight to land a kick on an obviously blind villain no trees no building just whoosh thin air he always solves the case or is the best at whatever skill there is no co star ever gets the glory its all norris its truly apparent that norris is awful stuck on himself and will not allow anyone to one up him in any scene no matter what the content terrible acting terrible script terrible series
<START> this is without a doubt the most stunning and amazing documentary i have ever seen the images that are shown are absolutely breathtaking and stunning on top of that it is a wonderful learning experience i'm not one for educational documentaries but this one grabs hold of you and doesn't let go until the end you'll be so hooked and entranced by what you are watching that you'll forget your at home watching tv this series is available to buy on dvd and i highly recommend picking this one up with all the evil and death in this world this documentary series gives us proof that life is beautiful and worth saving and preserving
<START> holy cow what a piece of sh t this movie is i didn't how these filmmakers could take a 250 word book and turn it into a movie i guess they didn't know either i don't remember any farting or belching in the book do you br br they took this all times childrens classic added some farting belching and sexual inuindo and prostituted it into a kaka joke this should give you a good idea of what these hollywood producers think like i have to say visually it was interesting but the brilliant visual story is ruined by toilet humor if you even think that kind of thing is funny i don't want the kids that i know to think it is br br don't take your kids to see don't rent the dvd i hope the ghost of doctor suess ghost comes and haunts the people that made this movie
<START> this film and the 1st film both all over the whole aliens and predator franchise br br they are awful films badly acted badly scripted and terribly directed they just seem like someones desperate attempt to make money off of the good name of the original aliens and predator films but instead of delivering a well thought out quality production they came up with the br br the original alien aliens predator predator 2 films were great they redefined the horror thriller genre by inventing these insane and yet still believable creatures who took the role of the 'serial killer' as opposed to a human br br these films are just milking the franchise and do nothing but darken its name br br the aliens vs predator comic books were brilliant and had a great story they were true to the alien predator mythology didn't crap all over the original stories etc why didn't they make the comic book into a great film because hollywood are idiots thats why
<START> here is another low quality movie from the disney company there is no more disney spirit the story is boring all emotions are fake it is not cute or moving disney company was at a time a sort of magic company which provided dreams for children it is now all about making money shame on the people who exploit disney name for their personal benefit it is the fall of an empire and by the way pixar is not disney
<START> i have been an avid jane austen fan for many years i had never seen this adaptation so when i had heard of it i came here and read all the excellent reviews on that basis i eagerly ordered it from netflix what a cruel disappointment they have taken one of the most subtle and bright comic novels and made it dull each character seems to have been dealt a single facial expression a single tone upon which to base their flat characters although this adaptation seems to have used every word that jane austen wrote they appear to have been passed around to characters in a random fashion even though it was done as a miniseries this adaptation manages to confuse and feel as rushed as if it had been done as a movie of the week br br mr bennett too harsh mrs bennet just a chattering chipmunk mr darcy as lifeless as a nutcracker the bennett girls almost indistinguishable and mr a man who no one would look twice at hardly the appealing cad i'm quite put out
<START> while watching this movie you notice right away the cheesy elements of a standard tv movie though through out the picture the plot changes if you are bold enough to say this movie has a plot are by the book and unoriginal and with every one the movie kept getting worse br br candace cameron bure famous for her role as dj tanner on the hit tv show full house is not very convincing as a possessed twenty something trying to avenge the death i believe she is fine actress just not in the thriller range br br the filming was trashy and like i said the plot stale though watching it i knew i was in for automatic cheese i had no idea how much worse this film could get br br i highly do not recommend this movie unless cheep filmaking and poor writing is what you looking for
<START> i was loaned this dvd by the director of a film i am working with in which i play an actor who is playing prospero knowing his own style i did not expect anything resembling a classical interpretation of the text br br what i have found is sometimes striking sometimes evocative but often meandering and tedious like most experimental music i find that in films such as this the building blocks of powerful film making are crafted even if they have not found their most useful form in a more coherent format br br thus we have a who is more a clown than a threat and who not even miranda seems terribly afraid of which is odd since we know that he has attempted to rape her at least once a stefano and who are more annoying than funny an oddly young prospero who looks like amadeus and a great loss of character development and plot through creative editing and highly stylized posturing br br interestingly enough i do not have an issue with the way in which or miranda are portrayed his stunned rapture and her slightly freaky innocence are actually quite appropriate br br i do not say that this is a bad film but an experimental one one that takes huge risks but is meant more for students of art and film and not really for anyone with an interest in the tempest for its own sake
<START> when it comes to any movie that was made in or about the south the characters are labeled racist or hillbillies or even worse that awful racist term rednecks this movie was a murder mystery plain simple it was a great murder mystery did demonstrate some of human feelings about each others race the same type of observations made by black character actors toward in todays' movies before watching this movie one should get the mississippi burning chip off of ones' shoulder enjoy the plot wonderful acting reminiscent scenes of simpler times that while are gone they will not be forgotten mr faulkner did his hometown of oxford miss justice by having this movie shot there the producer noted while shooting the movie there his stereotypical perception of whites were that he observed white black townspeople locals getting along with each other in the same way so sit back enjoy one of mr great classics try to figure out who the killer really is
<START> clint howard brother of more talented ron stars in this abysmally awful horror comedy about a mental case who serves ice cream to children and kills people striving to be a movie that's of the 'so bad that it's good' variety this film misses that mark by a good mile and instead has to be seen as 'so bad that it's well bad' it's the constant cinema the pillow stuffed 'fat kid' or the sleep inducing 'horror' that soured me on the film i don't know all i know is i loathed the film and this from a guy who has a soft spot for b horror films paul norman choose to continue making films in the porn industry both before and after this his only 'mainstream' film a wise choice indeed as horrible acting nonsense storyline and ludicrous dialog are much much more palatable while seeing a porn starlet do her thing funnily enough this turkey has absolutely no nudity another reason to steer clear br br my grade d
