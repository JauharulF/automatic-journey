<START> hope floats with sandra bullock is a real disappointment the story starts off ok her husband cheats on her and she finds out on national television so she has to rebuild her life here it could have gotten interesting or built up in a story line but you become so bored with it she moves back with her parents and harry jr who plays justin begins hitting on her the two have no real chemistry at all yet your supposed to get the impression that justin is in love with her the movie ends the way you figure it will but you wish it hadn't ended like every other kind like it they had a good start with this movie and could have turned it into something watchable but instead its a movie that you definitely want to miss
<START> young michael dudikoff like young lord greystoke was abandoned in the jungle on a pacific island as an infant but instead of being raised by the apes he fell into the hands of a japanese soldier who was still living there because he hadn't heard the war was over and like young luke skywalker it turns out he fell into the hands and learned the fighting skills of a ninja br br good thing because they were separated and the young kid came down with a case of amnesia but those fighting skills didn't go away the orphaned kid now named joe armstrong enlists in the army and gets himself stationed in the phillipines meanwhile his obi wan played by john gets rescued himself and goes to work as a gardener on the estate of planter and terrorist go between don stewart using a cheesy accent that seems to vary between french and spanish br br as these things happen everybody meets and dudikoff both solves the mystery of part of his past and saves the commanding officer's daughter from the bad guys in this golan globus production charles bronson was getting a bit long in the tooth now and golan globus needed a new star for their action flicks michael dudikoff filled the bill quite nicely and made quite a few films for them including several american ninja sequels br br this film is all action and dudikoff dispatches bad guys at a record pace what he doesn't do steve james does doing his best rambo imitation and showing his considerable martial arts skills br br the film has enough holes in the plot to drive one of those army vehicles through you see in the story but that's what the ticket buying public doesn't care about dudikoff certainly looks magnificent stripped to his fighting clothes no wonder so many sequels were made
<START> it was easy to get lost in the simplicity and light hearted humor of this year's best family film grand champion the story of a 12 year old boy buddy that with the help of his sister mom and best friend is determined to raise a grand champion steer it is a whimsical journey to the big competition after hokey pokey is crowned grand champion he is auctioned for 000 to pay for the kids college education buddy finds out that the next time he sees hokey it would be on a bun the kids conspire to steal the prize winning steer vowing to save him from the bbq this is where the fun begins julia roberts larry george strait natalie steven bland tommy guy tuff and so many more stars create the backdrop for all the antics you wont believe who actually won the steer at the auction he looks good in a mustache the soundtrack is rich with tunes from george strait natalie willie nelson and more where else can you experience movie stars country western stars and rodeo stars only in texas only in grand champion br br it is masterfully crafted simple little film that may be the best movie you see this year the movie opens in select cities on friday august 27th 2004 br br another great film from rope the moon and productions is in a whisper keep an eye out on the cable networks for this one
<START> the director godfrey must be a very charming and persuasive man for this dreadfully botched project to have seen the light of day message so powerful and resonant in his previous two films is hopelessly jumbled here athletes equations oceans laughing heads etc mingle without purpose the parade of banal imagery is mostly generic stock from getty images et al and the heavy handed digital manipulations are amateurish in the worst way imaginable surely someone involved steven soderbergh executive producer could have pointed out that applying a filter to nearly every frame was a very bad idea the crude looping layering and distorting of images recalls a freshman photoshop class and to make matters worse the computer animation sequences are more artless than a 1980's wall street pie chart this is not to say that improved aesthetics alone would have salvaged this film but some meager effort in this direction may have made it tolerable as visual fodder for the accompanying music i feel compelled to point out that the score by philip glass will certainly satisfy his fans not a radical departure but rather a refinement of what glass does best with lovely violin contributions by yo yo ma if you decide to see this film be certain to focus your attention on the brief opening sequence while you may already be familiar with detroit's once majestic but long abandoned michigan central railroad station 89 minutes later you will find yourself remembering this image of 20th century decay as the critical point when you should have headed for the exit sign hit the stop button etc you've been warned
<START> movies about u f o 's are always a nice way to kill some time so on a rainy sunday evening i picked up this flick expecting what can be expected from a direct to dvd u f o mystery br br boy was i wrong at about halfway in the movie it becomes very apparent that the u f o theme is just a deceptive way of attracting unsuspecting viewers to this christian propaganda and this is not just a christan movie from an average christian no this is christianity of the extremist fundamentalist kind the scary kind br br in the end of this movie the non believing lead is tricked by their colleagues using a practical joke in thinking that the rapture has started which is believed by christians to be the happening in the end of time where true believers are going to heaven and non believers are left behind br br when the joke is explained it is suggested that it is always better to become a true believer 'just in case we christians are right' now that's a lamest excuse ever to become a christian if you ask me br br this movie still tries to convert non believers using scare tactics believe in god or you will go to hell is the message here simple but quite offensive really especially because this movie is being sold as something completely different br br now let's assume you're a christian fundamentalist yourself and you're not likely to be offended by the themes in this movie is this a good movie i'm afraid it isn't no actually i'm lying i'm glad it isn't the acting is horrible the pacing is horrible the plot is horrible especially the ending is laughably bad as soon as the movie starts you immediately sense that this is going to be worse than you expected and you will be right br br in the first half hour it seems to at least attempt to set up a passable u f o mystery but then suddenly they bring in this count dracula look alike that starts babbling about the devil at first you just think this dude is just a crazy maniac but as it turns out he actually represents the real views of the makers of this movie as soon as you start realizing this you know how this is going to end up but actually it ends up worse br br avoid
<START> nicolas cage and deborah foreman provide stunning performances in this 80's tour de force a great 80's movie akin to fast times at ridgemont high i highly recommend this movie to any child of the 80's who hasn't seen it it's a cult classic
<START> this film is so 1980's and that is what i like so much about it it does an excellent job of conveying the feel of that odd decade the reality that russian nukes could wipe you out at any time reagan in the white house telling everybody that things were great while more and more social programs were slashed young people dropped out but not as far as their parents of the 1960's did young people still went to school they just smoked so much dope that their were all but dead nothing effected them not even the death of one of their classmates at the hands of one of their friends how weird is it to realize that the murder was wrong but you are not sure why watching the characters deal with the crime is fascinating and telling of a very sick society glover is great keanu is great hopper is incredible one of the most memorable movies i have ever seen
<START> a stunning and thoughtful observation on modern life for youngsters in japan like of sand delves into issues such as rape homosexuality and pubescent angst in a subtle and significant way it gives an insight in to the youth culture struggling to define itself outside of the bounds of their parent's generation with it's strict conformity and facade typical to japanese cinema often what isn't said is more important that what is so to those not versed in japanese film and culture beware it can seem dull and minimalistic pretty much like every film to come out of japan bar if you don't know what to look for i saw it for the first time when i was 15 and was what originally sparked my interest in japan it's culture and language considering i'm now 22 and learning japanese with the intention of living there for 2 years needless to say it's a powerful film enjoy
<START> well i'm a huge fan and follower of elizabeth berkley i bought this on dvd off of ebay for my boyfriends birthday we sat down to watch it and it was so boring i don't remember laughing once it's only on for about an hour and half and it seemed to take forever to end elizabeth is great in this though maybe it's just because i'm a big elizabeth berkley fan though if she wasn't in it i wouldn't have watched it but every time she came on my face lit up unfortunately even elizabeth couldn't save this film just the overall story and awful comedy makes this a film you'd rather miss than waste an hour and a half of your life it's a very forgetful film
<START> i went into the closer she gets knowing that it was the story of the filmmaker's mother fighting cancer i expected it to be a very harrowing depressing movie and although the subject matter is certainly emotionally wrenching the remarkable thing about this movie is the positive message it sends it shows a family's total dedication to meet the challenge of cancer together they refuse to lose faith in each other even in the darkest moments br br the most moving moments to me are when this faith is revealed little comments that the mother and the family make to each other that reveal her and their will to survive and their defiant emphasis on love and family togetherness in this way it is an uplifting and profoundly hopeful film we should all be so lucky as to be surrounded by family like this in times of serious illness
<START> you can tell that this is the first offering by the director who also wrote it but you can also see the potential this guy has this is an obviously low budget film in the spirit of boondock saints of course boondock saints came out a few years after this so you could look at this as a diamond in need of some polish the acting was good if you're looking for deniro or michael madsen in a crime drama remember that these are young guys playing young guys trying to be criminals they're not going to be tm like some of the veterans i would have love to have seen justin joe the main character go on to make more movies he was great in this good movie 3 stars out of 5
<START> the first thing i wanted to do after watching this film was watch it again because i'd missed lots with all the laughing i did i'm european and i've studied abroad and i've as good as lived with spanish french italian and german people the film was full of stereotypes which more often than not p people off and reading some of the other reviews i see that it did p people off but this film gets the stereotypes so right i cannot fault it except for maybe the way the french guy became a drunken party animal the english guy was the perfect geezer stereotype drunk annoying insulting but shines through in the end as well as the stereotypes the film also got the emotional aspect of studying abroad correct at first he's shy doesn't know anybody misses home doesn't know his way around as time progresses it becomes his home and when the time comes to leave it is extremely difficult a feeling people can only understand if they've experienced it i highly recommend this film
<START> the opening of the jungle promises us a safari adventure with a science fiction element but mostly what we get is a travelogue with lots of stock footage and padding and the odd leopard attack the movie is leisurely when you want it to be gripping and tries to inject interest into the proceedings with badly staged matches between various wild animals i had no idea that lions and wild boars were natural enemies in the wild did you i thought the big cats stuck to hunting herbivores but apparently the producers knew better br br as for the actors cesar does his usual great job of rocking the mustache and marie windsor is reasonably believable as the progressively thinking daughter nice eyebrows btw however rod cameron is barely watchable as the hunter returning as the sole survivor of his expedition i'm sure he was in demand in his day but here he comes off as a rent a center bogart rough looking but with none of bogey's range or timing he spends the movie going back and forth from stoic anger to angry stoicism and any time the screenplay attempts to crank up some romantic sparks between himself and windsor you just have to laugh that face isn't a good vehicle for tenderness br br the screenplay is not entirely without merit although it does make some odd choices early in the first act the screenplay makes a point of spending several moments where the heroes decide to bring along the obligatory clever young boy and monkey mascot but then basically ignore them until spoiler the monkey somehow gets hold of a live hand grenade during the mammoth scene and accidentally tosses near windsor this is so cameron can prove his bravery by diving on it and saving her life at the cost of his own end spoiler it's possible that the indian version of this movie which i understand ran better than 2 1 2 hours might have given the kid and the monkey more to do br br another thing that makes the film show its age spoiler is the issue of the woolly mammoths the plot device that sets the safari into motion in the first place when they finally appear the way the scene is filmed it's obvious that the mammoths obviously elephants draped in shag carpeting aren't really attacking anyone or even moving all that fast and yet cameron immediately sets to trying to wipe them out with hand grenades these days the idea of destroying the last known specimens of a species thought to be extinct would be unthinkable especially when all they seem to do is roll through the jungle at a nice walking pace end of spoiler br br so imo four stars which is pretty good for a robert production normally hack jobs rate two or three stars at best it's not a train wreck of a film or anything plus it seems to mean well with the daughter arguing for of the most repressive aspect of the traditional ways and the elements of mixed race romance that was pretty progressive in 1952 and there's some nice scenery and exotic spectacle see it if someone offers to show it to you for free but don't expect much except an interesting historical chapter of early fantasy cinema
<START> one reasons why they call the 80's the awesome 80's is quality television shows like the wonder years war of the worlds the series v amazing stories and many more have always left an impression to each fortunate one of us that in time will always find a way to reawaken itself to top that here comes monsters a series quite unique of its own and a theme fully dedicate to monsters may it be the good the bad and the morbid br br if you're a fan of classic shows or if you have the fascination of horror films then this one is absolutely for you provided you can find this rare gem br br even the newer generations will be in awe with some of the episode with its grittiness it's indiscriminating use of gore effects or its story telling power and simplicity i guarantee because i'm 23 br br be sure not to miss this br br although it's a show seemingly forgotten by the modern world it will always be with those who can always remember
<START> this television show is a idiotic waste of time if you want to learn br br about animals watch the discovery channel if you want to watch br br nincompoops on television just watch mtv mtv stands for music television br br not nitwit d preforming retarded skits or bratty kids crying br br their hearts out for not getting a bmw for there 16th birthday i bet br br that if you like this show i bet you love viva la bam and jackass huh i think my iq dropped ten points watching this show br br this is a combination of two shows jackass and the animal planet br br some people think this is a good combination br br i on the other hand think it is br br and if you notice its a lot like jackass br br and viva la bam br br just a note this show is horrible
