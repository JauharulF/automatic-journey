<START> this movie despite its list of b c and d list celebs is a complete waste of 90 minutes the plot with its few peaks was very predictable it was so silly that i cannot believe that i am taking the time to even write a review of it flex to his credit has grown in his ability to act since playing michael jackson in a made for tv movie a few years ago on the other hand has as she was more talented in her role as some years ago as i sat watching this train wreck of a film with its pitiful production and horrible sound quality other four letter words came to my mind to qualify what i thought of this film however in an effort to keep my writings g rated i'll simply say this film is another four letter word starting with an l lame
<START> quit while your ahead is a phrase they never learn typical hollywood sequel scenario if the first film was only shocking the second wasn't expect the third to be the worst thing to hit the screen this year even worse are the prequels events of which were already explained in detail if you haven't seen to first two films you will not like this one it's like starting to watch lord of the rings or star wars with the last trilogy movie so stand alone this film is not br br remember in the first movie about revenge remember the second about the long lost savage brother well if you saw those two 5 min moments and paste them together you would a 5 min prequel but the creators ether thought these 5 min were vital historical events or just wanted to give a job to some actors cast and crew and maybe make some money in the process i have a loot of money i make movies for a living and i'm bored what will i do i know i'll make a movie so anyway you get this 5 min prequel and you stretch it for 90 min Â that's this movie and you know what will happen to the main immortal characters so there is little suspense by the way all the drama of the movie is in those 5 min the only thing that made my eyebrow rise was mom killing in the begging of the movie sick the rest was braveheart remix if you want a comedy see braveheart first then this movie br br now i'm going to rant a bit Â the movie put me in the mood who invented the concept of vampire vs werewolf in the first place it's older than i am and got old just as fast and why do vampires look like goth girls in heat while werewolves look like psycho bears hiding bad films behind cleavage fails isn't it about time we got some sane slimmer werewolves with an upright posture how can their unchangeable werewolves even breed if they rip everybody into shreds and why with all their powers the vampires didn't rule the world what a waste
<START> is a game of words life and eagerness but i personally think this movie was overblown by its ambition and does not make justice to its title it gathers a set of awkward characters united by unbelievable links furthermore the way everything is connected at the end is in my opinion a bit pathetic what remains of it was a set of images an interesting one but not enough to make this a good movie br br i believe this film is supposed to be a comedy but i surely didn't noticed the nonsense and nature of the movie is actually the only good thing about it but when it drags on an on and on it becomes no longer bearable i have to say i fought hard to continue seeing it until the end and i am still not sure it was worth it
<START> this movie's only redeeming factor was the fact that it was on tv for free and that it probably helped the romanian economy other than that hallmark needs to re evaluate this division of their empire and maybe keep their movies more oriented towards bizarre love affairs between cancer stricken in mississippi to go into details about how mindless this movie is would give credit to it for being memorable it wasn't i remember the act of watching it there being vampires some of them teenage and some very bad dubbing whoever worked on the dubbing track of this movie needs to be relocated to another sector of society maybe food service to the deaf if you have the opportunity watch this movie just because it makes so many other really bad movies seem oscar worthy in retrospect then again if you actually ended up at this movie's profile i imagine that it may be too late
<START> i don't understand why it is so underrated on imdb this movie is just the perfection the better adaptation of all times of the myth of tarzan as a french i can say that this is the better role of christophe lambert ridiculous in a lots of movies but here absolutely wonderful charismatic incredible the plot is great well told the story magnificent the direction the atmosphere the music every things are perfect how believe these sequences with the music just simply perfect br br greystoke is truly an unbelievable movie underrated here i don't really know why but really appreciated
<START> as most people i am tired of the by the numbers clichÃ©d movies that hollywood makes there seems to be no creativity in hollywood companies only want to spend money on remakes are sequels that have an audience built in br br this movie is a welcome change it could be classified as romantic comedy for it's genre but don't let that turn you off this movie this is a very original movie which is not like most things hollywood produces br br if you are reading this you already know the basic plot so i will not bother going over that the only movies that come to mind to compare this to are interstate 60 and art of travel which are little known gems that take a different path than most of the hollywood garbage br br this is well worth seeing if you are tired of watching more of the same br br dean
<START> artificial melodrama with a screenplay adapted by mel from his play the man concerns a boarding house proprietress taking in a troubled handyman who may be homicidal despite solid work from ida lupino and robert ryan both trying their best this tedious yarn isn't very inventive within its one primary set which quickly becomes visually dull and underpopulated cast of characters there is however a smart pooch who senses the worst hokey and humorless with a stilted direction from harry horner perhaps lupino should have directed where's all the suspense promised by the ads also served as a co producer 1 2 from
<START> i was completely mislead by the comments on this film mainly by someone saying they saw it at a film festival and loved every minute of it expecting this to be a nice run of the mill american pie style film i was deeply disappointed br br firstly the camera work is awful i don't think the director knows that cameras can move around scenes rather than stay still and having the actors move close up and far away of their own accord br br secondly the scenery my god i've seen more furnishings in a bird's nest the club was totally unconvincing with around 3 extras dancing in the back ground at any one time the flats were bare and lacked personality br br thirdly the actors wow the director obviously went for the typical reaper character set up a wimpy main character with a gruff i don't give a f k character that takes pot shots at the main everything the main character said and did was a chore so much so it made me wince br br overall the plot the supposedly big revenge theme lasted for about 30 seconds and lacked any real motivation the characters acted irrationally and didn't seem to have any real relationship with anyone else no character had any depth to them they may as well have been cardboard cut outs walking past the static camera br br a truly horrible piece worse than a first year students 2 minute short for youtube advice to the director change your name and deny any association with the film that will probably sell one copy at a yard sale in ohio
<START> one true thing may have seemed like a horror movie to the yuppies of the 80's but it doesn't ring true today unless you happen to be part of a pampered upper middle class family which is so insulated from the world that it has never tasted suffering br br avoid this shallow flop
<START> all grown up had a lot to live up to and there was much hype when this show was now it's easy to explain why it didn't live up to expectations firstly this show failed to create a realistic world of pre teens in the way that rugrats captured the world and the imagination of toddlers secondly the show's character's are stereo types angelica white spoilt blond as opposed to suzie colored girl from modest family or boring tommy chuckie and annoying dil finally there is not one ounce of innovation or an original plot line to sum up all grown up is a waste of time and a bad idea for a sequel series to a show such as rugrats it's boring lacks imagination and it seems that the producers don't even know how 10 to 13 year olds behave to be accurate shouldn't angelica and suzie be comparing bra sizes rather than fight over who's better at doing chores
<START> a movie visually graceful but interesting is mainly the plot the film depicts a zigzag progress of exploring the main actor's innermost feeling max who has lived in new york for two years and intend to marry a girl he met there comes back to paris and unexpectedly meets his ex girlfriend whom he still fancies very much but finally finds out the one he loves the most in fact is her best friend non linear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well the three women max has met symbolize something we must pursue although possibly having no clear picture about the underlying motivations his fiancee is the one he needs rather than the one he loves and thus completely no loyalty we can see she gives him also no love but only stability true love also cannot be found in his relation with the ex girlfriend merely a fantasy for him to escape many things very romantic he has done for her but almost nothing seems amenable the one who really animates max's life in fact is her best friend the equilibrium achieved at the end is not identical to the initial equilibrium because max has understand much more about his innermost feeling the nonlinear structure makes the progress of searching look more complicated not equally ingenious as pulp fiction but things seem much more natural in the apartment max is not the only character who undergoes a transformation and in fact interesting is also the description to the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful a good commentary of today's love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing br br
<START> i watched all three mad max films in succession for the first time a few days ago and was left bitterly disappointed with the third instalment it destroys the fine work of the first two films with weak and cheesy action and a story line that turns the apocalyptic australian wastelands into a comical sand pit one would expect to see in a children's adventure movie the character of max is unrecognisable from his dark and cynical persona seen in the previous films and changed into a predictable uninteresting saviour that left me feeling betrayed if you haven't seen this film yet then simply don't let the story end with the road warrior and save yourself a very painful hour and a half spoiler alert the other major issue i had with this film that truly left a bitter taste in my mouth was the flying man we had already seen him in the road warrior where he had helped max and yet when he reappears in thunderdome it looks like the two had never met whether he was supposed to be a different character or a relative of the road warriors gyro man i do not know however it was not explained and is a weak element in this overall weak film 2 out of 10 doesn't get a 1 10 because of the thunderdome fight
<START> i just finished watching this film for me the most outstanding work in this film was the music score while many silent film scores work very well with their scenes i feel that this is the best score i've come across the mutiny scenes in particular worked extremely well
<START> let me get this out of the way before i trash this film i love park chan work as a director while i disagree with the masses saying he's is the best director working in our time i can't deny that he understands how to use a camera very effectively i really liked one of his other films sympathy for mr vengeance also min acting was the only thing that allowed me to take this film seriously for 1 5 of the runtime that is br br now the bad the plot is simply the oldest clichÃ© used in cinema literature i'll never understand how critics can trash a hollywood blockbuster for being clichÃ© then hail movies like oldboy which are just as unoriginal and clichÃ©d if not even more so regardless oldboy is flat out one of the most generic unoriginal movies ever conceived spoilers man is held captive man seeks revenge man finds out he had sex with a family member man's life is over end spoilers simply put this plot line has been used in everything from greek plays to modern melodramatic soap operas and countless movies books in between it is so melodramatic and unoriginal when the major reveal happens i laughed out loud does that mean i'm a desensitized freak without emotions as some reviews of this film say about people like me no what it means overdone plots make people laugh the scary movie franchise proved that and oldboy proved it as well why can't people think of something that is truly disturbing instead of just spewing out tried clichÃ©s masked with fancy camera work and classical music that brings up the issue of blood gore simply put it isn't there the director is too timid to even point the camera at the screen when something gory happens as if we're watching a children's movie or something maybe we were anyway i've heard oldboy called the most brutal movie of all time and the most disturbing movie ever but when i watched it i failed to see anything even remotely gory or disturbing all the gore is off screen and even then the violence level is nothing you haven't seen in pg 13 movies like the dark knight or casino royale before why this even got an r rating confuses me much less the most brutal movie of all time seriously i've seen movies that just make oldboy look cute on every level when it comes to violence gore br br the other huge glaring cheesy flaw is the main villain the majority of his screen time he's showing his bare butt off for the audience in comedic american pie style but i'm supposed to think he's oh so evil when he's wearing clothes his hair is slicked back like a bad asian mix of the cheesiest james bond villain mixed with something out of austin powers he talks like a brain dead teenager recovering from an acid overdose and his dialogue is so bad it had me laughing yet again seriously oldboy had me laughing more than any comedy this year br br in the end oldboy is for those of you who sip fine wine have no sense of humor and talk about how boring your lives are at dinner parties it's for those people who are so stuck up in their own ego they forgot how unoriginal they are and consequently forgot how unoriginal and boring the films never movies they enjoy are br br to those people all i can say is this i like films and also like movies i like thoughtful dramas that actually say something about the human condition and i also like pointless action movies that thrill me into a coma but the thing is for me to like both films and movies they have to be original they have to be something i haven't seen so many times i lost count of the number of times the plot has been used when something isn't original it's expendable if it does exactly what everyone else does it's forgettable and boring before you give oldboy yet another perfect rating because it touched you maybe you should think about something wouldn't a movie equally as touching but at the same time original make you think more i just wish someone other than me would understand this br br overall oldboy is forgettable and cheesy br br 1 10
<START> i've read a lot of reviews about showtime on imdb and many seem to miss the mark i've noticed a lot of reviewers calling this the typical buddy film de niro is in no way murphy's buddy throughout most of this movie in fact part of the comedy of this film is de niro's reluctance to be friends with anybody br br murphy really shines in this one he is back at doing what he does best acting like a complete ham he is a cop who wants so much to be an actor and enjoys being in the reality show de niro is perfect as the straight man who thinks the entire thing is stupid i thought the two of them had great chemistry and were a perfect casting choice rene russo is also great as the tv producer of course she loves everything murphy does and tries so hard along with to get deniro going too br br a lot of reviewers have touched on the hilarious scene with william shatner reprising his role as tj hooker to train de niro how to act like cops but my favorite scene involves murphy in the confessional hoping he could get a snipes like cop to team up with instead of de niro man that was hilarious comedies often depend on your personal tastes sure you could poke holes in the plot most often you can with a comedy i was psyched to see the pairing of murphy and de niro i think it brought out the best in murphy which was nice to see him at the top of his game again i can only imagine it was a great honor for murphy to be paired with the great de niro rating 8 of 10 stars
