<START> as i mentioned in other comments i became a real big fan of david bradley ever since i saw him in american ninja 3 the guy is great doing martial arts has some kind of charisma and is a cool looking dude on screen he went to the dtv department ever since his debut and has remained as one of the king of tv movies until 2001 where he apparently stopped making movies now one thing is watching cyborg cop or hard justice which are crappy clichÃ©d movies but real fun to watch coz they're entertainingly bad if that has any sort of meaning but another thing is watching a tasteless piece of boredom like total reality i mean this and crisis are the two biggest pieces of horse dung this guy ever did i wouldn't recommend this not even to the biggest hardcore fans if i had known this and crisis were going to be so f g crap i wouldn't have spent the 3 or 4 euros they cost me total reality is just as boring as crisis although funnily it starts promising a group of military prisoners in the future are given a chance to stop some kind of disaster in the past i'm sorry i didn't really pay much attention to this atrociousness and they only have 24 hours to get back or something like that if they don't they're stranded there forever the poor director who oversaw this tries some humorous clichÃ©s like the convicts arriving on earth and not knowing what a truck is for example wow hilarious the movie follows up with david bradley teaming up with some earth girl for the rest of the flick this bored me so much that i had to force myself to watch it in like 3 or 4 installments to at least make use of the 4 or 5 euros it cost me that's coz every time i tried i fell asleep and if you get a movie with david bradley with just one crappy 10 second fight scene in it then that's the final touch which would contribute to you throwing it off a hundred foot cliff so as never to see it again i wish i could meet the director of this pile of poo on the street and i swear to god i'd ask him back for mi 5 euros i'd also love to meet david bradley to ask him why in god's name did he choose to star in this poor excuse for a movie don't even bother with this film i mean it from the bottom of my heart not renting borrowing it and specially not buying it
<START> totally forgettable and almost unwatchable if you enjoy bad acting thin plots and predictably weak outcomes pull up a chair of passing interest to see bridget fonda look a like suzy amis
<START> it doesn't surprise me that the makers of this hopeless movie couldn't find a uk distributor and then had to release it as a free dvd with a sunday newspaper the distributors could clearly see what the film makers and the sunday newspaper couldn't that this was one movie that just wasn't going to recoup its costs br br since it's a thriller about riddles it would have helped if they'd picked a lead actor who could enunciate properly rather than the mumbling vinnie jones who appears to pronounce riddle as and it would have helped if the dialogue hadn't been swamped by noisy locations or scenes flooded with distracting and inappropriate music the plot is ludicrous the lost charles dickens story supposedly helps our hero solve a series of modern murders but so would a copy of herge's adventures of tintin since the link between dickens and jones is more non existent than tenuous and we have the ridiculous premise that a would be investigative journalist who lays his hands on a previously undiscovered dickens manuscript would take several days to read it just so that flashbacks to dickens can continue to be played throughout the movie as if they had some connection to it which they don't i mean if you found a new dickens manuscript wouldn't you just go somewhere quiet and read it the film ends with one of those surprise revelations that have become mandatory since the sixth sense but in this case it doesn't so much surprise you as insult your intelligence if the film is suddenly going to turn supernatural at the twelfth hour then revealing that vinnie jones is a robot might have been more acceptable it might not have seemed so turgid if the film had been stylish but it isn't and in several places it appears decidedly amateur there's a scene where a table is laid with a 60's jump cut technique but they haven't made sure that the person actually laying the table is completely out of frame between the cuts consequently you can see things changing at the edge of frame when you're really supposed to be watching things changing at the centre of frame a good rule in movie making is if you don't understand how to do a technique then try something else br br the real riddle is why anyone thought it would be a good idea to make this movie in the first place
<START> the robot vs the aztec mummy was one of the silliest and least believable films i've ever seen o k i can buy that the woman in the film is a reincarnation of a virgin that was sacrificed to an aztec god what i can't buy is that the incredibly phony looking mummy and the even worse looking robot when you want to watch a film like this you want to see lots of fighting action but the robot and the mummy fight for about a minute total probably worst of all was the dia de los muertos art they had in the credits it's the worst i've ever seen avoid this one if possible
<START> this film is one of the best of 1986 with creepy yet intriguing performances from crispin glover and dennis hopper the reagan years were pretty bleak for a lot of people not just teenagers but this flick really captured the desperation and despair well directed with great script apparently based on a true story i don't really see any weaknesses in this the opening shot was brilliant br br keanu reeves was decent for a change and miss skye was right on the money hopper had three other great performances that same year blue velvet texas chainsaw ii and hoosiers i imagine this has a cult following and i wonder how this picture would fare if it was re released super stuff
<START> by 1950 john ford had already fully developed the ideas and motifs that would form the core of his most successful westerns always present for example is a strong sense of community most poignantly captured in the family of steinbeck's 'the grapes of wrath 1940 ' within these communities even amid ford's loftier themes of racism and the pioneer spirit there's always room for the smaller human interactions the minor friendships and romances that make life worth living master 1950 ' came after ford had released the first two films in his cavalry trilogy Â apache 1948 ' and 'she wore a yellow ribbon 1949 ' Â and it covers similar territory only without the military perspective and more damningly the strong lead of john wayne ben johnson and harry cary jr are fine actors but they feel as though they should be playing second fiddle to somebody and ward bond's cursing mormon elder while potentially a candidate for such a role isn't given quite enough focus to satisfactorily fit the bill br br in master ' ford seems so comfortable with his tried and tested western formula that any character development is largely glossed over ben johnson's romance with joanne dru is treated as an obligation more than anything else and harry cary jr's charming of a mormon girl is so perfunctory as to be almost nonexistent in the final film leaving one to ponder the survival of deleted scenes only in charles charismatic and shamelessly villainous uncle shiloh does ford try some different and it works even with his being surrounded by a troop of insufferably hammy slack jawed yokels where ford does succeed is in orchestrating the conglomeration of three distinct races of americans Â the values orientated the easygoing horse traders the eccentric travelling Â into a cohesive community of pioneers looking towards a bright future this apparent harmony is thrown into disarray by the arrival of uncle gun toting outlaws who exploit the lawlessness of the western frontier but ultimately lose out to the noble cowboys who only ever drew on snakes br br ford reportedly considered wagon master among the favourite of his films and perhaps this has something to do with the absence of big names like john wayne or henry fonda armed only with his stock selection of usual players ford is able to generate a sense of community by avoiding placing focus on any one character though most of the travellers still remain completely anonymous despite being undoubtedly well made i can't help feeling that this film only does well what other ford pictures did even better the terrific majesty of the the western frontier was presented more beautifully in 'she wore a yellow the romances and friendly squabbles among community members took greater prominence in the early relations with native americans only hinted at here were more thoroughly examined in 'the searchers 1956 ' the bold pioneering spirit of the early settlers was explored more movingly albeit by henry hathaway and george marshall in 'how the west was won 1962 ' is pure john ford but it isn't a landmark
<START> my website www org lists this pick as the worst movie of all time here is an excerpt br br if i were strapped down to a chair and forced to watch this movie over and over again i couldn't imagine hell being any worse jim varney plays a three handed crazy guy bent on destroying the world apparently starting with cinema now let's face it no one expects a whole lot from a varney movie but this agonizing drivel had me dry heaving for 92 minutes not a laugh not one this is not kamp or this is not even mindless it is evil do not rent this it may destroy your dvd player do not even buy the vhs from a 29 cent clearance bin to use as a blank tape it is the worst film of all time period i mean it really
<START> i saw this version about a decade ago and have been looking for it ever since i just recently found an original vhs version and purchased it for 125 00 sounds crazy but if you like me consider it as one of the best the broadway musical stage has ever produced you wouldn't even think twice br br why it's just a little over paying for a broadway ticket today i really hope they re release this in dvd form soon it's a piece of musical theater that screams to be seen by all
<START> i just watched this film and i have to say it surprised me it was very well done with good acting and a deep look at high school students from japan in adolescent love br br the look and feel is a lot different from many movies and you can easily get into the film much of the emphasis seems to be in the story itself which is extremely subtle the main theme and relations with other characters are a bit complex but the the overall sense of realism and dimensions still pulls you in br br a main draw back is of course those who like something simple which is not here you have to be open to many things including a new culture to get more into the film br br i did enjoy this film though it is worth watching
<START> taking into consideration the chan films that would follow this isn't bad plenty of stereotypes beginning with the black man in the beginning and when the police captain orders that every hindu in town by rounded up a parade of stereotypical characters enter the scene including shemp of the three stooges charlie seems to move quickly around the city going from sutton pl to the w village in a flash the ending is silly an obvious toy airplane is used as it climbs through the sky and then nose dives ed wood couldn't have done it better the final scene is absurd as the murderer will obviously incriminate himself in his attempt to quiet the one person who knows his identity overall it is worth watching
<START> jack webb finally gives something besides his usual wooden indian performance he played the epitome of the jarhead brainwashed storm the beaches fi bonehead military idiot the corps before all else even humanity this great film showed the of boot camp to it's fullest 4 stars
<START> spoilers br br oh sure it's based on moby dick totally obsessed and it destroy's him it's a total folly the movie starts off rather well but by the end of the film everyone else is destroyed and the main star's mind is a blank br br the supposed half sister is never convincing some very poor lighting effects music is interesting but little else it took me over a month to finally finish the darn thing i suppose if you like being john malkovich you might like this but where as bjm was a great movie that i just didn't want to watch again x is a movie i just hate to high hell the only possible excitement in the film is the incest sexual scene towards the end of the film hopefully yer not thinking of catherine either br br this movie is severely boring depressing and poorly directed not highly recommended if if you like french movies go watch crimson rivers instead br br 4 10 br br quality 5 10 entertainment 1 10 replayable 0 10
<START> even after nearly 20 years apart the original members of black sabbath have not lost a thing in this concert they perform their best songs from their heyday 1970 1978 including n i b war pigs and paranoid br br also included is priceless backstage footage with interviews and retrospectives into their days as the top hard rock band on the planet the comments of ozzy tony geezer butler and bill ward are just as interesting and intriguing to watch as the fabulous onstage performances br br a must see for all sabbath and ozzy fans
<START> this movie is everything a tenacious d fans can hope for director liam lynch partnered with the d is a concoction of epic proportions of course you need to understand the humour and format of tenacious d when i saw it there wasn't too many laughs from the audience but the reason is not a lack of humour or intelligent jokes this movie seems to have been released on to an unsuspecting public that haven't themselves with the musical duo this movie does stay true to it's roots for the few of you who have seen the hbo tv series and heard the album they have not forgotten what their audience loves like the tv show people have noticed from the trailer the jb and apartment scenes and of course the open mic nights that each tenacious d episode would start and finish with the soundtrack is phenomenal and each song blows you away br br and dave plays a fantastic devil br br this is the perfect movie for those of you looking for a hard time and a rocking musical
<START> young writers young auteur young cast busload of producers what could go wrong everything even lame is too good a description that suggests that three of four legs were functioning when actually none of them were barely enough recycled plotline for a 48 and a half minute television hour gratingly stretched to ninety minutes the audience was talking back to the screen so bad was the story dirty cops steal drugs from the evidence locker how many thousands of times has this been done on television bad cops frame good cops again how many times there was not an original shred in this entire concoction giovanni ribisi made a valiant effort to prop up the lack of script drawing the only laughs of the entire movie and the thought of he and claire danes working from a real script with a grown up director and photographed by an actual cinematographer intrigues me note to screenwriters buy one of those story generators it can't possibly be as bad as ripping off bad television note to auteur there are shots available to you other than closeups even the lovely and interesting face of claire danes eventually grows tiresome in closeup note to cinematographer apprentice yourself to a professional for a few years you have much to learn note to color timer at the lab at least try to persuade the auteur and the cinematographer that they don't know what they're talking about note to claire i hope this paid for your new condo it's time to get some professional management and start actually reading the scripts before signing on
