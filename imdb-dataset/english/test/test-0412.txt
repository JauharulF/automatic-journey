<START> one of the more interesting films i've seen lord montague is br br black lord capulet is in charge of the porn industry that was br br handed down to him by montague not to mention the dismemberment of fingers the squishing of heads etc etc br br another troma hit this beats the toxic avenger this is by far my br br favorite troma flick and there's a priest who fights like bruce lee nothing can beat br br that
<START> this short deals with a severely critical writing teacher whose criticism extends into his everyday life when he learns why that's not a good idea we learn a bit about the beautiful craft of writing that he's been lecturing on
<START> dark harvest is a very low budget production made by a bunch of rank amateurs which manages to come off as a kind of semi professional movie unfortunately the poor effects wooden acting and unoriginal story makes this a very mediocre horror slasher at best by no means is dark harvest the worst horror movie i've ever seen it just isn't anything special and has nothing in it to warrant a second watch or hope for a sequel you know a director has doubts about their own horror film when a there is some pointless nudity and b the movie's so short they add some rather boring outtakes at the end credits that nobody really cares about because the movie wasn't that good a slightly better movie which i can't help feeling was the inspiration for dark harvest is the eighties movie 'scarecrows' which is an ok movie but still pretty average br br dark harvest isn't as bad as some of the other comments say it is but don't think that you will be entertained much either one thing i also have to comment on is the character of angela who has a really terrible english accent what was the point in that to maybe give it a certain touch of class yeah right english people do not say when they mean to say water and i don't care what part of england they are from if you can't find a genuine english actress or a non english actress who can put on a brilliant english accent not many of them about then don't bother sheesh final score 4 10
<START> the word actually means a small sharp wooden game instrument that is used in a game called a precursor to cricket in india the use of the word as nickname for the principal character is stylish as it signifies one who is sharp fast and can hurt badly when rubbed in the wrong way br br is one of the best movies for vijay and in it is unrivaled in its pace and action the movie never slacks for a moment and keep you always with some exciting action the movie is set in and chennai and its story core is simple a rich landlord tries to a beautiful girl in his town and his unquestionable power and authority prevents the girl from seeking a justice the hero tries to rescue her and the majority of this movie portrays the week in which all this action happens br br a very exciting movie and though the story is nothing new the director and the actors receive praise for the full paced action
<START> whenever i see a video like this i have to ask myself how it was financed hbo or showtime or whatever must pay for the production company to go through the motions to hire someone who may or may not actually speak english to get high and hammer out something approaching a plot to pay strippers with terrifying boob jobs to bounce up and down on grossly waxed torsos to find people to design and light sets to purchase the rights to cheesy techno music etc but i have to imagine this has to be a vanity project for whoever's serving as executive producer he had to have nailed all of those girls right and not wrong about the spanish looking girl but to call the cops stunning is awfully generous in fact i'd go so far as to call them something much closer to hideous or fugly watching these women writhe around sometimes clearly high on pain killers was so far from erotic that my testicles actually ascended inside of my body gross br br why waste time with this when there's so much freely available hardcore porn on the internet i wonder whether the of internet video will slowly kill the softcore video industry one can only hope right
<START> the japanese have probably the most sadistic movies around the world and this is one of the strongest examples with a running time at about an hour it contains enough sexual violence and gore to disgust every single sane person on earth even those who are hunting this type of movies three men and a woman are making a porn film after some normally shots which are pixelated the girl is tied up and the madmen cut her food arm and tong after that they make a hole in her abdomen and a man has sexual intercourse with her intestines he is knocked unconscious too and has his penis cut off the special effects are good for an obviously low budget production only the tong cut scene looks fake and we can't talk about acting direction or screenplay after hearing a lot about this film i was very happy when i finally found it the first part is pretty boring but the second one totally f k up my mind the torture and killing scenes being some of the most extreme and disturbing i have ever seen the gore hounds will be satisfied by tumbling doll of flesh but an unknowing viewer shouldn't even read the synopsis
<START> i had been amazed by director back in 2003 his first american project vacancy was less impressive but a decent start armored is his second feature and while the visual signature is recognizable the film never rises above the level of a b movie br br it's a shame because the main premise has all the ingredients for twists and turns and the ensemble cast featuring many quality actors should be able to deliver could have made a great heist film but instead goes for an action flick then again he could have shot a cool action flick but it doesn't really deliver in that department either br br what you are left with is one implausible situation after another a group of poorly sketched characters bicker and fight over a sum of money if you look past the sharp cinematography cast and the tight music score you're left with what could have been a below average direct to video featuring van damme or seagal br br this was probably the most disappointing movie for me in quite some time
<START> as i sat watching this episode i kept glancing at the clock waiting for something to happen as the hour wound down i thought they were really going to give us a big pop at the end and then nothing the whole family is huddled around the christmas tree like something from the hallmark channel then fade to black br br perhaps one of the poorest season finales i've ever seen nothing at all to drum up any excitement for next season the only thing thrown out as any sort of incentive to watch the next season was the ambiguous nugget offered up by agent harris while pawing a sub sandwich that the guys in new york were looking to get one of the guys in new jersey wow really i would never expect something like that from mobsters i'm on the edge of my seat br br it almost seems like they're trying to get everyone to lose interest they start more plot lines that end up just disappearing than any show i've ever seen they tease and hint but rarely deliver any more br br what's with the arabs that hang out at the bing they keep throwing them in front of us and magically nothing happens br br paulie knee caps some kid after tony promised his mother that nothing would happen to her son and poof gone in the wind br br and how many more meandering drug montages with christopher are we going to have to endure please have him get arrested or overdose or something interesting br br this was one of the few shows that i used to looked forward to watching but now bout it
<START> possible spoiler alert though there's not much to spoil about this film i saw project a part ii not having seen the first movie i don't think i missed much project a part two is not only the worst jackie chan film i've seen to date yes worse than fantasy mission force' this film is one of the most unwatchable films the world has ever seen it's right up there with plan 9 from outer space' on the sleep inducing scale the plot is twisted up and like a 50 foot ball of yarn the cat's been playing with and finally left for dead the if you could call it that seems to have been written by an annoying high school freshman who despite how many people tell him he's not funny is determined to get his lame humor out no matter how painful a movie is made and this movie is painfully bad the plot involves jackie chan as a navy officer recruited by the police force to round up all known he rounds them up in the first half hour of the movie and i prayed for a quick ending which i didn't get why the movie bothers to progress from this point i haven't a clue the movie drags on and on and on with no purpose no plot and attempts at humor that fail so miserably they make carrot top look like a comedic genius the kung fu in this movie is lame and forgettable there's better kung fu in that movie about the 3 ninja kids project a part ii is neither an action movie nor a kung fu movie it is however a complete waste of the talents of jackie chan and maggie cheung who have made films worlds superior to this as jackie chan repeatedly escapes certain death i enter blair witch' mode asking and wishing is he going to die now so the movie can end an example of how ludicrous this movie is jackie chan is handcuffed to another man a gang of pirates that look nothing like pirates throw axes at jackie does jackie grab one of the wayward axes and break the chain on the handcuffs no you see that would spoil the gag of him being handcuffed to another person if you have a friend who laughs at everything i encourage you to watch this movie with him or her and watch as even they won't get a chuckle out of this film if you're an insomniac this movie is sure to put you to sleep do not operate heavy machinery while watching plan a part ii possible side effects include headache strain and death by boredom 0 9 stars
<START> this is one you can watch over and over and laugh just as much each time we have been on a keaton fest around here after purchasing some of his films in this one buster is mistaken for an escaped murderer and there are lots of chase scenes and crazy scenes but also what is best about buster his creativity the opening scene is really funny and it just keeps going from there
<START> william h macy is brilliant as everyman caught in a desperate situation starts off with a bang and never lets up twists and surprises are fresh unpredictable use of film noir clips and frequent quotes and references to 30's and 40's flicks makes this a delightful must for movie buffs
<START> i absolutely love promised land the first episode that i saw was while i was on my mission from 2003 2005 i really loved the rich family background portrayed in the show here was a family with struggles of their own but instead of dwelling on them they would reach out with love to others who may have had the same problems in an effort to forget themselves and go to work this is what caused me to fall in love with the show all of the actors especially gerald mcraney had demonstrated the true meaning of family which has left an indelible mark on my life i have been down the same road they have but it has taken allot of time for me to develop that kind of character i love this show so much that i have wanted to share it with friends but i was really stunned when i had heard that it was taken off the air i thought and still think they should bring it back so many lives can benefit from heaven inspired media i honestly believe that this show was divinely inspired because it brings the spirit every time i see just one episode this show really in my book has truly defined what a promised land is it is the love that you hold in your heart for others which brings you to a higher destination the spirit of love is one of the most potent messages in this series and all i can say is bring it back robert
<START> this is the essence of the early eighties the malls the credit card machines the food the punk hair color the soundtrack i am in love with this movie this sweet intelligent romeo juliet teen flick is instantly addictive br br martha coolidge is one of my favorite directors she really employs her actors like john hughes and steven soderberg so check out joy of sex and real genius the soundtracks for valley girl are great if you can find a copy of the film buy it it's out of print and very hard to come by
<START> wait wait wait wait wait wait what this movie is terrible absolutely terrible 1 the only reason kiefer sutherland is on the cover is to sell it to kiefer fans only to have their hearts broken he kills one guy gets shot and dies before half the movie is over not to mention he was only in the first 10 min and then disappeared until the point which he died why put him on the cover if his character blows 2 where are the epic battle scenes promised in the preview on the back cover 3 it was way too confusing i mean whats up with the girl she had to narrate the movie to try to get our attention she failed 4 if kiefer dies in a movie it fails now i am going to go watch 24 this movie fails
<START> an extremely fast paced exhilarating interesting detail rich book its a huge shame that the film had none of these qualities not only was tom hanks' mild mannered portrayal or robert langdon laughable but the name changes to key characters huge deviances from the original story line and poor irish italian accent from played by ewan mcgregor made for the worst book to film ever br br as a huge fan of a d the book i had high hopes for a more lavish true to book detailed movie where it would start and finish just as the book did leaving me wanting more br br all the film really did was depress me within the 1st 10 minutes br br what was impressive was how the sorry i couldn't even finish that sentence without laughing br br in short was the token hottie a very second to audrey tatou and there were some very nice br br i would recommend reading the book to understand that if ron howard must insist on making another book to film i would be happy saving my Â£6 40 for a kfc zinger meal and some chicken wings far more entertaining and deeply more satisfying
