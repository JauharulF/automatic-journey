<START> i bought this movie at a thrift store months before my friend told me about it when we were talking about dumb movies we've seen once i spotted the cassette i knew i had to have it i watched it that night i could tell it was going to be very cheesy and cheaply done that's what drew me to it i popped it in and i laughed the whole way through i recognized gregory the ice cream man but i didn't recognize his name and i couldn't remember where i saw him later while watching the andy griffith show clint howard ice cream man was featured as an extra since he is ron howard taylor 's brother i saw the credits and i gasped i turned to my mom who was also watching the show and said that's the ice cream man she too gasped this movie is great but only for laughs and it is the perfect example of a cheesy horror flick if you feel like laughing as well as poking fun at low budget movies rent this video
<START> an independant film that from the back of the box promises twists adventure and an emotional adventure we will never forget this film also fools us into watching it by flaunting rachel lee cook with a starring role after the first twenty minutes you realize that this movie is going to give you nothing the story goes on aimlessly revealing nothing new or important to keep us interested all three disturbed characters have only small of back story to force us to care just as you reach the end everything about the story is altered and instead of helping the audience catch up you are left with no idea and more importantly no interest in why the director who also thought it would be a good idea to co star seems to come into the film with no prior experience or knowledge of useful filmmaking the entire piece looks like a college art film crafted by a freshman film student trying to hide a lack of true talent
<START> inferno gives los angeles what it deserves a baptism in fire death from above an excellent cast of obsessed characters could survive and sweat out the passing of the mass ejection but that would be no fun and certainly not dramatic a really lame review in variety criticized the characters for being concerned with their personal redemption instead of banning together to save the world but what's refreshing about this big heat is that there's nothing anyone can do about it we are therefore mercifully not subjected to heart warming scenes of fascist presidents and other big blowhard as they contrive implausible plots to save a chosen remnant of mankind ala deep impact here the sweat drenched and lust powered dirty half dozen work out their own redemption or face their personal the old fashioned way together as individuals or alone with the alone excellent tv film all in all clearly not by the destructive of overzealous network execs i highly recommend
<START> ken burns' baseball is a decent documentary it presents a clear origin of the game a great depiction of baseball's early years and heroes there's plenty in this movie for any baseball fan that said the film has several glaring flaws br br 18 hours is simply too long for the human attention span it's clear that burns stretched his film out to fit his nine inning concept it's not even a tight 18 hours the pace on every segment is slow almost morose the music always nostalgic and wistful isn't baseball ever exciting and fun why is every player and their accomplishments presented in the form of a tragedy talking head after talking head turn every pitch into an emotional heartbreak yakking about baseball as a metaphor baseball as americana the psychology and theology of baseball enough this is syrupy mawkish drivel billy crystal is here to sell us all the yankee hokum he's sold us before ken burns uses the national anthem as the series' theme song and manages to play take me out to the ballgame so many times you might vomit we get it dude br br clearly burns is a neo hollywood faux liberal so he spends probably a third of the film on the negro leagues these segments are spent chastising whites of yesterday for not being as open minded as kenny is today for shame he chides baseball for being segregated in the thirties and forties but fails to realize that america was segregated in those times burns falls head over heels in love with buck o'neil a former negro league player and drools over every piece of footage in which the elderly o'neil waxes poetic about his playing days nonsense br br burns would have been better off with an adult to help him edit his creation down baseball winds up as mushy gushy civil rights propaganda disguised as americana its clear that burns is not a baseball fan otherwise he would know we watch games laughing and cheering not weeping and reciting soliloquies are you listening mr burns there's no crying in baseball
<START> pluses mary boland is delightfully on edge as always i never tire of her upper crust zaniness especially in the women and pride and prejudice w c brief role is fun though the famous pool table scene stretches its welcome a bit because it seems to go on for ten minutes the madcap antics of the film typical of the period are great also a nod to alison wonderfully grounded hotel mistress i would love to see more of her she reminds me of marie dressler another personality worthy of high praise br br minuses gracie allen an irritating unfunny presence whose annoyance went unmatched until the rise of adam sandler that near falsetto tinged with an accent of unknown origin gets old in her very first scene this is the first of the burns allen films i have seen and while i as a big classic comedy buff try to experience at least one film with every major comedy star this is definitely one team i will not be calling upon again her timing and interpretation of the material is totally off a maddeningly mediocre talent br br the bottom line an ok comedy but the gags are few and far between and at only an hour long you can expect that this is not an a grade hollywood comedy recommended only for boland and fields fans who want to see all of their work
<START> so ya think you've seen every mafia movie ever made here's one that nobody every heard of it's a low budget quickie b movie shot in the swamps of jersey for us mob movie fans it had a little bit of everything sex violence cursing and wise guys acting like while violence dominated the movie i found myself laughing at some familiar scenes i've since seen on the sopranos and goodfellas look for a 1977 version of the girls in the beginning of the movie br br all our favorite mobster stereotypes were featured here and as for realism joe pesci was superb portraying the classic wise guy character like we seen him do so many times over the years this was probably his first shot and it was a gem pesci fans should run to the video store to check out this flick you have to look carefully for it since it goes by different names my copy called it the family enforcer here it is known as the death collector but whatever name it goes under it's should be called a winner
<START> is not a masterpiece which apparently was what it needed to be upon first release to justify its great cost and more importantly the continued uneasy reliance of hollywood on the auteur model of film making yet seen today at last on dvd in a cut of minutes is a superb film it is a touch lethargic in pace but at least it is paced quite apart from the incompetence of construction that marks many films today there have been many films which deliberate in form have been severely damaged by being hacked down with no care for rhythm so the films become shapeless and confusing beyond this the criticisms leveled at the film have become in retrospect quite lame if the good guys and bad guys are too obviously pronounced for a serious film and yes sam mustachioed fur clad villain is comic opera and not in the multi leveled manner of bill the butcher from of new york' and yes the townsfolk do seem a touch 'fiddler on the roof' on occasions then a few dozen serious films made since then including 'titanic' and the which bears certain similarities and is a notable failure in convincing qualities compared to this film can be castigated for exactly the same reason br br also despite accusations the film has a plot quite a well essayed plot at that it simply does not bow to standard form quality by providing titan heroes rafts of sub plots and confusion it experiments with telling in a manner more like much smaller modest films by carefully caught moments of character interaction and well textured pageant like explosions of communal action as with the opening at harvard and most specially the wonderful scene where the johnson county folk following the lead of a brilliantly physical fiddler make celebration on roller skates br br 'the deer hunter' was a critical and commercial success but abandoned the first half's inspired mosaic like accumulation of detail and i think in a manner similar to criticism of robert penn warren's novel 'all the king's men' and its dictionary of stunts if cimino had not had such a strong grasp of the conventions of hollywood epics he might have made a special rare work of art based in honest of people within their milieu in contrast succeeds in screwing its narrative momentum and tension upwards in a slowly expanding arc until the finale explodes whilst not abandoning the mosaic approach br br the central romantic triangle for instance resists standard inflections a decent intelligent but psychically defeated man james kris kristofferson competes with a hot shot but identity challenged young gunman nate champion christopher walken for the hand of a young madame ella watson isabelle huppert there is no self conscious bed hopping no slaps in the face recriminations or typical sad sack moments but more a sad and distanced decision by ella to choose the younger man whom she loves less because he is ready to make the commitment ella emerges as the film's true hero huppert's performance though initially awkward is really quite excellent balancing a dewy emotionalism with a hard hammered spirit attempting first to rescue nate and then the resistance party of immigrants into an enterprising defence subsequently is stung into action as friends die indeed in the process of overcoming so many traps of clichÃ© and style successfully and willfully throws off the defeated outsider heroes grace note of so many '70s westerns and portrays an eventual vigorous cheer the heroes rallying to a compromised but still relished victory br br the social conflict of so many '70s westerns at last into a fully fledged war where capital attempts a crushing final victory over the miscreants who stand in their way suddenly they find a and more powerful people's army led by the man who played the thoroughly destroyed billy the kid a decade before this is what led the film to be described as the first marxist western but really it simply deflowers a theme of the genre extant well before the '60s such various and classic old school works as william wyler's 'the and even tell awfully similar stories it is simply here that the romantic myth of the gunslinger has been replaced by the romantic myth of the people's revolt in a spectacular exiting but realistic and thus chaotic finale the marauding is attacked ringed by dust clouds punctuated by fallen horses writhing bodies and gunfire puts his classical education to work finally by stealing a roman trick and bringing the cattlemen to the brink of annihilation before they are rescued by the cavalry another distinctly touch but surely not so offensive after 'little big man's unrelenting depiction of native american massacres really it's hard to think of a more heroically american vision of grassroots resistance the film's only real dead spot stands as an unnecessary coda indicating eventual a rather potted piece of tragedy br br despite then certain failings and a slow mid section is a supreme piece of work a genuine attempt to create a contemporary western and a new kind of epic if one has to still join the chorus that reckons cimino was absurd in his behaviour on set and expenditure it is regretfully when today flops like 'the adventures of pluto and 19 the see nearly a hundred million dollars sink down the drain and yet a tag of infamy still hangs on this film one ponders what exactly its grim death signified the attempt at original style the bawdy sexuality the very hard won sense of detail the breathtaking rigor of the film making and what is being filmed all throw into contrast what is sorely lacking in so much contemporary hollywood product
<START> i love it i love pauly shore it seems some people don't agree it's humor and he's not like everyone else the movie is great i love the story line and most of the people in the movie it's funny from the first time she meets him at school i like the fact that she chooses him over the guy back home i like that tiffani isn't a bad girl in the end all the secrets are let out only the people you want to see are left in the end except for those of you who don't like pauly shore even if you don't like him there are funny parts and her family tortures him through most of the movie she's country girl gone wild and needs to be heard she finally makes it it's got just the right amount of love and romance i give it an 8 out of 10
<START> jeff just before dawn is definitely one of the most underrated horror movies ever made the film whilst a little bit influenced by deliverance and the texas chain saw massacre is extremely creepy and memorable the suspense almost never lets up and the atmosphere is genuinely eerie the cast is excellent deborah benson and jamie rose are great female leads the inbred twins are truly frightening and remorseless killers the film is beautifully shot it was actually filmed on location at silver falls state park in oregon there is very little gore but one killing when is stabbed in the groin is pretty nasty and unpleasant a must see for slasher fans 10 out of 10 what else
<START> the college teacher larry donner billy cristal is a blocked writer since his former wife kate mulgrew ruined him stealing his novel that became a best seller he does not hide his hatred for upsetting his girlfriend beth ryan kim greist who is an anthropologist teacher in the same college while giving classes of creative writing he is stalked by the student owen danny devito that wants to know his opinion about his crime tale larry tells that he did not like it and explains that in every mystery tale the murderer should eliminate the motive and establish an alibi otherwise he would get caught further larry suggests owen to watch hitchcock's movies to understand the structure of a suspenseful story owen who wants to kill his detestable mother anne ramsey watches strangers on a train and misunderstands larry's advice believing that his teacher wants to swap murders to eliminate the motive owen travels to hawaii and while in a ship falls overboard vanishing in the sea and is considered dead however larry does not have an alibi and becomes the prime suspect while the deranged owen presses him to kill his mother as part of their supposed deal br br throw momma from the train is one of the funniest comedies of the 80's and a great tribute to alfred hitchcock the direct reference is strangers on a train but there are jokes with vertigo with the spinning camera family plot with the car without breaks and other movies the lines are excellent and there is an interesting point when larry tells that every great romance or mystery has a train anne ramsey is amazing in the role of a nasty and abusive dominating mother and the viewer will certainly feel sorrow and understand the insanity of owen kim greist is very beautiful and kate mulgrew is the perfect bitch billy cristal performs an obsessed character with many silly and unreasonable attitudes but necessary to the plot my vote is seven br br title brazil a do throw momma from the train
<START> somehow i missed many of the early farscape episodes so i'm seeing them in all sorts of orders as they are repeated on various channels i first caught it entirely by accident whilst lounging in a hotel room the first 10 seconds had me completely hooked this is what sf is all about br br the characters are strong and pilot the living ship is what should have been the plots vary in quality but none falls below excellent in my opinion and i have to mention what a gloriously irreverent character none of your smarmy sugar coated star trek aliens here this is the real deal cynical self serving and replete with disgusting personal habits is the creation of a genius br br last week the scifi channel showed out of their minds the body swapping episode a true classic i couldn't stop laughing from start to finish br br long may farscape grace our screens
<START> i finally got hold of the excellent dvd of this film which is loaded with interesting extras i have read quite a lot about it and i unfortunately missed it at the stockholm film festival it doesn't quite deliver as i thought it would but it is still worth watching if you like strange and unique movies i much rather watch this again than any of the recent so called horror films vomited out of hollywood these days what detracts from the experience for me is certain music cues which sound dated and rely too much on cheap synth sounds for me all these tonal harmonic elements of the score could have been lifted out and replaced by david excellent sound design but that is just my opinion otherwise this is a daring angry picture with welcome meditative and poetic parts like the fading of the photograph sequence which is beautiful i look forward to seeing ascension and i applaud mitch and for their efforts in producing non mainstream cinema they are a great inspiration as i soon embark on my own short film production
<START> a wonderful movie about people i first saw four friends when it was originally shown in theatres and i've seen it many times since if i'm not watching it when it's on tv i'll get together with friends and rent it invariably the people i've watched this movie with find it enjoyable it deals with friends from childhood to adulthood in the 50's and 60's it's very funny and touching dealing with first love and first sex racism war politics the whole 60's shebang it can also be quite dramatic if you enjoy movies about people this one is definitely worth the time
<START> its a truly awful movie with a laughable storyline some awful acting and a script that ed wood might be ashamed of wagner is laughable in this he plays his role like number two in austin powers easily the worst of the airport movies 1 out of 10
<START> once again i fell for it in my roots i crave a fun and gory horror film even a vampire one even if it's stupid as long as i get my fun gore in the mix i'm a happy camper it doesn't take much so i saw the cover of bled over at hollywood video and was kind of curious what it was about it looked kind of interesting so i decided to rent it why why do i always fall for it not only did this movie not fulfill the satisfaction i needed for my gore and senseless violence and nudity but i was bored out of mind this movie has the to say it's a vampire movie and it's really not i'm so close to going back to the store and begging for money back because this is one of the rare times i actually turned the movie off br br an artist meets a vampire i think dunno i'm still trying to figure out what the heck he was but his name was so i'm assuming maybe he's a cockroach eating guy who likes to freak people out i think i dunno anyways he thinks the artist has a certain flare for darkness so he gives her a drug to go into an alternate fantasy where a vampire exists and needs blood to become alive i think i dunno so her friends get excited and decide they wanna try the drug too i think i dunno so after they decide to try the drug things get weird the fantasies are real i think i dunno and the vampire is now enjoying the will big breasted girls in clad clothing i think i dunno but a couple of the girls really end up being vampires i think i dunno br br sorry for all the i this is possibly one of the worst reviews i'm going to write but that's because this movie was just awful boring and confusing i love just seeing these wanna be actors who you can tell are waiters looking for that big break not too smart that they fell in the clichÃ© of the horror genre sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't in this case they really should have read the script because the movie the look the feel the acting everything about this movie was just bad i really recommend that you just pass the movie if you see it at your video store this possibly could have been an interesting movie with it's concept of a different dimension but why did they pick this director to display his creativity if he even has any this was a bad movie just stay away br br 1 10
