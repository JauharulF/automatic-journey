<START> this is a very long movie indeed but it is quite beautiful and a good example to show why cinema can be considered art a story easily told cannot be expected in les amants but every scene every silence here tells much more than a hundred dialogs touching different perfect in its pictures and soundtrack showing why the close brought by the cinema as one of its main features became the greatest innovation in any dramatic representation someone who is used to that kind of movies where everything is told and action takes place all the time will find this tiring but it is worth watching to find out other possibilities of feeling a story
<START> is a good movie but we recognize too much from other movies in its genre and therefor it lacks originality if you have seen 'goodfellas' dogs' 'pulp fiction' and a bunch of other movies that were inspired by that last one you have seen almost every part from there is a scene that involves torturing that has even the same dialogue as in tarantino's dogs' br br still it is a good movie because not every part is taken from the same movie the complete thing has some new ideas and some nice touches the opening sequence to begin with is quite impressive we meet nick aaron dallas and billy hill james le they get into a fight with a clerk in a gas station over a cup of coffee and it ends with the death of that clerk and the arrival of a cop we've already glimpsed at a suitcase with a lot of money in it br br then we meet casey thomas jane in houston he is married to christine paula marshall but used to be working with nick she doesn't know a thing then nick gives him a call and says that he is coming we learn that he has screwed his friends over and the problems are about to start br br what happens exactly is not for me to reveal but we meet some other characters all interested in the money or the drugs nick also had with him casey has flushed those down the drain br br very funny moments a lot of blood a very funny sub plot involving actor michael jeter and some surprises although if you really think about it you see them coming this is a good movie with some very fine performances nicely directed by skip woods
<START> i don't think i have ever seen a better movie parody mel brooks is insane every time i watch it i find something new and it makes it even more funny than the time before cary elwes is perfect for the role of robin hood it has a great and unexpected ending that leaves you cracking up every character is great from little john and will to maid marian and i laughed the whole way through and will never get tired of it watch it br br if you liked cary elwes in this movie you must definitely see the princess bride
<START> bedrooms and hallways is the kind of film that makes you realize that the drama of life is hidden in the details and that drama can be great fun too even though your own love life and your own friends may not be as unique as the characters in this movie every one is bound to recognize themselves and others in the colorful protagonists of this film and that's the great strength of bedrooms and hallways that the irony of life is that the most confusing things that happen to you can be the most interesting hilarious funny sexy things too hope you'll enjoy the film as much as i have
<START> what an uninteresting hodge podge it could have been something more but no imagination seems to have gone into the script or the direction a man is framed for murder by his wife and her lover the conspirators do a pretty thorough job of making him look guilty but the man richard thomas whose psychiatric records reveal him as stable and unimaginative manages to escape from jail beat it to the beach house and secretly record a conversation between them in which they reveal their guilt then he accidentally drops the tape recorder with all the evidence on it into the sea water but manages to retrieve it he shows a heck of a lot of creativity and improvisational skill for an unimaginative guy if you ask me br br the tape is now damaged goods but it's enough to break down the wife's lover and he sobs out his confession bad people are punished good people are saved br br the location shooting is impressive the beach house is nothing more than a wooden exterior thrown up on the grounds of fort fisher battlefield on the cape fear peninsula the house was torn down immediately after the production wrapped br br it's a pretty place unfortunately it's a little hard to see because someone seems to have shot every scene through a pair of pantyhose stretched over the camera lens it's all very fuzzy and for all the natural splendor of the location the viewer never gets a real sense of place of what the sand feels like of the texture of the gray bark on the stunted evergreens br br the acting is okay but the performers have nothing much to work with the best performance as is often the case is given by dick olsen as a sleazy but not unsympathetic defense lawyer virginia madsen radiates infidelity with every beat of her eyelashes ted mcginley is within his range as an immoral weakling br br the musical score neatly blends the ominous with the mysterious and is effective if you want to hear the original from which this was ripped off rent hitchcock's vertigo and listen to bernard hermann's suspenseful theme br br i can't think of any particular reason to catch this one except utter boredom
<START> for all its many flaws i'm inclined to be charitable towards thing there is the nugget of an interesting creepy claustrophobic hitchcock style story here put this in the hands of a writer like theodore sturgeon or if you prefer british perspective robert bloch or the guy who wrote day of the triffids and you might have had a nasty unsettling little spook story that was the best thing in an book anthology of horror and suspense stories br br however someone chose to tell this story as a feature length movie and a cheap 2nd rate at that and so most of the potential is wasted a story like this really needs a voice like to bring out interesting quirks of character in a better light his classic story the the and is an example of how he can gather together an isolated group of ordinary characters and in the space of 40 pages can turn them into the most amusing sympathetic and fascinating people you've ever met a good writer can with a few chosen words make the reader see some of the most vivid and memorable events ever to scar his emotions br br instead we get a movie where some of the most irritating and unlikeable characters ever made are lumped together and made to interact in unconvincing where did that come from moments that just lie there ie the blond psychic girl declaiming that you're all evil and i hope you are destroyed we get leaden pacing and slow motion blocking and dull sets and stiff actors i blame the director for the and part these are all 3rd rank character actors who never made the big time but they are also 'real' actors and a good director could have gotten better performances out of them we get uncalled for lesbian overtones that make the viewer feel uneasy and exploited without delivering any kind of payoff if i'm going to have my baser instincts exploited and feel guilty about it i want done by stuff staged better than this and we get over an hour of creepy build up diffused in about 35 seconds in one of the worst anti climaxes i've ever seen br br good things about thing um well some of the closeup shots of the head silently mouthing its directives were pretty effective the miserly and shrewish widow rang true to life even if i wanted to stuff a sock in her mouth the first scene where the big simple ranch hand silently turns on the oily cowboy and kills him had a bit of shock value because the plot had taken the trouble to establish the big guy as a fairly sympathetic character and like i said earlier the idea of an insidious force from the past turning the members of an isolated community against each other is a good one and can sustain interest far above the actual merit of a bad performance br br which this definitely is br br but as i said i'm inclined to be charitable because the director was probably working under a budget breakneck time constraints and the best actors he could find for the money heaven knows how future generations will judge facile crap like the cave wrong turn or the remake of house of wax 40 years from now i hope they are charitable towards our own tastes in supporting our generations wastes of film stock
<START> having just watched i find that i have to agree with the negative reviews here i like asian and korean horror and i had great expectations for this film man was i disappointed watching this i kept thinking surely they just do this to catch me off guard later on and for a while i expected something ingenious to happen however i slowly realised that the film really is that bad it is the cheapest cash in into the asian horror market i have seen so far br br the basic story is perhaps not even that bad but the way it is filmed it seems like the most laughable plot ever the tree as a 'scary' device might be okay if used cleverly but all the filmmaker does is giving us different shots of yes a tree over and over again he seems to hope that the tree will do all the work for him in terms of tension and build up but it just feels like what it is shots of a tree for goodness' sake br br slow build ups can be very effective and a film that presents the viewer with only few glimpses of what is wrong might deliver good scares but not sure we get a glimpse of a child on a disappearing around a corner and yet again meaningful shots of the tree from above or underneath or the side but these scenes are just not scary they feel silly especially because you realise that the director means them to be scary they simply aren't br br apart from that i agree with some of the other reviewers that the characters are ridiculous in particular the one character's into madness' is laughable however what really breaks is the terrible editing its hard to see why scenes were cut together the way they are but it's bad and it kills any spark of it might have had it also makes me feel patronised because i can see what they are trying to achieve with it but i cannot believe that they think i would fall for such cheap ploys br br there are lots of great asian ghost films and lots of bad ones but this is by far the worst i have seen they must have been going through the list of 'what to put into ghost movies' and ticked them all off but in the end they forgot to add the actual movie
<START> the problem with so many people watching this movie is the mindset they watch it in people come looking for a b grade horror film or a so bad it's good movie jack frost 2 is neither of these br br it is to put it simply a very good movie cleverly hidden inside a very bad one to view it as anything other than a screwball comedy easily funnier than all three absolutely scary movies combined is to the movie on a basic level it would be like watching shawshank redemption and then complaining that there were no explosions br br the premise is simple the characters from the first movie haunted by memories of jack frost take a vacation to a tropical island a new improved jack comes after them now with essentially the powers of hydro man from spider man essentially he can turn from water to snow easily and quickly divide himself multiply himself and worst of all he's managed to grow an immunity to his only former weakness antifreeze br br what's sad about this movie is that the brain dead fans of the first jack frost a simply horrible movie can't appreciate the change of tone for the sequel just as alien was a horror film and aliens was all about action jack frost was a weak attempt at gimmick horror and jack frost 2 is a cleverly written parody of the gimmick horror genre br br most of the entertainment comes the live action actors who serve admirably particularly funny among them are ray playing a caricature of a retired british colonel from the early 1900s christopher allport offering an insane hilarious spin on his wooden performance from the first film and david allen brooks taking the once serious role of manners to new totally bizarre heights br br the lack of memorable quotes disturbs me br br as a horror movie jack frost 2 revenge of the mutant killer snowman rates a zero but you have to understand it's not a horror movie
<START> this film was so unfocused rambling and uneven that it was an effort to watch the whole thing i actually thought some interesting plot elements might develop this was nothing more than a coming of age film for the thirty something generation total crap and i have no idea what julianne moore was doing in this since it was the only reason i picked it off the shelf at the rental store
<START> this is one of the classic twilight zone episodes where with the simplest of situations the viewer was drawn into a seemingly symbolic conflict only to find the solution surprising and strangely acceptable five figures are inside a container prison a major a ballerina a a clown and a tramp they are certainly an odd choice of types to be in this isolation chamber but they are all in it nevertheless and they are trying to figure out why they are there what have they in common none can figure it out but gradually the major organizes them into working to bet out by standing on each other's shoulders and the major going to the top of the line of figures does reach the entrance and i'll leave it like that although one of the other critiques on this thread actually gives the story away br br the title seems to be suggested by six characters in search of an author famous play whether the actual purpose to the show was to spoof that play is questionable characters analyze their roles and relations with each other but the five characters here while they try to understand their situation are totally in the dark they are not in the situation of the six characters in who know their current situations this uncertainty of what is going on allows the viewers to think it is an abstract drama br br the actors william as the major and murray as the clown in particular give good accounts of themselves and the conclusion whether planned as a spoof or not is quite effective
<START> once the slow beginning gets underway the film kicks off and really becomes quite a lot of fun in many unexpected ways the ensemble cast is really good with heather graham perhaps being the weakest of them casey affleck as her brother is really good and extremely likeable if you catch my drift br br i highly recommend the film if you just want to have to good hours teenagers should really enjoy this film it says a lot about relationships
<START> of all of the post 1985 perry mason movies i have seen this one is my least favorite br br i confess i have never liked diana muldaur as an actress she only seems to know how to play one type of character a hard bitten career woman with some undefined chip on her shoulder who for that reason is extremely difficult to in any way sympathize with this one is no exception it runs true to form br br the only thing that saves this movie in my opinion is an earnest performance by scott baio as the prosecutor i actually found myself rooting for him to win and the movie is worth seeing for him alone
<START> in following the lines of the classic formula to a point of taking another leap off from the material the thing remake becomes one of the coolest remakes of its time john carpenter fashions out of what must've been a fairly vague screenplay about certain things or maybe very descriptive who knows bringing forth incredibly wretched brilliant puppetry and animatronics by rob with stan winston also on the team these effects help set the tone against the harsh detached environment carpenter sets up with his characters the film takes the story of a group stationed in a research bunker in the middle of an arctic climate pitted against a malevolent force that takes the shapes of others it's given a full life by carpenter's choice of tones and surprises for someone following in the footsteps of howard hawks the filmmaker here has a lot more trust and talent in executing the material than most given the chance to have another go with an old film br br with the effects people working to full force amid what would likely follow as containing the most fire per scene it could become overkill but it all fits into the suspense after a while the actors pull along as a fine ensemble unlike the squad in predator these are mostly just regular working guys with the leader coming in the from of kurt russell's very good role for his style excellent in fact juicy supporting roles are out for grabs for the likes of wilford brimley and keith david and it is refreshing to see how the sort of absurdity of what's going on in the film an alien that starts off with dogs and then moves onto the others in gory demented transforming form is pit against such a tone of timing with everyone i loved the long silences at times with ennio morricone's spooky curious music in the background and that bass line is of merit in itself br br it ranks up with being if nothing else delivering what it strives for for its genre cult audience it remains one of carpenter's best a rare breed of horror film where the story is told clear and precisely by way of the position of the camera dialog and timing with the scenes that's not to say the film isn't chock full of violence it is and in fact a couple of times it's almost funny but given that it goes back to what is ridiculously seeming like a by gone era the creatures make up alongside the steady well calculated script was done completely without cgi it's disgusting but it's real and atmospheric to a t
<START> okay so this series kind of takes the route of 'here we go again ' week in week out david character helps out his ride who is in a bit of a pickle but what's wrong with that david morse is one of the greatest character actors out there and certainly the coolest and to have him in a series created by david a great writer is heaven br br due to the lack of love for this show by many i can't see it going to a season series but you never know the amount of rubbish that has made it beyond that baffles me let's hope something good can make it past a first series
<START> in a style reminiscent of the best of david lean this romantic love story sweeps across the screen with epic proportions equal to the vast desert regions against which it is set it's a film which purports that one does not choose love but rather that it's love that does the choosing regardless of who where or when and furthermore that it's a matter of the heart often contingent upon prevailing conditions and circumstances and thus is the situation in the english patient ' directed by anthony the story of two people who discover passion and true love in the most inopportune of places and times proving that when it is predestined love will find a way br br it's wwii flying above the african desert hungarian count de ralph fiennes is shot down his biplane mistaken for an enemy aircraft and though he survives the crash he is severely burned to his great good fortune however he is rescued by a tribe of nomads and winds up in a hospital but existing conditions are governed by circumstances of war and soon becomes one of many patients being transported via convoy to a different facility upon reaching italy he is too weak and ill to continue on and a canadian nurse hana juliette binoche volunteers to stay behind with him at an abandoned monastery br br hana soon discovers that her charge is something of a man of mystery as remembers nothing of his past and not even his own name thought to be english the only clues pointing to who he is are contained in a book found in his possession after the crash but even they are as cryptic as patient slowly however under prompting from hana begins to remember bits and pieces of his life and his story begins to unfold and his memory is helped along even more by the appearance of a mysterious stranger named caravaggio willem dafoe who suspects that is the man he's been looking for a man with whom he wants to settle a score but burned beyond recognition may or may not be that man meanwhile memories continue to surface memories of a woman he loved katherine clifton kristin scott thomas as well as memories of husband geoffrey colin firth and crippled in mind and body as he is those memories become the only thing left to which he can cling with any hope at all even as his life seems to be slipping farther away with each passing moment br br in addition to directing anthony also wrote the screenplay for this film which he adapted from the novel by michael the result is an epic saga presented in the tradition of lean's doctor zhivago' and lawrence of arabia' a magnificent film that fills the screen and the senses with unprecedented grandeur and beauty simply put film is genius realized crafted and delivered with a poetic perfection watching it is like watching a monet come to life from the opening frames casts a hypnotic spell over his audience that is binding and transporting with a story that has an emotional beauty that equals the engagingly stunning and vibrant images brought to life by john remarkable cinematography images that virtually fill the screen as well as the soul of the viewer in every sense this is a film of rare eloquence with a striking emotional capacity that facilitates an experience that is truly transcendental nominated in twelve categories it deservedly received a total of nine oscars including best picture director supporting actress binoche and cinematography br br if one had to choose a single word to describe the of this film it would be excellence ' even an extraordinary film however does not receive nine oscars without performances that are extraordinary in kind and the performances given by ralph fiennes and kristin scott thomas here transcend the term oscar worthy ' nominated for best actor for his portrayal of geoffrey rush was awarded the gold for fiennes has never been better achieving an emotional depth with his character that is nearly palpable private and introspective is not by his very nature an individual to whom the audience will be able to form an intimate connection fiennes however finds a way to open that emotional door just enough to let you in enough so that you taste the honest passion welling up within him and it works does not seek your friendship he will however gain your compassion br br kristen scott thomas too received an oscar nomination for best actress frances received the award for for her portrayal of katherine a woman whose stoic countenance masks the emotional conflict raging within her born of the forbidden passion that enslaves her and yet to which she gives herself willingly casting off her shackles of repression to embrace a love so strong it threatens to consume her the reserve katherine must maintain evokes the empathy of the audience as scott thomas successfully mines the emotional depths of her character to the greatest possible effect it's the kind of performance that draws you in and holds you fast taking you as it does beyond that curtain of hypocrisy that dictates what must be if only for the sake of appearances and allows you to experience a true sense of unbridled passion understated and shaded with subtlety it's terrific work by kristin scott thomas br br binoche gives a stunning affecting performance as well as the kindhearted nurse hana it is her humanity in fact which defines love in it's purest sense and offers a balanced perspective of it within the context of the film her relationship with kip andrews affords us a glimpse of passion of another kind which contrasts effectively with the intensity of that between and katherine the english patient' is a film that will move you and fill you emotionally one you will not want to see end 10 10 br br br br br br
