<START> although this film never attained commercial notoriety my experience has led me to conclude that many well done pieces of artistic expression often do not gain mass appeal the story line depicts a young boy stealing a car and embarking on a surreal dream like adventure with very little basis in our of time and space therefore anyone who attempts to view this film from the perspective of its conformity to reality will likely be disappointed it is not intended to be realistic it is however intended to be metaphoric with extensive symbolism apparent to those with superb attention to detail in addition the symbolic representations are left open for interpretation which can be said of much great artwork don't be fooled by the cover if you happen to rent or buy this film the movie is not what it might seem to be on the surface
<START> regardless of what anyone says its a b movie and the effects are poorly done if you're a vampire fanatic i suppose it would be ok not 10 out of 10 you others here cant sincerely mean that we are to view this as a movie not read it as a book so the effects and characters are important as well as the story the story are good but it doesn't carry the film no wonder it has a low rating over all i write this because i chose to see this movie when i saw some good reviews here on imdb but got severely disappointed don't get me wrong i thought the blade movies was awesome and loved the underworld movies but this characters aren't close the make up on the vampires is poorly done and the effects are worse this sucks i might not have gotten so disappointed if i had not read reviews here that told me how great it was the reviewers must have had something to do with the production company or something seriously if you think this is awesome you don't care about acting or make up this is better as a book 3 out of 10 for an ok story
<START> although this movie and i use the term loosely was made in 1997 we just watched it tonight for the first time my husband commented that a tommy lee jones movie that we'd never heard of made him a little apprehensive i blithely watched anyway certain that if jones was in the movie it must at least be worth two hours of my time after all he has been one of our go to actors for years although heche isn't one of my favorite actresses i was additionally reassured by seeing another well known face the list of accomplished actors actresses continued to grow so i endured more and more of this film certain that if i pushed through enough clichÃ©s and trite social statements i would arrive victorious on the other side of the plot alas there was no plot it appeared to be burned by the ever oozing lava of doom br br the characters were paper thin the plot was so chock full of holes that it literally distracted me from most of the special effects and acting in the movie was the fee for a brief consultation with an elementary science teacher too much for this film's budget no acid rain no toxic gasses like sulfur or no deadly ash no skin searing heat just a few feet from the lava wow it's the world's friendliest lava ever br br the events were no better than the characters each incident was so contrived and far fetched it's like the writers said okay we need to get rid of the little girl now and poof she's splashed by a lava bomb which burns her enough that she has to be carried to safety not from the lava but from her own helpless stupor but just moments later in the car she is in no apparent pain and soon after is running effortlessly through the groan building that oh no is about to be blown up after enduring all of this your reward is the line from the little boy at the end about all the people looking the same which has got to be one of the worst movie lines i have ever heard even if it wasn't so painfully scripted it was ridiculous timing for all the characters involved kid and cop aside as if the mother would still be in the area and just needs to be pointed out because she just isn't speaking up what she's hoping to slink off into the shadows and get away from the little brat once and for all i don't think so obviously the child's mother would be missing or dead or yelling her head off to find her toddler br br the token black gangsta tough hoodlum with a secret soft spot versus the chip on his shoulder narrow minded cracker cop with a secret soft spot scene made my eyes bleed even if such pat characters existed they wouldn't behave as the movie portrays them given the circumstances something about imminent fiery death and massive destruction tends to catch people off guard ya know br br there are too many canned movie moments like these to mention really it's just an embarrassing movie to watch those poor writers where are they now
<START> we all know that special effects cost money but it seems as if they could have used the money they saved writing the script to get some better shots the train is obviously a model in most moving shots the helicopter is obviously computer generated the alien looks like the one from the end of spaceballs except it's a decade later and spaceballs had an excuse br br the only smart thing they did was blur all of the special effects to make them harder to see br br not even the actors could compensate for such a poorly written script and it's pretty obvious they didn't really try either br br please don't waste your time please
<START> this brief review contains no spoilers since the movie spoils itself it is wooden and pedantic it has no saving grace whatsoever if someone invites you to his house to watch mr don't go even the title of the movie is dreadful and portends what garbage lies within the whole plot is so bad that it could drive mother theresa to despair it wasn't a stroke that led to the early demise of poor it was having to act in this clunker that did him in it must have haunted him the rest of his days perhaps he was an enemy alien and wanted revenge upon the americans for his confinement he found a perfect vehicle for his wrath in this travesty
<START> here's another of the 1940's westerns that i watch whenever it comes on tcm or fmc because although it may be flawed historically it is extremely entertaining and well acted plus it's got randolph scott my favorite actor second only to gary cooper well ok fourth behind coop charlton heston and gregory peck but the film itself to me anyway is reasonably historically accurate and as i said before well acted and flows very well i bet i've seen it 50 or 60 times and enjoy each viewing more than the one before i have it on tape from tcm but would buy it in a minute if it ever came out on dvd see it if you haven't i guarantee you'll like it
<START> i liked this movie i saw it to a packed house at the toronto international film festival the day after the gala opener which must have gone over well the director gavin hood was supposed to be present for today's screening but alas his twins were born just hours before so he had to jet on a flight back in 24 was how he joked about it br br rendition refers to a term whereby suspected terrorists in the us can be sent without the legal consent of their parents nations to prisons abroad to be questioned and detained br br it's fairly predictable innocent egyptian american man wrongly accused of being a terrorist while en route from south africa to dc he is sent abroad while wife at home reese witherspoon fights to find him and free him but what makes this movie special are some nice choices in story telling 1 a human touch story of what is going on in the locale where a suicide bomb detonated 2 the humanity of a cia agent trying to understand and be honest with what is really going on and 3 the chronology of story telling which makes it a tight taut tale that moves and jerks at the right moments ah relief and a mix of emotions that swirl around as the story fights for an ending br br all around strong acting with meryl streep as a standout vixen
<START> this movie was so incredibly boring michael j fox could've done so much better sorry but it's true for all you people who liked the movie
<START> yes 1939 robert greer garson version was the best perfection won the oscar in a very tough year gable in gwtw james stewart as mr smith were 2 of his competitors wow was that a rough year most critics in ny hated this version so didnt see in theatre finally saw this a m on tcm enjoyed peter o'toole was excellent glad he was oscar nominated for this esp pleased oscar finally gave him a special award this past year clark was good as mrs chips but her character i feel was poorly written some good songs esp you i sung by ms clark later recorded by many others including t bennett s bassey carmen macrae the b w version was more authentic but this is a good film beautifully photographed in color panavision enjoyable worth seeing bravo again mr o'toole
<START> i only bought this dvd because it was dirt cheap and it seemed interesting in its own special way special meaning retarded the movie turned out to be quite uninteresting boring camera work nothing really driving the story and of course the acting is horrible it wasn't even bad in a campy way it was just plain bad there are actually a handful of great lines of dialogue but for the most part its awkward and weak all i could think about while watching this was that this could actually be a good movie if the script was given a major overhaul if it were written by someone who actually understood drug culture and if some decent actors were cast i wouldn't recommend weekend with the babysitter unless if you plan on a career in film and want to learn what not to do in a movie
<START> this movie had a very unique effect on me it stalled my realization that this movie really sucks it is disguised as a film in the likes of memento and other jewels like that but at the end and even after a few minutes you come to realize that this is nothing but utter pretentious cr4p probably written by some collage student with friends to compassionate to tell him that his writing sucks the whole idea is Â i don't even know if it tried to scratch on the supernatural or they want us to believe that because someone fills your mind a very weak one btw with stupid riddles the kind you learn on elementary school recess you suddenly come to the one truth about everything then you have to kill someone and what how what why why is just like saying that to make a cake just throw a bunch of ingredients and add forgot about cooking it i guess these guys forgot to not explain but present the mechanism of why was this happening you have to do that when you present a story which normal everyday acts lie solving riddle rhymes start to have an abnormal effect on people acting was horrible with that girl always trying to look cute at the camera and the guy from highlanders the series acting up like the though heavy metal record store yeah they're all real though s o b's the menacing atmosphere with the oh so clever riddles enter the 60's series of batman and robin with guest appearance of the riddle and the crazies who claim to have the knowledge behind that smirk on their just horrible horrible br br i'm usually very partial about low budget movies and tend to root for the underdog by giving them more praise than they may deserve in lieu of their constrictions you know but this is just an ugly excuse for a movie that will keep you wanting to be good for an hour and a half and at the end you will just lament that you fell for it
<START> this movie was filmed in my hometown and i was acquainted with many of the actors in minor rolls most of them were students at the local karate school and even at the time it was filmed we all knew what a stinker it was it was interesting however to see it being made most of the places it was filmed at no longer exist such as the nightclub the pizza shop etc the world premiere was held at the civic theatre and we all laughed hysterically at how inane it was i personally believe it's the worst movie ever made but it brings back many fond memories for me watch this movie with a word of advice enjoy it for what it is a very low budget poorly made karate flick
<START> this movie is absurd absolutely terrible michael keaton and andy garcia must really have needed the work to do this movie the plot is totally not believable michael keaton agrees to donate bone marrow to the dying son of a detective but then escapes he manages to elude the police throughout the hospital not believable that he would have so much knowledge of the hospital he takes an extremely convoluted route to get out of the hospital blowing up the power generators and a bridge why and to top that andy garcia father of the dying boy and a doctor help the criminal so as to get the bone marrow the plot is such baloney maybe the worse movie i have ever see
<START> i saw the messiah the first killings and i thought it was absolutely one of the best programmes i have seen ever it was one of those programmes that you think that oh no i cannot watch the rest of this but you feel compelled to watch it just to see who done it jamie was an absolutely amazing actor in it to be able to switch between two totally totally different characters one of which is the evil nasty person that did it and the other person who is jez clifton the cop to be able to do that well i certainly wouldn't be able to do it well not without cracking anyway i really do love and care for jamie with all of my heart and i always will until the end of time i think that jamie is the sweetest cutest sexiest guy in the world i absolutely love jamie in ultimate force also because he looks god damn sexy in the blacks that he wore i love jamie love paula br br x
<START> and she really was beautiful laraine day that is herself her part and her performance an engaging story of selfish vs selfless love for the same man wealthy heartthrob and robert cummings one of his bouts of inebriation leads to an incident that enrages the local community and tests the mettle of the two sisters jean muir and laraine day that are close to him and to each other their comfortable and somewhat superficial milieu is up ended as the two girls confront the ensuing crisis and respond to its conflicting demands of prudence integrity loyalty and love with consequences that are profoundly different for each of them with the old vanities and abandoned their real characters are revealed in enthralling contrast br br a wonderful find on tcm
