<START> this film ain't half bad it may be a little long at times but carried along by beautiful scenery an immensely beautiful love letter and great actors you forget time and enjoy the grand prize however goes to blythe danner and geraldine mcewan as well that would be telling but they are just great
<START> for people like me who were born long after the '60s ended we can only learn about the era through cultural artifacts of which hair is one this is certainly a well done tour de force one can get a sense of how things were for the hippie culture probably the most impressive scene for me at least is when the group crashes the rich people's party as for the movie's final scene one might interpret it as the symbolic end of everything that the '60s represented br br but no matter how one interprets this movie it's important to understand that even though the '60s themselves may have ended the movements that typified them still exist in small it's a time that people won't soon forget br br anyway this movie is one that i definitely recommend milos forman scored another great one here right between his two masterpieces one flew over the cuckoo's nest and ragtime so why did he later make a piece of crap like man on the moon starring john savage treat williams and beverly d'angelo
<START> i saw this fine flick shortly leaving college as i sat there happily watching alice go from repressed virgin to sexual adventurer i got to wondering why her sexual encounters seemed familiar then i remembered intro psych 101 lecture one of the lectures dealt with the psycho sexual stages of basically the shift over time on what part of the body and its attendant stimulations gets our main attention as well as the changing emphasis on what gives us pleasure alice's first encounter is being bathed with emphasis on the genitals and bottom her next encounter is an oral one with the mad hatter's dingaling i forget the rest of the lecture and the order of alice's encounters but i do remember how well they matched it's interesting to see a skin flick with some brains behind it rather than the cliche i'm here to deliver your pizza let's screw br br i don't see how kristin career could be wrecked by this film as it was her first film and reagan's tiresome hypocrisies had yet to mar this land when it was released but in a way he and his stooge did affect ms debell when was staging his anti pornography commission to distract people from his own criminal activities hired the services of an anti porn activist named judith reisner reisner was obsessed with images she perceived as child pornography she saw the alice cover ms debell did for playboy and promptly announced she had scientifically proven that ms debell was in fact a photo collage of parts from several grown women and the face of a ten year old yeah right
<START> yes bad acting isn't only one thing to mention bad script not so bad music unfortunately br br nice girl and nice boy with perfect bodies and super teeth just isn't enough for me and for you too br br first thing in the morning after crash they go to swim to the sea to have some fun smiling br br they find everything in the sea i mean things like fishing net knife scuba dive things ropes bottles husband br br stuff are you kidding stupid they are so happy on the island they are going to die and they are happy love peace love just stupid br br terrible skip this one please
<START> i've tried to reconcile why so many bad reviews of this film while the vast majority of reviews are given a rating of between 7 and 10 the reason may be this film is kind of hard to describe in a positive review although a few have done that quite nicely already this film is confusing depressing and doesn't have a happy ending i still gave x a rating of 10 because it is basically for me literature and art combined on film that is really my favorite kind of filmmaking i've only seen two of carax's films this one and sang as with this film i'm being somewhat pretentious when i call this one of carax's best films but i am carax has a minimalist style if that type of film does not appeal to you and is boring then it would be best not to watch this but x was less minimalist than sang so it had quite a lot of intensity for a thriller at least for my taste i found it quite interesting and absorbing the two lead roles did an excellent job acting i mean the lead and the young woman he thought was his half sister catherine d is always great but her role was not very large or significant in the story but everyone did a fine job i thought the cult stuff was great it may have not been very believable but that is due to its being rather abstract there is a lot going on between the lines in this film this is a very freudian psycho thriller
<START> nominated for best documentary feature at 2004's academy awards my architect follows filmmaker nathaniel kahn in his quest to find out about his father the legendary architect louis i kahn lou kahn died in 1974 when nate was 11 years old leaving behind an incredible but limited body of work unpaid debts and three separate families all living within a few of each other br br my architect follows kahn's life through chronologically examining his buildings and interspersing their beauty with the story of a charismatic but selfish and emotionally immature genius as the son which lou never publicly acknowledged during his lifetime nate has delicately placed himself in the story without overpowering the main focus br br when examining the magnificent salk institute in california nate evokes his father's mythic use of space and light in his buildings making it a peaceful and fascinating experience for viewers the shot of nate in smoky white central meeting place emphasises the building's harmony with nature it's breathtaking my architect also covers the difficulty louis kahn had with getting his designs accepted several fantastical buildings exist only on paper dismissed by more practical architects and property developers it wasn't until louis kahn went to the east that his visions were enthusiastically embraced in india where he built the indian br br institute of management a former co worker describes him as a guru in where he built the magnificent national assembly building citizens consider him a father of democracy br br watching my architect is a wonderful way to begin or continue learning about architecture and the importance of space but it's the irony of lou kahn's egotism combined with the transcendence of his work that will inspire you 4 stars
<START> lotsa action cheesy love story unexpected actors and overall great fun the special effect are acceptable decent some of the fighting is kinda neat with some interesting acrobatic moves the overall story moves along and is cheesy enough to keep you wondering when the inevitable is going to happen although there is a bit of a twist just a small one the overall naivety of the movie make it quite whimsical at times cute enough chicks too what more could you want ps if you're gonna review a movie like this try to review it in terms of the category the movie would fall not necessarily where it was intended to fall ie don't bomb out good cheesy movies
<START> the twins effect chinese action comedy charlene choi gillian chung br br this vampire action comedy is one of my favorites for the very fact that i was thoroughly entertained throughout the entire movie first of all the characters are memorable contributing a myriad of classic scenes charlene and gillian are naturally cute charismatic and humorous this movie was my first exposure to them and all i wanted to do was reach through my television screen and give them a really big hug the remaining cast did well in their supporting roles including jackie chan karen mok the duke josie ho edison chen anthony wong and the vampire bad guys one of which looks eerily familiar to will ferrell even the abominably horrible ekin cheng was good in this one good characters are important of course because they avoid the feeling of boredom by keeping things interesting between action sequences br br and speaking of action this film has plenty of it more importantly there is an emphasis of quality in the fight choreography one aspect that helped in this regard is the featured weapon of the protagonists Â a sword with a retractable spear ended rope this weapon in and of itself opened up a variety of moves that would have been otherwise impossible josie ho and gillian chung in particular perform some wicked aerial maneuvers using these devices br br in addition the swordplay is superb and is highlighted by two great sword fights Â one taking place during the opening train station sequence and the other occurring in the church finale in fact the blade wielding maneuvers showcased in this film put some other highly overrated fan favorites to great shame and i truly feel sorry for those who would cite the horribly choreographed garbage seen in ashes of time storm riders or a man called hero with the well planned precisely executed sequences seen in the twins effect it's not even close br br i can't understand why this film gets so much criticism i'm sure die hard apologists for the hong kong golden age will hate this because it doesn't fit into their narrow minded view of what hong kong action should be we should learn from the downfall of john woo a one trick pony who never learned how to re invent himself we don't need another clone we need something different the twins effect is one good example br br this film was so good that it actually set me up for being disappointed at other chinese movies with the same actors and actresses this especially applies to ekin cheng whose other films almost always suck Â and yes this includes the obscenely overrated and exploitative wuxia crap mentioned in the previous paragraph even the twins have never been able to match the value of this movie when both were lead actresses in a film although they have managed to hit some good films when either one or the other takes the leading role e g beyond our ken good times bed times house of fury or when one or both are in supporting roles e g colour of the truth new police story just one look the twins effect 2 should have been a direct sequel instead of a family fantasy i am still yearning to see charlene and gillian team up and kick some butt in another movie but the fact remains that the twins effect hits on all cylinders their charisma while avoiding a descent into annoyance as in protÃ©gÃ© de la rose noire br br all in all this film has everything one needs to be entertained and may i remind the reader that it is precisely this Â entertainment Â that judges the greatness of a movie more so than artsy dramatic elements or meaningless awards from established academies of critics who usually have no idea what they are talking about br br in the end the twins effect is a classic not to be missed br br rating 5 5 stars br br p s Â the hollywood execs decided to slaughter this film when it was released in the u s by renaming it the vampire effect and cutting out 20 minutes of footage which includes parts of the action scenes however the final fight of the u s version does have a better soundtrack than the original version therefore i purchased both versions which allows me to first watch the original until about the 1 20 mark and then swap discs to watch the final fight on the u s version
<START> like the previous poster i am from northern vermont and i was inclined to like this film however not since red zone cuba have i seen such a confusing plot the things the people to bootleg make no sense two of the gang paddle across the border send a second party across in a car uhm why then they meet two others and drive up at night in to the bad guy's hideout in a luxury packard wouldn't just two people in a truck make more sense then parked outside the garage that holds the targeted hooch the four fall asleep when they in the morning and and start hauling the whiskey out of course they're spotted and shot at losing some of their precious cargo in the process then two of the smugglers put the whiskey in a boat and float it over the border again why i am told by someone whose great uncle really did smuggle in the area all one needed was to drive a vehicle that could outrun than the u s canada border patrol which back then had a fraction of the resources it has now br br and don't get me started on the last half hour which made no sense whatsoever br br the only good thing i can say about the film is that kris kristopherson has actually grown some charisma with the years
<START> from what i understand fox was embarrassed they released a pg 13 alien predator movie not so long ago it was not well received by any means br br not exactly sure where to go next seeing as they thought anderson was the best director for the franchise and they had produced a true sci fi gem fox turned to it's small but knowledgeable group of monkeys for answers br br these monkeys were by no means veterans of writing sci fi flicks but had seen burton's planet of the apes remake and house of the dead br br their first task hire actors fox gave them a reasonable budget but the monkeys wanted to save the money they hired fifteen tv actors shortly after br br now the script the monkeys wanted to save more of the budget so they wrote the movie themselves leaving out important aspects of the two franchises was the easy part thinking of great new lines for the general audience to remember years down the line that was more difficult they butted heads awhile and came up with a truly award winning screenplay equipped with clichÃ© characters idiotic decisions an gaping plot holes br br fox was pleased thus far with the results but wanted to see what was to become of the to the film the aliens and predators the monkeys again wanted to save money in the budget so they decided to trash the great robotics used in the otherwise terrible original and go with the man in the suit alien seen in the old films the actors playing the aliens had trouble fitting into the suits as they weren't properly sized by the monkeys so they their plastic heads throughout the film with honor as for the predators the monkeys decided one predator was enough this time around again saving budget to fight the hordes of aliens that seemingly come out of nowhere br br but what about the effects you ask come on now people they may be monkeys but they clearly knew cgi would play a key role in the film without diving into the budget the monkeys used a standard final cut program and cut and pasted some very nice fire and spark effects throughout putting red and green filters over the camera lens provided some excellent predator visions br br the setting was something the monkeys thought long and hard about if this was to be on earth in colorado of all places they needed to make it realistic this was where they admitted they might have made a mistake see the monkeys didn't have proper training in this department so they thought turning the lights off in the city and having the movie play out in the dead of night and in the rain was the right thing to do they simply forgot people like to see the creatures instead of looking at shadows and rain the whole film to add insult to injury the monkeys accidentally filmed all the fight scenes incredibly close so no one could see what was fighting or who it was but again rookie mistake br br the rating fox told the monkeys to make the movie r rated that was easy without showing how many of the injuries or deaths actually happened the monkeys made a habit of showing the carnage after the fact it was simple the viewers got the gore they desired and the monkeys didn't have to film the majority of action shots involving that violence br br some of the actors originally had questions concerning the screenplay why does a blue liquid the predator has endless amounts of magically disintegrate whatever he wants it to and nothing more than that why is an ex convict driving around in a police car the entire movie why did the monkeys forget to show a full body shot of the aliens why does a clock play a more memorable role than any of the main characters the list of questions just kept growing but the monkeys ignored them and finished their masterpiece br br fox was thrilled with their work so thrilled that they opened the movie nationwide on christmas day and even spent a few bucks advertising it the week before it came out the monkeys had successfully made another installment in these cherished franchises br br but some ask what ever happened to the budget the monkeys forgot to use they put it towards their next film aliens vs predator vs hulk hogan they knew the general public would be upset with the title but they have since released this statement br br to the people do not worry about our upcoming film it will be rated r and will have violence br br and everyone lived happily ever after the end
<START> i saw this movie for the first time a little over a year ago i've seen it 4 more times since i had never heard of it before and i consider myself knowledgeable of classic cinema a true polished diamond in the rough br br this gem of a movie revolves around jon voight lead character as a young schoolteacher assigned to island to teach the children all in one school at first the students reveal they know very little of the world beyond their island home the heart of the movie is finding inspiration to awaken their young minds to the world around them the students quickly reward their teacher with an eagerness to learn and a remarkable ability to grasp concepts that only a short time before had been foreign to them uses unconventional and clever teaching techniques that happen to be oh a little fun god forbid learning and fun together can't be or so says the ones in charge to avoid a spoiler i shall just say that finds resistance with the boss man and the ending is truly bittersweet br br i am a 35 year old white male with some teaching experience so i should identify with the lead character pat conroy aka mr but i don't i identify with the black kids as a kid i was to the school on the other side of town from the 4th to the 6th grade circa 1979 these kids in the movie remind me of my classmates then luckily in 4th grade as a 8 or 9 year old one doesn't understand racism i just remember we were all being kids playing 4 square hide and seek and running relays br br this movie is very moving there are delightful and poignant moments from beginning to end non stop i found myself many times with tears in my eyes then suddenly laughing out loud it's a funny movie br br git away from that sir if you're prepared to accept crap i should tell you that rabbit just did it in your lap so you the white schoolteacher mr my love mr you a good looking teacher you a good looking white man wind 15 mph from the east small boat warning small boats beware big boats ok don't gotta worry 'bout nothing not a fry cook but eleanor roosevelt not a share cropper but something latin that's latin hey wait sing like a frog i sing good talkin' 'bout br br it still mystifies me that i still hear nothing about this movie or that it has very little reputation or following i intend to seek out more reviews comments background and making of tidbits if they are out there what amazes me is the acting given from the untrained kids one of the kids mary i understand was an actress and you can tell however the other kids have plenty of lines and genuine reactions i wonder how they did it i'm guessing that and mary had precise dialogue to work with while some of the scenes unfold naturally or ad libbed br br is a special movie in my opinion it is one of the very few movies that are so good and so unknown others in that category are king rat '65 dark passage '47 with bogie and bacall gods must be crazy '80 and bad day at black rock '55 i recommend them all but first take a seat in the class of mr
<START> story about three eclipse maybe even indigo ha children beginning their love for murder oh and the people who are hot on their trail br br bloody birthday a pretty mediocre title for the film was a nice lil surprise i was in no way expecting a film that dealt with blood thirsty psychopath kids and i may say it's also one of the best flicks i've seen with kids as the villains by the end of the movie i seriously wanted these kids to die in horrible fashion br br it's a really solid 80s horror flick but how these kids are getting away with all this mayhem and murder is just something that you can't not think about even the slightest bit of investigation would easily uncover these lil sh ts as the murderers but there seems to be only a couple police in town well by the end only one and he seemed like a dimwit so i suppose they could have gotten away with it haha yeah and i'm a chinese jet pilot br br nevertheless this movie delivered some kids who were more than entertaining a lot of premarital sex and a decent amount of boobage no if you're put off by the less than stellar title dash it from your mind and give this flick a shot it's a very recommendable and underrated 80s horror flick
<START> if you've never experienced the thing that is zasu pitts here is a zasu zinger in 1933 mae caricatured pitt's voice for the character olive oyl for the fleischer studios animated cartoon version of the comic strip popeye zasu pronounced zay sue does her best olive oyl impersonation walking around whining and ringing her hands or attaching herself to the policeman's i kept waiting for her to say ohhh but instead it's something always happens to somebody the first time i saw this film i loved zasu and found her character really funny i've since seen her in other films where she does this same whining uptight fragile flower routine so upon watching this film again i started getting a little annoyed with the constant whining and near hysteria over a piece of dust but there are some funny comedy bits here and it's also a mystery movie as well it's an interesting mix of mystery and comedy that actually works the mystery plot holds together well through the camp of zasu pitts and james gleason who plays arthur the policeman the haunted house is fun with many a secret passage and even a skeleton in the attic well worth the watch read more public domain movie reviews at http blogspot com
<START> most movies from hollywood seem to follow one of a few pre formulated and very predictable plots this film does not and is a perfect example of what i watch ifc for br br there's a guy michael and his girlfriend left him with out a word he wants to know what happened is she ok can he say goodbye perhaps get some closure he hasn't been able to contact grace and in an effort to find her he has made a film asking for your help br br michael figures we might need a reason to help him so he tells us his story by reliving his relationship with the help of a friend nadia to play the role of grace the girlfriend who left br br hind sight is 20 20 and it is no different for michael by telling his story and getting feedback from his friends he realizes his mistakes and just how much he values what he has lost this is unfortunately a lesson we all have had to learn or need to learn and is easy to identify with that is what makes you want to hear more of michael's story and wanting to know if he finds grace
<START> i have noticed that a lot of films that have been featured on mystery science theater have received a tons of low ratings on imdb however a few of the films featured on the films weren't that bad and it's not fair to rate a film that's been given the mst treatment with the hosts making funny comments during the film now i am not saying that the girl in lover's lane is a great film but it's not nearly bad enough to merit its current imdb score of 2 1 br br the film begins with and danny meeting is a veteran drifter and danny a younger guy who seems to have no particular reason to be wandering about the country once they blow into a small town needs to rescue danny again and again because danny is quite naive a nice way of saying he has the intellect of a tomato br br along the way something happens to the self assured he finds a nice young lady and finds the lure of staying put pulling at him and in an odd subplot jack elam plays a super creepy sicko who wanders the town scaring the crap out of everyone yet oddly the police don't seem to take much notice nor does anyone on their own do anything about him ultimately however when elam puts the moves on a girl who is falling for things come to a full boil br br overall while not at all a great film there were many interesting plot elements in this film enough to merit a score higher than 2 1 the biggest negatives are a simplistic conclusion to the mystery that occurs near the end as well as the total stupidity of danny one time too often considering the minuscule budget however it's a watchable little film
