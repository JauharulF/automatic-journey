<START> anyone that is looking for an episode of law and order or csi would have to look elsewhere as the most basic elements of police or forensics work were totally ignored in this case br br a murder took place and all the police did was to grab a 15 year old boy off the street and take him to the only witness a 65 year old man and say is this the guy who did it sure the old man thought that the kid in the back of the police car had to be guilty never mind that he looked nothing like the real killer and was dressed completely differently he must have shrunk reversed his age by 5 10 years and changed clothes br br the police made absolutely no effort and they admitted it the did no forensics on any of the evidence they questioned no other witnesses and they beat a confession out of a 15 year old br br the saddest thing about this compelling look at the criminal justice system is that it occurred right down the road in florida let everyone now start talking about southern justice
<START> 15 park avenue is the address konkona is in search for from the movies beginning prof anu azmi is extremely caring and loving half sister from mom's earlier marriage the movie revolves around these characters and looks into the life of a schizophrenic patient the director tries to explain to the viewer the imaginary world of through her continuous blabbering to anu and others br br konkona deserves not one but thousands of awards which i am sure she will be getting for this rendition of in this movie you can see the look of a patient written on her face by the drooping lips and sleepy eyes from the first scene itself rahul has done a good job but has been reduced to one half of the movie in spite of his importance in their life br br watch out for the intense relationships shown between the characters of the movie anu anu mom and between anu singh azmi as usual has done a riveting performance to be remembered as the sister who sacrificed her life for br br the movie might not be your usual hindi potboiler but can certainly make people look at the schizophrenic patients in a different light altogether br br as usual sen brings the movie to a different ending rather than any clichÃ©d ones we might think off hats off to her for this great movie
<START> wow what can i say it was a good movie very different to all the boring remakes we see lately the only thing i would have liked to see a bit more of an ending like when jane left her husband im guessing she was going to serena cause she fell for her not just her but everything that she is i so wish producers would actually show that sort of ending instead of leaving to it your imagination sort of ending i really hate it when they do that the aerial acts looked like fun but i guess you'd have to be light and i would like to see more movies like this one maybe the could do a sort of sequel of jane and serena if i were in jane's shoes i would have went for the girl too she was attractive
<START> when melville's pierre or the ambiguities hit bookstores in 1852 his first publication since moby dick a year earlier the public response was similar to that found among the imdb reviews of x newspapers even published headlines like melville insane which of course he wasn't but when one compares the writing styles found in moby dick and pierre one finds in the latter a sharp departure from the simple and often declamatory style found in the former clearly he was mimicking the overly florid style of the now forgotten victorian romances that were easily his immortal moby dick he was not content however to turn out the sort of product that his publishers wanted and that surely would have sold his version of a victorian romance was a twisted cynical one perhaps but brilliant in its synthesis the alternate title the ambiguities is quite appropriate as pierre searches for and thinks he finds truth we become more and more uncertain what and whom to believe as he searches for happiness he becomes more and more miserable br br x is a fascinating adaptation of this novel set in modern or nearly modern france though in some ways it leaves little to the imagination and shows us graphically the incestuous relations that melville could only hint at the ambiguities which make the novel and its message so alluring are perfectly in tact the questions it raises are ones that few films have thought to ask yet the answers are left to the viewer br br i recommend a reading of the novel which is much shorter than moby dick before seeing this movie i hope more people discover this tantalizing film
<START> great documentary of how scientist's believed dinosaurs behaved captured with some of the most spectacular cgi since jurassic park done completely seriously like a prehistoric episode of nation geographic grabs your attention from the first frame and never lets go my favorite part was when the fights off the br br 10 stars this is what science is all about
<START> the limited scenery views were the only saving grace to an otherwise uneventful and boring movie the acting was borderline absurd which i blame on the script and screenplay nicole eggert didn't look the part didn't act the part and was totally unconvincing as a mountain guide after watching this i was left with the feeling that some friends had some free time and decided to make a movie it must have been produced on a budget of pocket change the plot was thin at best and with the low caliber of acting at times it begged the question to be asked why are we doing this i managed to sit through the entire movie but also asked myself why
<START> i have a little hobby of finding really cool pics out there that are pretty much unknown and then letting people know about them this one is on top of my list for getting the word out this summer this indie film and i really mean indie not miramax fox searchlight indie might be easy to overlook in the big maze of celluloid but if you want something completely different you have to check this one out br br basically i thought it was totally great i should have known from the dvd cover front and back that this was going to be something totally different but they all say that their stuff is different to hook you well this one really is totally different it's in your face beautiful and scary and unashamed to tell you to wake up war peace 9 11 poetry even a eerie sort of music video set to an old time patriotic song and a weird guy in an rv need i say more just see it
<START> i originally saw this film while i was working as a musician doing musical theatre in summer stock if you've ever done any work in theatre especially at a summer stock theatre you'll really enjoy this film br br yes there are some moments of really bad writing in the film but overall it's a lovely tribute to the theatre and why people love it
<START> this is speculation this movie could of inspired paramount pictures to film the movie the core both movies have something in common nature the only improvement for inferno is a better cast cast is still good though excellent movie 8 out of 10 this is worth watching this movie does have truth to it heat waves are real another piece of truth is heat related power outages where i live i have actually heard transformers blow unrest from heat is possible because people seeking to cool off may get rowdy there is a considerable amount of team work in this movie again this a movie worth watching the movie has a good cast the movie has no slow spots
<START> this film is a very beautiful and slow film there is nothing hollywood about it it is very danish and the characters are very real it is the first danish film to take up this transsexual theme it is really about love that has no gender i would not say it is about lesbian love even though the two main characters the transsexual veronika and charlotte are attracted to each other it is a story about love and life br br the story pretty much takes place in the two apartments there is almost no background music which makes it seem more real and intense the two actors playing the main characters are great they really make them seem real they are not archetypes but real people you could meet in the street i think it is the first time i have seen a transsexual portrayed this well very well done
<START> viva la bam this jackass spin off focuses on the obviously scripted adventures of bam and his pals johnny knoxville brandon etc this show while it has its fair share of gross out comedy and crazy stunts focuses mainly on torturing of his parents br br i'm sorry to say this bam but you're in no way as cool as you think you are this ego tripped show is not only painfully unfunny and yes i liked jackass but also narcissistic beyond belief the overly stylized intro ends with bam coolly explaining that he's going to do whatever the f he wants to how about you do something that is actually funny i liked jackass for what it was worth the camera work was horrible any idiot could have made a better show with a camcorder in their parents' garage but at least the show moved at a steady pace and never felt boring between the crazy dangerous or simply disgusting stunts the pals performed br br not so with viva la bam we follow our hero around as he plays pranks on his friends and tortures his relatives but never does it feel like anything else than really lame and scripted comedy the stunts and pranks are mildly entertaining but presented in such a tedious and dull fashion that they can barely make you smile br br viva la bam is a poor spin off of that does little good but feed already too big ego i don't recommend this lame and unimaginative show to anyone
<START> i enjoyed it there you go i said it again i even bought this movie on dvd and enjoyed it a couple of more times call me old fashioned but i prefer movies like this to garbage like die hard 4 which hold up the box office and get critical acclaim just because you have some old guy saving america van damme moves well for a guy of his age 47 i think delivering kicks that reminds one of kickboxer if you like old school action and and explosions this is the movie to watch this is one of van damme's best works br br van damme and steven seagal movies get released theatrically where i live so i never miss a chance to watch our old school action stars on the big screen
<START> this movie is one of the only historical documents displaying the talents of so many black singers actors actresses and dancers many who are no longer with us those which we are blessed to be able to enjoy today in 1999 through this film lets us recognize the talents that existed then this is why those individuals still living today as well those who are deceased are super star icons due to the educational history in music drama filming design singing etc this movie alone belongs to the people of this country br br i viewed this movie recently the sound was excellent the movie appeared to be complete color and clarity was fare but good considering how old this movie is without any repairs on frames i agree with all prior positive reviews i do not have any negative views br br i only would like to make one request please to whom it my concern please make this movie available so all can have this historical experience
<START> looking for proof that real life is more entertaining than fiction you just found it this superb documentary about an aspiring feature filmmaker mark who refuses to admit defeat is the funniest film i have ever seen probably because it's also one of the most tragic oddly enough the more i watch the film the more inspired i become
<START> about 12 minutes into the song in the scene where daryl hannah and jfk jr are first embracing there is a really pretty song playing what is that song and who is it sung by it's a song that sounds very romantic and it is a female singer piano playing etc i have tried everything in the world to look up the music on google and on itunes etc but it just doesn't come up not even on lyrics websites so if you hear it i would sure love to know enough about it so that i can try to either go get the cd with that song on it or find it in itunes i don't know if my email will i am new at this but i will be looking back here
