<START> i also joined imdb for the sole purpose of commenting on this film but so that i can sing its praises i had never heard of this movie it's packaged so horribly that it's easy to see why it may get passed over but a good friend suggested it to me and i'm so glad she did it's a gem of a film the actors are great kathy bates and meredith eaton in particular and look like they are truly having a fun time sure at times it was a bit over the top but i cannot remember the last time i laughed so hard or so many times over the course of two hours if you love to laugh then you owe it to yourself to see this film br br highly recommended
<START> it was a sweet intro for the most sailor soldier sailor mercury it consisted with a new in he at the wrote a love letter to ami which would be of course and now ami he is a einstien and he is attractive he ended up looking like melvin this was a it's no skin off my neck scene hot well i really like the senshi sailor moon series i personally think its the best anime ever but this movie was nice funny but not as as sailor moon r it was more like the s movie i saw this sailor moon with real player and it was pretty good over all
<START> what a terrible movie it represents perfectly the state of of french society where the most elementary respect for wholesome values and traditions has completely disappeared the plot is nonsensical the movie is not funny at all and the characters are completely shallow and uninteresting to say the least the direction and the cinematography are very poor and uninspired catherine deneuve is as bad an actress as she always was even when she was directed by bunuel in belle de jour the rest of the usually good cast vincent lindon line jean seem completely lost in an ocean of vulgarity platitudes and i cannot help to draw a parallel with the wonderful james le divorce with its thoughtful depiction of french and american mores its superlative cinematography and stellar cast put to good use having watched le divorce you can feel a kind of empathy with the french regardless of their foibles belle maman leaves you with only a nauseated contempt for its morally bankrupt and clueless protagonists
<START> mirrormask was a terribly disappointing film for me i had expected much from a jim henson production and had found favourable reviews comparing it to the labyrinth and alice in wonderland unfortunately the film ended up in one of those style over substance pile of movies br br whereas most kids dream about running away from home to join a circus helena is a kid who has grown up in a circus child labour anyone who wishes to run away to join real life helena wishes that her mother drop dead which is a bad move for a spoiled brat with a princess complex in a kid's fantasy movie next thing you know helena's mother flops over and for some reason she is suddenly transported to another world br br meanwhile i felt as if i was transported to the museum of contemporary art with a pair of foggy sepia tinted glasses br br the showcase of cgi generated creatures and backdrop was interesting at first and i liked the orbiting giants it got a little too tiresome after a few minutes though and i felt my mind wandering br br with no sense of narrative and mtv style clips and soundtrack the reminded me of basement where's your head at i did not feel involved in the plight of the protagonist and also frustrated as we waited for the film to lead us wherever it wanted hopefully towards the exit signs of the theatre
<START> just as in rififi the most compelling scene in the movie is the perfected silence of the jewel heist the scene is masterful in its execution each of the robbers having their own specialized job to perform each one successfully combining their own unique talent towards the objective and each one until a month before complete strangers br br many of the scenes play out very slowly in fact the opening scene is a long character introduction to both corey and vogel as we see corey getting released from prison and vogel escaping capture on his way to prison the two characters are then methodically brought together through fate at a roadside diner as vogel hides inside the trunk of corey's automobile from this improbable break in the two strangers agree to become partners to commit a perfected and precise jewel heist br br however to pull of this heist they must include the help of a third man named jansen jansen is hired as the sure shot gun man his inclusion into the mix was an interesting and desperate choice at the time of his hire jansen is in a full battle with dt's and spent most of his day on his cot hallucinating over lizards snakes and spiders his transition from the disheveled and hallucinatory world of a william s burroughs dream into the steady handed and sober sharp shooter is a very quick one and perhaps the only real false moment of the film but that's just me being extremely picky br br one other mildly false note was that of the police inspector mattei at times he appeared to be brilliant in the ways of strong arming the right people or gathering information and waiting out for his escaped prisoner to make his move other times he appeared to be 10 years past retirement especially at the beginning during escape through the woods br br i wonder if i got too much hidden meaning from the beginning of the movie at the start of the movie as the police car is speeding through the city the first image we see is that of a red stop light my first thought was that this may be the 'red and that if i am to find a deeper meaning in the movie perhaps it is that this car or rather the people inside of it going through the red light will be the ones who will 'stop' the jewel heist hmmmm br br perhaps the red circle refers to the thieving ring perhaps it was the burning sled no matter br br it's a long movie but it doesn't feel that way the ending is a bit of a disappointment it seemed too hurried for a movie that felt like such a delicious slow burn 9 10 br br clark richards
<START> this film is one to spend the short while entertainment but who then could be made in nobody country it does not have anything identifies the colombian who looks for the topics of the supposed colombian or socially and politically correct cinema and what it is it jeopardize it is better than it is not going to see this film some to the drug traffic or the fight is no reference either farmer and worker or wing guerrilla and to the kidnapping political br br the corrupt police is a personage who it could be mexican russian italian or chinese and also the personage protagonist an argentine photographer it could be venezuelan peruvian or philippine and the frequent in its it could be replaced by another word of slang of any other country without the personage or history changes the important thing is that it is a very decently counted history with images and right performances its quality almost is of tv movie but of the good ones that if one film like this if it deserves or does not deserve the support with publics bottoms a little is a classic discussion
<START> this interesting film noir features three very good performances sanders patrick and the scenes between sanders and patrick are particularly outstanding as the detective is unfortunately not nearly as good he lacks the intelligence strength and cynical world view of a bogart had humphrey played this part we could have had a classic br br pace location a library and atmosphere are all good but there are a few plot holes sanders strongly fears and the ruthless organization nazis he represents yet after mistakenly killing sanders seems to experience no anxiety or remorse sanders then seizes the library and its occupants by using the ruse that he and his men are detectives investigating the murder however sanders' hit man later tries to kill by shooting him without a silencer even though the many other could have been expected to hear and become alarmed by the noise finally sanders' hit man tries to kill roberts who has discovered the truth but when she faints he inexplicably does not br br what bothered me the most however was that the chance for a great and unexpected conclusion was wasted throughout the film patrick is portrayed as a smart hard as nails sociopath fearing nothing yet at the end she flees panic stricken from the last surviving nazi a brutish thug by the time the cops find him he has killed her and she ends up being just another weak stereotypical victim what should have happened is this the cops find the nazi thug but he is dead she has cleverly killed him and then vanished to continue her evil ways
<START> batman returns is a really dark movie that shows the caped crusader fighting against the penguin and the sexy catwoman i'll get to them later michael keaton acts well as bruce wayne showing he is a good actor tim burton directs this picture well and the locations of the movie are impressive the villains danny devito is menacing as the penguin a cruel yet disturbed man that had a really hard childhood but michelle pfeiffer steals the picture she is the best catwoman ever she is threatening and extremely sexy there's a scene where she kisses batman the cat way that just heats the movie up the action scenes are good too and the ending is dramatic and tragic probably the best ending of a batman movie tim burton shows he can manage a batman movie really well he already demonstrated this with the first batman and also gives batman a darker nature so much like him
<START> what a despairing film dress actors in furry rags place in suburban wasteland set cameras rolling and hope for the best one can only imagine e the thanks the cast gave when their characters were killed off by thus sparing them further humiliation in this this rivals monster a go go as the best cure for insomnia ever made oh god how can i fill up 10 lines explaining how overwhelmingly bored everybody looks in this movie whiney crappy plastic bungling robot who annoys everybody both on and off screen giant spider reduced to a single giant hairy leg pulled by string actors desperately trying not to look at the camera while mumbling off dialogs
<START> when this series aired i watched most of it i think it was supposed to be a long running series in the vein of the fugitive and the incredible hulk where the protagonist is being chased around the country looking for a solution to his problems in this case the hero's problem is his progressive aging in reverse i liked what i saw of these shows the acting was good especially the sorrowful relationship between the lead character and his wife problem is they cancelled it before it had a chance to end either that or i missed the last episodes br br they never got a chance to wrap up the story either knowing it had been cancelled poof it was just gone however like i said before i might have missed the last episodes but my proof to the contrary is this i rented the tape where i left off in the series the lead character's wife dies in a fire started by a chase involving king's famous organization the shop while getting away hero is kidnapped it ends with his friends realizing they have to go save him from the shop the end last episode on the video his wife does not die but escapes the fire with him right when he should get nabbed by the shop he and his wife share a weird moment then phase out of existence abrupt silly and cheap to the extreme they just wanted to put this video out and decided to tag on an ending not caring how bad it was they might as well of just shown some stock footage of the first atomic bomb almost br br the show did have a cool opening title sequence set to the david bowie song of the same name
<START> a boat builder in a sleepy town in maine is going out of business and the lives of all of the soon to be ex workers and families are disrupted the biggest disappointment is that the two stars bates and bridges have only bit parts br br interesting but not something you would see twice br br
<START> badly shot badly edited clumsy dialogue flat characters unsuccessful adaption of a novel it doesn't really get much worse decent acting and good popcorn saved me for this hour and a half felt more like three hours of boredom occasional good one liners br br david is a dim witted young man who has never recovered from losing his brother at an early age he puts his faith in a chinese philosophy mumbo jumbo video although that doesn't seem to help him much in real life david is a member of a debt collectors gang where every member has an iq below sea level a lacking script along with uncreative shooting and even worse editing make what could have been quite funny incidents of failed debt collecting look like a amateurish homemade reality show br br david rents an apartment from an elementary school teacher who by dropping a couple of sentences about his own importance convinces david he is dealing with the most dangerous criminal in iceland a severely lacking script doesn't offer david anything to base his opinion on a couple of scenes showing doing something that david could have misinterpreted would have done the work the potentials of film as media as opposed to the text of the book this film is based on are not exploited br br at first david's connection with raises his status within the debt collectors gang but the prevailing paranoia in the criminal world forces david to show where his loyalty lies br br the plot of the film is fine but then it is based on the book this could have been a much better film a good screenwriter could have made something of this material sadly that is not the case br br the acting is generally good is excellent and credible as david eggert doesn't get much to work with but does his best with what little material he has and michael imperioli in a tiny role manage alright br br overall opinion what could have been quite a funny and entertaining film about a dim witted anti hero in a debt collectors gang becomes a boring badly crafted film made after a poor manuscript staring at your toes for an hour and a half would be more enjoyable
<START> filmmaker bryan forbes who once displayed a light sardonic touch with beguiling material such as whistle down the wind and the original stepford wives completely bottoms out here not only is his direction inept he also sloppily adapted sidney early novel the results are atrocious roger moore plays a psychiatrist framed for the murder of one of his patients rod steiger chewing the scenery is a hot under the collar cop it's easily his most embarrassing performance the only actor here to exhibit some life is elliott gould who knows a thing or two about enlivening a bum script bland choppy and produced on the cheap no stars from
