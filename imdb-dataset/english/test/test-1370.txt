<START> now being a fan of sci fi the trailer for this film looked a bit too how do i put it hollywood but after watching it i can gladly say it has impressed me greatly jude is a class actor and miss leigh pulls it off better than she did in delores it brings films like the matrix 12 monkeys and the cell into mind which might not sound that appealing but it truly is one of the best films i have seen
<START> i have never seen this in the theater my second viewing was tonight on big screen dvd as opposed to old vhs tape from rental store br br for it's time and i'm sure the hayes code was pushed to it's limits br br hitch's pallet here is the game play between two combatants and yes if guy calls the cops on bruno right away the movie is 63 min shorter hello people do you always make the best or most logical choice how many times have you been in either person's shoes and made the right choice for the love of god it's called poetic license however as guy sees the situation he has found himself in he takes it upon himself to rectify it he does not help nor does he lie to his would be new wife her defense of him sets off the final show down with bruno feeling he has one more card to play br br for the cop shot ting an innocent person in pre cam corder days and before rules of engagement this type of thing did happen in the post rodney king world a presidential candidate backed the police in sending 43 bullets at an unarmed man if you haven't seen or witnessed outrageous police behavior your blind or have an application pending for the br br back to the movie br br go watch it with try and wear a post wwii filter and pretend your seeing a great suspense movie like many did for the first time back then and sure it's been copied since but your looking at one of the source of inspiration for many that followed
<START> the actresses are cute and the sets while simple quite ok apart from this there is nothing to save from this movie incredibly bad acted dumb to tears dialogues all too expected plot a lot of goofs and inconsistencies for instance a pretty young girl gets hits in the head by a morning star and not only she survives but barely with a scratch to make it short because it does not worth more even the fans of the genre can avoid it
<START> there is nothing like an oscar wilde comedy and this movie is nothing like a comedy the melodrama labors from scene to scene and the comedy is completely absent in the original story the humor comes from the americans who are oblivious to the ghostly traditions of chase the american father even offers some oil to the ghost to quiet the creaking chains read the book
<START> this is a hard film to rate while it truly deserves its 3 or perhaps even a two for an al adamson film it's exceptional and practically adamson's very best that's because unlike many adamson films there are times when nurse sherri almost looks competent but being an adamson film you know that sooner or later that crappiness must rear its ugly head br br the film begins with some bizarre cult leader of a huge congregation six trying to resurrect a dead guy who looks like he's made of blue cheese however in the process the cult dude has a heart attack and it taken to the hospital he apparently dies but it also seems like many of these hospital scenes are missing and a few of them appear much later in the film in other words when you see the film he appears to have possibly recovered only to hear later that he'd died because the guy is the b f f of satan however his evil soul can't die and he comes back to both haunt one of his henchmen and to possess nurse sherri br br now sherri is obviously a very disturbed lady demonic possession or not at times she acts like a zombie and at others she's violently homicidal so i ask why didn't her boyfriend a doctor think this was perhaps problematic in other words after trying to kill a patient he neither gets an exorcist nor commits her to the booby hatch oh and speaking of boobies this movie is not the breast filled sex romp its title and posters would indicate while there are a few bare breasts here and there they are irrelevant to the plot and only seen very briefly 1 2 second or so in all but one scene so if you are a perv this movie is not for you though a few places in the film such as the nurse undressing for a patient make it look like the film might have at one time been designed as a porn flick br br if you are a bad movie fan however there is enough to whet your appetite some examples of incompetence are the inability of many of the actors to deliver lines that aren't zombie like and i am not even talking about sherri especially noticeable is one of the very final scenes i have never seen and heard some stilted acting and dialog in my life and this includes ed wood's films there are also a few more cheap touches such as the bad animation of the green stuff the doctor finding a murdered nurse yet continuing to investigate in a house where walls are covered in blood i'd get a cop better yet an army of cops br br so despite these problems why do i think it's good for an adamson film well the story isn't all bad and he was able to build tension very well many false alarms early on made my heart race a bit also the car crash while irrelevant came off pretty well and was practically big budget for adamson br br overall not a good film and one most people would be bored watching however fans of adamson or inept films will like it it does deliver some entertainment in a cheesy manner that will provide a few laughs
<START> as previously stated in one of my great reviews the universal of flash gordon should not be classified with the other serials for indeed the three of these have made a sort of celluloid electronic mythology for a punchy war phobic mid twentieth century world they stand alone in many peoples' minds as the example of just what a cliff hanger was br br we can recall seeing buster as a guest on nbc's late night talk show tomorrow hosted by tom snyder this was circa 1979 80 during the interview mr crabbe was asked about his personal fitness habits he credited weight training and swimming coupled with some sound habits which included and protein and would you believe it he smoked several cigarettes br br when questioned about his career mr snyder of course got to the subject of his portrayal and strong identification with the character of flash buster stated that he had read and enjoyed the feature in its original medium that is a comic strip the property of hearst's king features syndicate he stated that he had thought that it would not work once transferred to the screen luckily he was wrong br br as for the 1st serial it was a very good adaption of the original continuity from the sunday color comics the world is about to end because of impending collision with planet it's up to independent working dr to rocket to the wild planet to change its course he enlists the aid of flash and miss dale arden newly acquainted from airliner landing in property br br the serial has excitement through out and manages to make one feel that there is always some other peril lurking just outside the film frame the costuming and decor is varied from to oriental to art it would be easy to surmise that this was due to on the part of universal but once again this was being faithful to creator cartoonist alex visual concepts just look at the old strips as reprinted in many collections the rockets were used before in just imagine fox 1930 a science fiction musical comedy the other scientific lab equipment was provided by universal's prop dept being the top hollywood company doing horror and scifi br br the cast features jean rogers dale arden and priscilla lawson princess aura who get into a good girl vs bad girl battle over flash charles middleton portrays emperor ming in a sort of overly melodramatic villain but makes it work frank shannon is toned down from the sheer madness that he suffered in his appearance in by the way ever wonder how has a brogue richard alexander makes a fine powerfully built prince ever helpful and so noble br br comic actor jack tiny is the surprise of the cast stealing scene after scene as a lecherous henry viii like scoundrel turned ally king ruler of the among the others most notable is jim pierce as prince of the lion men pierce like crabbe had also portrayed tarzan in a film but he later married tarzan creator edgar rice daughter joan br br flash gordon and the two sequels flash gordon's trip to mars 1938 and flash gordon conquers the universe 1940 have been a staple juvenile fare for generations first in the movie houses then in television release like fine wine they seen to get better with age br br we're all so glad that mr crabbe was wrong
<START> 1989 is an emmy award winning six part miniseries out of the uk which was the inspiration for the oscar winning traffic 2000 the five hour film breaks down the opium heroine trade for the viewer from the of poppy seeds in an afghanistan field to the head rush of a junkie in a flat in england not only does offer entertainment value through dramatic stories it also provides an overview of the international drug trade at all levels answering the who where how and why questions of the age old and unstoppable narcotic supply demand machine entertaining and educational will prove to be time well spent for teens and up a
<START> and that's a goddamn shame please make the sun rise and have it incinerate all copies of dracula 3000 this must be the worst vampire flick of the new millennium so far i haven't seen reign in darkness yet but they don't get much worse than this don't be fooled be the movie's cool h r cover this is so bad it's almost hilarious i can't describe all the emotions this movie conjured i laughed my ass off i yelled at the screen i sat there numb nodding my head in disbelief this film has cheese' written all over it the best thing of this movie are the opening credits and the opening shots which feature more or less okay cgi of two space ships but when casper van voice over comes on you start smelling something fishy and indeed it all goes downhill rapidly after that br br the crew of a salvage spaceship finds an abandoned vessel the which seems to be heading for earth they enter it thus sealing their fate this movie is above all things a shameless low budget alien rip off mixed with vampires right down to the plot twist were erika eleniak's character aurora reveals she's a robot coolio goes badly over the top as the dope smoking bloodsucking code from the hood as a name casper van character's named capt van helsing hahaha and he looks like er well casper van dien udo kier as capt former commander of the is only shown on a monitor screen and he really does seem to have trouble reading his lines from an auto cue poor udo what where you doing in this flick and then we have langley as count one of the most pathetic and laughable dracula's ever to dis grace the silver screen just look at his outfit instead of some cool looking futuristic black suit or something he's wearing a cheap old school halloween suit with fringes you thought richard was unconvincing as dracula in van helsing then wait until you see performance br br the set designers went overboard on this one the interior of the looks like a cross between an oil tanker and an old steel factory which they decorated with awful lights and colors like green pink blue and yellow the prop master must have forgotten that this movie takes place in the year 3000 because the characters use guns which look like today's 45 and prof uses a non motorized non floating wheelchair it has to be pushed around in order to move br br aside from one dried up corpse a few impalements and one dismemberment there's absolutely no gore and the vampire fangs and contact lenses look fake as hell add to that also the most lame stupid and abrupt ending ever humvee and aurora are the only survivors instead of having one final bloody showdown with count they lock themselves in the control room then aurora explains that before her program was upgraded and joining narcotics she used to be a 3 2 pb in other words a pleasure bot so she says well then what are you waiting for humvee answers ain't gotta tell me twice come on girl picks her up and the ship explodes and credits roll no sex scene no erika her boobies no bloody climax just one more shot of udo kier reading a line on the monitor and it's over br br so this movie is a must see for every bad movie lover but i must warn them it gets really painful at times and everyone claiming that van helsing underworld or even queen of the damned is the worst vampire movie of the new millennium clearly is insane or just hasn't seen dracula 3000 yet
<START> carlos mencia is not funny from his stand up specials to this train wreck of a tv series carlos mencia is not funny i have been trying to convince people for two years that he steals other comedians' jokes and as far as his comedy material goes he is a regular johnny come lately with far less than sub par results psycho astronaut jokes britney spears breakdown jokes i hope this is only a scheduling error but come on carlos and comedy central those topics and many others have run the gamut of late night tv show opening monologues saturday night live mad tv and many many others lampooning ethnic and racial stereotypes comedy stands no chance of evolving with carlos mencia around perhaps people especially viewers and comedy central executives will get the point since this week's issue of new york magazine accurately labeled him carlos mencia unrepentant joke
<START> i gave this movie a rating of 1 because it is by far the worst movie i've ever seen in my life this movie was made in 2003 and i've seen movies made in the 60's with better special effects i wish i could go into detail but words can't describe how crappy this movie was i could have done better with a home video camera and 20 i pray that chuck norris never makes a movie again now if you think i'm downing this movie because it has a christian theme you're wrong i like the fact that il' chuck decided to make a movie that at least attempted to make god look good but why would he make poor viewers like me suffer through such a crappy movie this whole film can be summed up in 3 words re damn diculous
<START> this miniseries movie was so terrible at times that i nearly broke down and turned it off i am a great fan of the novel however this movie suffers from multitudes of problems the costuming is poor and many of the more emotionally charged scenes are blase the departures from the novel are poorly chosen significant nuances are missed or rewritten br br
<START> the movie is about a day in the life of a woman who is going insane to show that she is mentally ill she overacts a lot and the narrator tells us she's going mad along the way she goes out with a fat guy who looks like he could be orson welles' brother and he later takes a header off a building in one of the only interesting moments in the movie br br this is a strange little film that is very cheaply made and it sure shows the film was shot without sound probably using 8mm or some other cheap type of film and had some sound effects and an overbearing narration added later in fact the narration was the most obtrusive and unintentionally hilarious i have ever heard and it is said in such a silly and over the top manner you'd just have to hear it to believe it as a result of these cost cutting actions it's not surprising that the film is bad though the idea of trying to make this sort of film was pretty original plus it's very hard to make it through the entire film
<START> i loved catcher in the rye it happens to be my favorite book jd the author of catcher has the rights to the book and made it so not one person can make a movie about it with his permission br br with that said heres united states of leland beautiful movie with much meaning and depth in emotion but a lot of it reminded me of catcher almost too much reminded me of catcher the few stories that leland told in the movie such as visiting new york and his adventures were very similar to those of holden's in catcher and the way leland views people and emotions is also similar to holden's they both are simple and true to themselves and others superior acting credited to don cheadle and kevin spacy great editing all falls together perfectly and loved the story all together recommend as a buy or at least a rent good movie br br the only thing that it does drag at some points but makes up for it in the long run give it time and appreciate a good movie
<START> this movie has a very deep look at the relationships between a mother who was raised in a christian environment and learned that appearance is everything she and her son who just recently returned from vietnam collide in some very tense issues the relationship has no connections intimately and is a great accurate portrayal of what it is like to live with someone who is false and only looks at the surface of issues kathy bates does an excellent job of portraying a woman of false faith who is either oblivious to her cruelty forgetful or just doesn't want to be confronted jeremy's wrath is never feared and it leads to a very disturbing conflict between him and his feelings about his fathers love for him this is a very honest look at some family dynamics after a traumatic event leads one to despair
<START> when i heard the film was to be released and the theme of what it was about i felt very curious but when i saw it was the biggest deception of my life technically speaking the sound is poor you can tell about man dialogs that were remade on studio that are poorly achieved in the final mix of all the photography is mediocre some part of the films show some soldiers with night vision goggles and the way the cinematographer achieves that dark night is by illuminated everything like if they were in an actual military base with lights there's no reference used of the moonlight my god but not least most of the ac are really poor it's totally not believable the roll of the wife of one of the soldier her performance it's pretty poor br br great disappointing shame of the jury who chose to send this movie to represent colombia on the oscars
