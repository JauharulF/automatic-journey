<START> being a fan of bad movies i was thrilled to find a 3 pack of cr ppy horror at best buy today the set was cheap and included a terrible film called the dark that i actually remember seeing in the theater br br the remaining 2 were equally as bad creatures from the abyss being probably the worst of the bunch since they were all bad that isn't saying much but its stupidity bad acting terrible effects and retarded storyline actually made this one a lot of fun to watch i was rolling on the floor with each new plot development the discovery of the abandon ship the missing crew the realization that there was something terribly wrong it was great of course everyone's favorite scene seems to be the sex scene omg i almost lost it between that an the monster cam i have to say i enjoyed this film a lot br br i am a fan of bad movies so i enjoyed it but in all fairness i did have to give the movie a 1 it was awful but if rubbish is your bag at least rent this one yes the bad pun was intentional
<START> didn't the writer for this movie see the other three i loved the original i thought 2 was the best i tolerated 3 it was ok nothing special but i hated this one who dare they kill off ug this was certainly not the ug who had been almost like a brother to charlie in number 2 remember his speech charlie said you wouldn't just leave me on earth would you ug replied charlie bounty hunter saying that he was now one of them now how dare the writers ignore this special bond between them and turn him into a baddie who get's killed by charlie in a particularly awkward scene just because they realized the movie was getting boring in fact for the first 20 minutes we get a new cast and have to wait this long until we again find out what happened to charlie who was the hero we've been waiting to see i kept waiting saying come on when's charlie going to appear angela basset must be doing her best to deny she was ever in this turkey moving it to the future eliminates the possibility of ever seeing a sequel with the original cast or in our time i think the writers decided that their movie was going to be the last and they could do whatever they wanted this movie is totally out of line with the first two and it didn't even seem like it was written by the same people who made 3 3 at least had humor and could easily be seen by younger children 4 is just ugly and mean spirited eric dare is particularly cruel and unnecessary i hated this movie hated hated hated it i hated the fact that anyone could like it and i hated the fact that it ruined what was one of my favorite camp classics i give this a one start simply because imdb com won't let me give it a zero
<START> the three stooges has always been some of the many actors that i have loved i love just about every one of the shorts that they have made i love all six of the stooges curly shemp moe larry joe and curly joe all of the shorts are hilarious and also star many other great actors and actresses which a lot of them was in many of the shorts in my opinion the three stooges is some of the greatest actors ever and is the all time funniest comedy team br br one of the most hilarious three stooges shorts is men in black in this short are bud jeanie roberts phyllis crane dell henderson 'little billy' rhodes billy gilbert and ruth the acting by these actors are good especially by and roberts there are many funny scenes here that i think most three stooges fans will love in my opinion this one of the most different three stooges shorts i recommend this one to all
<START> br br as a fan of bad movies and mst3k and a member of i must say i've seen my share of them but geez even the worst i've seen at least had a soundtrack as george stiffly wanders around hong kong doing who knows what you can guarantee that you won't be distracted by any of that background music that fills todays cinema or any of that music that fills elevators i don't think anyone in this film even hums br br now this isn't entirely true there is a sound track if you listen closely you will hear it chime in about a half dozen times through the course of the film of course the timing will be entirely inappropriate and it doesn't last very long but something that could be classified as music does occur your best bet though is to sit your toddler armed with a wooden spoon down in front of the tv with a collection of pots and pans while you watch the rhythm and flow would be better than anything the film offers br br keep an eye out for sammo hung as a minor villian in this film aren't we all glad he found jackie chan to work with
<START> i agree with this is a great movie here are some dialogue snippets br br sean connery to eden candice bergen you see the man at the well how he draws the water when one bucket empties the other fills it is so with the world at present you are full of power but you're spilling it and islam is lapping up the drops as they spill from your bucket br br the english have paid very well in the past well you'll not have your way with the americans president roosevelt will have your head for this roosevelt this president roosevelt he would try and take it himself he certainly would he is a man of grit and strong moral fiber he does not kidnap women and children what kind of rifle does he use a winchester winchester winchester i have no knowledge of this rifle you will br br teddy roosevelt brian keith the american grizzly bear is a symbol of the american character strength intelligence ferocity a little blind and reckless at times but courageous beyond all doubt oh and one other trait goes with all previous newspaper reporter and that mr president teddy roosevelt loneliness the bear lives out his life alone indomitable but always alone he has no real allies only enemies but none of them are as great as he newspaper reporter you feel this might be an american trait teddy roosevelt certainly the world would never love us it may respect us it may even grow to fear us but it'll never love us for we have too much audacity and we're a bit blind and reckless at times too
<START> humour is a very individual thing and the audience at the sneak preview of the boy seemed to enjoy it more than i did i found it an anachronistic affair more representative of the old fashioned racial humour of the australian cinema of the 1960s and 1970s the boy meets girl plot never takes off because of a lack of chemistry between lucy bell and nick while i found laughs thin on the ground if you want to spend your money on this wait until it's on video
<START> low budget but memorable would be shocker that instead emerges as theater of the bizarre vulnerable naive nurse charlotte beale comes to a secluded mental hospital and is completely unaware that the only sane people have been murdered despite the red flags that are constantly being raised all around her br br the lack of a decent budget really gives the filmmakers little more to go on than a sense of style as well as a cast of wacky characters the pleasures of this film don't come from the film's shocks which are fairly tame but from the weird atmosphere first we have the delusional woman who thinks her baby doll is real there's also an axe murdering judge a shell shocked war veteran and old mrs callahan is like everybody's daffy elderly grandmother gone amok a young patient named allyson gives the term nymphomaniac new meaning a big guy named sam is just a little slow after a botched lobotomy and jennifer vaults suddenly between catatonia and violent outbursts the only other sentient person in the place seems to be dr masters but does she have a secret br br don't look in the basement is a great example of low budget exploitation films there isn't much plot going on but the cheapness works for the movie several cast members turn in memorable performances particularly betty chandler and annabelle and the way the director adds little weird details to the movie can really stick with you br br the scene between allyson and the telephone man is a classic for all time and especially delicious are the facial expressions of dr masters when she begins to go over the edge near the finale of the movie also makes great use of the cheap soundtrack with several musical cues really evoking the characters that they accompany my favorite cue is the crazy cue a that whenever one of the patients does something pathological br br also wonderful is the way that charlotte herself plunges into hysteria at the climax with the patients revealing that dr masters is simply another inmate and then suggesting that charlotte is also a patient who is being allowed to act out her delusions she certainly has a tenuous grip on reality why else would she not question the ominous lack of phone service or outside contact the scene where charlotte manages to finish off the barely alive dr stephens with a toy boat has to be one of the greatest moments in low budget horror yes don't look in the basement could very well be the american beauty of grade z trash
<START> this movie had potential the script was not bad and it presented an interesting dark atmosphere with themes of suicide patricide regrets and as chris says 10 years of going nowhere it's a sharp contrast to the original which was bright humorous and even the bad guy was lovable br br it's a very interesting change of tone and if they had developed the characters more maybe i would've liked it br br but instead they waste far too much time on gratuitous and ridiculous battle scenes poorly edited together at one point you see a horse fall and 5 seconds later you see the same scene again but not many people would notice that since there are already 2 dozen horse trips i'm not exaggerating and by then we've already dozed off br br which leads me to the title of my review this film was extensively cut due to animal cruelty so chances are if you decide to watch it you'll get the watered down kiddie version there's a bullfight where the matador stabs the bull and suddenly as the crowd erupts cheering there's no bull just the matador in an empty arena like wow maybe the bull was a jedi i dunno more likely the scene was cut br br later there's a cockfight scene where in the original version one of the birds gets horribly mauled before a crowd of cheering mexicans this was cut but we still see enough to get pretty annoyed br br but by far the worst scenes are the horse throws one after the other you see horses' legs get yanked sending thousands of pounds of horse onto its head in one scene a horse gets thrown and then while it's squirming on the ground in paralytic convulsions an explosive goes off right under its neck br br this film was made in 1966 when hollywood was just starting to animal brutality on film this is probably one of the last flicks where you can see it happen so if that sort of stuff it floats yer boat check it out you'll get a mild thrill but if not you'll either be irritated or flat out bored
<START> the comments for commune make it sound like a very interesting film one that i would be deeply interested in unfortunately the producers didn't see fit to include closed captions for the hearing impaired and deaf that leaves me and countless others like me who depend on closed captions to follow a movie completely out br br this is inexcusable for any film produced in the year 2005 in a world where all manner of handicaps and disabilities are accommodated it's infuriating and ironic that the ever sanctimonious entertainment industry fails to demand that all productions and movie theaters be closed captioned
<START> it's a soap opera drawing upon an applied ethics idea a movie about human suffering and death is not necessarily a good movie i didn't get any emotion from it the ideas are not at all new the tension lacks it becomes tedious towards the second half but towards the end i think it becomes quite interesting in a burlesque way i mean you have this middle aged paralyzed bald guy who gets more women than don juan he doesn't seem to suffer as much as you would expect from someone completely paralyzed for over 28 years he has no issues with god and one would probably expect that too the people around him seem to be the perfect slaves i can't get out of my mind bergman's cries and whispers similar to this one in many respects which simply bursts with emotions and not all of them humane etc this movie is the perfect recipe for housewives who look for some emotional thrill but don't expect to be blown away the movie is worth seeing among all the cynicism we get today for its sincere intention to present a modern ethical issue without any desire to arouse the viewer amenabar doesn't rub your face in it and he doesn't take sides he doesn't want to make us fanatics for a particular idea still i have no clue as to why this movie was so highly regarded
<START> david lynch shot his first film over several years adding new scenes each time he managed to raise a little bit more cash kevin smith made 'clerks' at work while working as a clerk and robert rodriguez has boasted that 'from dusk till dawn' cost precisely 30 000 but 30 000 is still a hell of a lot of money to raise if you work as a cleaner in a cemetery and what if an aspiring film maker not only had such a job but also had all the ambition of such luminaries and all the of smith but absolutely none of the talent such a figure is mark the subject of this hilarious documentary which chronicles his attempt to make a pair of movies over many many years combines his lunatic dreams with flights of depression and a fatal inability to call it a day one senses he almost prefers the endless labours of searching for an impossible perfection to an accommodation with the reality that he's simply on the evidence presented in 'american movie' not very good and like a modern day ed wood he surrounds himself with an epic crowd of fellow losers his genuine affection for whom is his greatest redeeming feature the collection includes his warring parents his best friends one a criminal the other a reformed drug addict his own hapless children and best of all his aged uncle bill bill may live in a trailer park and just about have given up on life but he is the owner of a small fortune 280 000 to be precise and the touching but potentially exploitative relationship between the two men lies at the heart of the film manages to enlist a few actors to perform alongside himself of course but in the main he is wholly dependent on friends and family to complete his work even bill has a role on camera on british tv the bbc brilliantly scheduled a screening of 'american movie' back to back with 'lost in la the story of terry gilliam's ill fated attempt to film 'don quixote' in that film one was impressed by the huge amount of professionalism on display inadequate as it was to the task in hand and just how damn difficult it is even for experts with millions to spend to make a film whereas is not only penniless but also such a clown that he can't even pronounce the name of his own work properly ultimately is human enough for you to want him to succeed but awful enough for the viewer to still be able to laugh at his failures if this film was fiction you'd dismiss it as unbelievable but as it is it's one of the funniest documentaries you're likely to see
<START> i really enjoyed this old black and white talkie at first i didn't recognize harold lloyd as mr cobb a missionary to china coming home to find a wife there were many twists and turns in mr attempts to clean up city hall his methods of making the punishment fit the crime would likely be illegal but this is not a movie based on reality this would be a perfect movie for children except that there is female near nudity only on grace bradley the old telephones are enchanting the only fault is a problem typical of the day caucasians are used to represent chinese men this is offset by the positive way the chinese are portrayed they are the wise good and friendly guys trivia a truck appears in the movie when the police run out of black
<START> this movie just felt very true to life i liked the ending which seemed to resolve naturally without any big moments but with a lot of little moments coming together you could tell it is an honest love story it doesn't matter what the of the main characters are it still a story about love and understanding br br there were a lot of scenes that involved the family the setting is during what for some people is a very stressful time namely the holidays christmas to be precise br br like most good films this one addresses issues of love fitting in expectations and can't be overcome biases in the end alexandra and casey make a choice for each other knowing that love is difficult and about giving well done
<START> this is really a terrible film by any of the regular plot storyline acting effects direction i could go on suffice to say it's poor however it has a certain appeal many totally out of context sex scenes appear it's fun looking for the batman references umm that's it poor really don't bother
<START> a study of one of those universally familiar physical and or emotional states isolation i think the film also comments on cultural displacement too br br the film presents the experiences of two turkish men cousins one has money and the comforts that come of having 'made it' with a steady income the other has none and goes in search of work neither are happy expect no celebration of life here this is loneliness warts and all br br the film succeeds in offering a powerfully bleak traverse across the 'low of the human condition brave film making well acted and well shot in my view outdoor shots by the harbour being my own favourites a film that should inspire gratitude in anyone who is not a stranger to happiness and fulfilment in life not to mention employment everyone else will find a companion in this film a film with all the warmth and pace of an ice expect a bitter pill not a 'happy pill '
