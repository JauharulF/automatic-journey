<START> opera is one of the greatest achievements in horror genre this masterful picture has everything what should be in the pure horror movie good captivating story a lot of symbols wonderful visuals and plenty of gore the killings are very shocking and bloody an unforgettable atmosphere of dread and fear a must see for a true argento fan so if you get a chance watch it
<START> by far one of the best sci fi films out there however it does take viewings to understand the concept of the film and to be able to appreciate not only the special effect but the main plot of the film itself it is my own feelings that this film film got such poor reviews because no one took the time to watch the film the way it was meant to be seen it does have some moments you wish would hurry up and pass by but they are few and far between hooper who directed tcm 1 and 2 along with a remake of invaders from mars and the funhouse does his best work here great score good acting and great effects makes this a film to add to your collection if you get the chance see the widescreen version on dvd highly recommended to any one who is a fan of sci fi
<START> it amazes me that someone would actually consider spending some money on a movie like this really let's forget for a second that the plot doesn't even give a single hint of originality most of the movies today are based on other movies' stories so a simple lack of originality is not that big a deal br br but i can hardly believe that none of the guys involved in the movie had never even got on a plane before shooting this because let's be honest that would be the only excuse to come up with something so ridiculous to be sincere i think a 6 years old child with a fake camera could have come up with something technically much more believable some examples following br br the scene that really drove me crazy is when the engines turn off when they regain control of the plane when they have to turn them on again the guy on the radio says something like ok push the 1 and 2 buttons on the dashboard now those are not buttons they should not be pushed they should actually be pulled up and toward the pilot that's something only plane addicted would know you say wrong the next scene you can see their fingers pushing the buttons and of course the so called buttons don't move at all not even a single millimeter and note that i haven't even mentioned the fact that aircraft engines are not like cars engine that you just turn the key and the magic happens you have to do quite a complicated procedure to turn them on come on guys you could have faked the movements at least not to mention the hilarious final impact where the plane crashes against every single thing along the runway light poles along the runway what where they thinking and the wings don't even get ripped off it happened to me too once except the plane was made of lego what about the flight attendant she's actually so skilled that she perfectly knows where the aux 1 and aux 2 fuses are in the middle of the wires behind the cockpit should we mention then the guy that can drive an ambulance and fly a plane behind the ambulance using his computer and how did he turn the other airplane engines on br br really i could go on hours with this stuff this is the dumbest movie i've ever come across and i'm including garbage like alone in the dark and other stuff in the list want to do yourself a favor don't watch it
<START> clever psychosexual drama about a wounded union soldier clint eastwood who seeks refuge in an isolated confederate school for young women during the civil war slowly eastwood begins to seduce every girl in sight until the tables are turned and he becomes the pursued in an unsettling gothic toned finale never has a film been so deliciously erotic yet disturbingly macabre at the same time br br this is undoubtedly eastwood's finest hour those who tune in for dirty harry will indeed be surprised while the rest of the cast gives uniformly superb performances try to see the film on video as television prints usually delete crucial flashback scenes between geraldine page and patrick
<START> how living the dream managed to get into the 5 in west hollywood is beyond me as it is the worst film i have ever seen in my life i should have known when the first scene opened in gasp eugene oregon that this dud of a film with characters that you want to like and feel sorry for from their exclusion days from high school but can't as they are such losers is so wooden and atrocious with dialog that is beyond bad br br then clichÃ© the three high school losers end up in la and here is where the film could have been realistic if it had shown them trying to find a career in acting but no one works as a used car salesman the other is a true loser in a garage call center selling magazines even the bastard that runs the place has more audience appeal than that dreadful actor with the horrible foreign accent and they fraudulently get money from an insurance scam to set up an executive recruitment firm with no experience just showing the supposed good life in la night spots with a cast of actors that are so wooden and bad they better not have sag cards br br i could go on and on about this bad film but i ended up walking out of the theater which had at the start six people and when i left four men were the only ones in the audience i wanted to like this film but i couldn't find one merit in the story characters writing dialog nor the actors whoever cast this film should retire amen enough
<START> this year's royal rumble wasn't really bad but last year's was definitely way better br br first match shawn michaels vs edge even though this match did take a little too long it was still alright edge wins after using the ropes to pin shawn michaels 4 10 br br second match undertaker vs in a casket match now i don't really like casket matches this match was boring sloppy but in the end it picked up it's pace as undertaker nailed the tombstone then rolled in the casket for the victory 4 10 br br third match jbl vs kurt angle vs big show in a triple threat match for the wwe women's championship not a bad triple threat match too bad jbl wins again to retain his title after nailing a clothesline from hell on angle for the win 5 10 br br fourth match randy orton vs triple h for the world heavyweight championship great match by these two men the match was a bit sloppy but it was still good it picked up pretty towards the end even though orton lost the match was fast paced great towards the end hhh nails the pedigree on orton for the win to retain his world title 5 10 br br fifth match royal rumble this was a cool royal rumble every royal rumble is good after all 30 men entered the last four remaining superstars in the rumble were cena edge mysterio batista edge was able to spear mysterio out later batista cena edge out together it was now up to cena batista first after reversing an f u batista went for the batista bomb but suddenly both men crumbled on the outside at the same time after a controversial decision mr mcmahon making his way to the ring to settle the matter the match was restarted again as batista cena battled it out but batista got the better out of cena nailed a spine buster threw cena out to win the 2005 royal rumble go on to wrestlemania 21 to face the champion in the 10 10 this was a very good royal rumble but last year's would always top every royal rumble in history br br overall i'll give it 8 10 b
<START> supposedly a movie about a magazine sending journalists to investigate reports of ufos with one being more or less tolerant or agnostic about the whole affair and the other an aussie a hardened skeptic who laughs at the ufo nonsense it's all a crock some kind of money making racket br br turns out this movie is actually a deceit and a trap to actually christian teachings and the christian explanation of ufos one i've heard before this is an ad hoc explanation that is itself not at all biblical but invented by certain modern theologians who can fit anything and everything into their mythology the paranormal it's real just demonic unless it takes place in a christian context then of course it is of god simple if it isn't of god it's the of the devil stupid so i suppose since beethoven's 9th symphony wasn't inspired by god it must have been written under demonic influence or so would the logic lead ad br br we are informed that since the bible does not tell of life on other planets in the universe therefore there is none a version of the ad fallacy and that god created the universe so huge so grand to show us his almighty power i think of carl sagan's remark that if god created such a huge universe and stuck life only on earth it'd have been a tremendous waste of space br br so what are ufos they are demonic activity and concern the soon to be earthshaking christian event the rupture i mean rapture before the tribulation the true christians will disappear from the face of the earth en masse causing mass panic confusion car and plane crashes whatever therefore satan knowing this is sending his demons to basically create an illusion of alien spacecraft and alien abduction which can then be used to explain away this otherwise inexplicable event all part of satan's plan which will of course keep people from looking to god or jesus and fall for the lies of the antichrist br br this ad hoc explanation also typifies theological mishmash by explaining away one mystery with another in opposition to the scientific method of explaining the unknown the strange and the mysterious in as much as possible first by the known if not solely by the known br br it's like jumping straight to an alien abduction whenever a child is missing and unaccounted for i think i'd look first at more mundane explanations like the child has run away gotten lost or been kidnapped for ransom or abducted by a predatory pedophile before invoking aliens or the supernatural or satan or some such br br this kind of deceit or trap on the part of fundamentalists is nothing new as young people are often lured to free rock concerts that may start out with something innocuous then suddenly switch to overt christian music followed by a sermon and an altar call this kind of blatant deception one might think would be more satan's ballgame but maybe because the christian faith is soon to be in its death throes these guys feel that anything goes any deception or trickery or scare tactics are acceptable to try to keep the faith alive which is facing serious opposition from both as well as competing faiths like islam the world's fastest growing religion which may well replace christianity as islam is far more cohesive and unified and logically more tenable than christian fundamentalism although this should offer little advantage to mankind as it would be replacing one intolerant thought system with another br br and of course the movie ends more or less with a variant of wager the aussie who is skeptical about just about everything is told well if you are right about there being no afterlife and death is nothing but rotting in the grave no worry but what if you're wrong br br basically statements implying that reality is going to conform to nothing but an viewpoint or christian fantasy is a false dilemma or black and white fallacy even if the atheists are wrong would not necessarily make christianity correct by default nor if christianity turns out to be full of holes in its theology that the materialistic atheists are therefore correct by default br br for all we know native american spirituality might turn out to be the best description of ultimate reality and we might all of use have wished we treated the earth and its creatures a wee bit better br br this movie should be stamped right on the box caution contains religious propaganda and not meant for informative or entertainment purposes
<START> when i played the first soul calibur on dreamcast i thought it was great when i played the second i was hooked and finally when soul calibur iii was released i bought a playstation 2 and the game br br this can really keep you up for hours with a huge amount of characters loads of content and not to mention a great fighting system this really is the greatest fighting game to date br br the games strong points is foremost the vs gameplay were two human players battle each other either playing as one of the main characters or as a created and customized character the create character option is vast and allows the player to make thousands of different combinations br br the only thing that bothers me is that if you create a character that uses the fighting style grieve edge only kicks has to wear those ridiculous shoes br br this is absolutely the greatest fighting game one could wish for now i'm just hoping the planned movie won't be crap
<START> i have to hold barney drilling my head every day well i guess there must be reasons first i'm convinced that our kids are not they are just kids but they know my 1 and a half years old son selects what to see what's nice or disgusting did you see the news do you think your kids have to know the reality as it is maybe or maybe not we the adults have the responsibility about what we want for our kids and what to teach them a film of drug dealers news about massacres in middle east of course the kids must know there is a real life but they are kids let's give them some mercy what do you want for them if you wanna have kids trained on weapons or the best way to kill a neighbor go ahead impose them lethal weapon kill bill any anime tell them santa's a depraved who enters through the chimney directly to violate them i want illusions for my son don't get me wrong i'm not saying barney and friends is the best in fact the show have a lot of defects i read other comments and i agree with most maybe the happiness is made of dreams or illusions at least i want to teach him to grow without fear but cautious that learns to think and believe that everything is not serial killers or hijackers whom they're reasons to worth to grow that at least he can be a little happy with his own dreams so parents don't underestimate your kids they know what they want
<START> i was fortunate enough to catch this film at the phoenix film festival and i must say that i very much enjoyed it when i asked the director if he had attended film school i was very much impressed that he had not films like these don't come from people without talent to get a start in commercials and then produce a heart felt family comedy like this shows real range i'll certainly be keeping an eye on what he does next as a good indie movie should the film is very character driven as apposed to your average hollywood movie which are mostly plot driven the film centers on a jewish family in new york the who have all been invited back for their fathers suicide party the film is stock full of witty quick jabbing dialogue the fact the small jewish family is obsessed with being jewish and anyone who is jewish grounds the unrealistic situation of a suicide party in reality director jeff hare does a wonderful job at pulling the characters out of the actors and bringing them to life on screen the production design brings the sets to life with lots of attention paid to small details making the setting feel like a home that's been lived in for 40 years the editing keeps up with the dialogue in such a way that it makes you sit on your seat wondering who's going to stab who with the next witty phrase or punch line and when appropriate the film slows down to let the audience dive a little deeper into the meanings and motivations hidden inside these lovable characters if you're a fan of woody allen or films like as good as it gets go see this film
<START> those who dislike this film seem to think that a loved one somehow to them and must be discarded if they go off with someone else fortunately human nature is much deeper than that loving someone deeply inevitably brings suffering though if we are fortunate only on their death br br this film is true in setting atmosphere and dialogue to nigel original novel 'a way through the wood' and by a seemingly irreconcilable dilemma captures the quiet desperation that lies behind many seemingly idyllic lives and the depiction of english upper class country life is very accurate br br i loved the film and hope it will appear soon as an uk compatible dvd
<START> what a mess and i'm not referring to the destruction in the title i could go on about the hackneyed plot the lousy effects the actually notable cast grimacing as they deliver the worst lines of their careers etc i'll just say there weren't any palm trees in chicago the last time i checked and leave it at that br br hmmm need ten lines to get this posted on imdb ok well i think a dvd release with outtakes could be interesting maybe dennehy will reveal what favor got called in for him to appear in this thing maybe dianne will show us the bag of money it must have taken to get her involved maybe cbs execs will apologize
<START> apart from some quite stunning scenery this steven seagal vehicle is devoid of reasons to spend any time watching it for a seagal movie it has very little almost no action but he does put in some reasonable for him acting in contrived character development scenes not recommended to anyone
<START> well at least this was the last sequel that i could find at blockbuster because this movie was just downright horrible i mean i can understand how hard it would be to get rid of an evil house we're talking starting a horrible fire flood etc but a mirror how hard could it be can it be to get rid of a mirror this was the most horrible movie that could've put the title of amityville into the picture br br well a group of friends who are pretty much from the start are a bunch of freaks one of them is a photographer of some kind and buys a haunted mirror from a homeless creepy guy teaching me a valuable lesson don't buy things from homeless creepy guy of course the horrible deaths and chaos ensues this group though i can't imagine anyone missing them br br please skip amityville a new generation i've already got a few complaints about my generation so i think this was a premonition not to sound so crazy p but believe me this is horribly acted not well thought out and not even scary i feel so bad for the original writers of the amityville horror they must be crying every time person witnesses this film br br 1 10
