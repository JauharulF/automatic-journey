<START> this is the last episode of the ova series finds himself working in an animation studio which is rather interesting if you don't know anything about the way anime studios were run besides episode 3 this was probably the least risquÃ© but it had a nice girl interest as well as a surprise reunion from others in the previous episodes my only complaint about this episode is it seemed a little too short but at the same time this may have only been because it was the only original script for the show that wasn't based on one of the manga chapters but it ended well leaving us with the nice feeling that is permanently 25 studying on definitely watch the rest of the series all the way through you can buy the whole series for like 17 you can watch it all the way through in about 2 1 2 hours or watch your favorite episode if you have 20 minutes free time which i do if i have a lunch break at school good series check it out
<START> hey what a great idea to open a film show someone s home movie drama schools must be full of idiots there they are taking drama lessons hoping to become the next big thing in hollywood when all you have to do is send a home movie to a studio hey i think i ll send in the video of my wedding and call it the greatest romance ever seen or send in a tape of my honeymoon and call it the greatest sex ever seen oh hold on i m not married and i ve never been on honeymoon not to worry i ll send in a video of someone elses wedding honeymoon br br mild spoilers br br you d think with an opening like that shark hunter could only improve wouldn t you as shocking as it may seem the home movie is the best directed best written and best acted part of the film alas it s all downhill from here as the family go to sea in reality a fog shrouded swimming pool in a three foot yacht where mom and dad get eaten by a cgi fin and their son spencer swears revenge against the fin cut forward to the present day and the french are using an underwater research base for oil exploration only thing is and it s so obvious you can t fail to notice this it s not filmed underwater the director hasn t made any attempt whatsoever to even use the unconvincing technique of shooting the scene through a fish tank the underwater research base is blown up by the shark maybe it s hired by killing everyone inside and spencer now a grown man is hired to hunt down the shark that killed his parents and a bunch of frenchmen what else happens no idea because i decided to watch something else br br no hard feelings if any of the cast and crew are reading this and i do hope matt becomes a big fish in hollywood you think you know about sharks matt you t seen nothing yet
<START> stop me if you hard this one before some cheerleaders their coach and a couple guys are trapped within a cabin in the woods when an unseen killer kills them off one by one shame on me after i totally wrote off jim wynorski after the horrid busty cops it was a long time coming as his last truly good film was 1990's hard to die i still for some reason got my hopes up for a supposed sequel to slumber party massacre sadly even my mediocre expectations were not met this outing is not nearly as fun as even the three previous films in the franchise and yes i'm including 2 that should tell you something furthermore how can you have a slasher film with this little gore i mean come on now br br my grade d br br eye candy ricky ray gets topless april flowers and charity show boobs and buns in a shower scene april gets nude again later in the film and sheffield gets topless and bares buns
<START> director tay garnett ford cast mike mazurki vic christy fritz ford tay garnett br br based on the number of comments i see on imdb this seems to be a forgotten movie this seems rather ironic to me because it is actually one of the first movies that i remember my mom took me and my little brother to see this film at the garland theater in spokane when it first came out in the mid 1970's and i still remember it br br i am going by memory here but i believe this move is about a trapper who was accused of a crime which he did not commit and the law goes after him i believe it to be set in 1800's alaska a narrator tells the story of the trapper played by mike mazurki really this is a very good film with a great setting it could be compared to the 1981 film death hunt with charles bronson the two films have a very similar story line the main difference between the two is death hunt is an adult orientated film whereas challenge is a family friendly film br br mike mazurki and tay garnett were both rather old when this movie was made which i find rather impressive when one considers that this movie was filmed on location in the wilds of alaska this was the last film made by tay garnett before he died which was just a few years later they both had been around since the silent era
<START> batman returns it is my opinion that the first batman of the batman series was only half the movie that batman returns is in the first batman by tim burton we had only batman and the joker both played wonderfully by michael keaton and jack nicholson br br in batman returns we have what i feel is the most perfectly cast batman movie yes even better then dark knight keaton returns as batman and is perfect in the role never going to far over top with the character of batman which is perfect in this film when it comes to the two villains that he's up against first you have danny devito who is delightfully insane as the penguin then you have michelle pfeiffer as cat woman who i dare to say is one of the most interesting and complex villains in the batman movies i feel this way about pfeiffer because of the way she becomes the cat woman she starts off as the rather pathetic mousy selena kyle and then truly dives into the dark side of her mind and what you get is a brilliant performance of a woman who goes from trying to be a hero to a villain and then i suppose back to a hero in the end also in this amazing cast you have the evil businessman max schreck played by the amazing and legendary christopher walken while in a supporting role there's something about this role that i love and maybe it's the look of schreck in the film that makes his performance all the better then it already is br br story wise i have to say that batman returns has so much more going on this time around as opposed to the first batman part of the reason i loved this story so much is the fact that burton dared to go in a much more darker and twisted direction as opposed to nicholson's over the top antics you have the story on the penguin and how he tries to deceive the people of gotham into making him the new hero and mayor of the city then you have cat woman and her struggle to decide just who she really is and what she should do with her new persona when it comes to batman i feel that in this one he's more the ring leader that holds the two stories together but of course kicking ass at the same time br br cinematography was the film is dark and atmospheric just like the story that's taking place within it gotham city never looked as good as it does on blu ray and hd so if you have the chance to see it this way then by all means do because it truly adds to the overall experience of batman returns br br so all in i truly feel that of all the batman movies batman returns believe it or not tops the dark knight for me because while i enjoyed that movie for heath ledger's amazing performance as the joker i felt that the movie was lacking something batman returns lacks nothing so if you want to see an amazing film with what i feel is a perfect cast then this is the batman to light the bat signal for
<START> if you read errol flynn's autobiography my wicked wicked ways you will see that this film is full of poetic licence not that that makes much of a difference because errol flynn was pretty generous with poetic licence in the autobiography anyway no need to worry about spoilers since there is nothing there to spoil br br to me it would seem more sensible to use the story about a fictitious hollywood actor then you could go out and find a better actor than duncan regehr to play him and you wouldn't have to worry about the audience saying things like but he didn't have a moustaches in captain blood another failing of this film is that it shows flynn as a two dimensional character flynn was an intelligent man well educated well read this film only concentrates on his image br br regehr is a disaster the rest of the cast struggle with their scripts hal linden is ok as warner and barbara hershey makes a believable damita although lili damita herself did not think so br br the best thing to do with this film is to forget about it and let it gently slip away to oblivion so what i am writing this for i can't imagine
<START> i usually enjoy watching laurel and hardy but this is obviously one of the films they made while they were on their way to becoming a successful comedy team br br the plot is all too simple and is mainly based on one joke how strange kilts and scotsmen are and that's all okay there are some other jokes but i didn't find them very funny at all they are outdated and i guess were not very entertaining when the movie was first released br br still the movie has got two of the most charming faces in history and they make the best out of the awkward story which i expect was filmed without a proper script and the scenery is nice to look at br br in my opinion watching this is only worthwhile for laurel and hardy fans other people should stay away from it
<START> this was the worst movie my wife and i have ever seen the only concessions is that we did not pay to see it at the movies as we rented this on dvd from the video store simply no plot worth mentioning i only watched it 5 minutes ago and already i have forgotten annoying characters played poorly by two bit actors and if this was suppose a comedy i am still waiting to laugh in fact the only laugh we got out of the movie was that we joked with each other that we agreed it was truly awful br br put simply this movie was quite utterly pathetic and i warn others to not waste their time a travesty of the national lampoon name rating 0 10
<START> i loved the original i watch it every year but the second is a piece of garbage and it never should have been made the second could have worked if there was a different location the son was not an original or didn't even act like one of eddie's kids third was too smart for eddie which downplayed his father role none of the other kids where in it it just could of been a lot better i don't know why they even tried to make this movie there was no from the first movie i will pretend that this one doesn't even exist it is sad that the actors didn't even see that they where made fools of a really bad movie i just think that i wasted an hour or more on a bad movie and i really love all of the national lampoon films
<START> what alice found was a pleasant discovery as written and directed by a dean bell this is combination of a road movie with a cautionary tale as well as a voyage of discovery br br if you haven't seen the film maybe you should stop reading here br br alice is a case study of a young woman that wants to break away from the unhappy life she leads in a new england town her pretext for leaving is going to join her best friend who is away studying at a miami university alice is the product of a single mother's home one that is struggling to make ends meet in sharp contrast with the life of ease her friend seems to inhabit in flashbacks we get to see alice's life before going on the road br br alice like her namesake in alice in wonderland embarks in a trip to the unknown that life hasn't prepared her for the highways of america are full of predators in search of the weak and innocent alice meets with disaster when her car breaks down the road and a friendly southern couple come to her assistance when a strange man approaches in the darkness with the excuse he wants to help her sandra and bill convince her to come along in their plush r v on her way down south br br nothing has prepared alice for what this couple turns out to be after all in her sheltered life she hasn't dealt with what sandra and bill her new benefactors do during the overnight stays at the rest stops in the american highways it comes as a shock to her the realization that the kind sandra is nothing but a prostitute that plies her trade among the truck driving populace one meets in those places br br alice brilliantly played by emily grace is a study in how the young woman awakens to the new reality she can't escape in fact sandra makes it seem so easy that alice tries her luck at the oldest profession on earth in order to raise some badly needed money br br judith gives a tremendous performance as sandra ms is perfect as the seemingly normal woman one wouldn't suspect she is doing the nasty with clients she and bill find along the route they travel ms is amazing when she reveals the truth about her life to an accusing alice as the husband bill raymond is good in his portrayal as the husband that in reality is a procurer br br under the excellent direction of mr dean bell the film is not afraid to go to places mainstream films dare not to go congratulations to this director who has written a plausible story and has gathered the perfect cast to play it for our benefit
<START> this was an interesting movie i could have done without the bathroom scene and the seduction scene ewwww other than that i loved the head banging music this movie revolved around chris parents are awesome they totally support their sons interests and believe in him enough to support him now that is awesome what really surprised me was the chris's realization at the end it was not quite the hollywood ending on his road to self discovery the overall rise to stardom and the fall of it was quite a roller coaster ride
<START> i felt compelled to give some feedback on this movie that i rented from blockbuster this movie has it all comedy drama crime suspense and realism br br this movie also had a lot of action with just the right amount of humor i will definitely watch it again there were some funny parts as well as action packed drama i enjoy movies that keep you wondering what's going to happen next br br the writer director travis should make more movies in my overall opinion this movie was great i'm looking forward to his next one travis has real talent as a writer and director
<START> in what attempts to be a positive story dolph lundgren leads a group of mercenaries to take over a tropical island that looks a lot like paradise so that the men who hired his team can mine it for bird droppings actually the gas that exudes from the muck on this island is what they are after br br there was only one good thing about this movie the island location in which it was filmed was beautiful otherwise the story drowns itself leaving the actors with nothing to work with result a lot of violence a lot of language lots of blood and a few shots of women topless if you want pointless violence sorry the storyline can't even give the violence a point though it tries then this is the movie for you br br parents be warned that this movie is full of violence and blood driving the r rating
<START> i have just caught this movie on tcm and can understand why george murphy went into politics if this was the best mgm could serve up to him it is so slow moving that the attempt to make it a real film noir effort does not come off it featured two of my favourite br br players in eve arden completely wasted and dean stockwell the best actor in the film but what really hit me was that the leading lady frances gifford went through some 90 minutes it seemed longer without changing the expression on her face her fainting scene was comical john hodiak played his role ok but the script let him and the rest of the cast down very badly i gave it 4 stars mainly because of the photography it would have been on the first half of the program when double features were the go
<START> once manos the hands of fate that was worse than this quite a bit worse but it did have one thing it had beautiful women in wresting each other for about 20 minutes this has a fat 45 year old with 3 tits and a tail in a cantina scene cloned directly from star wars not to mention an obese blue seductress uhura her fat legs and ass hanging out of some sort of insane bird costume in this method acting mess she always wanted to perform before a captive audience she must have meant the poor slobs who shelled out 8 bucks hoping to see another wrath of khan or at least a voyage home captive is right i wonder how many people in the theaters tried to slit their wrists while crying out mother make it stop br br no question about it final frontier is not just an unmitigated disaster it's cruel and unusual punishment this is star trek from hell this is shatner on mushrooms or maybe peyote this is where no man has gone before and wished he never had in the first place or to paraphrase a review of heaven's gate it's as if gene roddenberry sold his soul to the devil for the success of a tv series and devil is just now coming around to collect br br and don't even get me started on a drunken kirk and a grinning mccoy singing row row row your boat together like they were lovers in some sort of demented gay fever dream then we've got the hideous dynamic duo of sulu and chekov hiking through the woods together probably en route to a barry manilow concert then there's laurence as spock's brother yeah right amazing how these relations we never heard of suddenly crawl out of the woodwork when we need a new plot line and not to forget spock rocketing through the air after kirk when he falls from a cliff in yosemite sure he catches up to kirk and saves him one foot away from the ground where'd you get those nifty rocket shoes spock
