<START> this film marked the end of the serious universal monsters era abbott and costello meet up with the monsters later in abbott and costello meet it was a somewhat desparate yet fun attempt to revive the classic monsters of the wolf man frankenstein's monster and dracula one last time br br i say desparate because in the previous film house of frankenstein both dracula and the wolf man are killed according to how the vampire and werewolf legends say they should be dracula by the sunlight and the wolf man by a silver bullet yet somehow they return in house of dracula with no explanation this movie could have played as a kind of prequel to house of frankenstein if the frankenstein monster plot wouldn't be continuing chronologically into house of dracula from house of frankenstein and if the wolf man didn't get cured then there'd be no plot holes but since this is not the case the plots of dracula and the wolf man make no sense br br however ignoring these plot holes house of dracula is a classic atmospheric horror film that's fun to watch it has many high points especially seeing the wolf man get cured i know i just said that this shouldn't have been included but it was nice to actually see him get cured after all this time and the scene with the lady playing moonlight on the piano then all of a sudden playing a haunting melody when under dracula's spell was very eerie dr transformation into the dr mr hyde type character was also done very well br br and it's great to see dracula frankenstein and the wolf man together one last time br br out of
<START> what a clunker br br it must have been made for tv or cable br br look forget the screenplay forget the bunch of forgettable actors excuse me continuity the nsa whatever or whoever he is an agent takes off in an f16 is shown in an chucking his guts up and later the aircraft shown is an phantom oooh wish that i could be so cavalier br br apart from the male actors the women are wasps blue eyed and long legged and eventually get to cry about the heroes who save them even when a solid weld could save most of the cosmo astro the blond drops the welding tool duh br br as an sf movie one out of ten as a movie per se 1 2 that's a half point they should have ditched the space station and headed for mars br br major raspberries
<START> sometimes you just have to have patients when watching indie horror if you can just toe tap your way through the slow paced early scenes sometimes a real gem will present itself this unfortunately was not the case with satan's whip br br written and directed by jason satan's whip attempts to drag us along on a boring snore fest of a film with no real pay off at the end i'm guessing that the black white and blue cinematography must have been for a reason however it is never explained why the majority of the blood is blue and i found this increasingly annoying as the film went on the story in itself is not that bad and actually had some originality and decent content but the acting is simply pathetic this combined with the slow pacing and lack of any real red gore made satan's whip one to forget quite quickly i will give it a 4 rating for some witty dialog that made me chuckle but alas that could not save this boring waste of my time
<START> even if i had not read anne rice's queen of the damned from the vampire chronicles i probably would still have thought this movie was just awful br br it was tasteless plot less it made absolutely no sense at all i sat for a while pondering the plot from the book and the longer i thought of it the worse it was to associate it in any way with the prior chronicles film is ridiculous as it is ridiculously inconsistent with that movie let alone the book the bare few ideas taken from rice's genius in the vampire chronicles were butchered and ridiculed br br it is an absolute insult to anne rice fans everywhere and such a pathetic excuse for a legacy in being last film truly it's an insult to aaliyah fans as well br br possibly the only compliment can be paid to the sound effects as well as some of the graphics good as they may be it is still not at all enough to make me regret the time spent watching this movie as a matter of fact i signed up for this membership for the sole reason of communicating to people bothering to look at this film 7 years after the release as it may be to not waste their time or expect much beyond disappointment
<START> i wish i had something more positive to say about devil fish but i honestly can't seem to come up with much i can't even come up with many of those so bad it's good kind of moments devil fish is just plain old bad the plot is completely derivative jaws anyone the acting is wooden the characters are uninteresting the special effects are beyond bad and the score is annoying add to that the seemingly inept direction of lamberto bava and you've got one stinker of a movie i think however that the film's biggest sin is its lack of a budget it doesn't appear that bava had much to work with by 1984 the italian film industry was in full decline Â especially as far as genre films go the funding available to bava was most probably very meager film's like devil fish that rely on special effects just never had a chance to be good it's not the only italian film to suffer this fate there are a number of italian movies made in the mid 80s whose ideas and concepts far exceeded what anyone could realistically have expected given their budgetary limitations br br however having said all that and noting the film's many weaknesses i can't bring myself to rate devil fish lower than a 3 10 i've even considered rating it higher but can't because i realize how bad a movie it is why don't i rate it lower well that's hard to explain despite the many problems found in the movie there's something about devil fish that i inexplicably enjoy it could be as simple as my love for low budget cheesy italian movies maybe my taste in movies is horribly skewed but i enjoy what i enjoy br br the mystery science theater 3000 treatment of devil fish is actually very enjoyable i rate devil fish a 4 5 on my mst3k rating scale the guys do a fine job of poking fun at the movie's many flaws one very astute observation comes very early in the commentary when tom servo notes just because you can edit doesn't mean you should Â highlighting yet another of the many weaknesses to be found in devil fish
<START> look this film is terrible the plot involves twins who are neglected by their self absorbed parents and left in the care of a succession of and babysitters all of whom the children drive away by being completely obnoxious eventually the kids engineer ex convict beverly d'angelo to be their new nanny do you care why and d'angelo watches a tv talk show about selling children and decides she will try to sell the twins and well oh you don't want to know it's all very unpleasant and not at all funny in fact the announcer slated this film before it came on the tv channel i was watching just don't bother wasting a single moment of your life on this pile of complete trash
<START> it is clear this film's value far supersedes the cost with which the format mini dv implies in fact the filmmaker embraces the format and incorporates it so craftily into the storyline that i forgot the fact that i was not seeing the typical 35 millimeter film it has the core appeal of indie movies like clerks the work of robert rodriguez combined with a fantastic new take on the romantic comedy genre this is not a film is an honest film with honest portrayals and it is a superbly paced narrative there is not one point in this film where i felt a scene could have or should have been omitted on the contrary the director pulls amazing performances out of truly gifted actors and does so in extremely confining circumstances from page to screen this film is a worthy and relevant story that hits on so many levels creative technical or otherwise i highly recommend it for all who enjoy cinema or those looking for a little charm in an otherwise devoid of charm medium
<START> i remember when they made a big deal about this when it was coming out they showed clips every week on wwf tv and everyone was excited it debuted opening weekend at number two behind indiana jones and the last crusade then it did a nosedive critics hated this film i don't remember seeing one good review everyone agreed it was bad and sometimes grotesque i didn't know they meant back then but now i do since the movie makes references to gay bars women getting slapped hard and nearly raped and a disgusting looking bar restroom with overflowing lol when i was younger i didnt care for that it was brother br br now i find this pretty bad but still fun to watch once in a while when its paired with which has a better storyline first off hulk hogan's acting skills just aren't great he is one dimensional like the character he plays in the wrestling ring and actually rip and hulk are not to far off from each other kurt fuller is a good actor but he is not good at playing the bad guy he is better at comedy and nervous drama characters he is just not believable as there isn't much character development in this film and the ones that suffer are the characters of randy brother and charlie the trainer in wrestling its unheard of a trainer a wrestler to the ring lol tiny lister plays zeus the way its supposed to be played so there isnt any problem there joan is passable and for all you softcore hounds she does have a lingerie scene lol by the end you figure what's the point br br for this one as with other wrestling films or films that feature wrestlers as the main star turn your brain off you'll enjoy it more if you do
<START> i love this movie one of my all time favorites ann blythe as sally is sweet and trouble free she believes that praying to saint anne will solve all her and her friends troubles the sub plot of the dastardly bad man to get her father's property is funny and clever her brothers are what kind of brothers any girl would love to have also look for aunt bee as her mother a strong irish woman who won't leave her house that she brought her family up in they don't make them like this anymore that's for sure
<START> i enjoyed this film immensely i'm really into films where females kick lots of butt so this film already had my hopes up for some decent entertainment my hopes were met and exceeded less than 20 minutes into the film the action humor and wit this film contained easily made it one of my favorite films of all time it had sam jackson and his undeniable screen presence geena davis as i've never seen her before demanding your respect and flat out taking it even if you don't want to give it br br geena plays samantha caine an amnesiac desperate to remember something about her past but quickly realizing the more she finds out the more she wants to forget and eventually becomes consumed until finally samantha is so more and charly is all that's left but now can charly and sam two completely different women possibly exist in the same body we have characters that pop in and out of the film that nurture each side of sam charly like sam jackson and craig bierko craig is also irresistible as timothy the sexy bad guy with no conscience br br this film was perfectly casted and perfectly acted over the top and wonderfully entertaining you watch the impossible happen and applaud when it does so worth your time watch it you won't be sorry
<START> warning contains spoilers br br this is one of the best italian sleaze films i've seen br br the plot has a teenage girl who is interested of occultism and has supernatural powers her mother is a member of satanist group and is afraid what influences it'll have on the girl no need to worry the girl knows just what to do and there's no return she belongs to satan br br during the film odd things happen in typical italo way there's not too much logic but that's only good thing it's amazing how entertaining these films are on the final battle we see her and her mother fighting each other nude off course and doing some mysterious rituals you might guess who wins the films final pictures leaves your mouth open and wandering why can't there be more films like this br br there's superb music through the whole film and the actors are quite good better than usual in these type of films specially anne heywood looks and acts good it also has some unusual camera angles and stuff like that so it's not boring at all my rating is 10 br br hopefully someone releases this on dvd
<START> the beginning of the movie was confusing and the rest of it was predictable it was just one of those movies that i came across in my netflix instant queue and i thought it would be interesting to see brad and bijou phillips team up together again since bully unfortunately interesting never happened in this movie swain plays an invisible girl at a private school whose best friend is rich and does anything she wants at any time phillips but swain likes one of the boys from the in crowd and eventually starts hanging with them and of course like all other movies things are good or so you assume since the movie never hints on that things are good and then things become not so good by hanging with the rich kids br br the problem with the movie is that there are absolutely no peaks and valleys it is just a dead lifeless movie that after you've watched it you feel you could have done anything better some scenes the ones with parents don't even make sense as to being in the movie because the director and writer didn't follow up on it at all br br all the interesting things that could have played out was just completely ignore and this is almost like watching a before they were stars episode mischa barton and rachel bison from the oc br br the only shining light in this movie and the reason it doesn't get a one rating from me is phillips they needed more scenes with her in it just look like he brought over a bit of his character from bully and for pete's sake the title is bs change the name
<START> two great stars and a legendary director created a magnificent throbbing love story that is memorable and moving on so many levels br br henry king directed jennifer jones in her first hit song of bernadette and he again directs jennifer jones in this film and miss jones is perfect in this role and gives a edgy beautiful performance that captures the conflict in the character and bill holden who hit home run after home run in the with a series of smash hit films beginning with sunset blvd stalag 17 born yesterday country girl picnic and of course river kwai is superb in this role hard to imagine anyone but holden in this movie i loved the ending and cry every time i see it for anyone who has ever loved and lost you will understand for those who haven't you won't
<START> i've loved this movie since i was a little kid i remember the night my mother brought this movie home for me i loved it and i still do i think it's very funny and original there are also some very catchy tunes in this movie lou is also a surprisingly good singer the actors that portray prince arthur and princess eloise are okay too but abbott and costello are the best former heavyweight boxing sensation buddy baer also brother of former heavyweight champion max baer is good in this movie as the cop and the giant he's a better actor than boxer he had a natural talent the beginning of this movie is hilarious how lou costello keeps crashing the car and how he gets into trouble with buddy baer the slapstick in the house is good too i especially like the comedy in the castle my favorite parts are the part were lou is climbing the and they're all singing as a farewell jack is singing back to them that he'll return lou costello is a very good at singing my other favorite part is the part when jack is fighting with the giant i like when jack makes exploding eggs and when he tries to make the giant an omelet they keep exploding abbott and costello are hilarious and the greatest comedians of all time this is only one of their great movies that i will love and cherish the reviews for this movie aren't very good and i can't understand why this is a very good abbott and costello movie i also love how lou costello comes back to reality in the end and thinks he's back in the dream when bud hits him he starts singing his song and leaves with an attitude like no one is going to push me around very good movie
<START> i was lucky enough to see this at this years tribeca film festival i was stunned by how well made and how entertaining this wonderful little film was director griffin dunne has done a great job assembling this film that has several characters and several story lines that blend so smoothly and seamlessly the main story involves the family and it is very thought provoking and entertaining story that involved the viewer in every scene the film as a whole has credibility and integrity yet still has that commercial edge an indie movie for the masses if you like the performances by the cast are all excellent but it is diane lane who shines the brightest diane lane is simply sensational in this wonderful film and should be oscar nominated early days i know but lane acts her socks off here
