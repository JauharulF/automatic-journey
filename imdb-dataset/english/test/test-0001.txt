<START> let me first start out by saying 1 out of 10 is too good for this movie it's unfortunate that imdb doesn't have tenths of a star i watched this abortion of a movie in the middle of the night due to insomnia and it was absolute garbage the plot was horrible the acting was horrible the movie was utterly boring looked like the shadow with alec baldwin the shadow is infinitely better than this as well the character eve was so undeveloped and 2 dimensional she didn't even grab my attention i didn't even know her name was eve don was interesting when he kept his mouth shut the twist if you can call it that was laughable and pathetic when it came the movie had done such a horrid job of building suspense or attachment to any character that i simply thought who gives a s the only thing that made me even lift an eyebrow about this movie was the fact the med teacher was dyson in terminator 2 also a movie that was light years ahead of this motion picture massacre anyone who was involved in this movie should be ashamed of themselves for wasting 90 minutes of countless people's time it's no wonder no actor from this movie ever had a fruitful career in summary this movie is so bad i feel dirty and need a shower worst movie in history gigli was better prom night the remake was better and dare i say it saw iv was better

<START> i was really geared up to watch when two of best movie critics tagged this movie as a 'laugh but the movie turned out be disappointing br br you will be advised to watch this movie keeping your brains at home but you simply can't ignore the flaws and the shortcomings br br 1 the missile scene was total stupidity br br 2 katrina kaif and govinda pair looked awful he's 49 and she's just 24 more than double of her age 3 salman's comedy is less of acting and more of overacting br br 4 songs are good but interrupts the pace of the movie br br 5 some scenes were deliberately attempted by the movie makers to be funny and 6 poor and flawed story br br however there are few pluses 1 govinda great individual performance br br 2 some scenes are actually quite funny br br 3 kaif looks and acting keeps on improving with every film br br 4 rajpal yadav's don sequences though under utilized but hilarious br br so 4 good points 6 bad ones this one gets 4 10
<START> right so you have a dam tons of water that seems to flow really really slowly and a small town that happens to be right underneath the path of destruction throw in a profiteering glutton an apparently mentally unstable and disgruntled architect and his son and then to spice things up you add a weak plot and bad acting all in all when you have a look at this film from a paying customers point of view i would feel extremely peeved off if this was a pay per view film if you want a laugh then you really need to watch this film
<START> this film was one that i have waited to see for some time i was glad to find it has been everything anticipated the writing of this film has been so finely crafted and researched far beyond what is seen by the audience i found it amusing that so many people watching will not read between some very important lines but indeed if not the movie will make sense in a different way and is very brilliant the film has many stories and characters woven together around this one character kilo a man whom has rose from the streets amidst many woes and become a very powerful criminal after spending some time in prison kilo finds a loophole in the justice system and through a disturbing turn of events is released only to find everything is not at all what it seems kilo finds himself going up against the higher realm of society and political royalty in order to make clear how important a man's word is and stands for a war begins as the street is in arms against lords of wealth and corrupt power br br a build up to explosive and powerful non stop twists and turns this film will leave you riveted i found the cast of this movie to be outstanding and is not a movie to be ignored excellent go rent it today
<START> this is one of my favourite disney films it has everything you could hope for in a disney animation cute animals great songs a nasty villain and lots of adventure the story begins in paris where duchess and her three kittens live with their mistress in a mansion life is perfect for them until the fiendish butler edgar discovers that she plans to leave her entire fortune to the cats he realises that if he even stands a chance of claiming the fortune the cats will be out of the way an excellent often forgotten masterpiece from the 1970's a time when the disney studio made few animations which features songs such as the title number the aristocats as well as wants to be a cat this will enchant viewers young and old with its enduring
<START> how managed to avoid attention remains a mystery a potent mix of comedy and crime this one takes chances where tarantino plays it safe with the hollywood formula the risks don't always pay off one character in one sequence comes off inappropriately silly and falls flat in the lead role thomas jane gives a wonderful and complex performance and two brief appearances by mickey rourke hint at the high potential of this much under and mis used actor here's a director one should keep one's eye on
<START> eric ability to roll from character to character in this 'one man show' exhibits his true range as a character actor each persona has their own message to convey about truth society class drugs etc this is an absolute must have for anyone who is a serious fan of acting his performance contains some of the most hilarious and real moments i have ever experienced as a viewing audience
<START> welsh poet dylan thomas excused from serving in active duty is doing his bit for the war effort producing bits of prose for some propaganda branch of government in whitehall br br thomas is portrayed as a believing in free love married to a woman with an equally demanding artistic streak and likewise with a penchant for extramarital romance thomas writing and reciting his poetry in systematic domestic mayhem throughout becomes somewhat priggish towards the end resting somewhat uncomfortably on his society connections and pulling rank on a war veteran who had shot up his house and who was incidentally married to the woman he had been having an affair with br br the real story of this film is the love of two women one keira knightley whose first love was thomas matthew rhys the second sienna miller who is thomas's wife at times it reminds of the singing detective as in very good television with slightly sinister overtones laid on top of scenes of surreal camp absurdity
<START> i'm not sure why this film is averaging so low on imdb when it's absolutely everything you could ever want in a horror film this is the definition of being a horror film i consider myself to be a big horror fan and i must say that this house delivers the goods house of wax is the story of a group of college kids on their way to a football game whom decide to camp out for the night and have a run in with a local weirdo upon waking the next morning they make a gruesome discovery and decide to go into town for a broken car part the town is creepy and i'm just gonna stop there because thats when the truly gruesome mayhem begins trust me when i say if your looking for a horror film go see this you will love it it's wonderfully diabolical and inventive with it's killing scenes the story is interesting and the characters are decently drawn with the actors giving them gobs of personality paris hilton included whom does quite well with her part the film lies a little on the shallow side but it's so much fun and who cares this movie should eat up the box office and all horror fans should have part in it go see house of wax the film that features skin being peeled super glued lips dead animal carcasses hot wax sprayed on a still living person a finger being cut off a decapitation a pole through the head and much more i was lucky enough to witness this film at the tribeca premiere and all the actors were on hand to promote the film and boy do they have something to be proud of house of wax is the scariest roller ride of the year 9 10
<START> i had read online reviews praising this obscure outing as a combination of gory horror quirky black comedy and borderline art house the film has elements of all three to be sure but they are at the service of such a supremely silly premise the title immediately gives the game away Â and amateurish production to boot Â that its long term neglect due to a lack of proper distribution Â basically until cult epics picked it up for dvd release a full 30 years after its inception Â was no great loss to cinema or even the genre s the bed was apparently created for the purpose of accommodating a demon's dalliance with a woman anyway a dying man who had made use of the four poster and even painted it ends up trapped in the wall behind the canvas and provides intermittent commentary to the 'action' several people from teenagers on a fling to gangsters in hiding supply fodder to the hungry bed latest on the menu are a trio of girls Â one of whom however recalls its mistress of long ago and consequently the bed seemingly fears her seeing various objects Â from cigars to pieces of fried chicken Â and people getting swallowed up the belly of the bed is depicted as a vat of honey colored liquid makes the film mildly amusing at times especially when a young man's hands are reduced to their skeletal formation which he seems to take rather too easily in his stride but also awfully that at even a brief 77 minutes the whole pointless exercise feels strained and downright desperate
<START> wicked little things was a really good movie i will say at some parts it seemed really unbelievable and others it seemed as if there just wasn't enough thought put into the actions of the characters but overall it was exciting and entertaining i don't understand why this movie's rating is so low nor do i not understand why all the horrorfest film's ratings are so low these are b movies people and nothing more they provide great entertainment and most of them don't have many flaws at all this is definitely worth a look because you won't be disappointed with the outcome wicked little things is one of the best 1st annual horrorfest films and compared to a lot of other films in the series this is one of the best overall
<START> due to a very misleading advertising campaign i saw this film in theatres at the relatively young age of 10 the trailers on tv portrayed the film as a comedy and i bugged my parents until they took me after seeing the movie i was blown away i had no idea what to think totally different than anything i had seen before leaving far to many questions for such a young mind needless to say i loved it this morning was the first time i'd watched in in probably 2 3 years and i still think it's one of the greatest films made in the last decade kevin spacey and jeff bridges are both in top form as a mysterious man who may or may not be from another planet and the psychiatrist that develops a bond with him while trying to decipher his mystery the supporting cast are near perfect as well each resident of the mental institution is incredibly convincing in their own way the open ending was handled very well giving lots of evidence to support whatever you believe happened in the end how this movie failed to receive at least a nomination in that year's oscars is beyond me if you haven't seen this film run to wal mart right now the dvd is usually in the bargain bin pick it up br br 9 5 10
<START> the back of the dvd for this movie raves is the quentin tarantino of christian films this isn't so much an insult to quentin as it is to christian films this film is poorly written stiffly acted and edited with a purposeless intensity the scenes play out in a confusing and unrealistic way and are interspersed with some nice time lapse photography flashbacks fades to grey freeze frames to tell the time unimportant in the story are all done with out any apparent reason other than to give the movie more cinematic credibility the camera is haphazard some nice crane shots are cut with ridiculous montages that have no significance poor blocking and lighting leave the viewer wondering who is talking to who in many scenes oh and the audio is terrible the special effects were decent and thankfully limited but this is all just technical the movie fails to engage on an emotional level the dialogue is so fake sounding and the actors seem to have only read it a moment before the camera was rolling the story the things that happen in sequence have no motivation behind them the characters are struggling to take hold of one dimensionality and the characters have to make a stance on christianity and faith in every single scene take a queue from m night engaging christian films don't have to have the characters saying the name of jesus christ in every scene for the movie to be christian goodness please don't try to show this to your unsaved friends with any expectations other than laughter
