<START> i can't remember the worst film i have watched total waste of actors and audience time if you prefer sitting by your tv and think when will be this film over then this is the right film for you maybe this film is recorded to make people believe that moscow has some mystique past but i must say i have not expect anything else from rade serbedzija but i have expected more from vincent gallo the film lacks a plot character development denouement entire movie is about underground tunnels and how they are mystique i must be fair there is some camera effect but even that is too poor over and over are the same pictures total waste of time
<START> there's a certain irony in a parody of the gothic genre being turned into a mess of clichÃ©s by filmmakers who either had no idea what the story's purpose was or just didn't care all of the hallmarks of your average family film are present rambunctious younger siblings a grumpy teenager who doesn't want to move unsympathetic parents who are unable to see the apparition and of course a romantic subplot the movie has very little in common with wilde's original story which was largely written to poke fun at the melodramatic gothic novellas that were all the rage at the time if wilde saw this version he'd probably laugh and then of course write a parody one can only hope that the children who watched this bland mass produced pap eventually discovered the wit and sparkle of the original version
<START> the whole world is falling prey to a lethal disease and rain never stops pouring down nevertheless in this atmosphere of nightmare a man and a woman discover that they are neighbors thanks to a hole in the floor of the man's apartment they fall in love at least all would not have been lost although this wonderful film expresses the loneliness and the weakness of human being there is also some room for hope in the shiny singing scenes
<START> awful in a bad good way this movie has officially become the worst made for tv movie in my book except for the camp value it offers i give it a 1 in quality and a 10 for the camp value suggestion watch with friends champagne and plenty of popcorn you'll want to throw some at the screen preferably friends who like chris noth from his 'sex in the city days' this movie is dreadfully funny this is definitely the lowest point in the careers of all cast members honestly i don't know how they controlled the laughter as the lines were delivered daniel j is absolutely pathetic everyone participated in the school of over acting and poor joan van ark i believe she was the only one taking this theater of the absurd seriously she is credited as a producer though her mom jeans and bad plastic surgery are scene this movie also crosses the oh so delicate line of social incorrectness when they introduce a mentally challenged character into the plot this is an obscure movie showing on lifetime listed as with harmful intent has anyone else had the pleasure
<START> 29 sept 1990 marked a small but important milestone in my appreciation of horror flicks this was the date that bbc1 broadcast for the only time i'm aware of jeff super creepy 1981 shocker just before dawn and it made a huge impression on me nearly twenty years later i'm delighted to report that i've finally got my hands on the two disc shriek show media blasters special edition and it's just as eerie and unsettling as i remember it if not more so br br the plot as is usual for genre flicks and this was first film as a for though he did at least remove all the religious cult snake handling mumbo jumbo from the screenplay is a bit thin five likable twenty somethings including chris lemmon son of jack in a pair of uncomfortably tight white strides venture into the dense oregon woodlands to do a spot of camping and to check out a patch of land that's been bequeathed to one of their number but just before dawn stands out from a crowd of imitators because wastes no time in showing us just how deranged things are on this particular patch of mountain with a complete innocent skewered and a drunk preacher's truck shoved down a hill and engulfed in flames within minutes of the film beginning the youngsters come rolling into the picture in a snappy blondie's 'heart of glass' pounding on the soundtrack and before you can say texas chainsaw massacre they've clobbered an innocent deer with the front bumper and had their first taste of from the heavy set maniac responsible for the opening catastrophes forest ranger roy george kennedy warns them that things are likely to go awry if they go any further but they go ahead with the trip anyway refusing to give the sozzled preacher a ride even though he's understandably scared witless and finally pitching camp miles from anywhere needless to say things go downhill from here br br although this film's not short on bloody horror and well handled action scenes the standout moments for me are those where lets his camera zoom out long and slow from apparently innocuous shots of the fun loving kids larking around in the wilderness or just lets it settle for a while on the dense imposing people dwarfing woodlands he makes the oregon exteriors as threatening and as ominous as kubrick made the overlook hotel's spacious interiors in the shining and brad score discounting the horribly distorted racket that runs over the titles stays the right side of intrusive underscoring the slowly escalating menace with subtlety and flair there are plenty of surprises along the way nods to deliverance with the discovery of a backwoods babe and her freaky disturbing family and a truly bizarre kill technique deployed shortly before the film's end i won't spoil it for you i've said enough br br quite why this undervalued horror gem fell through the cracks and became a cult item instead of a breakout hit is hard to ascertain but hopefully it will be rediscovered and appreciated for years to come it deserves to be
<START> boogie nights is a masterpiece it tells a great story with flair an great direction from a very talented director this film features a cast which turn in outstanding performances though the subject matter is very controversial but it is handled with great care by very talented people this movie has an unexpected emotional impact also you will remember it long after it is over
<START> all right i'll grant you that some of the science in doppelganger or journey to the far side of the sun is kind of dopey the idea of an entire planet existing undetected because we can't see it on the other side of our sun doesn't hold up at all any astronomy 101 student knows that another planet the size of earth would cause gravitational in the motions of other planets that's how astronomers deduced the existence of pluto after all and that's how they find and asteroids and moons on a regular basis br br and the idea that a mirror image earth somehow evolved in almost perfect parallel to our earth down to english speaking scientists and human counterparts for each human born on our earth that takes things out of science' fiction and into twilight zone territory that's not necessarily a bad thing but it requires a major suspension of critical thinking to accept and enjoy br br but man this movie knocked my socks off as an adolescent i was still used to fairly cheerful upbeat science fiction films when the hero won through in the end even 2001 could be interpreted as having an ending br br but in this case thinnes attempted to dock with his orbiting so he could return to his own earth only to be bounced back out of his docking berth something about 'the not being reversed because his wasn't doing the same thing apparently thinnes' had decided he was happy in his new home thinnes' ship started the descent back to the launch site and i was certain that he would somehow get the damaged craft to land safely and try again armed with the new info that would let him and his backers succeed he was the hero after all and the hero always wins through in the end br br instead thinnes couldn't maintain control of the crippled craft and the ship's subsequent crash into the launch site was so horrible and devastating that it killed everyone except for the chief project leader and destroyed all records of the project and thinnes' existence thinnes never got to go home and he perished uselessly his secrets never revealed br br except for the planet of the apes series i had never seen such a sad and downbeat ending and it always stuck in my mind especially the ferocious devastation of the crash scene near the beginning of the move you knew that spaceship was never going to fly again and the one at the very end br br i'd love to see this movie again and see how well it held up over the years
<START> first off this movie is not near complete my guess is that someone actually bothered to steal every other page of the script br br the movie contains bizarre time travels without notice inconsistent dialogs misplaced details all over the music isn't very bad at all other then misplaced tracks and besides the fact that the volume goes up and down between the different tracks the cutting room did a descent job actually and that says a lot sound effects ruin the tension though br br luke perry does what he does best just looking worried and occasionally coughing up punchlines from hell br br i seriously rate this movie as the worst of 2007 and i've seen a few bad ones do not spend money on this one it's not so bad it's a laugh it's worse ratings above 1 star should render a blacklist at imdb because it's a damn lie
<START> unlike what one reviewer said this is not a ripoff of magnum force in that one lieutenant hal holbrook put together his own little squad from academy rookies to dispatch repeat offenders in extreme justice this operation has the sanction from the higher ups of the lapd just how far they sanction the exact methods used is open to question br br this special investigations squad seems to be quite the haven for the misfits of the lapd those that have forgotten their first duty is protection and service which is why scott glenn thinks lou diamond phillips a detective with more than his share of beefs with internal affairs for excessive use of force is perfect for the squad br br what should have sent him running from phillips is the fact he's got a nice live in relationship with a reporter chelsea field that one certainly threw me in this film you'd think that lou would be the last guy he'd try to recruit for his team br br and what his team is is a death squad they target perpetrators follow them and wait to catch them in the act then it's open season br br extreme justice went very overboard in trying to make a point there sure would have been no harm in waiting for a gang of bank robbers to finish the robbery and taking them down outside no civilians got hurt when the citizens of did that to the or waiting until three rapists finish the job before moving in that's what were asked to believe here br br and frankly i couldn't buy it a lot of good players get really wasted in this one
<START> unlike most of the reviewers of this particular movie i'm really not the much of a cynthia rothrock fan to say the least however when i saw that the movie had fred williamson and robert forster both great actors i just had to watch the film williamson is a dakota smith an alcoholic cop who is to scrubbing toilets with a toothbrush and even worse having to team up with cynthia at the behest of the captain robert forster forster is always watchable it's just a crying shame that the movie itself is so damn trite and clichÃ©d it also features one of the least terrifying villains ever to be committed to celluloid williamson would return to the dakota character in a few more films the next one being down n dirty br br eye candy nina richardson shows some t a mary goes topless br br my grade d br br where i saw it showtime extreme
<START> bad bad bad those three lines sum up this crappy little film that can only attract idiot children and their parents to the cinema and its 1 movie in america what is this country thinking mike myers looking more like micheal jackson some chineese lady that falls asleep within 3 minutes a lame plot with dirty jokes it's grotesuque and awful when green eggs and ham comes out in 2005 i'll be so happy not eddie murphy and tracy morgan will probably play two hipsters trying to find the lost green eggs and ham they'll try to chase sam i am and that mean guy who are running away with it i hope they don't ruin the classic book don't waste time and money by seeing this
<START> jacqueline hyde is a good quality film and does manage to be likable because of what it is everyone out there will like it sandwiched between the amount of breast shots the times jacqueline rubs herself the various times jackie spends chatting to herself and the times spent heaving in the mountains this could create one hell of a dishwasher if your career were to end br br unlike most horror movies that take place in space or in some restless tranquility with ripe green apples this one takes awhile to the performing is good other than great acting by dan the pizza delivery guy must see there are no standouts but no notably bad outcroppings from my recent dinner either and i do mean recent excellent acting overall because there are no typically dreadful actors which you'd find in movies of the four skin related data fields or in the biological found in any ibm shop in addition if you see a female in this movie the likelihood is that she will be butt naked by the next scene now that i think about it there is quite a bit of action in this movie between the first and the second electro yank obtained from a hot chick and the time you observe her buckets naked keeps em' speculating i loved it
<START> i don't know if i'm wrong or everybody that says this movie is good are sincerely i just wanna do a favor to people that has doubts about seeing it renting it or even worse buying it don't do it really br br the trailers and very early previews might seem fun in some way or another but its not funny at all it gets to fall in a series of you're supposed to laugh here scenes that tend to get in really bad jokes bad very very bad acting tasteless scenes cheesy effects this movie has it all all wrong that is br br as final comment the movie would have been funny due to the basic concept but believe me is really way far from that
<START> i think this is one of the best tamil movies i've seen in a while i love the fact that it doesn't revolve around a guy and girl falling in love and they made the movie brilliantly the cast did a great job and i especially congratulate the girl she was brilliant and really brought out the feeling of an adopted child searching for her real mother best of all are the songs beautiful music and moving lyrics there are some great songs in this move ya'll especially and great songs both of them i highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants to enjoy a good cry and some great acting and superb songs cheers
<START> christmas in connecticut is an absolute gem and a must see for christmas elizabeth lane a precursor to martha stewart is a magazine columnist and the ne plus ultra of the perfect wife mother and domestic goddess only thing is she is none of these things a total phony unfortunately for her she is about to be found out her publisher mr alexander yardley a brilliant comic turn by sydney greenstreet gets the bright idea of inviting a famous war hero to elizabeth's perfect farm for the christmas holiday only thing there is no farm perfect or otherwise the comedy involves how elizabeth is to keep her real identity under wraps so she will not lose her job elizabeth's colleague john happens to have a farm in connecticut so that solves that problem however he wants to marry liz but she does not want to marry him he offers her marriage though he knows she doesn't feel the same way about him that he does about her he makes the offer anyway and assures her that he is willing to wait and here barbara stanwyck as liz delivers one of the most devastating put downs i have ever heard with perfect innocence she replies could you wait that long ouch in addition the scenes between una o'conner and s z are hilarious they don't seem to like one another though one suspects they really do they are rivals in the household and s z mangled english is equaled by nora's strangled pronunciation of his name mr my name is felix it is amazing how christmas y these black and white films are great character work by all involved don't miss this one
