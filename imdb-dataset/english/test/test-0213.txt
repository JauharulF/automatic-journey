<START> this was one of the best movies you could find as a child i lived with the chipmunk adventure from 4 years old to 8 years old the story of this film was dave's going on a business trip to europe and sticks the boys with miss miller while playing an around the world in 80 days video game two villains klaus and claudia brother and sister round the chipmunks and into an adventure in which the kids must hot air balloon their way across the globe what they're unaware of is that the game is really a diamond smuggling ring and when found at the airport by the villains a chase ensues and which ends in klaus and claudia off to jail and alvin simon theodore brittany jeanette and eleanor safe with dave and miss miller but i am warning you now this is a musical and quite a damn good one at that most people hate musicals but i am not one of those people i frigging love musicals like rocky horror grease sound of music cats don't dance and just about anything except for my fair lady if you see this share with your kids if you got any
<START> a wonderful cast thrown into modern mystical romances for the intellectual grown ups yes they too need a love story to stir those hidden urges without the hollywood fluff this all under the masterful direction of antonioni and wenders who both love to pin his characters in exotic locations and have them dwarfed by the surroundings with long wide shots it is great to see that there is lust in the mid life crises sector
<START> i love movies all genres and from big dollar spectacles to small indie projects but even making allowance for this piece of junk being 25 years old and its attempt at homage to the 1950's it just suffers in almost aspect by which we judge films br br throughout the movie i was reminded of several student films i've had a chance to watch efforts where creativity is required to fill gaps where funds are needed br br all in all chances are there are much better uses for 90 minutes of your life br br 2 10
<START> going into this movie i was a bit cautious i have always been a bit iffy about claymation movies i've always enjoyed decent animated movies but claymation was always different to me but this one caught me by surprise wallace and gromit are extremely lovable characters and it's a great story with jokes for all ages there's the silly burp fart jokes for the kids and the subtle but over the head of young kids jokes for us older people very neat claymation and while the story had holes it kept my interest beginning to end br br it's so rare to find pure and humor these days this movie was all the more refreshing wallace and gromit go doing their normal thing which is exterminating humanely the that ruin people's vegetable crops but this time they find themselves fighting some form of a freak huge rabbit that their humanely built traps can't even keep under tabs great laughs and a great hour and a half of fun if you have not exposed yourself to wallace and gromit i highly recommend this movie br br the only reason i rate it a 7 and not higher is because it's still a family movie and i don't have kids i enjoyed it but if i had been watching it with some little rug rats and my wife it'd be at least a 9 for sure give it a shot
<START> relish every moment of this languorous spectacle with music to match 5th is gorgeous but listen to the vocal portion of the 3rd symphony so beautifully utilised in this film there are many aspects to this film but the main subject is the overpowering force of beauty its spontaneous nature absence of logic for love and adoration i am also an ardent fan of bogarde and believe he was rarely as wonderful try him in the servant however note i multiple viewings
<START> 1st watched 2 9 2008 4 out of 10 dir j s cardone sexual political thriller that doesn't really succeed in any of these areas very well except early on where there are some interesting soft core scenes the movie starts off portraying a couple exploring their sexual fantasies amidst their work environments or wherever and whatever suits their fancy the couple takes an excursion to a retreat and bathhouse where they run into a woman that's willing to be a part of a three some and fulfill some of their fantasies at this point we only know that this couple is well off but we don't know until they return that the fiancÃ© is part of a well to do political family the man hopes to be on the rise to the point of possibly getting a congressional seat after the marriage they then receive a package in the mail from an anonymous source with explicit pictures of their encounter at the bath house and their begins as to how and why they were filmed who sent the package what they want and how to clear their names before any of this gets out this becomes an obsession that leads them deeper into seedier worlds and takes a lot of their time to the point where their friends family wonder what they're doing all day and why they look rundown all the time this movie is interesting at times but drifts into ridiculousness as they personally seek out the problem instead of getting the police involved early on because of their pride this mistake of course keeps the movie going the performances are fine despite the no name cast but the lunacy of the situation overrides and the movie starts to become ho hum about Â½ the way through and of course they throw in a twist at the end that defies and challenges everything that happened prior as is the norm these days when they don't know what else to do to spice up the movie this doesn't help this movie one bit though
<START> i bought jack o a number of months ago at a blockbuster video sale and at the time i wasn't expecting anything outstanding from it upon watching it i realized i not only got less than i could have ever bargained for but a whole lot more as well it seems strange i know and it is but it's perfectly fitting when you consider that the utter weirdness that is jack o br br the movie follows a young boy named shawn kelly somehow thru ancestral ties he is marked for death at the hands of a demented scythe wielding pumpkin man this pumpkin man was killed by shawn's great grandfather uncle cousin etc and now that the villain has been resurrected shawn's death is apparently crucial to his hell bred mission of vengeance anyway much horror ensues as jack o hacks his way thru various neighbors before battling shawn to the finish br br i'm not so much here to discuss the plot as i am to determine who may find any worth in this movie i can honestly tell you that jack o is one of the most poorly made movies in the history of time the acting is deadpan except when it should be the script is apparently a 1st grade group project and the production budget must not have exceeded 150 some of the most laughable death scenes are carried out in this anti thriller and they're all the more humorous when you realize director steve actually seems serious in his movie making br br and yet i heartily enjoyed the film i can call it a terrible horror movie yes but i can also say i had a great time watching it with my friends and have watched it several times since that fateful first viewing many people including some of my friends will find this movie intolerable and needlessly time consuming and that's understandable if you're like me and enjoy ridiculously bad horror movies that take themselves seriously you'll find jack o an instant classic which is also understandable br br that's why it's so hard to rate this movie if i were rating jack quality as a film i wouldn't give it anything in fact the studio would owe me stars yet if i were rating it's on the basis of pure enjoyment i'd give it an 8 or a 9 i'll give it a 4 so to be somewhere in the middle i recommend everyone go out rent this and form their own conclusion
<START> i don't think it's necessary to outline the plot for you because the site and other users have done a superb job of that already that said here's my take this is by far the worst movie of 2005 and there have been some really really bad ones i don't even need to go into detail because there is nothing redeeming about this movie bad acting bad plot bad directing bad special effects you name it if it doesn't stand alone as the worst film ever made it's tied with some other piece of crap i'd be embarrassed to have my friends know i was in this movie but hey most people that are gonna see it will do so no matter what reviews it gets so more power to ya when you feel the gaping void between your neurons two hours into your evening don't blame me
<START> this film did well at the box office and the producers of this mess thought the stars had such good chemistry in this that they cast them in the much darker screwball farce the frankly i am shocked to see all the positive comments on this ludicrously plotted unfunny comedy both lead characters have the maturity of seven year olds and are much less interesting to spend time with a veteran supporting cast including fred clark harry morgan and eva gabor lend excellent support and the beautiful cinematography certainly makes the rich countryside of spain seem lush and there are four or five truly funny scenes to go with two wise scenes and a whole bunch of recycled and unfunny clutter br br i cannot recommend it started with a kiss
<START> if you like stupid jokes and a terribly predictable storyline then perhaps this movie is for you courtney thorne smith jack warden and several other members of the supporting cast actually have talent but it was completely stifled by the paper thin script this is a generally boring and joyless time waster of a movie
<START> i am afraid i will have to add my name to the long list of people who remain flabbergasted that this film has still not sept 2007 been issued on dvd it's one of those mysteries that makes the mind boggle especially when you consider the amount of dvd's available today containing material that should have been years ago still i have an excellent digital vhs copy in english with subtitles and stereo so my qualm is more one of principle than a frustration at not being able to view the film as to the film itself this is an excellent all rounder with good picture quality more than satisfactory soundtrack lively plot involving suspense emotion sadness frustration feeling good and exotic surroundings for a european how true the film fits in with the reality in burma i have no idea indeed that is less important the essential thing is that entertainment wise it is a success one soon becomes attached to each of the main characters and i admit to having my heart in my mouth during the final crossing the river scene it's a shame we hear so little about countries such as burma and this film at least gives some insight into the country has the situation changed since 1995 the events which are to occur later this month seem to answer this question with a resounding no and the regime in place seems to be as brutal as ever not even sparing the lives of monks let alone women or children
<START> what is worth mentioning that is omitted in the other reviews i have read here is the subtext of how the law shaped the lives and behaviour of gays in the era portrayed in the film while character is evidently gay he is not the only one the often talked about mr davenport scott is the other and the reason that he is never seen the reason alluded to that he has disappeared seems to be that he has been detained by the police for homosexual activity a criminal offense in england at the time br br we can read under the surface that this recent event has unsettled norman character and we can also see in a passing remark by the edward fox character the quick of any connection to such a person when the law is involved the fear of association affects many of the characters and is part of the portrait the film paints of a time and the people who inhabit it the abandonment of at the end by sir has been anticipated all the way through if this subtext is included it also makes sense of both the otherwise inexplicable omission of his dresser from the list of those he gives thanks to the flamboyance combined with the fear of exposure produces the combination of yearning and fear that has to 'step into the as he does when he makes the announcement about the imminent air raids a scene that would otherwise be gratuitous but that is both a symbolic and literal depiction of the man's inner torment br br so while the drama is of the decline of finney's sir a great deal of the tragedy of the film and play comes from the 'fatal of gayness and makes this a film about him as the title suggests br br the art direction pacing and cinematic style of this film seem to come from another time more distant than the eighties and in some ways even than the second world war the implicit portrait of a society still clinging to an older moral order and the sympathy of the character racked and ruined by the cruelties of that order of necessity trapped in the enclosed world of the theatre and the knowledge we have of how much of it all would be swept away after the war makes this film all the more poignant for all its flaws
<START> if you're in the mood for a really bad porno with no good porn combined with a really bad horror movie this movie is perfect for you however if you breathe air make sure you spend your time watching anything but this the acting is crappy the plot is crappy they try too hard and the whole time i was waiting for the one good redeeming scene that might make the movie worth watching nope stick with the scrambled cable
<START> chris smith is a superior filmmaker with the seldom seen talent for spotting a good story then getting the hell out of its way smith's american movie is the true to life record of filmmaker wannabe mark a loser intent on milking his elderly uncle for cash to complete his horror short but never under any circumstances to pursue gainful employment or support the children he's conceived br br such is producer smith's skill that mark appears more sympathetic than otherwise even as he entices uncle bill with sugar spun dreams and executive producer credits it is his desperation to be somebody to have his name coupled with the likes of scorsese and spielberg that touches us br br american movie also belongs in that rare often attempted but seldom achieved sub genre that successfully blends hilarity with horror the humor comes from ed wood style belief in his own genius from his appalling attempts at acting from his substituting his less than film savvy mother for a missing cameraman and from his employing sweet but brain damaged friend mike whenever he's short an actor or crew member br br the horror comes from seeing what cannot it is this very american attitude i want therefore i am entitled that keeps him from seeing just how much he has to learn about his chosen craft he is so confident he can't fail that failure is guaranteed
<START> after seeing big fat liar i think jason learned a lot more when he told the truth about marty stealing his story it was like the boy who cried wolf people heard him but they didn't believe him nobody did anything to help him besides not only marty's movies stink so does his advice the truth is not overrated i am so glad he got exposed for what he really is everyone found out that he stole from that boy including his parents not only he stole from that boy and lied about it he gave them someone else's work and tried to call it his own which is plagiarism doesn't he know that it is illegal to plagiarize someone's idea another reason why he got fired he is not trustworthy he's a liar a cheat a thief a crook and a plagiarist you got that marty you're a plagiarist plus you got everything that you deserved
