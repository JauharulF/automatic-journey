<START> straight up i love this film i love everything about it it has a great soundtrack it has a lot of recognizable faces and it is funny as hell there are so many plots in this film and every one of them is funny in one way or another br br where as lit up the screen two years back drake is almost as memorable of a character all he wants to do is have fun he moves out of the house without his parent's consent he skips work whenever he feels like it he is obsessed with sex he loves his drugs and booze and he tries to be a good friend it is his attitude that makes him such a joy to watch and he comes out with some great lines and there are so many tiny observations that you don't see coming but they make you laugh at the sheer velocity when it hits you one particular moment is when tommy and bill are talking about bill's ex girlfriend dating someone else now at the end of the conversation tommy takes his huge beer bottle and just throws it over his shoulder casually he then says good night and the scene ends it is a perfect scene tommy's world is his own he really lives to party and have fun when the conversation is over his time is over and he doesn't care who he offends in the process he has an innocence about him it's casual is his favourite saying br br another such classic scene is reggie handing bill a donut he says something to him that me and my friends will never forget because we rewound the film ten times and watched that part over and over again and hurt ourselves laughing it has to be seen to be appreciated br br wild life is a throw back to when teen comedies were funny raunchy had a good ear entertained us and just wanted us to get lost in their world for 90 minutes wild life does all those things perfectly if this is a film that you haven't seen give it a chance it is a classic br br also check out the army store guy that jim has problems with he is a very familiar face now and it is his first role on the big screen
<START> the summary line is some men's wet dream for the ideal woman o seriously though back to the movie which has classic cinema written all over it pun intended and quite literally shown in the picture too as you'll see br br how could someone make a silent movie in this year and age it's not completely silent for once take the music for instance with great cinematography is the answer and it's no wonder that it did win prizes as another user stated in this area but it's also sometimes it's downfall although the pictures are great it sometimes delves too much in them instead of moving forward plot and time wise if you can cope with that than you'll enjoy it even more than me i haven't told you anything about the story but i'll never do that because i don't want to spoiler anything for you
<START> first love teenage love we all have experienced it even if it was not as sweet as the one the protagonists share friends could be considered an adaptation of the classic the blue lagoon originally from 1949 and its remakes from 1980 the most popular one with brooke shields and 1999 with a young milla jovovich while the blue lagoon puts the two young lovers in a desert island with no contact with civilization friends goes the opposite route and it is sure to ring much more true and be a more difficult movie with contemporary audiences paul and michelle who for different reasons turn their backs on family and the adult world to end up living together in a small cottage in southern france having only each other and their childhood innocence their friendship slowly develops into much more as they struggle to sustain themselves in this sweet coming of age story this film even to this day is controversial since the actors are teenagers and they certainly look the ages that are stated in the movie 15 and 14 1 2 the movie does contains a hint of child molesting nudity depictions of teenage sex and teenage pregnancy but the real controversy is not the subject matter but the fact that paul and michelle's love is presented as a natural and healthy relationship while this worked fine for stranded lovers in another time and in a desert island having them in a modern setting presents some very difficult moral issues laws consenting sex between minors are in effect in almost all countries and lack of sexual education in teenagers is seen as one of the causes for the rise in unwanted teenage pregnancies and abortions is a movie like this one just child pornography or a slap in the face to make us face our own hypocrisy regarding a modern society that does not cater to teenage parents and laws that clearly go against human nature and hormonal development but that are needed to prevent child abuse is hormonal development parallel to emotional growth these are not easy questions and most of us will feel uncomfortable with them as an artistic piece this movie is really a forgotten and rough gem the script progresses with extreme simplicity albeit some sappiness but never pulling any punches to state its message although by today standards it is somewhat slow the photography is beautiful and it has scenes of great beauty the acting of the two protagonists varies from really awful in some scenes to marvelously innocent and credible in others pop music unlike most productions nowadays is used tastefully and sometimes the lyrics speak the thoughts of the protagonists overall this is a delightful piece even if the moral values are not in with your own
<START> one night at is one of those films that starts with an awful amount of promise but as the film goes on it becomes silly and loses it's way big time liv tyler plays a manipulative woman who tries to get her own way by flaunting her body to every man she meets all of which fall under her spell there are a few funny moments in this but they get fewer and fewer as the film deteriorates into a comedy farce michael douglas who plays the assassin is good as is liv tyler although she does look like she had put on a bit of weight since this is ok but is only memorable for the scene in which liv tyler washes her car you will know what i mean when you see it 7 out of 10 just
<START> okay so i love aidan quinn's acting even with a bad script this is not the case in the assignment as other viewers have said this was a movie i stumbled upon on cable and got so into it i didn't want it to end take one cuban american navy quinn who is an upright uptight soldier and family man add a crazed agent donald sutherland who is looking for the worlds most notorious terrorist and add a ben kingsley and you have the assignment sutherland is a witness of the most notorious terrorist carlos actions in a cafe on a lovely day where he is so profoundly rocked at this mans evil that his sole reason to live is to get this man as long as he draws breath br br take one soldier on a pass in israel who is a dead ringer for this man and is beaten and held by kingsley until they realize they have a plan by taking on carlos by being him or being forever responsible for never helping rid the world of him makes for a very heavy assignment and guilt trip by not helping his country he is bound as a man and his military duty to chose wisely so the training begins lets say carlos training is right up there with the academy of arts and holocausts when i say this intense and wonderfully casted scripted and executed film rates the best i am not understating it all three actors could save almost any script together this is a movie to be seen from frame one to credits i am not into terrorism or movies about it but i got hooked bravo again to aidan quinn who for once plays a heavy that could hold up to any actor including gary oldman thats a compliment rent it and get lots of popcorn oh did i mention the sex it works better than last tango and its educational
<START> george and mildred was a spin off from the mid 1970s sit com man about the house though i haven't seen the series since it was last broadcast i do remember it being fairly amusing with most of the comedy arising from the eponymous couple going to live beside the snobbish family a sort of love thy neighbour without the cynical racist gags br br having seen this big screen version of the show i find myself asking what it's a big screen version of certainly not of a popular mid 70s sit com of the same name for some reason the movie jettisons all character interaction from the television by having george and mildred leaving the street where they live behind and getting caught up in a plot involving some serious gangsters who want something george has inadvertently picked up and which leads to some cringe making situations and lines like br br did he give it to you br br no that's the first time a man has resisted my charms br br i meant the envelope br br you do get the impression that screenwriter dick sharples who never wrote an episode for the original sit com has never seen an episode of the source material and has got the show confused with the carry on series of films in many ways it resembles the same mistakes of the latter lost in space movie in that it has absolutely nothing in common with the series that spawned it
<START> one of the reviewers here wrote good acting good special effects great br br location even better ending all i can say is ugh this movie was painful to watch let me start by saying this i am a christian considered extremely conservative by many people i know so what i am about to say is not biased by the br br christian content of the film i'm not gonna bash it because it's christian i am gonna give it a 2 10 because it's a horrible movie the writing is bad over the top way too preachy and much of the preachy stuff is just plain irrelevant to the story it just makes for bad scriptwriting whether i agree with the br br screenwriter's beliefs is irrelevant make a good script that flows well stays on track and is believable the acting was amateurish at best but hey when you cast amateurs you get br br amateur performances dirk been may have been on survivor but that show br br requires zero acting ability playing on his name and reputation to sell units is in bad taste cast unknowns who can act and you'll have a much better film the effects were horrible the scene with the hail and the subsequent falling of the stars was embarrassing to watch and what was so great about the ending it made no sense yeah i know what br br tim was going for but it missed the mark big time i bought this film and expected so much more based on reviews and the br br misinformation on their website and although i was hoping for more i got what i always get when i watch christian films an under budget poorly written pathetically acted badly produced piece of ka ka maybe someday someone will finally step up to the plate with an end times film as well written and as well made as gibson's passion was 2 10 stars
<START> okay pretty good doesn't scream rent me but i was surprised at how much i enjoyed campfire tales while by no means a classic the directors involved do have an idea what suspense is the scares don't just jump out at you but instead the directors build steadily to the climatic moments the film is based upon popular urban legends and ghost stories the writers have updated the tales rather well and twisted them just enough that the familiar endings still pack a punch the best of the shorts are the honeymoon and people can lick too i enjoyed both as they have nice suspense throughout each story the was a good ghost story and the wrap around the campfire is pretty good too except they go for one too many twists at the end the only disappointing segment is the hook which is fine because it's pretty short anyway overall i give this a 7 out of 10 it has suspense which is lacking from most horror movies today and good acting by the cast it may not rate up there with halloween and the exorcist but it's a good little movie well worth the price of a rental
<START> got to confess right up front that i didn't watch this entire movie i missed the first hour during a sci fi channel broadcast or was i spared the first hour the other reviewers sum this one up nicely it was badly conceived badly scripted badly acted br br but the worst thing for me was the adr the entire film which appeared to have been dubbed sounded like it was done in somebody's garage there was a voluminous echo to the words which just served to make the bad dialog hang and hang and hang even a made for tv movie should have recognized this br br and the idea that alternate dimensions are differentiated by color saturation went out in the 80s folks
<START> a rare lengthy kinski feature role as crazy johnny sex crazed outlaw who is wanted in san francisco kinski's character is obsessed with raping women a sexual predator in the old west who has nothing more but stealing raping and killing on his mind this movie maybe a major disappointment for many spaghetti western fans but not for many klaus fans overall it had two things going for it a great performance from klaus kinski and a great music score by stelvio br br another story line which needed much more work done to it to be impactive but still fun to watch br br it would be nice to see this movie redone in the future since most old movies are being re made nowadays
<START> ever since 1981 nintendo has been making great video games such as super mario and zelda most ideas would get a bit boring after 20 years games made by nintendo never seem to get boring because they're always adding something new it went from arcade games to the wii and i hear that there's a new version of the wii scheduled for release in the thing that makes wii games so different is the fact that your actually doing something instead of just sitting on the couch pushing buttons br br and i have more good news super mario galaxy 2 is to be released in 2010
<START> i accidentally bumped into this film on cinemax while channel surfing i must admit that what attracted me was christopher walken and the setting was the kind i would like so i started to watch it at first i expected a serious drama film and it seemed like so for a while until i started to giggle here and there and before i know it i was laughing so hard all through the film i really like how subtle and light hearted it is but still has a huge impact on the audience the plot is very simple and it's far from trying too hard to be funny like many hollywood comedies are yet it almost had me rolling on the floor a must see for a nice evening rest or any time in that case
<START> this is a weird and compelling film the topic about the atom bombs created at los in the usa and used on japan during the latter part of world war ii is huge and of course deeply disturbing the film's plot takes on a lot of heavy issues and the actors have to carry much of the creative tension i had never seen the film or was much interested in it i have to admit until i read the book smoking in bed conversations with bruce robinson robinson wrote the story and screenplay i think the film was better than i expected from reading robinson's point of view in the conversations about it but i can see how he thought it got derailed i think paul newman is pretty good but is somehow at bottom miscast he's too hollywood at one point a big mean looking guy storms into newman's office and has such a striking presence i immediately thought he should be playing the character newman is playing the other lead who plays the head scientist is also fairly good but somehow not brilliant enough to portray the huge angst that goes with the part the immense responsibility for creation of an ultimate machine of death and destruction one of the more effective characters seems to be a composite personality played by john cusack he is oddly affecting throughout and in the end is the character whose fate really hits home and who made me think most vividly of the fate of more than 200 000 japanese people in hiroshima and nagasaki
<START> this is a truly terrible sci fi horror film from 1957 in fact despite ed wood jr and his dreadful films getting a lot of publicity this turkey is every bit as bad as the worst of wood now the acting is a bit better than you'd find in the wood epics such as plan 9 and bride of the monster but the special effects managed to be significantly worse than wood's however bad movie aficionados will be happy to hear that it's so bad that it's still excellent viewing like a wood film it's great to watch this crap fest and laugh along with your friends br br the film begins with a scientist flying about doing some testing in his jet however out of nowhere a ufo streaks by and his report of this over the radio triggers a panic by the air force however later they realized that the ufo didn't appear on the radio and they think the scientist is a nut but when soon after this planes start disappearing all over they realize there must be something to his sighting br br so far the film isn't great but it's watchable however by the time the horrible flying monster appears you know you're watching a turkey first through horrid use of stock film and crappy models airplanes keep changing mid flight some may not be bothered by this but with airplane lovers like me seeing an f 80 turning into an f 86 to an f 102 fighter plane made me crazy especially since the planes look nothing like each other second through clever cinematography all you really see of the monster is a ball of fuzz for half the film this is frustrating and you hope that when you finally do see it clearly it will be worth the wait well no such luck the monster looks less realistic or scary than the duck from groucho's you bet your life tv show in fact it's significantly less realistic than any of the japanese giant monsters in fact big bird from sesame street is even a bit scarier and realistic it's just god awful in every way and might just be the dumbest movie monster in history about as bad or worse as the monsters in robot monster or teenagers from outer space the bottom line is that this is an absolutely dreadful film that sane people won't like bad film fans like me who are a crazy bunch will probably love it all others be afraid be very afraid br br fyi you might notice that some clips in this film are from other sci fi movies i am positive the crashing washington monument scene was stolen from earth vs the flying saucers but i also saw a couple other scenes that i swear are from other films what a hack job
<START> as i have said before i am not a fan of tweety he's just so aggravating i wish sylvester would just eat him and get it over with br br in this cartoon sly is homeless once again and is back to feeding out of garbage cans he spots a cruise ship leaving port nearby and decides to hop aboard when he tweety is one of the passengers br br the ship provides an adequate stage for the following hijinks and sly desperately tries to catch the annoying bird and avoid seasickness if only for once he's succeed by chewing and swallowing thus finishing of the irritating canary forever but as cartoons starring tweety go this one is quite good but it's all thanks to that brilliant cat
