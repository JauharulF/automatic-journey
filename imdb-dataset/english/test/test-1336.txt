<START> this film is a total bore entrapment is way better in all aspects plot acting stunts etc plus the soundtrack is one of the most annoying i've ever heard i was close to muting the film just to shut it up 3 out of 10 stars
<START> at least for me and rather unexpected as subject a movie that makes you question your beliefs your life your approach on everything that helps you see the world you we live in through a lens or a multitude of lens a moving surprising and haunting movie br br and it benefits of one of the best performances ever from kevin spacey very well by jeff bridges there isn't a false note in this tango it's a perfect dance perfect 'till the end br br what does the ending reveal well everything you want it to br br a movie one will want to see again maybe not right away maybe after a few days months years but it's something to go or come back to
<START> honestly how hard can it be to make a good remake obviously pretty hard i was soooo excited to see this because i loved the original and my friends go and see it and tell me it really sucks well i finally see it and i was sooo disapointed ok the shower scene was more realistic that's why i gave it a 3 otherwise it did suck vince vaughn does a terrible job playing norman he's just too dense or something i don't know it was just terrible don't see it
<START> the story of macbeth was one of the most successful shakespeare ever wrote this may be due to some features that place it close to the slasher genre murder murder kill kill gallons of blood a tense sexual relation between the main characters etc more than this the original play is very appealing taking into consideration the length it's only half the size of hamlet and the focus on macbeth for whom we are constrained to care in spite of his bloody nature the play would seem ideal to base a movie on not so lengthy it gives the directors the possibility to explore it's many levels a good actor can play the role of his lifetime the film has deep meaning in any historical period unfortunately this has not been the case with macbeth polanski's version comes quite close but it insists too much on the medieval period welles' film is too personal with an interesting twist towards totalitarianism the 1990 or so tv version is too shallow this 2006 movie is no exception it is very far from a shakespeare film but it is interesting to see how the director understood the story and where he places it in contemporary life no knights in shiny armor but gangsters in shiny cars a lot of drugs and trippy music replace the dread of night in the original play the idea of macbeth is so simple that to take and implant it in modern day life doesn't need shakespeare at all the worst part in the film are the lines most of the poignant scenes of the play such as the dagger scene are trimmed so much they seem pointless replacing the knocks in the door with doorbells and horses with cars seems funny if they wanted to make a movie about power and its temptation they could have done it easily without shakespeare this macbeth seems to be a looser with a brain injury not a valiant warrior brave and ambitious that wants power so much he is prepared to to kill and who gets caught up in a net of fears and despair the movie doesn't make clear what drives lady macbeth to madness it doesn't give a reason why some of the characters should fear macbeth and his terror since there is no hereditary ascension to the throne what with no throne and all and it places macbeth in an awkward position since the leadership of a gang is as far from kingship as this whole movie is far from any shakespeare in conclusion we have two superimposed ideas that never quite meet making this a film that's ultimately pointless stand not upon the order of your going but go
<START> it's probably a cultural thing somehow the natives of this country have been conditioned to find this stuff funny i have experienced this phenomenon first hand during an open air cinema event where this film was shown before the feature most of the indigenous audience laughed and no this wasn't in a sanitarium or a clinic for retarded children this was in a well to do area and the audience consisted mostly of educated adults br br so it must be possible somehow to find this amusing but honest to goodness i have no idea what it takes maybe it's in the air or the water prolonged exposure to which causes this condition something must cause it obviously the only thing i can say is that i am quite sure what doesn't cause it the movie itself br br there are no jokes in it it's brain dead stupid nonsensical unfunny lame it's in short a waste of time any tom and jerry is funnier heck even funerals are funnier br br just in case you have been fortunate enough not ever to have seen any of the stooges' performances it's three guys behaving running even talking like retarded infants causing all kinds of unfunny mayhem with no plot no real purpose and no real conclusion it's like ugly teletubbies without the cute costumes br br sitting in a crowd watching this garbage in this country can be quite exasperating because you feel like you are at a party with a bunch of potheads and you are the only one who hasn't smoked anything br br so unless you are prepared to yourself to make this bearable or come equipped with whatever it is that makes people think watching three ugly old men behave like morons is funny my advice on this is stay way far away
<START> title dracula a d 1972 br br director alan gibson br br cast peter cushing christopher lee stephanie beacham br br review sometimes movies can be time capsules that transport you back to any given time in this case our time capsule is hammers dracula a d 1972 which transports us back to a time in which austin powers would have felt right at home br br the story is about these group of kids were not a gang were a group that love to hang out at a cafÃ© shop called the cavern one day johnny alucard hmm strange last name wait it spells dracula backwards a new member of the group offers the group a new way to get their kicks he offers them a night of black mass and black magic to which they also say sure why the hell not it could be fun so in no time flat the find themselves resurrecting count dracula from the ashes br br this movie opens up with a swinging party at some rich doofuses home he knows non of the people at his party yet there they all are partying the night away in his house doing drugs making out and dancing on top of tables the filmmakers made sure that this sequence was completely engulfed in whatever young people considered cool at that time everyone says words like way out and groovy and they finish many of their sentences saying all that jazz so yeah its pretty evident that this is the 70s to top it all off there's a band that sounds something like jefferson airplane i mean you'll be drowned in all things 70s and as i watched this i kept asking myself how the heck is dracula with his black cape and get up going to fit into all this and thats exactly what happens old dracula feels out of place amidst all the partying and the rock and roll and drugs many of the scenes in the film are great but sadly the music they decided to add to the proceedings doesn't fit at all and completely takes you out of the mood of things something horrifying or scary will be happening on screen and suddenly a bunch of loud trumpets and start to beat and your just completely taken out of the horror element that sucked out the atmosphere right out of this movie for me br br but all in all putting all the distracting 70s music aside an illness that satanic rites of dracula also suffered the movie was pretty good but i will mention this the story was just a re hash of what we had seen before in taste the blood of dracula in fact the story is damn near identical lets see a young lad inherits ring and ashes check he then decides to bring dracula back to life with the help of some people who know nothing about what they are getting into check black mass to bring dracula back in a desecrated church check the list of similarities goes on and on so this movie ain't very original if you ask me br br there are a few things that make this movie worth while though for example the fact that the movie is a time capsule to london in the early seventies makes the film entertaining i kept giggling and laughing every time someone spoke in 70 jargon i couldn't believe some of the clothes these people wore and the cars they drove it made the movie fun for me but we are here to get spooked were here to see drac kill a few virgins and take his revenge on the house of van helsing did we get any of that well yeah there's a few good sequences squeezed in there to satisfy old school hammer fans first off there's the black mass sequence which was above all things satanic they mention the name of many a demon and lots blood is spilled that sequence was awesome but it was messed up by the music in its most crucial moment then there's actual resurrection which ill admit was great from a visual standpoint some mist comes out of grave and slowly but surely christopher lees silhouette and face emerge from the fog cool shot i loved it we have a cushing and lee face off at the end and i couldn't help to laugh at one point when dracula hurls a piece of furniture through the air i laugh because he has done this in every single film since horror of dracula its this hammer tradition where the characters start throwing candle sticks and chairs at each other and i think to myself aren't their more exciting things to show then a bad guy throwing a candle stick at our hero oh well anyhows demise in this one is very similar to all the other hammer before it vampire gets slaked and then we cut to a series of frames until there's only ashes left br br all in all an unintentionally funny hammer dracula film its trapped in the 70s and though that makes it a fun watch and its not as horrible as satanic rites of dracula it still doesn't gel well with the dracula universe we had come to expect from hammer br br rating 3 1 2 out of 5
<START> like the previous commentator on this film i too found myself in tears at times during this movie sometimes one wonders how a film of such awe inspiring awfulness comes into existence from the first moment when our protagonist wakes up in his new york apartment from a dream of subway trains intercut with galloping horses what irish emigrant hasn't had that one its clear we are in trouble and it doesn't get much better br br whisked back to 1950s ireland we enter a world where everybody speaks without intonation and exclusively on the topic of the irish civil war schoolchildren go to school to learn about the civil war the drinkers in the pub divide themselves according to their civil war allegiances are carried out for those who died in the civil war the town is divided between those who believe we should remember and those who want to forget the civil war every glance and conversation is dripping with meaning that traces back to the civil war br br the blurb on the of broken harvest suggests that the film is a parable of the troubles in modern ireland the only parallel which strikes me is that in present day dublin conversation is indeed dominated by one topic house prices if its intention is to offer some sort of insight into ireland's obsession with its past it fails miserably it is striking how few irish films have dealt with the irish civil war and its however it will take a film of a great deal more subtlety and intelligence than this one to tell us anything about the lasting effects of such a traumatic event on the nation's psyche br br for those american viewers who have suggested the film evokes the atmosphere of 1950s ireland it doesn't 1950s ireland was a horrible poverty stricken pit of sexual repression and misery from which young people fled in their droves however there was more than one topic of conversation
<START> spoilers br br this movie was truly awful this woman deceives her employers right from the start and then selfishly proceeds to tear them apart at the end you see her making a profession out of the trade she'd learned from the father of her pupil i put pupil in quotes because the governess never really seems to teach the child anything she seems to hate her and can't stand being near her i felt sorry for the little girl who simply wanted to be loved absent that it was understandable that she would say and do outrages things just to get attention but the viewer wasn't supposed to sympathize with the little girl the viewer was supposed to sympathize with the governess who hated her pupil and manipulated and deceived her employers i just couldn't do it this was not the story of a self made woman rather it was a window into the mind of one who uses others at every opportunity with no other thought for anyone outside of her own family i couldn't stand the governess this was a really horrible movie i only paid one dollar to rent it but even that was too much
<START> as a fan of nearly any period drama and at that a huge jane austen fan i was horrified by this adaption as a fan of the 1999 version of mansfield park i was constantly comparing the two and this fell far short it felt hugely rushed and very one dimensional so that it became boring very quickly there seemed to be no subtly to the relationships particularly that of fanny and edmund and little atmosphere despite being set in a beautiful location despite having looked forward to the jane austen season since christmas i turned this off after an hour and went to bed i will be interested to watch the adaptations of persuasion and northanger abbey of which i have no much loved version to see if they still manage to bore me in such a manner
<START> wow i've sure seen quite a bit of kelli this summer i didn't know this woman made so many softcore flicks in the past three years it's like seeing a future softcore star blossom in front of me much like michelle hall did a couple of years ago br br passion's peak is the third quality softcore flick i've seen kelli in with girl for girl and house of love being the others desire and deception was okay but it wasn't spectacular there's spoilers in this review so read only if you want to br br the story begins with christina kelli heading out of the big city and to the mountains she has inherited a house from her dear departed grandmother and plans to turn it into a mountain lodge before she can even set her things down some woman named kim uncredited in this film but quite the aggressive one begins booking guests to stay there now she has to get the house into shape quickly in comes chip bobby johnston a childhood friend to the rescue chip helps her get the house in workable condition she hires two local slackers to work in her lodge chip's sister bait samantha mcconnell and her sex buddy hank br br now the guests start coming the first to arrive are eric and linda flower two stereotypical money first lawyers linda and eric get into a huge argument during a dinner party halfway through the film which leads to their breakup sad stuff there next there's romance novelist sophia played by b movie goddess monique parent she's using that silly alias scarlet again and she's got a very professional look this time with blonde hair of course it wouldn't be monique if she didn't have at least one scene where she plays with herself and she obliges during one of eric and linda's sex scenes br br james and lane yes the porn star lane show up for a little weekend getaway as well unbeknownst to james and christina have quite a history james and christina used to date but christina broke it off to head to this mountain lodge james comes up to the lodge to get christina back but his plan backfires christina spills the beans to which causes to walk out on him and down to the local bar to strip for the locals ends up in the sleeping bag of the now single eric and they leave together bait realizes she wants something more than just sex with hank and christine finds true love with chip with sophia soaking it all in and writing it into her next romance novel br br in fact if you ask me this whole movie played out like a romance novel i don't know if the screenwriter was going for that effect but i sure got that impression sophia had some of the best lines in this film playing up the idea that this is a live action romance novel she seems to enjoy all the fighting and backstabbing going on br br now to the sex there was a fair amount of it and it was the usual bump and grind stuff monique did her fair share of moaning in her two sex scenes this film was tapeworthy and the story will actually keep the audience somewhat interested in between the sex scenes br br women a monique was simply monique out of all the softcore actresses i've seen over the years she's the best at acting in my opinion she can really act and be sexy which is why she's holding on to the 1 position in my skinemax top 10 kelli is better at doing softcore films than she is on the soap opera passions i don't know why she's not doing more of these flower was merely background scenery for the most part in a limited role samantha mcconnell continues to impress me and lane is yet another hardcore actress crossing over into the softcore realm and doing a halfway decent job at it br br sex b it was good but not awe inspiring spectacular plenty of moaning don't watch the r rated version trust me most of the good stuff is taken out my grade is for the uncut version br br story b a solid storyline which throws in a contrived ooh the building inspector's gonna shut us down subplot toward the end which messes up things the underlying story between christina and james was nice and sophia's dialogue full of the metaphors and imagery usually found in romance novels was a nice touch br br overall b i found this movie to be quite entertaining it's not a surefire softcore hall of like girl for girl is but it's a respectable addition to the skinemax collection
<START> i saw this movie when it was first released in 1986 at the time i was young and enjoyed all the normal comedy available i e monty python jim belushi snl steve martin cheech chong so i believe that my judgment represents most sane individuals br br the absolute best part of this movie was the trailer played at the beginning of the movie for the new my little pony movie that was coming out br br this movie was so atrocious that it was actually yanked from most theaters before the initial week run was completed br br i'm surprised that anyone would waste there corporate money to duplicate this steaming pile of human waste br br don't waste your time or money to rent or watch this movie
<START> there is a great danger when you watch a film that had had such a profound affect on you the first time around that 20 years later it wont hold the same magic as it did before i must admit i wasnt expecting it to be as good as i remembered but a was pleasently suprised yang is still as fantastic as i remember it when i was a 12 year old this film has a certain type of brilliance that not many films possess it is engrossing it is acted and best of all it makes me feel like a kid again and there isnt many things that can do that john and abigail rolls in this film are 1st class and i had forgotten how good they were until now i urge any parent of teenagers to sit them down and watch this and see if it has the same affect on them as it did on me yang 10 out of 10
<START> i first saw it at january 1 2009 and after a day i watched it again and i want to watch it again love everything well almost so 9 stars about it no color beautiful naive stories funny gangsters anna camera work music well sometimes you just want to listen little bit longer and the music just stops but this is not a musical after all i like anna's acting this naive wannabe gangster girl how she speaks holds the gun everything makes me smile no it's not that funny though i have laughed a bit at some moments it's just so subtle excellent work by samuel though 3d nouvelle seems weaker but they are also gangsters maybe even worse cause they are stealing ideas and the last scene is my favorite makes me feel so warm and romantic yes i would recommend this movie for the romantic souls with a taste for such art movies and i don't agree with those comparing it to pulp fiction it's not about action and twisted story though all vignettes intersect it's calm and maybe too slow movie for most of the people it's about characters their feelings very subtle anyway probably this review won't be of much help to anyone my first just wanted to express my appreciation br br spoiler this movie doesn't have a goofs section wonder didn't anybody notice that hand in the 2 part when the kidnappers decided to go home looks like a part of crew hehe i know i should better post this in forums but i don't agree with some policies here
<START> well for a start i must say that here in russia a saga of of is known and loved a gifted writer or maybe even genius of some sort created one of the most realistic honest cynical and god d mn well written fantasy worlds in a history of literature and when such amazing material gets in a right hands well see rpg game and you will understand what i am talking about br br is an excellent example of the opposite outcome br br lack of budget lack of directing lack of good script br br these three whales of disgusting movie making sunken this movie ate it alive acting is good sometimes even more than good but for god sake it can not save this project br br i still have some faith though i still hope that someday a new movies will be created and entire world will see magnitude and breathtaking splendor of books p s but before that a uwe boll must be eliminated just in case you know
<START> brown returned to his role from the year before in slaughter for this rough follow up film in the original he had avenged his parents' slaying by wiping out a huge mob organization in mexico here he is the one being pursued retaliated against by a money portrayed by mcmahon when the first assassination attempt fails brown is back in action once more kicking gangster butt all over the place while trying to protect his new girlfriend hendry while the original film was overall a better and more coherent movie this one delivers all the exploitation aspects in far heavier doses making it more pleasing to fans of the genre aside from a fairly dreary opening on horseback and a downright deadly car ride down a city street at night this movie clips along at a very brisk pace every few minutes there appears one or more of the following drug use sex nudity gunplay murder or some other action brown is his usual reliable amiable self helped by his amazing physical presence which goes a long way in glossing over any stiffness in his acting mcmahon is a riot with tinted glasses and his hair parted down the middle he is shown meting out orders to his gang of thugs and is overheard making passionate love to his fur clad bimbo seeing johnny carson's sidekick in a role like this is a perverse thrill stroud makes an impression as an intense racially bigoted hit man while peters adds just a tinge of class as an upright police detective who enlists brown's aid sadly no mention at all is made of brown's original sidekicks don gordon and stella stevens suddenly brown now has a girlfriend hendry who is likable enough but lacking in the voluptuousness and personality that stevens had before williams does an outrageous turn as a pimp who can seemingly pick any girl out of a bar and make her an instant member of his harem the cinematography and overall direction is less polished than the first film but this one does have a drive and a sense of danger that exceeds the original's feel the film spends a lot of time in the sewage of organized crime drugs prostitution and other vices but it retains interest through the creativity of its action scenes and the now startling lack of political correctness one odd note a key supporting player in the first film was shown getting shot to death but pops up here in a different role
