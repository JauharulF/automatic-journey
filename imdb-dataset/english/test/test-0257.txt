<START> oh dear this has to be one of the worst films i have ever seen it's unbelievably repetitive every scene seems to consist of people being gunned down running round screaming or being kicked in the face which quickly becomes very dull i wouldn't mind if the combat was even any good but it isn't the main character phillips pushes the various goons over with ridiculous ease and no matter how often he stands in full view of the tracker he never gets hit even though extras and minor characters are being shot and blown up all around him i've rarely seen a worse cast of actors especially don wilson if you can even call him an actor but that's not really surprising given the dialogue they have to work with sample line computers killed my brother the plot is a sub par ripoff of the excellent terminator the special effects are laughable overall this film is just utterly dreadful and why does everything explode
<START> i was very impressed with this production on likely all levels from production to plot and character development br br this definitely fall under the realism genre since there is nothing going on here that makes use of creative imagination twists or manipulating audience in how a viewer shall feel think and asses br br the actors are great especially the little ones the chemistry between the brother and the sister is mind blowing maybe not even as common as should be in real life it is a movie excellent to literally watch while visualizing it one knows when a movie is good when one just does not want it to end but eventually everything does
<START> detective sergent vince de carlo james and company are on the case of a vicious serial killer rapist can psychologist carol susan sullivan help or will she become the killer's next victim and what is with the killer's hilarious white dude afro br br inspired by the case of serial killer ted bundy killer's delight aka the dark ride is a rather dull serial killer tale from 1978 that doesn't offer much if anything it's more of a police procedural flick than a horror movie as much of the violence occurs off camera sure we get mutilated bodies but we don't get a whole lot in the exploitation department especially considering that they are from the aftermath and not during the crime those hoping for the likes of the toolbox murders or maniac will be very disappointed br br fortunately there is an impressive scene involving a woman trying to escape the killer that get's the tone right and is quite suspenseful to boot also john is quite effective as the killer though his hilarious hairstyle white guys with afros are always worth a chuckle is more than a bit distracting br br the dark ride is too routine and mediocre to really warrant a recommendation as it lacks the proper exploitation elements and is dated even by the standards of the time those looking for a better example should probably turn to don't go in the house and a few others instead as this just doesn't cut it
<START> the first killjoy 1 but here's the review of killjoy 2 br br contains spoilers so beware readers br br oh my oh my my my i'll start off with telling you that i had no hopes in the least bit that this movie would be good considering that killjoy the first movie is without a doubt the worst movie ever made the sequel didn't have much promise br br as expected it didn't deliver br br the deaths were even lamer than in the first movie there was absolutely no eye candy whatsoever and every single prop looked so fake that i wouldn't be surprised if they had a kindergarten class make them br br look i don't even know where to begin hm for starters the movie wasn't even feature length it was only an hour and eight minutes long 68 min but then again ending it early was actually a reprieve in fact that's the only reason that this movie wasn't as bad as the first because the first was longer br br usually i don't give spoilers in reviews but since i don't want any of you to go through the torture of watching this waste of film i'm going to spoil away not that there's much to spoil br br let's start with the ending killjoy is the killer ever it takes explosions firebombs guns etc to kill all of the normal serial killers in horror movies guess what it took to kill killjoy a f ing glass of water no lie in the end a girl picked up a cup of water and threw the water on face then killjoy started screaming and they tried to make it look like his face was melting by putting dried rubber cement on his forehead then he laid there and the people went to sleep br br now let's hit the acting very terrible not even one person was believable in the least bit i don't even know what to say other than it looks like they just hired a few hobos living on the streets to act in this film br br seriously i honestly doubt that they spent any more than 100 dollars total to make this movie they had nothing most of it took place in the woods which wouldn't have cost them anything to film on the actors weren't giving in any effort whatsoever so it's blatant that they were probably working for free they didn't have any kind of special effects or nice props and they probably used ketchup for the blood hell who am i kidding they probably didn't even spend 100 dollars they probably spent 3 29 on a bottle of ketchup and that was it a f kin' movie made with a budget of 3 29 br br for bob's sake they couldn't even afford to rent a cop uniform in the end after killjoy dies the girl wakes up and says where is he and the main woman replies he's gone then suddenly some fat goofy guy with scars on his face pops out of nowhere with a cell phone saying you have a phone call the girl answers and says oh hi mom and smiles then the fat goofy guy walks along to reveal that it's a police officer however he's wearing khaki pants and a regular button up green shirt with a lame badge on the front pocket hell it was probably the badge that the director got when he was in safety patrol in 3rd grade then they all got into a tan blazer and drove off as the credits rolled they couldn't even get a police cruiser so they just got a tan blazer f kin' lame killjoy didn't even have the ice cream van that he had in the first movie br br killjoy is without a doubt the most flamboyantly gay slasher ever if there was a slasher that wore hot pink spandex and carried a rainbow flag he still would not be as gay as killjoy killjoy isn't funny either and believe me he did try to be br br the only good thing about this movie is an extremely lame threat given by one of the delinquents somebody makes a comment to some boy about not passing third grade to which the boy responds i'll show you third grade in a threatening manner that has to be the absolute worst threat that i've ever heard i'll show you third grade br br this movie doesn't even work on a so bad it's good level it's filth unless you did something bad and you are feeling so guilty about it that you want to punish yourself severely don't watch this movie br br just remember if a flaming homosexual clown with a huge black afro tries to bore you to death with gay jokes and attempt to kill you at the same time just throw some water at him case closed br br final rating 1 out of 10
<START> as long as you can get past your puritanical instincts and realize that are people too you'll realize the depth p t anderson gives to his characters also an incredible soundtrack the songs are so tightly tied to their scenes you won't be able to hear them without thinking about the movie again br br philip seymour hoffman is worth the price of admission alone
<START> director lead actor revels in this look at me film wherein he attempts to gain worldly acceptance for the otherwise very upbeat world of mormon missionaries some of the acting is fair but some roles are unrealistic i e the ominous rather than fatherly mission president etc the film does give a fair look at how some missionaries may struggle with their faith but the actual missionary program he claims to represent is far from his concept of it in terms of being upbeat cohesive and inspired the only inspiration i see in this film is self inspiration the film is slow and boring and the shooting and screenplay look like a college student project
<START> while the date doctor concept is the one thing that saves this film from being an otherwise average romantic comedy with a standard plot for the genre i found it enjoyable enough to elevate my opinion of it so i ended up liking it a lot more than if it'd had just a mediocre plot without many twists will smith does a great job as always acting as hitch the man who devotes his life to advising men how and how not to win over women ever since his failed attempt to keep his college girlfriend there're plenty of laughs as he tries to help his latest patient overweight gawky asthmatic albert kevin james successfully court beautiful co worker cole amber also when he decides to rid a woman he meets in a bar of the turkey who just doesn't seem to get she doesn't want him around he finds himself attracted to sara eva mendes it appears to be a big deal for him so i guess since college he never actually practiced his own rules on himself unfortunately sara is a gossip columnist who is interested in the date doctor who got a seemingly dorky guy like albert together with especially after player jerk vance munson jeffrey donovan breaks her best friend's julie ann emery heart and hints the date doctor he saw disgusted him when she doesn't realize that he refused to see him still trouble follows and hitch is stuck left wondering about what to do with his own relationship while not being any great help to albert when he tries to figure out what more to do in his the acting is good there's a great deal of humor and some other fine points with meaning hitch's character is witty and wise sometimes managing to be both at once true the misunderstanding where the woman is at something the man hasn't truly done why do they always show that as common and irritating guess it wouldn't have been if it was the 1st not 5th time i've seen it but the rest of them were completely new i only wish this movie was longer i remember being able to watch 3 5 of it while it was playing on a restaurant's tv once but i still approve it's definitely worth the money to pay for its brevity
<START> i recall so many things about seeing this movie back during it's original theatrical release the post woodstock afterglow of peace and love along with the pre watergate tension of fear and paranoia it's hard to believe that it's thirty seven years later and i can still remember the thoughts going through my head while watching the film with my best friend like marveling at peter boyle's characterization of the ultimate redneck sure to typecast him the rest of his career oh how wrong and how the counter culture jarred the sensibilities of most of the country to this day my buddy and i still use joe line from my summary above when faced with a dilemma curious how a simple line like that can stay with you for decades br br it's curious to read comments about the film from others on this board particularly the ones stating that the film has a dated quality and how over the top the characters were still if you were around during that time the picture gives a pretty accurate portrayal of the polar opposites that existed back then pretty much side by side as the events in the story reveal if you really want dated when was the last time you heard the words macy's and in the same sentence or a line like joe's come on get with the pepsi generation for historical perspective you have that great nixon poster lingering in one of the background scenes would you buy a used car from this man with minor intricacies like those director john captures many of the subtle but ever present hints of how life was four decades ago br br today's viewing was only the second time i've seen the movie and i have to admit i don't remember susan sarandon in one of the lead roles but then again this was her very first picture the scenes of nudity and free love were something actually quite new and bold at the time shocking in fact as film makers began to experiment with their ability to push the envelope of propriety and convention joe took a major leap in that regard particularly since it was a 'mainstream' picture br br with the passage of time the thing that impresses me the most about peter boyle was how he overcame the stereotype of joe to appear in or star in some of my very favorite pieces of work i mean how do you go from joe to that hilarious rendition of on the in young frankenstein and my absolute favorite episode of 'x files' has boyle as clyde in both a tender and tragic funny and serious portrayal that turns the tables on scully and mulder more than once and as a career capper frank barone has to be one of the funniest characters in the history of television even repeat episodes in syndication are funny as he whenever the elder barone lets loose with one of his observations he is one actor that this viewer sorely misses already
<START> i was hoping this would be a good weekly vehicle for tim curry one of my all time favorite performers alas and it is not there doesn't seem to be any chemistry between anyone on the show the dialogue is decidedly uninspired and even the laugh track appeared to be brutal
<START> shot in my former home town by a couple of college kids this movie centers around some freak named luther luther recently paroled revealed to us by an arguing parole board in one of the most laughably scenes of all time runs amuck at the local grocery by eating an old woman's neck with his metal teeth br br luther runs to farm where he eats a guy steals a car ties up an old woman and gets chased and gets killed oh and the chick from the tv show gets naked
<START> today you die starts as honourable criminal harlan banks producer steven seagal is hired by sinister businessman max stevens kevin tighe to drive a security vehicle with 20 000 000 of cash in the back from point 'a' a las vegas casino to point 'b' him sounds simple right well what max forgot to tell harlan that the money is stolen that he has just become the getaway driver in an armed robbery bummer things get even worse for harlan when the local cops catch him chuck him in prison for a long time however harlan managed to hide the money before he was caught with a nice 20 000 000 at stake unaccounted for harlan has to watch his back as the crooks want it as do government agents harlan teams up with ice kool anthony criss in prison they both manage to escape at which point harlan goes looking for some revenge br br photographed directed by don e one has to say that the shot in eastern europe straight to video action films that steven seagal specialises in these days aren't getting any better today you die is a good case in point this is a terrible film simple as that really the script by producer danny lerner kevin moore les gives seagal a new sort of character to get his none existent acting skills around that of a criminal rather than some government agent cop soldier one man army clichÃ© he usually plays in fact if you were being charitable you could say today you die is a rip off of mel gibson's excellent thriller payback 1998 where he too played a really nasty piece of work to such good effect while payback was a superb uncompromising hard edged film noir type action thriller today you die isn't pales into insignificance by comparison unfortunately here seagal is terrible he has no on screen presence or menace either the audience is never quite sure whether he is meant to be a bad guy that we hate or not for instance initially his character's is set up like a modern day robin hood as he steals from the rich drug dealers scumbags to give to the poor as well as keeping a tidy profit for himself which is just ludicrous in itself but then it has seagal turn around murder a lot of people which contradicts the likable criminal with morals that the film went to such lengths to set up in the first place the story is full of holes for instance agent knowles is contacted by the on the run harlan is then reprimanded by her bent superior for meeting him it turns out that he found out by tapped her phone in that case why didn't her boss use the information he had to catch harlan the story is the usual dull predictable bland fight over lots of money with surprise surprise the investigating government agent is actually a bad guy wow i didn't see that coming i must say br br director slows everything down to a snails pace today you die feels like it goes on forever the action scenes set pieces are also severely lacking in entertainment value the infrequent fight scenes aren't great most are either shot in shadow very quickly cut edited or with the camera played behind seagal's character to try disguise the fact that most of the stunt work done here is by a double again seagal looks fat out of shape uses long baggy overcoats to try hide it it doesn't there's a pretty cool car chase through the streets of las vegas in this at the start i thought that today you die might be alright but it seems the whole sequence was stolen from another action film called top of the world 1997 which is about a las vegas casino robbery as well as using footage from that film today you die also edits scenes from the charlie sheen action film no code of conduct 1998 the jean claude van damme action film the order 2001 the wesley snipes prison based action film undisputed 2002 so quite how much of today you die is original footage is anyone's guess br br technically the film is alright considering it's edited together from four separate films as well as it's own footage it's just about competent consistent enough all the footage of the us locations are obviously lifted from the films already mentioned with all the original footage shot on the cheap in bulgaria the rap style music that litter today you die is awful by the way the acting is poor seagal just mumbles his way through his lines as usual br br today you die is a really bad film made up from other bad action films seagal looks old fat the action scenes are average at best most of the story is fairly random it doesn't come together at the end that well at all one to avoid unless your a die hard seagal fan if such an animal even exists
<START> bank heist cop thriller sounds ok right br br chaos looks good nicely framed good production values high concept action heist br br but br br the plot has the unique achievement of being both smart and blatantly implausible in the how we actually got the money mode and in the who done it and why section at the same time br br in ryan philippe shouting is not seriously not either tough or scary and he is especially not tough or scary when throwing a tizzy fit honestly his great outburst is the only really funny scene in the whole film must make him thrilled that he turned down the role of anakin skywalker and is now doing this br br stratham is normally good as the tough but silent hard nut with the self deprecating humor but here the extra relationship lines are so laughably bad that even he looks uncomfortable saying some of the clichÃ©d mush required more silent seems best br br snipes is actually ok in a typecast way but another nail in a talented actor's coffin he needs an actor's role not an action hero rehash perhaps that business with his taxes will allow him to break that mold and the public and critics will let him on the sympathy vote it would be good if he wasn't so typecast all the time br br the lines these guys speak when they're not doing the plot development and detective work can be summed up in one word br br the film feels all out of whack and it never gels i found it irritating for the first 45 minutes and the tighter last part was passable it should could have been good but it just can't redeem the awful lines the overwhelming score and the general level of irritation with the levels of plausibility br br overall i nearly didn't make it through incredibly irritating and ryan please please please get rid of the
<START> forget the over rated batman begins this is the ultimate batman movie that you are not gonna want to miss out on this movie has everything and it totally surpasses the first 1989 mega hit it may not have done as well as the first one in at the box office but this is certainly a much better film the visuals are amazing burton works his magic as he always does in his films once again gotham city batmans hunting ground is an amazing sight to behold the story itself is actually quite good and the 2 villains in this one are very interesting much more interesting in fact then there comic book counterparts tim burton and screenplay writer daniel walters go a step further to bring you a truly emotional connection with these characters the penguin played to perfection by danny devito is a type of tragic character who was abandoned by his parents at birth and later in life seeks revenge on the world that denied him very disgusting to watch at times but he has some of the most classic lines a villain could ever utter in a single film the other villain is catwoman played so absolutely brilliantly by michelle pfieffer one of the most beautiful actresses of our time and gives a wow performance and totally steals the show as far any of the past and present live action batman villain's is concerned she also has a tragic background her name is selina kyle and she is a very put upon mousy secretary for a shrewd business man called max who later murders her by shoving her out a window somehow she survives and is awakened by cats and decides right then and there to become the legendary catwoman not before of course the amazing sequence in which she completely lets loose and wrecks her entire apartment in one of the most oscar worthy of rage and anger i have ever seen in an actress br br michael keaton once again dons the cape and cowl as batman and also as bruce wayne and this time hes much darker there's not much else to say here except that keaton is simply the best actor to play batman ever he just oozes cool and he has a kind of clint eastwood approach to playing batman and he is very dark he doesn't talk a lot and when he does he sounds very cool and he doesn't make his voice sound all goofy and fake ie bales batman voice in batman begins he struts around gotham like a man possessed by his own inner demons he's disturbed and you know it in this outing he takes on 2 of the most famous baddies to ever grace the batman comic book world br br i have to say though despite the awesomeness of the action scenes like the scenes with the coolest batmobile ever racing down the street knocking thugs to the ground and batman gliding across gotham its the romantic angle between pfieffer and keaton that really makes this movie classic a top choice for anyone who wants to see the real batman in action i rate this a 10 would give it more if i could
<START> dope sick love is a really remarkable documentary made for hbo about two pairs of heroin addicted lovers roaming the streets of nyc i managed to catch it one night by accident and found it absolutely mesmerizing there is no narration and we never see any interviews with the subjects the camera just follows them around like a third eye completely detached the people being followed don't even seem aware that they're being filmed or at least they don't seem to care the footage is amazingly candid some of the most candid i've ever seen this is as real as it gets the nuts and bolts of what its like to be on the street and addicted to heroin we watch them score dope shoot it make up hustle and even impersonate cops to rob people and about a million other tiny details that less observant documentary filmmakers would leave out br br some of the footage is truly horrifying like watching one guy frantically searching for fix he lost i found myself praying that he would find it just so that his misery would temporarily end and when he does find it the guy literally dances in the street br br the cyclical nature of drug addiction becomes very apparent while watching this everything is about getting the next score to these folks yet the next score seems to be well worth the immense trouble they go through br br i would love to get a copy of this if anyone knows where it is available highly recommended if you can catch it on hbo
<START> a story about love and hate tragedy and happiness and most of all friendship set in the very interesting time of the american civil war br br gets you interested in history gets you emotionally involved and makes you feverishly wait for the next episode br br moreover the casting was splendid many superstars appear in short cameos the leading roles are played by a big array of talented mimes kirstie alley and terri garber should be mentioned here this is simply a superb example for a tv production as it should be br br not to forget the sheer loveliness of wendy portraying constance
