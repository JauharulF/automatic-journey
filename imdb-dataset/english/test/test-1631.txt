<START> the opening scene of the beach at while amusing in itself unfortunately provides a suitable metaphor for the film insipid and washed out it is actually not as corny as most of the others in the carry on series but maybe because of that doesn't really deliver much fun it's a fair bet that the title will appeal to fans of the benny hill show but those looking for attractive females in bikinis and miniskirts while they will see some in this will probably enjoy some of the other titles in the series such as carry on abroad or carry on up the jungle more the emergence of early 1970s feminism is used as a plot device which seems rather self defeating
<START> in out was a funny comedy with good performances by joan cusack tom selleck matt dillon and kevin kline the thought of kevin kline being gay was very funny if i was him i would hate to say i'm gay at his own wedding with his family friends and his going to be wife there very seldom would that ever happen i also loved when he was dancing around when the voice on the radio was talking to him i'd say that in out was a silly comedy with a lot of laughs and giggles this is a recommended comedy and kevin kline had a great performance as a gay guy trust me you'll like this movie br br 7 10
<START> this film has possibly the worst title for a stooge short ever dreamed up somewhat fitting given the actual fifteen minute content br br i can do without any of the shemp a d stuff but i will admit to having a few lol moments from the two man comedy offered by moe and larry in some of the new footage and kudos to those guys for trying to give it their all considering the position they were forced into in even making these dogs br br another bright spot to this and the last a d debacle commotion on the ocean is the decided lack of screen time for joe palma and the back of his head no attempts to have him speak or flap his arms like a chicken see hot stuff may be worth an extra rating point br br 2 10
<START> i saw this film at school and absolutely loved it based on a true story this is an absolutely splendid masterpiece of a film seriously i couldn't find anything wrong with it one definite plus is how it was filmed set in morrocco in 1904 the wind and the lion is filled with stirring images like the great on horseback especially the cinematography was faultless the editing was crisp the costumes were gorgeous and the scenery was breathtaking and i have to mention the music from jerry goldsmith it was phenomenal i have used this phrase a lot recently but goldsmith ain't my favourite film composer for nothing his score here is so rousing and exciting it shows the man's true musical genius and this gem of a score should be up there with goldsmith's best scores with legend rambo first blood patton and the secret of nimh br br the action is exhilarating and the screenplay is intelligent and sophisticated the direction is sensitively handled too the performances were astounding as well with sean connery ever the picture of charisma and suavity magnificent as the great he almost dominates the entire picture on his own he is joined by a feisty candice bergen a wily john huston and a captivating brian keith in one of his more understated performances the history is fairly accurate perhaps flimsy in some areas but with the acting music and visuals so good i am past caring 10 10 bethany cox
<START> just saw this movie on opening night i read some other user comments which convinced me to go see it i must say i was not impressed i'm so unimpressed that i feel the need to write this comment to spare some of you people some money br br first of all the is very predictable and just not much of a thriller it might be scary for someone under 13 but it really did nothing for me the climax was laughable and most of the audience left before the movie's resolution br br furthermore the acting seemed a little superficial some of the emotional arguments between the family were less convincing than the sub par suspense scenes br br if you've seen previews for this movie then you've seen most of the best parts and have a strong understanding of the plot this movie is not worth seeing in the theaters
<START> the bothersome man is one of the best foreign films i have ever seen all the technical aspects are in my opinion perfect lighting acting directing pacing etc the story is breathtaking br br seemingly beyond death our main character finds himself inhabiting a world without beauty passion or anything remotely pleasing to the human senses his work is cold and uninteresting his relationships are numb and uninspiring and when it all becomes too much he seeks to end it in front of a train but it doesn't end he can not leave this strange world by suicide working his way back to a man who seemed to be feeling he same isolation and loneliness our main character joins him in excavating a stone wall in hopes of revealing the source of a strange and wonderful smell and music just as they break through and i will not reveal that much it all comes to an end and the movie ends as oddly as it began br br suffice it to say you will either love this movie or hate it i feel that it is like a magical poem open to many different interpretations and all of them as valid as the next if you enjoy new experiences in film and want to be taken away from hollywood's crap feast try this movie br br 9 10 and i don't rate easily because in spite of its darkness this movie left me with a sense of something greater something mysterious and beyond ourselves well done
<START> i am surprised that so many viewers didn't find all the symbolism in the movie it's what made the movie an incredible work of art the story deals with some of the saddest content a movie could hold yet it is one of the best movies i've ever seen because of the need for your own imagination and the brilliance in the storyline br br if you will pay close attention the message is there the younger brother is killed by the stepfather the older brother made up the story about the wagon flying as a way to deal with the pain of his brother's death there are those that would argue why would he lie to his own children with the story to me the answer is because he doesn't want to share such ugliness with his own children or that he has blocked it out and replaced his memory of the horrific event with the thought of his brother flying away to safety i've read some of the reviews that believe he was an only child and that he created the younger brother as an escape to deal with the abuse he suffered although this is an interesting idea i love the imagination used to come up with that i don't think he would have lied to his own children about having a little brother but i do find it plausible that he would have lied about his little brother's death however i like that idea of an ending much better than the notion that the movie had no symbolism at all br br there are many different takes you can have on the movie but if you take the movie at face value two brothers creating a wagon that flies to escape an abusive stepfather you've missed the brilliance the fact that i was able to see the subtle messages in the script were what made the movie so incredible to me it requires your own thought process and your own imagination to make it work dig deep when you watch it you'll be amazed at the genius contained in the film the only other movie i've seen as close to this in symbolism and subtle messages is pleasantville but that's a comment for another movie
<START> veber is not renown for his outstanding directorial skills in fact nobody cares as long as they got the laughs quite a few here to be honest scattered in the whole process thanks to depardieu's half wit characterization and the dialogue veber puts in his mouth br br but this is not enough to make a great comedy since there's no movie outside of the usual veber premise a tough guy is doomed to team up with a very naive character in la or les there was a real story going on over the fire vs water proceedings le diner de cons although it was a play managed to create a real suspense about the next catastrophe would cause in tais toi the backstory about the vengeance is both redundant and too weak to arouse our interest plus the heavies are lame both on screen and in the script br br now what's wrong veber wraps this up creating no action no rhythm instead he uses systematically and ellipses maybe he met william goldman in hollywood and the really stresses that lack of nerve and a backbone in the story br br so you'll have to be content with depardieu's performance
<START> now and again a film comes around purely by accident that makes you doubt your sanity we just finished studying the novel northanger abbey at school and decided to refresh our memory of this unexciting piece of humourless garbage with the bbc adaptation br br the funny thing about northanger abbey is that it actually makes you want to kill yourself the film is nothing like the book for example the subtly evil characters seem to have been turned into transparent stereotypes john looks like a leprechaun on acid while isabella plays the role of slut catherine the main character is the most depressingly stupid and irritating actress on god's earth she looks like a coffee addict her eyes are like whilst mr looks and acts like a retired porno stunt double the plot goes completely off the rails at certain points of the film i don't know what the hell the director was thinking when for no reason at all a 7 year old black kid who we've never met before takes the main character out of the abbey and starts in front of her yes that's right nonsense of this kind is occasionally interrupted by catherines fantasies in which she is being carried around a cathedral by an ogre br br northanger abbey is basically visual euthanasia so if you want to murder your boss or something like that bbc have basically discovered a new way to kill someone northanger is a barely laughably bad film don't watch it unless you're in a padded cell
<START> at the bottom end of the apocalypse movie scale is this piece of pish called 'the final at least where i come from a bloke is trained by an ex cop to seek vengeance on those that killed his woman and friends in cold blood and that's about it lots of fake explosions and repetitive shootings ensue has one of the weirdest array of costumes i've seen in a film for a while and a massive fortress which is apparently only run by 7 people great job on the dubbing too guys best moment when our hero loses a swordfight and is about to be skewered through the neck he just gets out his gun and bang why not do that earlier it's a mystery as is why anyone would want to sit through this in the first place i'm still puzzling over that one myself now 2 10
<START> i rated this one better than awful because i liked seeing jonathon from buffy in something again even if it was the same role br br first the concept is kind of cute for a short but not an entire movie the writing was forced and contrived i have the feeling that the movie suffered the most during editing br br second amanda bynes always looks like her eyes are crossed even when she's not trying to do it she's just not funny she always plays some sort of misfit girl who triumphs by being herself ironic considering amanda seems to always be a caricature i would actually like to see her in something serious i really want to give her a chance but she is always cast in these trite roles where she and makes faces and somehow that's a good thing br br finally the whole i'm a dork segment was ripped off from revenge of the nerds there was nothing in this movie that was unpredictable br br shame shame shame
<START> successful films on metaphysical subjects are rare but fata morgana is a good case you can chalk up the large subject to the ambitions of youth but herzog does an amazingly good job the movie's point is to show human beings and even the world from a non human point of view br br the movie is in three parts creation paradise and the golden age the imagery of each is in counterpoint to the voice over although the text of the from the a mayan myth refers to the primordial wasteland the scene goes no further in illustrating the myth it dwells on the waste and on various specimens of destruction fire smoke wrecked vehicles the images from paradise' are anything but that and the golden age' is darkly comic Â the highest culture is the strange roadside musical act br br the suggests that mankind is the central object of creation but the movie does everything it can to undo this notion its mythological framework has no referent in human historical time there are no human characters to speak of when a boy stands with a dog in an extended shot the initial suggestion is of the boy's point of view by the end it is much more the dog's likewise the lizard is a stronger character than the human who introduces it and the turtle's partner barely looks human with his big flippers br br animal stories and nature documentaries always but fata morgana has none of that certainly the dunes look like a female body but the cuts both ways presumably only humans can distinguish easily between their creation and nature and here airplanes and factories are presented alongside mountains lakes and waterfalls people and civilization are all part of a broader natural landscape br br in 1979 herzog put a new twist on the idea when he remade nosferatu from the vampire's point of view
<START> good lord this movie needs to have a new classification on its cover watch only if you have absolutely nothing else to do i am disappointed i was looking forward to a good horror movie over the weekend needed an adrenalin rush and that awesome tingling sensation going down my spine but this movie didn't do it a reasonably good story but pretty awful acting dialogue and filming it was disjointed and sometimes outright silly we had actors looking at the wrong direction of the camera people talking out loud by themselves and narrating what they feel and what is going to happen shadows of equipment in some shots silly clichÃ©s like i just need you to hold me in the totally wrong places and situations thank you for allowing me to and sorry if i'd offended anybody but it was a waste of time and money
<START> you know i was very surprised when watching this movie it aired during the day once when i was sick and having nothing else to do i continued watching this is by far the worst movie ever but to my surprise i kept watching i sat there saying this is terrible but yet didn't change the channel because i was so amused at how bad it was maybe it was the guy that looked like big tom from survivor or the dreadful moustaches and these characters had that kept me watching however the girls weren't half bad but if that's what you want there is far better oh and there's ninjas and boys br br so if you like bad acting hilarious and terrible dialogue and two twins who are five feet tall and killing everything in their sight then this movie is for you it's so bad it's good however i just had to give it a 1 out of ten i couldn't have put a 10 on it up there with lord of the rings br br enjoy
<START> move over manos back off boogens it doesn't take a baby genius to know that malibu beach vampires for the rest of this tome is now and always will be unless someone makes a sequel to the invader the worst film ever the only horror in this thing is watching it i wonder if this was an attempt for someone to meet babes by casting a movie if this was the case the babes ain't babes just like this ain't a movie it's dreck no wait i dishonor the word dreck by calling it dreck ulli lommel of boogey man fame would call it uber dreck or it should be used to torture prisoners if you find it on a shelf in a video store back away from it quietly and notify the authorities
