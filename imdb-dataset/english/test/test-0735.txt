<START> i don't get it the teenage leads in horror star supposedly all are devoted horror fans yet when their favorite idol conrad passes away they dig up his corpse and do all sorts of disrespectful stuff with it like disco dancing it around the house and throw food leftovers at it that doesn't sound like something real horror fans would do now does it i'm a big horror fan and i immensely idolize departed icons like vincent price peter cushing and boris karloff but it would never come to my mind to ridicule their memory no wonder conrad comes back from the dead Â admittedly after a sÃ©ance Â to wipe them all off the face of the earth mr already wasn't known for his friendliness in life since he occasionally killed the directors that disagreed with his visions and even after his death he suffers from a tremendous ego even inside his tomb there are video messages to possible visitors and the group of teenagers will vividly experience that he also enjoys the murdering business outside his film sets horror star a k a and body snatchers is a pretty lame 80's horror flick but there are a handful of cheesy gory highlights to enjoy the film mainly suffers from its own stupid plot since no one Â not even a film school student Â is stupid enough to steal a recently buried corpse and actually think he'll get away with it and there are too many tedious moments to struggle through conrad's video speeches from beyond the grave are overly talkative and definitely undermine the tension but on the other hand his killing methods are pleasingly inventive one teenager enjoys the experience of getting cremated alive and another one jeffrey combs in one of his first roles loses his head in a delightful decapitation sequence in the absolute messiest sequence a poor girl' head is crushed by a coffin writer director norman thaddeus vane wanted to bring homage to vintage horror cinema and he obviously how to make film look sinister the locations and scenery are great but vane lacked the necessary funds to provide his film with a proper continuity and editing job the acting performances are overall decent with ferdy mayne imitating christopher lee and jeffrey combs delivering the most memorable roles horror star can hardly be called a must see or even a good film but it's worth tracking down in case you're an admirer of enthusiastically made b horror
<START> this movie looked fun on the cover and i honestly thought 'how bad can this be ' little did i know out of the gate the dialogue was unbearable it was contrived unrealistic and not even interesting dialogue on upn syndicated television shows is more natural sounding the story was implausible and had nearly zero play off at the end the end with the snake is almost confusing and seemed staged the only remotely interesting character is rose who is mute which prevents her from being ruined with cliche ridden garbage dialogue well at least until the end when even she has to speak the only thing that even gives this a 3 over a 1 or 2 is rose nude scene truly awful save yourself the trouble and rent something more interesting like a barney video
<START> there are no flaws in this production perfectly entertaining fun and worthy of respect br br this is what theatre is all about definitely not for the very young but slightly older kids will get a great kick out of seeing it and can be introduced to theatre this way br br astounding and amazing
<START> this episode so far is the best of the series the story was told perfectly i especially liked how the writers made it a desmond episode it was his best performance to date and he definitely deserved the emmy for his performance br br we had some of our questions answered in this episode but since the show is called lost we know there will be more questions brought up too first the answered walt is reunited finally with his father michael second michael's betrayal is exposed to jack sawyer kate and and because of this betrayal kate jack and sawyer are all taken captive by the others this was a great way to end the show br br on the other side of the island we see locke going through a mental breakdown with the button this leads to another answered question about how the plane really went down however there are some unanswered questions first what happened to locke eko and desmond when desmond turned the key and what was the deal with the scientists in the arctic searching for electromagnetic guess we'll find out next season however great ending to the best show on tv
<START> the movie starts off relatively well and seems to be getting somewhere when an african american passenger an airline for negligence there is one scene in which his pet dog gets sucked into the engine and thats really a sad thing but the way it is portrayed makes it difficult for one to figure out if that was an attempt at crude humor or really a tragedy to reflect on the extent of negligence after this point they clearly ran out of ideas if you stuck around long enough you will soon be treated with one of the worst movies ever made it is basically a highly racist sequence of smoking dope toilet humor styling of each and every segment of the aircraft to reflect african american pop culture and pretty much nothing else you'd think that the only 3 white passengers onboard would lead to some hilarious consequences but nothing of the same happens they were basically just added to show how badly they could initially be treated and later be accepted into the hood if they behaved avoid
<START> electra glide in blue is a slow moving b flick in which blake plays a desert motorcycle cop who wants to be a homicide detective and becomes embroiled in a murder investigation a mediocre film at best eg in b features some members of the band chicago a whiff of action some philosophizing and lots and lots of boring dramatic filler not worth the time
<START> since the last horrid film and the fact that we only get the swiss german version in cinemas here i went to watch it with quite a bit of trepidation unfounded as i was happy to discover br br the film is funny and modern has good gags a good animation an amusing character interaction a good voice cast note i can only speak for the swiss german one except for the viking chief's daughter abba her name is great despite the not very inspired voice actress br br i especially liked the character in french in german he's the young man who is supposed to be put in shape he's a very amusing portrayal of a urban teenager but he's very likable despite the teenage mannerisms xd the interaction between and their young charge is fantastic and thoroughly entertaining br br it shouldn't be compared to the old films since this one is quite different which surprisingly doesn't make it bad on the contrary when they tried to modernize the last film twelve years ago they completely blew it this film however proved that it can be done just fine br br i came out of the theater cheerful always a good sign
<START> as over the past ten years or even longer the whole world is flooded with so called sitcoms actually only very few deserve this title 'cause they're so predictable king of queens is a very original unique and astoundingly funny alternation it's about the daily life of a and his wife who works as an attorney's assistant in manhattan in queens ny with them lives carrie's father arthur a picture book extrovert who is played by the fantastic jerry stiller and who steals the show from all the others every time he appears other important people are their best friends deacon and kelly a married couple and their other friend spence who's almost 30 and still lives with his mother what makes this show so unique and funny is above all that every single character seems so real and carrie's cynical sarcastic attitude is the total opposite of good natured slightly dumb optimism and arthur's the one who makes it absolutely unpredictable with his strange ideas and habits he often gets himself into trouble and doug and carrie have to drag him out of the mud even if in my opinion the quality of the show decreased a little within the last years it's still one of the best daily sitcoms ever made it takes a little time to get into the characters and relate to them but after that's done you get some unstoppable laughs from it although i think i couldn't survive one day with arthur in a closed room without beating the guts out of him i really adore him in this show watch and have fun i give it a 9 out of 10
<START> i took a group of young people who were the same age as the protagonists and it appealed to us all i agree with the other post the wilson guy worked a thankless script into a great minor character it is good to have a movie for a certain age demographic too old for pg too young for r it also shows how they think and maneuver in junior high school you had to love how well jimmy buffet did as the cool teacher he kept us adults awake the level of kids questioning authority was kept reasonable their motives were specific and not like some a d d rebel the setting and music were beautiful overall if you enjoyed holes this is really similar
<START> hindsight is a wonderful thing much reviled when it first appeared inspiring the famous review 'me no this precursor of cabaret can now be looked at in comparison and it's not half bad it's certainly no classic but it has its own wayward charm the film version of cabaret follows this plot whereas the stage version changed the plot somewhat one should of course resist the temptation to snicker when laurence harvey's christopher it keeps the original author's real name god knows what thought of it describes himself as 'a confirmed and while harvey is an utterly inadequate 'hero' he's virtually asexual and shelly winters woefully miscast as landauer the part marisa played in cabaret julie harris is a perfectly marvellous sally it's a lovely piece of comic acting and anton diffring is first rate as fritz the german jew in love with shelly's character of course if cabaret had never come along you might ask yourself would this ever have seen the light of day again that it has been revived may not quite be cause for celebration but it's perfectly acceptable all the same
<START> it's really rather simple the name of the movie is death bed the bed that eats if you are anything like me you already know if you are going to like this movie i stumbled across this gem at best buy the other day and picked it up for ten bucks i got ten bucks worth of enjoyment out of the title and the box alone br br i'm a huge fan of b movies this is in my opinion one of the greatest b movies i've ever seen now it's not for every one br br granted it's not even for most people as a matter of fact i suspect their are only going to be a handful of us who truly enjoy this movie br br for those of you who like b movies though this film is a diamond in the rough it has a great premise a bed that people it doesn't walk it doesn't move it doesn't have a siren call to attract people it pretty much relies on people wandering by and sitting on it br br i loved every inch of this movie and have already seen it three times in the scant weeks i've owned it br br like i said after reading the title of the film you already know if you'll like it if you laughed or smiled then give it a go it's worth it
<START> the basic idea for this movie was good but there was no real character development and the pacing was slow maybe because i saw it in a sloppily edited pan scanned video version it went straight to video in france
<START> i usually really enjoy steven seagal movies they are usually highly entertaining and being somewhat of an adept of aikido i usually like the way steven incorporates these martial art techniques in the fight sequences br br however this film is a really bad movie making effort and it seems obvious to me that the blame lies with the director and the producers who obviously have no idea how to make an action movie let alone direct someone like steven seagal and to take advantage of his knowledge and competence br br i never saw the end of this movie i walked out before the end simply because i couldn't stand watching anymore of this bad movie i am sure that many people also share my feelings
<START> oh dear this sequel has a mirror this time which houses the evil spirit of a psychopath which murdered an entire family with a shotgun in the amityville home the mirror captured the entire ugly incident of the horrified family who had no time to prepare for their uninvited guest the mirror is given to a photographer keyes ross partridge by a bum who just so happens to be his lunatic father and the man responsible for killing the family and it's evil soon terrorizes those in a loft such as painter pal suki portrayed by julia nickson soul where he lives when they look into it soon keyes is having nightmares looking through the eyes of his father as he guns down the family in cold blood worried that he might follow in his footsteps soon he sees other occurrences through his father's eyes like that terrible day pops bashed his mother's head against the floor of an institution or experiencing a moment inside the cell as doctor's administered a drug to immobilize him br br pretty solid supporting cast who deserve better than being stuck in junk like this such as david naughton american werewolf in london as the proprietor of the loft with which keyes lives richard roundtree as an eccentric sculptor artist terry o'quinn as a psychologist detective and especially lin shaye as a hilarious ditsy rather strange secretary nurse in the asylum the one which held father soon to be closed down br br rounding out the film the sexy leggy lala as supportive girlfriend barbara howard friday the 13th the final chapter as naughton's betrayed wife he was on the verge of starting an affair with soul jack as the sadistic fiend who attempts to provoke his son into killing innocent people as he did and robert a nightmare on elm street 2 freddy's revenge as a rejected lover of nickson soul who meets an unfortunate demise while ripping apart paintings as a revenge for his dismissal br br this film is a poor special effects movie merely using the amityville title as a cash in the franchise has never been that great to begin with but as each sequel was green lit it grew worse and worse after the third film furniture from the infamous house become possessed items tormenting folks the cast try hard though but the material a mirror causing chaos and murder through supernatural means is lacking in quality and the rather mediocre special effects don't help matters o'quinn as little as he has to work with shows why he's such a great actor he can even shine in excrement such as this all's not lost you get to see always wearing super short skirts or her man's shirt in panties showing off her legs throughout hey you have to find a silver lining somewhere believe it or not amityville a new generation was the seventh film in the franchise coolest part of the film were the portraits of demons painted by nickson artist perhaps inspired by the evil mirror after looking into it
<START> i didn't know a lot about this film going into it but i did find out that kane was a wrestler which didn't exactly thrill me but hey i liked santa's slay and that had a wrestler in it so what the hell the story begins very strangely and promisingly but after a while becomes not much more than your typical teen terror slasher flick although the settings helped some a bunch of criminal young folks get rounded up and taken to an old hotel that used to be a luxury palace but is now a dump to clean it up to prepare it as a homeless shelter the driver is a man with a prosthetic arm being a veteran of the opening scene of this movie wherein he encounters this big galoot that had just killed his partner and blinded another woman the teens all being punk smart asses all of course object to having to do any real work but they're part of some unique co ed work program yep what a great idea that is of course little does anyone suspect that there is someone lurking there in the hotel that in his own little way will save the tax payers of that state some money of course it's the guy that likes to collect eyeballs and he's got quite a collection going there won't be a lot here that horror fans haven't seen before but there's a few brutal scenes and sufficient gore to satisfy the hard core fan the setting of the old hotel makes a perfect spot for a slasher flick too and there's little sub stories like the search for an alleged safe full of money and the search for babes since this co ed work crew is evenly matched most of the teens are deservingly too so that works well not great but far better than silent hill or when a stranger calls and perhaps better than some of the other crap that i wouldn't bother to see 7 out of 10
