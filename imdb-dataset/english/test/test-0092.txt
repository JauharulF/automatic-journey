<START> it's nice to see a romantic comedy that does not have the prissy man lead this has solid acting from both male leads and also from the female lead and although the story is a little long and a little clichÃ© you cant help but like it br br i think the story was a little rushed at the end but extending that would have made the story even longer superior to other romantic comedies such as 100 days with mr arrogant and possibly tied with my tutor friend br br it would make an interesting introduction to korean cinema not as great as my sassy girl but still good
<START> rock star is a well told hollywood style rendition of the tale based on fact actually on how ripper became rob replacement for judas priest mark wahlberg poured on his likable boy ish charm and performed with believable admirably something he has been known to do since the release of boogie nights br br stephen herek no stranger to musically themed movies takes the audience through the wonders of the breakneck lifestyle of an extinct species the hair metal rock god wahlberg's izzy acts as the film's host plays the everyman who gets to see his wish come true his likable character quickly wins over the heart of the viewer who wants to see him succeed and gets the chance to give him the metal goat horn hand sign several times over br br the only real complaint with the story is that the supporting cast namely the other members of the band were not fleshed out or even introduced properly more interaction with these life long rock musicians would have amplified and solidified new surroundings br br naturally rock star is filled with great music rabin's score the steel dragon's original work and plenty of 80's style metal hits makes this soundtrack a must have let's all hope that films like rock star not only give a credibility to a style of music that helped define a generation but also spark a very needed revival
<START> val kilmer is almost nowhere in this film lucky for him he plays maybe 30 seconds of screen time and his role is completely irrelevant after seeing the film i couldn't tell you what role he plays in the film ok they suck you in the first hour by immersing you in dark underground tunnels spooky movies filmed in dark underground tunnels easily suck most people in to last the first 30 minutes to an hour then you will begin wondering why am i watching this i remember thinking how easy it must be for a director writer to use dark underground labyrinths to make a film simply film people wandering around in dark tunnels and you have instant suspense but that is where this movie goes no further we all wonder what goes bump in the night but there is nothing out there in the dark in this film but more darkness the story is even worse apparently there is an underlying story to the film that i learned of after watching the film but the film uses such poor dialouge that it never came across clearly during the screening i still don't understand what the writer director meant to say some children trapped underground by a misled sister in russia why are they in our time the same time as the characters are they ghosts br br this was an absolutely horrible film that drew me to write my first imdb review to warn others to avoid it
<START> brad pitt sticks his index finger in diane leg wound and keeps it there until he gets what he wants funny horribly so the invented yarn takes the dirty dozen for a ride and sometimes abandons it to pay tribute to other movies lots of fun even paris when it sizzles is mentioned in a delightfully organic piece of dialog i was thrilled by christoph character and by his sensational performance brad pitt creates a true original i love the actor's lack of vanity there's a quirk in the character that is pure brad pitt tarantino visits a new universe but fortunately his hand his brain and his heart are visible all over the place
<START> this may not be regarded as a review on any film but just a comment on a film i saw when i was a youngster i remember coming home of an evening all full of wonder at what i had seen i tried to retell my parents part of the story but they listened without understanding well what was so strange about two kids stranded on an island who fall in love and grow together and have a son as you must have guessed by now i'm referring to the blue lagoon 1949 which has kept me bewitched and bewildered through the years almost 50 and now wonder full of anxiety and disgust who or what has prevented the film from being available in cassette or dvd or whatever i've spent a lifetime chasing the opportunity to get hold of it one day and nobody knows anything about it what a waste indeed sorry if my english is not at all technical or scientific but my mother tongue is spanish i'm doing my best to make myself understood thank you my name is juan and i'm writing from uruguay in s america
<START> isaac florentine has made some of the best western martial arts action movies ever produced in particular us seals 2 cold harvest special forces and undisputed 2 are all action classics you can tell isaac has a real passion for the genre and his films are always eventful creative and sharp affairs with some of the best fight sequences an action fan could hope for in particular he has found a muse with scott adkins as talented an actor and action performer as you could hope for this is borne out with special forces and undisputed 2 but unfortunately the shepherd just doesn't live up to their abilities br br there is no doubt that looks better here fight wise than he has done in years especially in the fight he has for pretty much no reason in a prison cell and in the final showdown with scott but look in his eyes seems to be dead inside there's nothing in his eyes at all it's like he just doesn't care about anything throughout the whole film and this is the leading man br br there are other dodgy aspects to the film script wise and visually but the main problem is that you are utterly unable to empathise with the hero of the film a genuine shame as i know we all wanted this film to be as special as it genuinely could have been there are some good bits mostly the action scenes themselves this film had a terrific director and action choreographer and an awesome opponent for to face down this could have been the one to bring the veteran action star back up to scratch in the balls out action movie stakes br br sincerely a shame that this didn't happen
<START> with several name actors lance henrikson david warner joe don baker why was jeffery combs given the lead henrikson would have been a perfect fit for the lead as would warner baker or even others in the movie such as charles napier combs was miscast in this and did a poor job of it everything he did seemed fake or contrived br br the script is poor meaning that if lance henrikson or another had the lead role he might have saved the film removed it from my waste of time category but it still would have been a bad movie the screen play was completely lacking the director should have recognized this and helped the movie along
<START> tourist trap is an odd thriller that came out in the 70's it's about 5 friends molly jocelyn jones jerry jon van hess eileen robin sherwood becky tanya roberts and woody kevin mcdermott who stumble upon a down museum lost oasis a curious and eerie roadside museum this goldmine of decaying but strangely life like mannequins is run by chuck an eccentric but seemingly harmless has been has one warning for the youngsters stay away from reclusive and disturbed brother br br the curiosity gets the best of them and they go exploring the trap is sprung amidst flying objects slamming doors scarves that strangle on their own empowered by some hidden force the trap slowly closes in on the group the creature and his army of murderous mannequins make quick and brutal work of the friends until only one remains br br although not a slasher movie tourist trap still contains elements of slasher movies such as the chase scenes and the stalking and the fact the killer wears a mask br br the seemingly telekinetic abilities of the killer to lock bolts and animate the wax dummies is used to great effect perhaps the scariest thing about this movie are the mannequins which are admittedly scary enough to start off with but are rally spooky here the film succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously meagre budget these wax figures are blatantly plastic shop dummies but this only goes to serve as even more eerie when their eyes move with an incredible human the acting is actually pretty good chuck gives a well rounded and creepy performance as mr jocelyn jones is great as the female lead
<START> following is an intriguing thriller that requires constant awareness to be completely understood the plot has many twists and uses displaced chronology the event sequence complicates following following if you are willing to pay attention it is an exciting movie full of noir earmarks with the running time at 70 minutes there is a lot to take in but the fast pace helps to keep the viewer enthralled br br bill is a lonely untidy fellow who takes up shadowing people and seeing where they go what they do he is a bit too conspicuous however and eventually gets caught by a well dressed clean cut bloke named cobb cobb bill in a world the poor boy is not prepared to live in cobb is a smart rogue who seems to have complete control over the other characters by the end of the film the disjointed story is explained thoroughly the film is an excellent first effort from the talented christoper nolan who would go on to make memento one of the most original movies of our time
<START> is typically considered one of the 3 master founders of japanese film the other two being ozu and this is an interesting and honest film on the lives of retired geishas whatever happens when such a woman ages and loses her charm and mystique well for those who are interested watch this film one is successful as a money lender but the other two have to borrow from her and are resentful doesn't have any children but the other do finds out that her old love is coming to visit her and is excited is a master in subtle studies of his female protagonists' characters ultimately draws the viewer into the study of the questions of ones happiness and one's life worth very good film indeed
<START> it is playing on showtime right now but is going to be released as a movie called three or has been released for 2006 mess ups include a supposed nude body comes out of the waves with her bottoms on you can have fun finding the others it was a decent stranded hungry cold crazy person video but that is about it and of course what would a movie be without sex the lady has a nice body and the men are pretty but the story is the same as swept away or a savage is loose type with some blood wonder if the movie studios know they made a big booboo and already released this show and now gonna release it as three billy zane should have worn a top hair piece or shaved his head completely juan di pace is awesome and there is a couple good sex scenes there is a voodoo woman that loves the character di pace plays and in real life her name is di pace too not aware of any connection but probably kin or married
<START> first off let me say that this movie is nothing spectacular the cast is like the saved by the bell reunion the monster is a guy in a bad outfit and like always the military is useless it would seem that the more training you have and the bigger your gun the more likely it is that you will die if you're in a cheesy low budget horror movie apparently the people in the movie business have little respect for the navy seals the marines and ninjas who get it the worst the plot is thin a nutcase by the name of dr peÃ±a traps the he then smuggles it aboard a cruise ship where two members of the crew let it loose you can do your taxes and watch this movie and not miss a beat the most noteworthy part that really makes it all worthwhile revolves around the captains daughter toward the end she goes all martial arts on the monster and kicks his butt let me get this straight the monster wipes out the entire navy seals unit while they are using armor piercing ammunition ok its a movie it can happen right but here comes the captains daughter who can't be older than 19 and kicks the crap out of the with front and side kicks it was hilarious they should get a medal for coming up with that
<START> the movie is being televised as i write br br i simply forgot how horrible an experience i had watching it in the cinema br br the whole idea of the movie is flawed the fact that intelligent europeans and americans stranded in the desert forget all concept of morals and civilization within a couple of days is laughable the madness of lord of the flies was longer in the making br br details that annoy are plenty one is the single african god like character that mysteriously survives the horrible climate and have done so for ages without losing his mind and he seems to have no supply problems either ridiculous so too is the rescue attempt from the tour guide an indiana jones look alike whose rescue attempt ends in tragedy and death a 5 minute walk from the hut then there's the choice of lear imposed onto the group by a guru like joke of an artist he reminded me of my hippie high school art teacher br br the worst thing though is choice of lear obviously is an intellectual brain fart how that ever was going to be an pass time is never clear to me br br positives are few and far between it's a beautiful movie but that's never important br br high school intellectualism weird for the sake of weird it's a complete waste of time unless you like thrashing useless art movies
<START> well where to start describing this celluloid debacle you already know the big fat nada passing as a plot so let's jut point out that this is so pc it's offensive hard to believe that frank oz the same guy that gave us laugh riots like little shop of horrors and bowfinger made this unfunny mess br br so this guy doesn't know he's gay till this actor points it out ok sure if anyone ever says i'm gay i'll know the truth even if i currently like girls more than george luca likes a dollar br br and how to know the true nature of my sexuality well if i like classic dancing and barbra streisand i'm gay if i dress like a blind man in a hurry with half my shirt hanging out i'm straight oh sure br br and here's the big clichÃ© of clichÃ©s no matter how you look there's always a very attractive hollywood actor who'll adore every bit of grease under your skin or a top model who'll love your zero iq your butt ugly face and your pointing out ears if all those gay common places weren't enough to get me angry this did in real world looks matter folks and i know for sure br br i see it coming now you'll say relax it's a comedy don't take it so seriously if being a comedy gives anything carte blanche to suck out loud i think the world has a serious problem wouldn't be much better and funnier to make a movie to those old tiresome clichÃ©s instead of magnifying them over and over again br br so one of the absolutely worst movies i've ever seen 1 out of 10 if giving this rating has something to do with my sexual please let me know i'm interested
<START> i never thought i'd say this about a biopic but there is a near over abundance of characterization especially concerning kenji emotions and too little on the literal occurrences in his life by the end i'm not sure if he dies he's supposed to or if his sister finally dies she's supposed to or if the director spent a little too much time on the galactic railroad that's an inside joke in case you missed it wrote a children's book called night on the galactic railroad however this glimpse inside the mind of a writer who sketched poetry and fairy tales from his imagination is very intelligent creative entertaining and emotionally powerful br br all this despite the fact that everyone is animated as animals like in many of stories br br some of the visuals are truly astounding especially considering that it was a made for tv movie seriously some of them like the sequence with birds trailing blue light rival parts of fantasia however i still can't stand computer animation when it is mixed with cel animation the cgi trains are horribly obvious even more so than the anastasia train br br 8 10
