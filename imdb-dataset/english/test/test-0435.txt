<START> good old jess franco the always reliable choice of director in case you're looking for undemanding sleaze shameless exploitation and 200 jess once again really surpassed himself with this utterly trashy piece of jungle adventure let's face it this film is basically just an excuse to have the ravishingly hot and actress katja parade around topless it's actually a rather disturbing thought that an innocent 16 year old girl had to walk around a film set naked in front of a whole crew and particularly before the gazing eyes of pervert franco and it wasn't even the first time since the duo previously already made linda together anyways just in case you wondered yes diamonds of the does have a plot albeit a very imbecilic one during the opening sequences a plane carrying aboard a wealthy scottish guy and a girl child crash amidst an african tribe of vegetarian cannibals i say vegetarian because they never at one point in the film so much even attempt to consume human flesh the obnoxious scot declares himself the great white leader and the girl grows up to become the beautiful and scarcely dressed white goddess several years later an expedition reaches the middle of the jungle to get the girl back to civilization and Â even more importantly to steal some of the tribe's legendary diamonds this could have been a compelling and action packed adventure movie but jess franco obviously couldn't be bothered why shoot jungle chase sequences or bloody cannibalistic rites when you can just as easily aim your camera at a hot young chick sitting naked in a tree most of the jungle settings simply appear to be filmed in someone's garden and there's a massive amount of clumsily edited national geographic wildlife footage in order to fill up the gaps in continuity the back of the dvd describes diamonds of the as an ingenious feminist and adult orientated version of tarzan yeah right they just put that sentence there because katja character swings from one tree to another using a a couple of times
<START> solo starts as a team of us soldiers go into america to blow up a rebel airstrip joining them is a robot named solo mario van peebles who can use any weapon ever made is fifteen times stronger ten times faster than any human being something goes wrong though solo refuses to kill innocent civilians which colonel frank madden william sadler isn't happy about back at base general haynes barry corbin orders solo to be shut down one of solo's main directives is self preservation so decides to escape back into the south american jungles where colonel madden his men are sent in to recapture it br br this mexican american co production was directed by one has to say solo is awful the script by david corley was based on the novel by robert mason is one clichÃ© after another robots were popular at the time solo was made in hollywood at the box office so solo rip offs the likes of robocop 1987 universal soldier 1992 the two terminator flicks as well as having the same setting basic story as predator 1987 this is the usual rubbish about an emotionless robot who grows a sense of humanity while being around people at first he doesn't know what a joke is or why one person would care for another but by the end he develops emotions starts to befriend people sounds like terminator 2 judgment day 1991 to me the character's are poor colonel madden in particular is given absolutely no motivation for hating solo at all why he would kill other us soldiers disobey orders to destroy it you know i saw this on cable telly last night for free thank god i didn't spend any money on it i looked it up in the tv guide do you know what it said my tv guide described solo as a sci fi action starring mario van which when i think about it is a perfect description of solo in less than ten words my tv guide has hit the nail on the head i mean it's a sci fi action film it certainly stars mario van peebles it's definitely dire enough said really br br director doesn't do anything particularly special here the action scenes lack any real excitement the sci fi elements are virtually none existent apart from the fact solo is a robot so the military lose solo colonel madden is sent in to recapture it right i'm not being funny but wouldn't the military have put a 'self mechanism inside solo in case something like that happened surely at the very least solo would have had a tracking device inside it so the military would at least know where it was at any given time i'm not being funny but these people can come up with a walking talking robotic soldier but they are not clever enough to realise that a tracking or self destruct device might be useful if anything went wrong the violence is mild there are a few ok fight scenes but this is pretty weak stuff really br br technically the film looks alright is competently made it was actually shot in mexico the makers of the dolph lundgren action flick agent red 2000 edited footage from solo into that film the acting is poor van peebles was the perfect choice to play an emotionless robot william sadler deserves better than this it was only a few years prior he was staring in the fantastic die hard 2 die harder 1990 br br solo is a really bad sci fi action flick which is basically a huge rip off of big budget hollywood sci fi action films like robocop universal soldier the terminator films not recommend i'm going to start pay more attention to my tv guide when it comes to choosing films to watch
<START> for all those people who believe the dialog is worth something and who appreciate a farce that is clever enough for you to take it seriously this movie will surprise you it is not a for people who can't aren't able to follow the verbal exchange of our hero professor dexter cornell dennis quaid br br cornell teaches in southern california near the tar pits he has not published a novel in four years his wife is divorcing him he drinks a bit much and is blessed or cursed with caustic wit which he freely dispenses to his students he has recommended a friend for advancement and one bright young student has submitted a manuscript to him as an independent project cornell doesn't even want to read it so gives it an a and pushes it to the side leaning back with a drink in his office he stares out the window when the bright young student falls past his window on the way to meeting the sidewalk in a splat encounter br br hal comes to talk and they chat drinking some more the cornell realizes that he has to read the manuscript now when he goes home his wife is waiting with divorce papers he drinks some more she leaves and he goes to a faculty affair only to find her there he drinks even more and when his wife learns that the student is dead she swoons and he learns that she had been having an affair with the student this of course prompts him to do some more serious drinking the next morning he wakes up to find himself in the dorm room of one of his students a freshman named syd meg ryan br br he feels worse than a hangover goes to the doctor and learns that he has been poisoned it is irreversible and he has 24 48 hours to live he doesn't have much time to find out who killed him and there are sub plots motives relationships and surprises at every turn although everything makes sense at the end all his discoveries and exchanges are adorned with sarcasm dry wit and keen observations let's just say that this movie will give new meaning to the adage publish or perish br br there are no bad performances in this movie there are recurrent images and symbolism used at careful intervals watch for the cracked glass and images distorted through glass some of the camera shots are revolutionary for 1988 and some of the violent action is carefully and skillfully choreographed the music is unobtrusive and appropriate although occasionally it makes it's own statement in song lyrics the visuals in this flick are impressive br br if there are any failures it is that the opening 20 minutes move a little slow and nearly puts you to sleep but the pacing picks up quickly with just the right amount of exposition in between action segments br br there are no explicit sexual encounters although there is violence and some bad language br br this is a writer's movie and is best appreciated by those who have a sense of humor about their own success or failure i do think if you take it seriously you're already in big trouble
<START> i wish i could have given this a zero sure i'll admit that i also mistakenly picked this up thinking it was the spielberg version a clever marketing ploy releasing it at this time and being prominently displayed at the video store however i was willing to give it a go anyhow i wish i wouldn't have br br where do i start i have read some of the other reviews here and have to say i disagree with anyone who thinks any of the acting was good sorry even c thomas howell stunk none of the performances were any good not a one br br even if the acting was decent the dialog is terrible and dick skinners just doesn't really cut it br br now as for the story well it was terribly adapted and must have been edited by a 5 year old the main character is constantly running into situations that are way convenient or at least appear that way due to how the film was edited together for example he is trying to get to a place called new hope to find his brother during a brief break someone just randomly hands him the directions to new hope what the hell is that when he gets to new hope he just happens to stumble onto his dying brother then there is the part where he has been traveling away from his destination for days and just happens to come across the car his wife and son were traveling in he was going in a different direction then they were how did that car end up where he was he has a black back pack that randomly appears and disappears throughout the film there are parts of the film where the characters are just waking up in the morning and then two seconds later it is night or worse yet dusk of the next day i also can't forget the main character and the preacher falling through the floor of a house for no reason we don't find out until later that an alien has landed on the house which reminds me of the moment when they are walking and suddenly find themselves standing under an alien they didn't notice what the hell the aliens are like two stories tall with huge bodies and multiple legs how could they miss it there is one point where an alien kills a random citizen supposedly by spitting some kind of junk at him but you never see the stuff fly it just appears on the guys face the special effects in general are terrible the entire movie is like a bad train wreck when we finally get to the end after this guy trying to get to dc to find his family they just appear no searching no asking questions nothing just oh there you are i am so happy the end br br i am sorry if my review rambles a bit but this movie was so bad i had a hard organizing my contempt please save yourself the time and don't watch this sneakily displayed pile of cinematic stench it is quite possibly the worst film i have ever witnessed i would rather have been getting a root canal it would have been less painful
<START> for an indy film this is probably a bit better than a 3 out of 10 but in general it only gets a 3 the effects aren't horrible and at least they have some adults playing adult roles rather than all kids as a lot of indy low budget horror films do the acting is very wooden but at least they had a better display than some films in the shoestring budget category it's filmed a lot inside a building rather than a friend's basement the plot as a whole isn't the worst it's a resident evil rip off about an evil corporation invading a small town and an outbreak makes people into zombies i would have liked to have seen some sort of creatures rather than the big baddie just be another super zombie i try not to write spoilers but this review has one so be warned spoiler alert not only do some of the cast just seem to shrug past the zombies the same ones are recycled over and over but at least they have more then 5 people playing them but one of the plot twists really doesn't fly with me the deputy who goes inside turns out to be on the evil corporations payroll he kills one of the other employees in cold blood and then meets with the head bad guy in an office talking about cleaning up the mess the deputy has just shown us that he is a real bad person too and talks like he can clean it up meaning kill all the surviving witnesses no problem but then 2 seconds later he is helping them out there was no real change of heart emotion or anything to make me feel that this bad guy went from killing an innocent guy just minutes ago and then talking about taking everyone out no problem to being their savior there was no incident or anything to make me buy into this worth watching if you are a fan of low budget flicks otherwise you will not enjoy this
<START> i didn't like this movie for so many reasons i can't even say then all i thought it was poorly made just because of the whole story line i mean who is gonna believe that they captured the and it broke loose on a cruise liner lame it was all right for a lame straight to video movie but not worth spending money on it i can't believe someone actually gave this movie a ten but i guess there are people that like this movie i gave this movie a 2 instead of a 1 just because it was about the and it had the guy off of lord of the rings if you want to see this movie i would stay home and wait till it comes on sci fi channel don't waste your money on seeing this movie believe me
<START> one of his lesser known films many horror fans have yet to catch this dario argento offering which is unfortunate it is underappreciated mostly because of the fact that really not enough people have seen it the film boasts grade a argento gore with his customary close ups set to savage rock scores while it true that this script is not very complex it is not nearly as bad as other entries in its genre or his own personal resume for that matter br br this movie symbolizes more of the that he likes to portray in his films by his own admission worth a good look on any night
<START> i don't know about you but i go to horror films to be scared and this was anything but scary the movie had several chances to be truly scary and failed miserably every time several of these supposedly suspenseful moments were haunted by some of the worst cg you will see this year perhaps decade i mean when i say the cg looks like daytime tv i'm giving daytime tv a bad name i've seen better stuff on the sci fi channel who i really feel sorry for is the actors that they have their names attached to this film they did a good job i cared about most of the characters and i felt that their performances were quite good but that was not enough to bring this movie out of the gutter whats really amusing is the reuse of some of the sets if you have seen exorcist the beginning it will be easy to spot the reuse of some of the buildings however what i thought was the worst thing about this film even above the cg problems was the main demon he was just not scary in anyway his form the way he talked he was extremely bland all in all this movie was a horrible experience and i would have walked out of the theater if it weren't for my wife wanting to see the end
<START> when you have waited years to see a film that you have heard on the grape vine about obviously your expectations are high right f k yeah but when this baby dropped through my door little did i know what f ed up visuals would grace my tv and warp my fragile mind first off hussein is a film fan like all of us growing up on a diet of argento fulci lynch etc and it shows in this film but in a good way although i didn't really know what the hell was going on on my first watch of this gem i was just amazed by the visuals the lighting and of course the performances from everyone who was involved must have truly believed that he was going to push the boundaries in film making which trust me he does and that he was going to have a hard job convincing the actors to do the same br br so what can i tell you about subconscious cruelty well without spoiling it its a deep insight into the human psyche with images of violent and sexual madness which toils into madness a truly unforgettable experience br br keep you eye on hussein he can only go onto better things br br i viewed the full uncut print of subconscious cruelty on a double disc dvd from infliction films which is loaded with extras please note there is a censored hong kong release out there avoid this version
<START> i think that most people would agree with me if i were to say that the movie alien pretty much set the bar for atmosphere i've seen quite a few movies match that bar but none have ever exceeded alien's eerie tunnels and darkened halls the cave is a film that tries very hard to reset the bar i believe the trailer even mentioned something about being as scary as alien yet not once throughout the movie did i ever feel even the slightest bit scared or thrilled for that matter br br so now that we got the ball of negativity rolling i might as well explain why the cave's main hook the atmosphere in case you weren't paying attention fizzled into a waste of my time i'll say right now that most of the sets were gorgeous and nicely lit but what we hear and what we know is there tend to ruin what we see the music for one is terrible we either get corny rock music or over exaggerated haunted house music okay maybe that's pushing it a bit but i couldn't bear it the many underwater scenes were bad enough it's a well known fact that underwater scenes are always boring as hell i didn't need rock music blaring in my ears while they were simply swimming through a cave this actually produced a lot of unintentional laughter that was then amplified by the following crash scene br br anyway as i already mentioned it wasn't just the music that killed the atmosphere heck no the creatures hiding amongst the darkness are supposed to invoke horror i'm supposed to be worried that they are going to appear and merely a glimpse of them is supposed to make my blood turn cold the cave does wisely take a page from the alien handbook by not showing the entire creature for very long and leading up to the reveal with only glimpses but it just doesn't work because the creatures are so lame i guess it would be rude to spoil the specifics but they are basically the aliens with wings br br i guess you get the point by now atmosphere ruined yet i know plenty of people who will still see a movie if it's exciting i'd like to say that about the cave but i'd be lying this movie is slow to get to the action and once we get there we sort of wonder when the thing is going to finally call it a day we've seen all this done better before with the exception of a few neat scenes the guy impaled on the eel and the rapids so you really don't get any thrills from watching people running from uninspired alien knockoffs in endless tunnels br br ah but no the pain doesn't end there we must also take the characters and acting into account well i can't remember a single line of dialogue other than run and the only character's name i can remember is jack but that's only because it's placed in almost every other line near the end of the movie perhaps the actors were capable but the script didn't allow them to do anything other then run and argue they had almost no background and whenever somebody died they simply shrugged it off it's pretty sad when you consider that the cgi eel puts on the best performance in the film br br speaking of cgi there's plenty of it most of which is terrible i do commend them on using suits at least i think they were suits but nothing truly meshes with the environment and as a result most of the effects end up looking pretty hokey br br so i guess to wrap it up the cave is bad and has very little going for it had the film been a scifi channel premiere movie or low budget direct to video release i might have a bit more love for it but this film was a theatrical release with more wit and talent this might have been a frighteningly fun movie but as it stands this film is about as scary as going into the basement and that's not very good br br my review from frider waves http friderwaves com index php page cave
<START> for the uninitiated almost any andy milligan film is a shock but despite the fact that i've seen many of his films this one still takes the cake for sheer shoddiness br br this is of course milligan's take on the sweeney todd tale done with period costumes but not necessarily period hairstyles in some cases and the usual headache inducing camera work grainy quality as for the gore well the version i saw may have been cut some for there's not a lot for a film with bloodthirsty in the title the best indication of subversive film making here is a meat pie consisting only of some poor victim's tit br br so while i will still treasure this piece of uh work on my video shelf it's definitely somewhat of a letdown as far as content though recommended for only the foolhardy morbidly curious 3 out of 10
<START> a truly masterful piece of filmmaking it managed to put me to sleep and to boggle my mind so boring that it induces sleep and yet so ludicrous that it made me wonder how stuff like this gets made avoid at all costs that is unless you like taking invisible cranial punishment in which case i highly recommend it
<START> i saw this film on the a e channel this past weekend the mystery was okay i was not able to guess the culprit before the end but i enjoyed the characters and their development much more than the mystery there was a mystery about some of them especially george performed by the wonderful michael and george's cousin susannah in fact the story of those two characters left me wanting to know more from what i've tried to glee about the agatha christie book of the same title i think this film did not follow it to the letter very good performances by the actors involved especially and the lady who played cora companion
<START> i just want to say that chris role as williams for that entire show was emmy worthy it was uncanny how well he did and to be as rapid fire and as random and as creative as robin williams really is wow there were scenes where had to say probably 20 rapid fire lines and do 15 different characters while delivering those lines all while sounds as much like robin williams doing those characters well that my friends is impressive acting its one thing to do a robin williams impersonation for a couple of minutes its another to do it for a whole tv movie br br i don't know how i felt about the whole show and i don't know how much they played with the facts but i do know that it was chris that kept me watching so for that i give him a 10
