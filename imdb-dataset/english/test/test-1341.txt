<START> this should be re named everybody loves sebastian the 1983 rural go nowhere town high school junior or senior they seemed to flip flop on that one with weird hair and leo like good looks has a big plate full of issues his step dad announces definite plans to have a sex change operation upon which his mom calls the marriage quits sebastian is called the f word by everyone and their mother all the while kissing around with various girls getting high on ready whip at a supermarket and saving a strawberry prostitute from the clutches of her ruthless pimp br br sebastian's buddies make eddie look like a choir boy bad association doesn't get much worse sebastian seems to go for harold's suicide attempts record although he won't admit suicidal for no apparent reason the genius level sat scoring sebastian must graduate a year early although he has no clue about the future nor does he want to attend college what gives with this nonsense br br this film is a look into a few weeks in the life of someone who is pretty messed up the final scene suggests that things will be alright although the how is left entirely up to the viewer br br the makers of this film seem to bank solely on the undisputed appeal of the very attractive male lead the story leaves a lot to be desired looking for what will this gorgeous kid do next doesn't exactly satisfy the lackluster production values just don't measure up to other films independent or otherwise a low budget and weak story need more than a pretty face to carry it through the results of this project are forgettable and an insult to intelligent cinema fans
<START> i hate to say it but i really do think this one's overrated and i love jackie's films it's got more plot behind it than usual but unfortunately though it has some great stuff i find it to be a bit slow all in all i say it's entertaining but not great
<START> the story isn't very strong don't expect a bourne identity kind of movie it started of strong tara speaking russian and it even sounded credible not that i'm the russian language expert moscow had that darkish depressing look what gave this movie potential i still believed in it to bad it only took about half an hour to see they really missed the spot with this one acting was poor maybe because the story itself was not very strong there is this part in the movie where gordon patrick nick moran is having a conversation on the phone with the c i a like you're listening to a chinese w t f too bad the writer didn't even take little effort to give the main characters depth also bit of a cheap and easy ending br br plus point is almost every scene where tara reid is in not that she's acting that well in fact she doesn't but she really looks great in this movie overall it was a bit of a disappointment rental maybe
<START> from the epicenter of the cultural globe four working class teenagers attempted to change the world through music and fashion it was the final attempt to do so last century and they failed before the dust had cleared band manager and sex shop proprietor malcolm mclaren spent the money the sex pistols had earned to make a mockumentary about his own role in their success the film was called the great rock 'n roll swindle take the hint and consists of very little footage of the sex pistols actually playing music and quite a lot of footage of mclaren effectively calling the audience idiots br br cod surrealist nonsense in which guitarist steve jones is a detective on mclaren's tail soon dissolves so he and drummer paul cook can jet off to rio and spend time with great train robber ronnie biggs ready yourself for the spectacle of three very unappealing men dancing naked to a hideous irony free version of was a gas a song about killing jews for gold in bergen concentration camp and another song sung in ronnie's tone deaf whine which includes the lyrics god save myra hindley god save ian brady lyrics that johnny rotten would have considered distasteful the sid vicious scenes are few and idiotic jumping out of bed in a thong with a swastika over the testicles to sing some bad boy biker song from the '50s playing into to the punk's a joke theme of the movie in an attempt to turn sid into james dean i'm surprised mclaren doesn't take credit for death too the redeeming scenes are those of sid in paris and the infamous performance of my way the punk rock zeitgeist right there mocking an adoring audience before shooting them all no need for an entire film just watch that clip on youtube br br from julien temple's far superior and more enjoyable 2001 documentary followup the filth and the fury we were given a more balanced honest view of what transpired in '78 but there were also a number of scenes that i would have liked to have seen in swindle as fury was basically a of the same material one was an animated sid complete with sid's voice acting you f betta out alright or i'll slice you open a still of which appeared on the cover of the something else 7 inch a snippet was shown in fury but i don't know what context that originally appeared was it in original prints but removed after sid's death was there more fury also shed light on the film who killed bambi which would have been the mock hard day's night movie mclaren was originally intending to make it starred sting as a member of a gay new romantics group and looked a damn sight more entertaining than swindle br br sod swindle a swindle if you must rent the filth and the fury and revel in music's failure as a world changing polemic
<START> probably one of his lesser known films it suffers from the same lack of exposure as salvador in that its actually one of his best br br written by and starring eric bogosian talk radio tells the story of an opinionated radio phone in host who upsets the wrong kind of listener the film is important and has much to say on the issues of free speech and just how free it should be and you can easily tell that it started life as a stage play know what you're getting into before you sit down to watch it and you'll be fine br br there isn't much to the acting really as bogosian pretty much steals the film he wrote and is given licence to rant i couldn't take my eyes off him and that was part of the fascination many of the listeners had the people who hated him wouldn't turn off in case they missed something br br not for everyone but a very good drama and overall a very good film
<START> may contain spoilers br br the first time i saw this movie was when it was re released on video when i was around 8 years old now i am 17 and still watch it whenever i get a chance to the aristocats was a cute heart warming film that i immediately fell in love with i loved the songs on it especially the one the kittens sing by the piano in fact i even sang it in a talent show with my sister and friend since i loved it that much all three kittens are so cute and their mother is one of the prettiest cartoon cats i ever saw the ally cat had a great voice br br my favorite part of the movie is when the kittens are playing the piano that part is adorable i also enjoy their journey home it's incredible this is one of the best disney films i ever saw and one of my favorites everyone should see it i give this film 10 10 stars
<START> a really funny story idea with good actors but it misses somehow the actors are older but none of them looked particularly good they needed better make up photography or something it is supposed to be a love story and yet the film had more of the rough look of a street film i liked the cast but i think the performances were rather bland this is where the weakness of the director shows perhaps if mrs spielberg had mr spielberg directing it would have been a much better film
<START> this is a whodunnit in the hitchcock tradition you are kept in the dark as suspects come and go dennis quaid is supurb as dexter a man doomed to die and meg ryan excellent as his babe there is not much not to like in this little suspense and all the pieces fit neatly together the way they should you won't be sorry you watched this one if you like suspense
<START> suburban kids meet the forest killjoy is better in this part he is more wicked and stronger as well nevertheless most part of the acting is bad as well like in the first one sometimes the characters say things to each other that do not make sense and are not convincing i made an error to watch this one sober you'll probably enjoy it more if you are not if you did not already stop loving clowns after the first movie you definitely will after the second br br problem kids and their watchers are on their way to a camp in the forest and what a coincidence their car broke right in the middle of a forest and at night that's just their luck they find a house and one got shot one of the watchers stays behind why i do not know and the rest eventually finds another house in that house a voodoo priestess lives but she is not responsible for the resurrection of killjoy who is it then well you better watch the movie and find out for yourselves
<START> i had high hopes for this one after reading the back of the dvd in the spirit of american pie and animal house after suffering through this i realized i just blew 2 50 to rent it this movie started out slow and just got slower brief and fleeting moments of levity proved that it was in the spirit of american pie if you mean spirit as a dead thing not very entertaining or fun don't be fooled like i was and expect anything barely watchable because this movie will depress you more than entertain you need to fill up three more lines for this stupid movie that doesn't deserve the effort what a stupid piece of ignorant crud this movie wreaked even the brief nudity sucked
<START> i saw this movie about 12 years ago and i can still remember it as if i just saw it recently that is how much this movie has affected me br br considering this is a movie from the 50's i think it was ahead of its time it surprised me as in how it maintains its integrity in this subject some might have considered taboo back then very realistic in showing the tumultuous and journey that an addict chooses to embark on one can only imagine how the audiences were affected by the realism of this movie back in those days br br i personally think is was one of frank sinatra's top five performances in the big screen br br when others are discussing movies dealing with mental illness and or addiction i always recommend the man with the golden arm as one of the top five to watch
<START> whoever filled this stupid idea of acting and producing a movie in head which is always hidden under a cap covering almost half of his face all the time only hope this is first and the last as well for god's sake from to gayatri mantra himesh has tried every thing to create an aura of his so called singing talent which is nothing but atrocious pronunciations of words like which completely kill the beauty of the terms so commonly used for love songs why does himesh not smile simple because he does not use close up toothpaste now there this friend of his tailing him around every where and this number one lawyer in the town who has to herself sexily wiggle and try to seduce himesh of all the handsome german people she might have met earlier perhaps the male lawyers on this part of the world might be cursing their fate for destined to deal with the stiff unattractive lot every day the action scenes are so funnily shot like the event planner attacked by the thief autos riding over the cars so on and so forth the father of the bride seems to be in a great hurry to get rid of his daughter by marrying her off that he flies to and fro around most hypocrite he praises hr for distributing love among people of the world as if they were sweets and on his back coolly gives a lecture to his daughter on these show business men when himesh is proved innocent he again unceremoniously dumps the other guy as if it's a game of musical chair i didn't get to se the poor guy's face even did you in the role of ria looks as if she is in need of an eye check up for strain in her eyes the fellow in the role of a friend is good who has acted quite naturally and should be in better movies like sharman joshi for example child artist in brief appearance is sweet but wasted it seems today's young generation has gone nuts since they prefer this kind of mockery of lyrics and musical scores and associate gossip with it for example if you sing ek bar aaja the ghost would come this is a weird taste in music and rather funny i am surprised how such classic lyricists like gulzar have opted for himesh of all the people to give music there is story in that a crow attachÃ©s so many feathers of a peacock to look beautiful and appeal to the birds but the feathers fall off ultimately and the real dark crow is revealed hope himesh takes a hint and refrains from manufacturing such meaningless stuff and wasting precious money which he has earned by taxing his short nose so much his friend does tell him if your nose is cut how will you sing thanks for showing us germany himesh at a reasonable cost of renting the dvd and correct those spelling mistakes will you an extra e in movie and no e in love there is also a famous number from the old film sholey mehbooba on which mallika once again but this time with himesh winking at her and conveniently ria his so called real love and his new bride is not around now that was very clever himesh at least one thing in this movie which you have done smartly to justify presence but doesn't she look a bit washed down
<START> i am deeply disturbed by some posts i am reading on the message boards for this movie people saying it is actually a good movie just because this movie is uwe boll's best to date does not make it a good movie at all no way in hell far cry is a clichÃ©d mess full of bad acting poor direction and an uninspired story with a shoddy script this is boll's first pure action movie and news flash people action movies aren't too hard to make because for a basic action flick all you need is explosions and gun battles scattered around a flimsy plot and hey mr boll succeeds in doing that house of the dead alone in the dark and bloodrayne all horror games adapted into movies by boll are far worse than this they have no redeeming qualities far cry boasts two things which make it his best yet two good leads and a couple of well done action sequences til schweiger is quite good as jack carver and emmanuelle vaugier is a strong female lead the usually great udo kier is passable as the clichÃ©d villain and the supporting cast are pretty damn bad towards the end of the film there is a surprisingly tense chase sequence which came as a shock considering boll was behind the camera br br unfortunately the rest of the movie has an incredibly cheap feel to it with bad cgi lame one liners and clichÃ©s around every corner oh and the worst lead up to a sex scene i think i have ever scene not only have the two only known each other for six hours but all it takes is for him to say he kept warm while in the army by spooning his fellow soldiers he already got her to take his clothes off by merely telling her to then he took his off and climbed into bed because he was afraid of hypothermia br br anyway to summarise this is a bad movie it is mindless action movie that can kill 80 minutes if you are totally bored one could probably do worse than popping this in and watching it but i'd personally say watch a classic action film like die hard or predator and stay away from this derivative mess br br 1Â½ 5
<START> i first saw signs of life on pbs as an american playhouse presentation it's a wonderfully written ensemble production with terrific performances by michael lewis as joey and vincent d'onofrio as his brother daryl arthur kennedy in one of his last roles is also excellent as an aging shipbuilder whose family business is about to close the rest of the cast which includes beau bridges kathy bates and mary louise parker give remarkable clarity and substance to their characters br br the direction is subtle and effective i've watched this movie several times over the years and would very much recommend it a beautiful piece of filmmaking
<START> note after writing this review i see that this listing is indeed about the tv series and not the original film my mistake i thought imdb for a database for movies not tv shows but since most people will look up this film under bagdad cafe and not out of which strangely is the name this film is listed under on imdb i'll leave this comment here br br maybe i missed something but when i read that other review it seemed to be entirely a review of the cbs series which must have been loosely based on this film i did not see the tv series and i might like it or not but one thing i am sure is that it is very different than this film this film is not like a tv show at all and whoopie goldberg is not in it or any other famous hollywood stars other than jack palance who was very charming in his role br br this is a terribly sweet movie that totally thinks outside the box it is not at all like a hollywood formula movie which is probably why the what's a nice word for idiots who decide to market movies or not decided not to market this one br br first of all this movie captured my heart and imagination from the get go from the music which is just part of the time so you can't really call it a musical to the cinematography to the really cool story br br a german or bavarian woman very pretty and quite plump gets in an argument with the other german or bavarian man with whom she is traveling through the california desert with and parts ways with him he taking off in the car and she left to fend for herself on a deserted and desert like highway out in the middle of nowhere br br she finds the small and dilapidated but charming bagdad cafe in bagdad california and checks in the rest of the story is magic i don't want to try to describe this film because i want you to enjoy every surprise br br warning if you are a racist or have something against big women you will not like this movie as the main romantic lead is a big woman and characters of brown and red skin have large roles and are included as part of the mix without any racism involved br br i gave this film a 10 for orginality entertainment and sheer
