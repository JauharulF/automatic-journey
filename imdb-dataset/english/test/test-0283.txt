<START> i can't describe the feeling when i got this crappy vhs rental cassette in my hands about 20 years ago somehow i got my father to rent it for me and i watched it twice with my little brother yes we got nightmares this film was originally rated as pg in the us in many other countries including finland it was restricted under 18 or 16 the film was aimed to teenagers but this must be the goriest pg rated film ever there's no bad language or nudity in it what so ever originally made in 1981 stayed on the shelves for a couple of years before release br br this is an a class b movie a true well made 80's horror flick a bunch of college girls decide to spent a night in a mausoleum not knowing that a supernatural evil awaits br br you can almost smell the rotting flesh and feel the atmosphere of this movie it's campy utterly stupid but they just can't make these movies anymore there is definitely a certain feel to this 80's horror genre this one is still effectively spooky and entertaining after all these years br br the effects are just oozing quality by ellis burman jr and thomas r burman the make up effects play a big part in this flick otherwise it would've been just a boring teen slasher br br it's now available on dvd at last and it's a special edition dvd including some extras too commentary track is interesting br br in fact this version isn't so special after all below average transfer on dvd some glitches and scratches here and there at first it was going to be released by the blue underground but unfortunately it was canceled so shriek show released it without restoring the print too bad br br great date movie br br recommended br br note i only gave 8 out of 10 because of the nostalgic values otherwise 6 out of 10
<START> i had never heard of this film and only got it because i am a martin sheen fan now i am stunned as to why it did not receive the praise and recognition that it truly deserves the four characters all make you feel for them the father trying to assert his authority the mother still clinging to traditional family values and both trying to keep up appearances despite the total fragmentation of their family the daughter wanting her own life and the son haunted by his experiences in vietnam one felt that this was a scenario that must have been played out in thousands of 'ordinary' families after vietnam emilio estevez as jeremy was superb totally unhinged by his war experience which none of his family could relate to the screen chemistry between him and his real life father martin sheen was amazing and there were times when anguished face was so like martin's in apocalypse now i feel sure that just as martin has counted as one of his best films emilio will count this one as one of his best too the scene with the gun was totally mind blowing as all the emotions were there on the family's faces brilliant acting by estevez sheen and kathy bates i watched the film for the first time last night and today the lead story in the news was about a gulf war veteran who had shot several members of his family how many more young men are going to have their lives destroyed by war
<START> miserable film not even to be compared in one breath with to kill a mockingbird or in the heat of the night br br yes there is racial prejudice but the film is at most ridiculous br br come now would you really have elizabeth patterson of all people guarding a jail so as to avoid a lynching patterson in her day played everyone's mother and was the landlady in i love lucy before fred and ethel mertz bought the building br br imagine the body so that it will not come out that the black man's gun killed a white man br br claude jarman jr who was so fabulous in the yearling appears in this mess he still had those sad eyes my eyes would be sad too if i appeared in this awful film br br to me this was nothing more than a faulkner flop all the way
<START> gerald richard carlson and kitty veronica hurst have just finished celebrating their engagement announcement in france with family and friends when he receives a letter asking him to visit an ancestral castle located in scotland uncle reportedly has fallen ill and has requested gerald the sole heir be present gerald goes off to scotland leaving his future bride behind a few weeks pass and he doesn't come back concerned kitty sends out telegrams but doesn't hear back from her fiancÃ© four more weeks pass and kitty finally receives a weird response from gerald calling off the engagement and telling her to move on with her life not ready to give up on her relationship and looking for answers kitty hops on a plane and decides to pay gerald a visit accompanying her on the trip is her level headed aunt edith katherine emery best known for her starring role in the classic chiller isle of the dead when kitty and edith arrive at the estate they immediately suspect something strange is afoot for starters gerald seems to have aged twenty years in a matter of weeks secondly this once nice and charming guy has turned into a complete jerk who repeatedly demands they leave the castle and never come back when edith comes down with a mild cold kitty uses it as an excuse to stay there to try to get to the bottom of things br br why is gerald being so cold and cruel to the woman he was just about to marry why is gerald so opposed to having company why do the house rules state that guests must be locked inside their bedrooms at night why are guests forbidden to enter certain areas of the estate such as bedroom and a large hedge maze out back and what's making those strange dragging noises every night these are just some of the questions the maze poses the movie actually does a fine job building up mystery and intrigue you genuinely become interested in what's going on and patiently await the resolution to explain the weird events that are taking place and then it happens i definitely don't want to ruin the finale of this film because you're better off not knowing but it takes one of the most unbelievable and jaw droppingly strange turns i've seen in any movie it's wonderfully ludicrous in a way but it also takes a pretty solid little b w mystery and sends it straight into z grade schlock territory and yet this ending seems so out of place you're not likely to forget it once you see it br br despite the ending or maybe even partially because of the ending i really enjoyed this odd bird it's extremely talky and slow moving for the duration of the run time but it managed to keep my interest throughout director william cameron menzies who made the much more famous invaders from mars the same year is best known as a two time oscar winning art director and his set designs here are also really interesting there's almost a silent movie feel at times with model work for some of the exteriors some painted backdrops and sparsely decorated interiors with very high ceilings as with any good castle set there are also secret passageways and long staircases this one also throws in a few rubber bats on strings for good measure br br a few of the actors are a little stiff and awkward but i liked most of the cast hurst is one of those obscure and mostly unknown actresses who unfortunately never seemed to catch on despite being both beautiful and talented emery who also gets to play narrator in framing shots at the beginning and end of the film is decent enough as the overly mannered and cautious aunt my favorite however was michael pate as the silver haired sinister servant who does this hilariously upright zombie walk every time he ascends the stairs also on board in smaller roles are hillary brooke who played the title role in the sherlock holmes mystery the woman in green and lilian bond whale's the old dark house of course carlson also starred in it came from outer space creature from the black lagoon and some other horror flicks so you've got yourself a pretty decent cast for genre fans right there i say check it out
<START> when it comes to movies i don't easily discriminate between crap pure crap and masterpieces i believe this movie is an absolute masterpiece and it's hard to keep me entertained for more than 90 minutes this movie ran slower than mystic river and harry potter 3 combined and i still managed to stay riveted to my seat for me it was the passion that eric bogosian put into his performance it's extremely difficult to pull off such a stunt and manage to garner any positive effect from it bogosian probably nailed one of the toughest single man performances in modern cinema i didn't have any respect for bogosian until the end of the film the entire monologue minutes before the inexorable climax was the turning point it was the key that turned me around this man hit a point so low that he knew he could never recover from it the corporate boys congratulated him on the performance his blistering prose made even the slimiest one in the cavalcade shake his head in awe it made me realize that personal integrity and hypocrisy don't matter in the world of talk radio even in the corporate world for that matter stone may have been pushing some uber liberal agenda but it was the actual movie and production that got my attention oliver stone is a minor master of the moody the final third of the film had probably the best lighting and cinematography i have seen in any film stone artfully makes the dj booth feel like five by seven cell in a nineteenth century prison visually speaking it appears that only friend is the black foam that absorbs his routine vitriol he speaks and it doesn't speak back it's a sad metaphor considering the way he treats the people who handed him his success stone and bogosian carved out a stunning film of a man who is trapped in both a prison of walls and a prison of self this man is confined to his own volition and he can never escape it the scene that made me realize his conundrum was when he was unwilling to his ex wife back he preferred his own prison instead of the world on the outside every story has a conflict and it came down to the simplest of all conflicts man versus himself presents this conflict in an intelligent gripping and artful fashion there are no hidden messages in this film and the progression of events should be expected by any astute viewer i just leaned back and let my mind be grasped by this film and i loved it it's unheralded unseen and it will never receive its due recognition let's hope it stays that way because gems deserve to be found and then hidden again it's a gem because i found it in the discount dvd bin at my local wal mart store for 5 50 it was worth the half hour i spent digging trying to find it i did and i got more than my money's worth this is one of the best movies ever made and that is worth ten reasons alone ten reasons give a score of ten br br here ends my rant
<START> this would have to be by far the greatest series i have ever seen i vividly watched every sunday night and purchased the box set as soon as it was available this is a timeless play written by a fantastic australian that people of all ages could relate to whether they are australian or not however for those of us that are australian it truly brings across the typical australian icon a must see 10 10
<START> terrible movie just terrible the start of this movie is like something out of a bad women in prison movie then it moves on to being a b movie version of aliens b movie in this case meaning the addition of gratuitous sex scenes and women in lingerie oh and a lot of the footage is the exact same as used in two other movies by the same company including the women in prison schtick the only thing saving this movie from a 1 10 is that i have actually seen worse movies not many and not much but worse
<START> bonjour monsieur is simply a wonderful film writer director has created a story unlike any other and cast it with such consistently fine actors that it remains a puzzle to me that this film has not become an audience favorite throughout the world it is intelligent emotional edifying and warm entertaining and in all categories it is a winner cohen in a brilliantly understated performance is a 16 year old lad who takes care of his highly dysfunctional family his mother is about as distasteful a shrew as ever concocted and in a constant state of ill temper because of her husband cheated on her and because she is stuck working double shifts to support her ailing father in law elias who as grandfather is a bright funny wise loving old man who deeply cares for a married sister ziva who periodically moves back in to the house because of constant spats with her husband who doesn't help her care for their infant twin sons his brother cohen whose life is loud electric guitars braggadocio about female conquests and the favorite son of his mother stir this mixture and the result is the penultimate dysfunctional family unit cooks gourmet meals for them shops cleans house runs errands bathes and cares for this grandfather and in general leads a life of submission to a family that views him as a longs for a girlfriend and practically fails his school because of his lack of time devoted to caring for his family and a lack of concentration serendipitously his math teacher begin notes his natural genius on a discarded test and with the aid of the headmaster nair the two encourage him to be tested and discover that he is a genius with dyslexia and arrange for him to try for a special school in haifa mother will hear none of it but between fights with absentee father albert and confrontations with the teacher and headmaster they finally consent to his testing for the school meanwhile discovers a girl his age rona aya who has moved in next door and gradually the two become intertwined in a physical and intellectual relationship always in the background is the support of grandfather and when the grandfather dies sets off on the journey to live his life for himself to realize his gifts to find his happiness the manner in which the family comes to grips with this is the peak of the movie and need not be revealed for the sake of loosing the power of the message the film is beautifully photographed the musical score is creatively lovely and the final result is one of exaltation of the human spirit highly recommended on every level in hebrew with english subtitles
<START> i haven't reviewed anything on here for quite awhile but after having the misfortune to sit through this rubbish as entertainment i had to put forward my thoughts br br normally however bad something is there is one redeeming part whether it is an actor who was okay a scene that was passable an attractive cast member or a general feelgood moment unfortunately that isn't true here as the film starts of atrociously with a ridiculous shootout which was so poor i thought it was a practice two otherwise known as the boys in blue chatting beside a school br br one of these idiots was daniel baldwin who not only starred in this but also actually directed this garbage unlike his brothers cannot act for toffee not that he was on his own here as everyone in it seemed to belong to the acting school of a trained chimp br br luckily certainly for me i only watched an hour of this masterpiece as the dvd wouldn't work was probably made by the same fools who produced this so if you have nothing to do but watch paint dry do watch this as it is just as boring ideal for getting rid of unwanted guests
<START> i really enjoyed this movie i have probably watched it 2 dozen times or more and still enjoy it being an old navy guy im still stirred by the rousing rendition of anchors away i also love the navy pirate atmosphere i could have done without the female dive officer but im just old fashioned i guess she was still good to look at lol after the crew got done with her laundry the cook and electrician made the movie loved the salty old engineer and his first class po too and actually did a very commendable job of being a misfit officer i loved the driving scene as they passed the golf course on the way into port lol pure navy and i swear i had an xo that was just like that little weasel im am so glad this is out on dvd about bloody time 0
<START> bill rebane's the capture of bigfoot is one of the most awful horror movies ever made a greedy owner harvey olsen richard kennedy decides that he wants bigfoot captured at all costs however local game ranger dave garrett stafford morgan learns that the bigfoot used to live in peace upset by a geological expedition and sets out to protect the creature there is nothing even remotely interesting in this piece of crap the film is extremely dull and filled with horrible songs and cheap special effects no gore no suspense just gigantic boredom avoid this horrible junk like the plague
<START> this is a standard action flick as we have seen them many times before not much action in this one though again it's about the guy protecting the president he's macho as usual and at the same time soft and melancholic as usual does he have the guts to take a bullet for the president and then there's the girl and the usual conservative flirting around stereotypical and predictable to the last toe crumbling minute
<START> as a canadian i didn't know very much about the dismissal i had read the wikipedia page about those events but that was about it earlier this year when canada went through a potential constitutional crisis it fizzled out thankfully that might have led to intervention by our governor general the dismissal was mentioned in the press in an effort to learn more i ordered the dvd of this mini series through ebay br br i was greatly impressed by how interesting the account was as dramatic as events were this could have been a very boring political drama however it was a pretty suspenseful mini series i was also impressed by how understandable it was despite my lack of familiarity with australian politics it didn't take long to figure out who everyone was and what their roles were br br having said that it is not an entirely impartial account malcolm fraser is certainly portrayed as a rather machiavellian figure who lets no person or thing get in the way of his quest to be prime minister gough is portrayed in a more noble almost saintly light however the actor portraying channels the nobility in such a way that it comes across more as pomposity i thought that sir john kerr was portrayed in a fairly sympathetic manner br br i must warn people that the dvd is of very poor quality i understand that it was made for television in the early 80s but it would appear that no effort was made to restore the picture quality or sound quality it was very disappointing that no extras were added either a documentary or even some interviews with the historical figures would have enhanced the experience but there is nothing br br i highly recommend this mini series for anyone interested in the real life events
<START> debra winger's 1987 black widow is much better br br this is like a lame version and jane seymour usually does better br br chad allen is pretty poor in this too just playing his usual role as a boring rebellious child br br maybe the both of them being from dr quinn was supposed to make us get excited br br if it's on go grab a copy of black widow
<START> i haven't seen this movie in 30 years so i don't know if i would like it as much as i did when i was 12 at the time however i loved this movie this is a great starter chick flick for young pre teen girls be careful of the ending though there are tears and harsh emotions br br looking back at it from a 2008 perspective with so much more knowledge of child psychology politics and political correctness i think it would be interesting to watch again patty's uncaring abusive father indifferent mother and favored sister all contributed toward making her vulnerable and starving for companionship patty was sad when anton left she was heartbroken when he was killed the rage that was directed toward her afterward was shocking after all she was only 12 years old br br the thing that i most strongly retained is how this movie taught me even enemy soldiers are people too not all german soldiers were hateful nazis when i was older i saw tv shows like hogan's heroes and the rat patrol which also made the point that the regular german soldiers were not the same as the gestapo br br regular soldiers were drafted the gestapo were handpicked among volunteers for their special attitudes of hate i believe that one of the privileges of being a nazi was that they had special assignments and therefore didn't go into battle their specialties were interrogation and torture br br later during the cold war i would think about russian soldiers and remember we were taught that the soviet union was evil but the reality was that russian soldiers weren't out to destroy america they had a job their government probably told them that our government was out to destroy their way of life which in a way was true since the us fought to end communism br br the lesson is still applicable today german soldiers were not the same as nazis just as muslims are not the same as al qaeda
