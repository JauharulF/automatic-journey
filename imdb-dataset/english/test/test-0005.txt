<START> the adventures of hercules has to be one of the lamest excuses for a movie i've yet run across you would have to look far and wide to find anything that approaches the level of ineptness on display in this movie acting Â bad editing Â bad direction Â bad special effects Â bad and laughable plot Â bad lighting Â bad cinematography Â bad costume design Â bad and silly everything else Â bad watching the adventures of hercules is about as enjoyable as a root canal even for a fan of bad movies it's a real endurance test this is one for either masochists or lou ferrigno completists if any exist br br eight things i learned from watching the adventures of hercules br br 1 if you don't have the budget for real special effects rotoscope a scene from the previous movie it will look great trust me br br 2 when on a quest to recover take time for frequent stops to oil up you body it worked for ferrigno and his two amazon companions br br 3 any sword fight use of magic and just about all other day to day activities in ancient greece created a sound very similar to a game of man or asteroids br br 4 some of the ancient greek gods dressed like extras from star wars br br 5 if you need to pad your crappy movie's runtime extend the title sequence by adding star trek style credits and throw in some overly grandiose music it also helps if you've got a previous movie to pull scenes from br br 6 fight scenes move along much smoother if the bad guys attack hercules one at a time br br 7 william berger did anything for money br br 8 i didn't think it was possible but the adventures of hercules makes the first film hercules 1983 look like an academy award winner
<START> i wasted 35 minutes of my life on this turkey before i gave up the main character is completely clueless and astoundingly unsympathetic but there is no humor in his blundering as soon as he arrives in germany the screenwriter pulls the old there's only one room in the hotel you'll have to share a room with a pretty girl stunt come on at least you could let them develop their relationship a bit first watch it happened one night to see how to do it right or any of a thousand movies since then br br the acting is consistently third rate and the improvised dialogue should have been left on the cutting room floor it meanders with no plan at all despite the fact that the film telegraphs the relationship's destination from the moment greta is introduced br br the first song in the boardroom is mildly funny but badly sung the rest of the songs well to be fair i only heard those in the first half hour are just pointless and awful most of the singers are painfully out of tune but not in any intentionally humorous sort of way
<START> there have been very few great comedy films in the history of hindi cinema happens to be one of them the film is based on a very simple story of two poor young men aamir and salman who dream of becoming rich by marrying a millionaire's daughter raveena aamir and salman khan try their best to outwit each other and woo raveena the plot thickens when paresh rawal co plan to take over all the wealth the movie is well paced and very funny rarely does one come across a hindi comedy which is both funny and intelligent this is one of the few films with aamir and salman together probably the only film unfortunately it did not succeed at the box office and we might never see a film of this calibre again aamir khan is brilliant in the film and has proved his versatility as an actor in this film salman khan gives a very good performance as a dim wit raveena plays a convincing role as a confused rich girl and karishma who is assistant friend is also funny paresh rawal junior shakti kapoor verma and tiku talsania just add to the flavour of the film all in all the best hindi comedy ever made and i wish they make more quality films like this one you will want to watch this film time and again br br p s for those of you who have watched this film i also suggest gol chupke chupke si garam hera pheri old and new etc
<START> there seems to be a spectrum of cinema on the left there are movies made mostly for entertainment and or commercial purposes in the middle there are movies that are both entertaining and artistic on the right are movies that are not as commercial but are focused more on cinema as art than cinema as product br br i'm not here to say any one part of the spectrum is better than any other but that when a movie goes too far to either end it's rarely good such is the case with naqoyqatsi br br i had no idea what to expect when i saw it advertised a few friends were going and asked if i wanted to come along none of us knew what to expect and by the end none of us were pleased br br yes there are breathtaking images yes i'm amazed at the lengths the filmmakers went to in searching through archival footage yes the soundtrack is enjoyable to listen to and probably the best part of the experience the thing is this goes so far to the right side of the spectrum i mentioned that i can't say anything nice about the movie as a whole br br it's preachy it's a jumble of symbolism and obvious morality it's not saying anything new or forcing the viewer to examine life in a new way it's just telling us things we already know that is if we can even figure out what it's saying br br this movie is simply art for art's sake an attempt to say look at how deep and thought provoking we can be by using montage when a film becomes more about how clever or intelligent its creators are than about its subject it ceases to be a film and simply becomes celluloid self gratification
<START> this movie has got to be the worse movie i have ever seen i only watched about a half an hour and i just shut it off the cars in this movie look like two geo front ends smashed together this movie isn't even good for laughs the only time i laughed was when dante kept saying in funny voice nobody can beat dante i said holy god and shut it off bad bad movie 2 10
<START> with the obvious exception of fools horses this was in my opinion david jason's finest series br br coming straight after his tv debut on 'do not adjust your set ' these 13 episodes revealed a mastery of comic timing not seen since the old silent movie days by comparison porridge open all hours and that awful series 'lucky man' did not come close br br i believe jason banned the series being repeated because it showed him at his rawest shame on him a new generation deserves to enjoy this the series actually flopped in the ratings but that is most likely because it was shown against 'the brothers' which aired on bbc at the same time before vcrs were commonplace br br btw i have only just noticed that his long suffering assistant spencer was played by mark eden alan bradley off coronation street i am amazed he didn't try to murder edgar briggs
<START> hercules the tv movie hercules a very twisted and version of the story about the greek superhero paul makes a good attempt to play this hero sean astin rehashes his sam image by playing lupin a thrown in character to make the whole thing a buddy movie picture i almost expected his to say at one point we're in a bad situation mr frodo uh i mean hercules an unexpected good performance comes from timothy dalton one of the lesser james bonds as father love interest looks like paris hilton something which just turned me off right away someone has twisted and the original story into somewhat of a murky and sometimes incomprehensible story the special effects don't help either while the hydra scene does the original story justice the lion and harpies are just well lame i believe the creatures and effects from power rangers flashed across my mind at least twice and the golden hind felt rushed and very computer generated and they took out one of my favorite parts of what was originally a very cool story the movie can't decide whether it's greek roman or american and it almost ruined the original story a classic epic don't bother looking for this one on the direct to dvd c
<START> at initial thought the concept of this show seemed to be a joke and a gag just for stan lee's amusement i expected nothing more than a sleazy animated version of barb wire with low production values much like those short pieces of crap you see on adult swim for short term amusement but can never taken too seriously boy was i wrong br br has even better production values than similar marvel toons the animation is very good and it seems that they've taken this series very seriously and given it a full effort to make it a professional production as possible br br the humor is good too on the sexy suggestive and sleazy side it is very similar if not exactly like the simpsons style you may encounter clichÃ©s and a lot of predictable humor but its still fun nevertheless if this were running today i'd surely see it regularly its surprisingly one of the better toons ever made
<START> i'm not into reality shows that much but this one is exceptional because at the end the viewer gets something useful out of it besides entertainment i don't have children but lessons will be a great help when and if i ever do my only complaint is that the show has been watered down since it has been in the us i prefer the british version with the sterner nanny approach is it just me or does anyone else find the us version to be a bit soft now it's the kinder gentler nanny i guess we yanks need a spoonful of sugar to help the medicine go down after all still nothing wrong with a sappy happy ending is there
<START> br br man i just cant believe this movie i have watched it entirely believe me i have done this and the best part was the on the beginning and i hate br br no plot no acting no nothing i was watching the movie and thinking when this is going to start it never started how people can spend money and time to make such a crap br br the plot a dog gets bitten by a bat and get rabies okay until now no problem nothing special but ok now the rest of the movie will be the dog will chase people thats it nothing else now add to this some of the worse actings actors i have ever seem some completely scenes and some others really idiotic like the child cant breath and the mother gives him a big and strong hug to see if he gets better and a very lame ending thats it here you have crap ops cujo br br do your self a favor and make something more worthy like your head against the wall or play chess with yourself br br zero out of 10 br br gabriel
<START> i did a review for this director's fictional recreation about btk i had also seen this movie and it was terrible please save your money and time this movie was terrible and this director is untalented i do not understand how he is funding these movies they are horrible i have decided to make sure that i check who the writer director and producer are and if this director's name pops up i will not waste my money there is nothing worse than renting a movie on a friday night making the popcorn and then realizing you have been duped by creative art on the front of the movie box stay away so i guess i should make up some stuff to fill in the lines i have always checked imdb for reviews before but i think i will not anymore this is ridiculous i have been corrected in my reviews far too many times not enough lines you may cancel my account your site is a pain
<START> well i'd have to say that i do own this film and i only like the ending the movie is boring and slow but the final fight is so funny lets just say that if the fake bird didn't attack the main evil guy this movie would be a 0 out of 10 the bird though makes it a 3 if you are truly bored or want something terrible to watch rent this and fast forward to the final battle
<START> i can't get this flick off my brain it's definitely totally different than anything that's out there i've seen a ton of movies over the holidays and while some are okay nothing really rocked my world the way did there is just something way cool about the actors and the way that they put the film together it's like there is really scary stuff mixed with with some pretty f ing hilarious black humour franco is great but the older rough dude steals the show in a few scenes like when he punches the kid out in the dirt grave i guess some politically won't appreciate the vibe don't bring your grandma but it is totally awesome the thing that's best is the style there is some really serious stuff mixed with super interesting footage of the road the movie really makes you sad and scared in parts but it also spins your head with what is happening and the way it is filmed wtf is up with the world sooo many critics are raving about all these supposedly revolutionary ground breaking films and when you see them they're boring and predictable and not all that i don't get it because there are a lot of other better choices blind spot is really kinda great because it gives you thrills and chills and major upcoming star power but does it in a way that is completely fresh and definitely totally rad
<START> i got subjected to this pile one wednesday afternoon when my mother in law was watching it i can't get over someone basically doing a remake of a crappy high budget hollywood flop the core with washed up actors like luke perry if the high budget one flopped what makes people think doing the same movie 2 years later with no budget would go anywhere i was laughing through most of the movie because of how insanely similar it was in fact i am shocked it's not held up in legal rather than airing on tv and how it was basically the script of the core just redone badly which if you have seen the core you know why doing it worse is funny since the core was already so bad it was funny br br if you enjoy getting a laugh out of really bad movies this one will be right up your alley the only thing i can say is that i wish luke perry was able to have a career because he isn't a horrible actor he just lands horrible roles crappy made for tv movies that will only run on daytime television is pretty much one step closer to the end for him if it wasn't for 90210 he would have a career
<START> okay i know that's clichÃ© taken on its surface this is a bad film perhaps in a league with plan 9 from outer space the dialog is suspect but the is quite enjoyable the plot is not quite believable gavin's character overacts excessively while watching the movie somethings happen that truly make you wonder handsome and kim making out on a tank gwen eating a banana in a bath just about everything gavin says and does these things taken separately are perhaps flaws taken together however they are merely quirks watching this movie with an open mind especially if you're not familiar with singaporean culture and with an open minded group of friends is guaranteed to deliver a lot of laughs and a memorable time you can't go into this movie expecting a masterpiece or even expecting to take anything serious at all if you can take this film for what it is an underdog film about underdogs filled to the brim with its own quirks then you should have a good time watching this one i've already seen it three times and i wouldn't hesitate to watch it three more times
