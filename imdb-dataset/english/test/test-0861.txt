<START> i received this movie as a birthday gift because all of my friends know i'm a big fan of low budget horror flicks kaufman studios have always made the cheesy gory flicks that delivered i loved to watch their films at home on rainy nights with my family until i saw bugged what happened br br this movie started out with a pretty good concept about mutating bugs and even added some slick comedy but overall the writing is just bad and that was mistake number one ronald k armstrong should learn to first be a better writer before becoming a filmmaker after reading the credits we discover he gave himself the most important role in the film two words mr director acting lessons ok mr armstrong joins the ranks of other writer directors who cast themselves in their own movies and that's mistake number two br br the only thing that i believed saved this film was the artistic camera work and the musical score let's hear it for the crew the cast of other actors who in the beginning of this production seemed a bit cold really warmed up toward the middle and end of this production everyone pulled together and helped to pull this film off ronald armstrong may lack the talent to ever become a decent director or actor but i'll say this of him he seems to know how to organize people to get them all to come together and pull his productions off br br this film i have to say can be an inspiration to any young filmmaker who dreams of making their own movie because if mr armstrong was able to pull this off any one else can too if you get a chance to see this film watch it for the sake of getting inspired to do better in the future hollywood needs bigger and better horror flicks to keep this genre coming back from it's grave
<START> yes the movie was that boring and insipid after a certain point i was wanting the croc to eat these people just so we could get the movie over with br br the plot is that three aussies take a fishing tour up a river in a little boat where the fishing guide straps on a gun he says he just does it for insurance purposes all the crocs have been hunted out of this river he is immediately eaten by a croc the trio then get chased up a tree getting picked off by the reptile in their attempts to escape they spend most of the movie arguing over the best way to escape br br predictably the one survivor finds the tour gun and shoots the crocodile aww they killed the movie's only likable character br br where's paul hogan or steve irwin when you really need them
<START> this film is an abomination of all that is worthy in film making the lead actor surprises his audience by not actually acting at all we have to watch almost two hours of his bland soulless face the jokes are all lame i never laughed once it was saturday night there were 5 of us having a beer all up for a laugh and then we put this on and you could feel all the warmth and colour being drained from the room the film ended and the mood was ruined so we all went our separate ways ruined the night ok so pros and cons pros beautiful setting in hawaii looks good on bluray cons worst acting ever you can tell everyone concerned is just thinking about payday predictable poor plot zero character development forced jokes which fall flat many shots of the guys penis which to be fair acts better than him and has more charisma may all makers of this film hang their heads in shame and hold their flaccid cheap
<START> what can i say this film is amazing it has its flaws like every film does for example wobbly in a graveyard a clearly visible slide board during the penguins death scene max losing his heavy coat in a split second between shots during the image scene batman losing his black eye makeup all of a sudden between shots so he can reveal bruce wayne to catwoman dialogue being recorded but is played back and spoken differently than when it was spoken in the first place and lastly catwoman all of a sudden knows how to use a bull whip without any training whatsoever these flaws are minor compared to some you would see in for example batman forever where the riddler can obviously be seen waiting for his cue or val kilmer's hair changing between shots br br what makes this film so deserving of an 8 10 is the great acting because the performances are absolutely amazing michael keaton reprises his role as batman and has a lot more to do in this film he looks more comfortable in the role the second time around and is on par with the villains performances danny devito is the perfect penguin i really like the conversion of the penguin into the grotesque penguin man instead of the non threatening character from the comics or tv show because now the character has more depth and has a far more interesting story that generates from the basic need of family and to feel accepted and wanted this gives us an evil character who we feel sympathy for because he was rejected for being what he is which is not his fault michelle pfeiffer is excellent as catwoman she is and sexy and she is also a villain we can feel sorry for because of the way she is christopher walken is a great secondary villain and is so interesting a character even though he is not even in the batman universe br br the soundtrack is far better than the first and danny elfman gets more of a chance to show off his musical talents this time around the sets are amazing they are detailed eye catching sinister gothic unique dark and so many other adjectives can describe how amazing they look the costumes and make up are great and obviously a lot of work went into making them and all the work pays off because the is better the cat suit is amazing to look at and the penguin make up and effects are so convincing the animatronic penguins look really realistic and are played to good effect the script is really good and the storyline in my opinion is a plausible one overall because of all these factors this film deserves an 8 10 and stands as my favourite of all the batman films
<START> i watched this film early 70's it is the best film i have ever watched and i will never forget it as long as i live i hate wars i hate wars i hate wars i wonder why we humans still let wars happen do you do you know why all these wars go on and on and on innocent people get killed even today for stupid and unreal i watched this film early 70's it is the best film i have ever watched and i will never forget it as long as i live i hate wars i hate wars i hate wars i wonder why we humans still let wars happen do you do you know why all these wars go on and on and on innocent people get killed even today for stupid and unreal i watched this film early 70's it is the best film i have ever watched and i will never forget it as long as i live i hate wars i hate wars i hate wars i wonder why we humans still let wars happen do you do you know why all these wars go on and on and on innocent people get killed even today for stupid and unreal
<START> we've all played halo and and gta and resi etc but none of them can stand up to the game itself is great i have literally burned out my n64 playing this great game along with zelda this game along alone built the mold that is essential for all modern shooters on top of that the multi player is great the story mode itself is worth playing a hundred times over and more its a great game for when your board and you want to just shoot up some people and there are endless unlock cheats aztec egyptian god knows how many multiplayer and the three difficulties as well as the famous difficulty our modern games are great but when you sit down and play this game you get a certain feeling that few other games can give you and with the online capabilities of newer shooting games we rarely see this old two on two death match style and when we do its no where near as good as this games and when you get bored of the story there are endless mysteries glitches and easter eggs to be found and taken advantage of br br this is definitely one of the greatest shooting games of all time
<START> the working title was don't spank baby br br wayne crawford went on to become a successful producer films like valley girl night of the comet and others even though he wasn't too terrific in this little gem and little known abe zwick should have gotten tons of work from this film but didn't filmed at studios in hollywood florida on the same lot the early tarzan movies were filmed this film is definitely for those who appreciate the abstract the movie was originally shot with some nudity and much more graphic slasher scenes for reasons only known to tom casey the director the bloody slasher scenes were given a tab of lsd and the nudity was removed even though this version is worthy of a look for those so inclined in my opinion the original version would have packed the punch needed to make this a full on slasher 70's cult classic
<START> this film winning im kwon the best director at cannes in 2002 tied with p t anderson for punch drunk love is about a 19th century korean painter with a roots and significant impact on korean painting one of the strengths of the film is that im tries to help us see with the eye of a painter so we see multiple scenes and objects which help our drunken painter friend jang seung up choi min receive inspiration br br the costumes and the art direction are all impressive and the acting is even along being good it's not a movie that moved me but it was one that made me think about art and what it means to find your own voice in it that's pretty cool it's also interesting to see a version of korea during those times right before the turn of the century where chinese and japanese powers are both in korea and the kingdom is coming to an end more than one revolution and political ideology are gathered in the film but are never the center it's firmly on the painter br br in the end it's a well made film about the life of a painter but it doesn't exactly have the regular three act structure plot so you have to be able to take a non standard hollywood story to watch it yay for art 8 10
<START> so i turned on hbo which i just got thinking that it would have some quality movies and i saw this carrot top is so unfunny it's nauseating to watch i've seen unfunny movies before but i think i find this one so impossible to watch because carrot top seems to think he's hilarious watching this movie is really like watching a movie designed for 5 year olds with crazy over the top replete with ultra stupid jokes that only a 4 year old would appreciate br br what is amazing is how some other talented actors actually signed on for this project such as larry miller and m walsh if you've ever seen carrot absolutely horrible commercials or whatever they were then this is more of the same just worse it's a slapstick fest that is a waste of a high budget that could have done something saved homeless people anything but this i'm not sure it's in the bottom 50 of all time but for the 10 million spent it's a disgrace
<START> there's this whole theory of horror that some people adhere closely to that the monsters and the violence should be kept off screen park chan wook throws that concept completely out the window and shows directly what he wants and what he wants to show is pretty much anything he can think of leaving it to the actors and dialog to create subtlety from a stylistic perspective park seems willing to do just about anything to get his point across whether it's long involved ensemble scenes with the camera whizzing around a mah jong table or entire weeks confined to a single shot between two other scenes dialog from the scenes before and after bleeding over them park doesn't keep to a specifically structured style but focuses more on telling the entire story of a couple's relationship from virginal remove through utter codependence to utter self annihilation and uses vampirism as the link and as the drama it's that simple and that complex at the same time br br you gotta give him credit too many people are ready to compare any modern vampire movie to twilight with twilight almost always being the lesser of the works but here the stories are actually comparable but this one is more raw and honest none of this sparkly coming in the window during the night to talk crap but anything ranging from the dirtiest most desperate and virginal sex scene to eventual spousal abuse as the two leads begin to vie for power over one another it's the same deal guy and girl meet girl finds out guy is a vampire decides to join him anyway but with no happily ever after just straight up limited time as they become forced to keep each other closer and closer and run out of options the girl's motivations are particularly interesting as one desperately craving power and attention to a fault foiled by the guy who just wants to live a good life as best he can under the circumstances but is a hypocrite who cannot admit that he's merely using his vampirism as an excuse to act against his moral training br br the movie isn't perfect and it does tend to stretch there's no three act five act or any act structure here just scene after scene of character building and dysfunctional romance but what's great about it is that park chan wook is willing to show everything frankly and honestly while delighting the horror sensibilities of tension and gore he also provides an expertly chosen soundtrack to hit the emotional high notes in a pretty effective way too br br polarisdib
<START> this movie was a riot it pokes fun of madonna truth or dare in all the right places i love madonna i love julie brown how could i ask for more julie's spoof of vogue entitled vague was hysterical kelly lebrock thinks she's great she's just cold boogers on a paper plate brooke shields pam personality of spam i could've died and just wait till you see what she can do with a watermelon
<START> i haven't for a long time seen such a horrible film i hoped that at least adam sandler could be funny hopeless seems like some teenager have written it's script and he's daddy pushed this so far that someone agreed to shoot it movie world could be better place without this whatever it is
<START> stephen hawking has one of the greatest minds or if that's too simplistic to coin for him one of the most curious and daring that also happens to be trapped in a body crippled by a disease that leaves him in a wheelchair and a computer to communicate perhaps i didn't know enough about hawking going in i always knew him as 'that guy speaking like a computer who knows a lot about like the universe and stuff you know' that he is british that he was a rather normal kid and perhaps most remarkably the disease that could have possibly left him dead at 21 put him in the position of putting his life in focus br br according to errol morris's equally curious and coolly visually dazzling portrait in a brief history of time hawking was already brilliant in spurts when other oxford students were faced with daunting equations he answered more than three times the amount in an hour's time but when faced with challenges mostly from other theories by other scientists he bounced back with his own beneath some of the complex scientific talk and if you got any less than a b in astronomy like me you'll need to keep your ears especially perked up in explanations of time's possible infinity or the peculiarities of the black hole there's a human being who just wants to enjoy his goose on his birthday br br morris captures hawking just right for those who can't get enough of his theories on how particles may be going in and out of a black hole or if there is even a creator or not depending on how much one takes into account einstein and time but he also captures the back story on the man and his condition which creates this as something much more interesting than if morris had done one or the other too much talk about the cosmos would make one's head hurt and too much about his personal life and one might wonder what all the fuss is about this bloke who's book of the film's title was on bestseller lists for over five years br br almost in spite of his appearance hawking defines what it is to be a conscious entity in a universe which he observes he won't be apart of if and when the universe goes another 10 billion years from now through it all in a brief history of time we get a glimpse of a genius and his humility not to mention his colleagues and ten cents here and there through an unfathomably hypothetical and mathematical thought process of the universe
<START> i think that this is one of my top ten worst movies i have ever seen there's like fade out every two minutes if this was on tv they would have a preview every 2 3 minutes but there is a seen i personally enjoyed which is when the blonde goes to take a bath in a pit of boiling water with a man watching and for about 10 seconds you see her whole body with no towel on that was the best scene in the whole film because you see sasquatch starring at them but the last 10 minutes is when we see his whole body plus most of the deaths are off screen and just the scream or roar and i was expecting the sasquatch to die but he dosen't shoot him and only 4 or 5 people die in the whole film i was expecting 8 10 people to die don't watch this movie i give it an f don't waste your time
<START> once again i must play something of the most of the reviews for ab tak have been extremely positive mine is positive but only slightly a 7 out of 10 is equivalent to a c letter grade from me br br it seems that a lot of the praise is rooted in two factors one that ab tak is more realistic than the typical bollywood film and two that it is trying to do things differently br br the first point i couldn't care less about i'm not looking for realism in films and so i do not score higher for a film that shows a story and characters closer to how i believe the real world to be i'm a big fan of surrealism fantasy absurdism and so on although i do not dislike realist films merely for the fact that they're realist br br for the second point i agree that it is commendable to try to do things differently however i don't think originality versus makes for a better or worse film in itself a film can be original and poor just like a film can be formulaic and excellent what matters are how well the film does whatever it sets out to do and how enjoyable or aesthetically rewarding that is to the viewer br br ab tak is based on the true story of a mumbai cop named was an encounter specialist encounter specialists who could be said to be early of real world judge are trained to operate like the criminals and gang members they pursue and they're basically given a license to kill effectively acting as policeman judge jury and executioner in a matter of moments ab tak follows the story of nana patekar the encounter specialist based on we see him at work interacting with his fellow encounter specialists and engaging in violence we see him at home trying to live a normal life in his less than luxurious surroundings we see him trying to adjust to a new commissioner halfway through the film and we see his odd relationship with a notorious indian gangster don br br all of this has the potential to make a fabulous gritty film i agree that it's nice to forgo the typical bollywood musical numbers and romances not every film needs that stuff ab tak producer ram gopal varma is famous for leaving music and romances in the background or by the wayside in many films that he's directed or produced additionally ab tak has some good performances patekar almost gives off a death wish 1974 era charles bronson vibe it also has admirable cinematography the hand held stuff near the beginning of the film was particularly effective for example it has a great score that mixes more of a moody hollywood sounding action crime score with traditional indian instruments and the violence is well done and gritty br br there is also decent exploration of subtexts including the morality of having encounter specialists the idea of following orders and so on the encounter specialists are shown having to largely divorce themselves from ideas of right and wrong more poignantly the film questions the merit of blindly following orders parallels are drawn between the encounter specialists following orders and say members of a country's military and we're shown what a corrupt situation this can lead to br br but you just knew there was a but coming didn't you director amin and his scriptwriters have created a story with far too many characters far too much sprawl and that moves a bit too slow all of these problems may be due to amin and crew looking at the godfather films which ab tak has some at least superficial resemblances to although from a policeman's perspective br br most of the encounter specialists we do not get to know very well these are shallowly drawn characters to say the least except for and for one narayan i didn't know who he was until at least halfway through the film his name is mentioned a number of times but i'd only get glimpses of him until the scene would change then everyone would change clothes by the time they appear again and i'd have to start all over figuring out who narayan was br br the same thing happened with first commissioner the film was already far into the new commissioner before i could figure out the relationships it seems like there are new characters in every scene we never learn the stories of most of them while that might have some artistic merit in that the encounter specialists are mostly killing people they do not know anything about because they're mostly doing so on orders since we do not learn much about most of the encounter specialists either it's difficult to find characters to care about and that doesn't exactly make for a gripping film br br the primary villain is but until about halfway through the film there's no indication of this he doesn't get much more screen time than the other villains parading through the film and he's literally phoning his performance in he's in another location dubai communicating only by telephone for the majority of the film we don't actually see doing much to an extent the film depends on a couple twists that not showing doing a number of things but we could see him do other things and a lot of the other villains could have been left out br br that would have tightened up the film a bit making it more focused and about a half hour shorter both of which would have benefited its impact this is not an action packed film by any means for at least the first 45 minutes or so i found myself admiring ab tak considerable style but saying okay get on with the story already
