<START> what's fun about barker's is that it's the story of a human on a rampage a deadly threat to monsters everywhere in this one the monsters the night breed of the title are the good guys it shares its sense of celebrating the different the twisted and the dark with the first addams family movie and much of tim burton's work it also has the goriness that one expects from a piece by barker br br especially fun is the performance by cronenberg as the truly evil human doctor who is bent on destroying the as happens in most classic monster movies the villagers surround the monsters' castle with torches and pitchforks only this time the modern setting replaces the castle with an old mausoleum and the rustic weapons with guns and bombs and this time the sympathy you felt when you saw frankenstein's monster burned in the windmill is the very center of the movie br br this isn't a masterpiece and even barker has done more interesting and certainly more chilling work but it's pure fun it looks great and remains light without mocking itself worth a look
<START> this showtime cable film features a talented cast and weaves together several storylines involving the darker side of new york from the naive and innocent tourists' nightmarish adventure to a pair of undercover cops on the streets to an old friend's betrayal it has it all br br well worth a look as is its sequel
<START> this movie is horrendous the acting is cheesy and laughable if you know anything at all about rugby the match action is boring in fact any episode of power rangers contains more realism than this movie the 'action' consists of no more than one pass and a shot of guy landing over the try line or being tackled without the ball and hectic hand held shots of who knows what it's impossible to tell there is nothing of the excitement skill and construction of try scoring that real rugby contains as for the this is a bunch of yanks trying to imitate a tradition they know nothing about much like the white rasta character that should have been left out of the film next time there's a rugby movie made we can only hope that people who know rugby make it
<START> i enjoyed very much the movie wooden camera i think it's a little bit influenced by the brazilian movie city of god but maybe this parallelism between the two tracks possible to follow crime and art in social neighborhood are a reality br br i think the films made by are really beautiful i don't think it's unreal that he shoot such good films because there's a lot of artists that don't have any type of education and can be really genius br br i enjoyed very much the soundtrack it's adjusted to the pictures br br see the movie it's good to show how can be a life in a social neighborhood
<START> topical certainly entertainment probably but only on removal of any shred of the viewer's common sense reality only in so much that it was made on this planet br br how thousands of people were supposed to have died as a result of a 5 wall of water in a city liberally littered with buildings in excess of 25 metres high is quite beyond me line to the effect of how could anyone survive that when the shot shows forests of buildings with several floors above the water is completely laughable further if someone commits themselves to an area under water where one cylinder of air is not enough i e they are going to die why not use the simple expedient of taking more than one cylinder clearly the writer thinks that people in stressful situations cannot count beyond one one cylinder one floor br br rather than watching this tripe you would be more informed and entertained by throwing the dvd away and reading the pricing information on the cellophane outer wrapper br br pitiful truly pitiful and a terrible waste of the on screen talent br br as for the sexist propaganda suggesting that only women can see through the problems to illuminate the solutions to be effected by the expendable men yet more pc small wonder that first blood delta force navy seals and other such movies of little or no merit will always have a following while this blatantly politically motivated bilge is peddled
<START> the best thing from the american pie bakery i found the humor and the plot to be far more engaging audience than any of the american pie movies to date also concerning the of the content i found this to be acceptable to a much larger audience than any of the previous american pie movies i thoroughly enjoyed this movie experience when the movie first came out i read a number of negative reviews and ended up not going to see it while it was still in the theater i now regret that decision the movie far exceeded my expectations in terms of plot dialog scripting and overall quality i give it two thumbs way up
<START> in watching enterprise for the first time as we all no doubt do with all shows i went into it with an open mind enjoying about half of the past star trek efforts and disliking the other half br br enterprise has fallen short but this episode a night in made me seriously question why i bother the shows from monday night on sci fi br br masking some idea that it is one of those 'a day in the life' episodes in which we learn about what makes certain characters operate as humanoids the writers seemed to forget that this was supposed to be a starship vessel not the and the br br a planet especially one whose people had been offended previously by the enterprise crew for eating in public was no place for a dog as an animal lover myself i would have never taken one of my pets into an environment that had proved in the past to be tense br br but what made this episode even more ridiculous was the endless problem with all of these st shows constantly depicting things that are sacred and insulting to other cultures as tho they are offering some insight into american religious zealots br br the aliens were now offended when the dog on a sacred tree yet the aliens were quite capable of taking the dog urinating as an insult br br strange how the dog's urinating wasn't regarded as some form of worship i wonder how that one got by the show's writers br br from there we are subjected to a captain who was misguided by his duties in watching the episode i found it very easy to forget that bakula was supposed to be the ship's captain br br he chose to sleep in and from there we are given more inanities of behavior sigh that we aren't supposed to understand and that causes us to brows br br the doctor non chalantly clips long hairy toenails and feeds them to hungry caged animals then a white bat creature escapes br br oh how is anyone supposed to sleep with all of this going on clipping for crying out loud i was waiting for something that feeds on vomit to be presented br br then we were inexplicably given some idea that the captain was in love with t'pol and that perhaps he was masking those feelings with his concern over the dog br br endless amounts of rubbish br br your dog is ill so go have sex you'll feel better and of course the captain had to apologize and we humans had to regard his apology as completely ridiculous because we are so everyone smile very sarcastically narrow minded saw depictions such as this endlessly droned out on tng br br oddly enough the only thing missing from this awful episode was that trip person offering his smirks and downhome tho bakula seemed to be covering all of that with the silly dog br br oh the dog survived so now go play fetch
<START> out of all the parodies of star wars i've seen this is probably the funniest not because of the premise star wars with simple electronics instead of spaceships but because of how poorly acted it is this is purposely overacted and it makes it hilarious and since everyone knows its purposely overacted no one complains the special effects were also purposely as awful as can be and include a toaster on a visible string that shoots toast and an egg beater on a string this short is funny for any fan of star wars which i'm not or anyone that has 15 minutes to kill great short br br my rating out of 13 mins not rated
<START> the worst sequel i've ever seen really awful songs which is upsetting considering how fantastic the first films score and story is also which ruins the film for me is the fact there is no john cleese so jean bob might as well not even be in it and the new villains are dreadful it is really annoying how that old woman type thing cant string a simple sentence together properly without repeating her words over and over and over again but to be fair not shutting up is a little bit funny but the fact it was her 50th birthday why do they draw her looking like an 80 year old i was going to give this a 1 but now i think i might give it a 2 but still the story line is no where near as good as the first film it is similar without the humour from certain characters overall i disliked this film entirely because of the disappointing music the severe lack of voice talent having changed the voice of prince derek and jean bob the new villains disappointing storyline the annoying habits of some characters and the very simple animation
<START> although copies of this movie are hard to find if you can find it get it i believe this was aside from in the navy abbott and only musical although they twisted the plot around a little i've never heard a version where the butcher goes up with him you still enjoy the antics of the slightly idiotic but lovable jack and the greedy butcher mr slightly reminiscent of was a lady this uproarious film will have you rolling on the floor only to get up and dance as lou costello sings i don't know why they didn't do that in other films
<START> i can't remember exactly where i heard of them first but i listen to a little of one song and liked it went and bought the cd and had finally found the type of music i like i heard about this video and knew i had to have it it has a lot of clips from them playing in concert let me tell you watching this video doesn't even compare to them in concert i've seen them twice in concert and don't want to ever miss a chance to see them again the other two things it has is some interview and even a video for one of their biggest songs couple little side notes i saw them at 2001 and they ruled there but seeing them in a smaller inside stage was much better they had some really cool things to do with being able to cut out the lights the other in case anyone wonders means a devout follower
<START> my friends and i watched this movie last night it was pretty incredible by all means this was probably the worst movie i have ever seen at first it was tolerable it stunk of bad improv but it was pretty friggin hilarious despite the scenes being too long drawn out and the terrible quality i read 400 budget above sounds about right of the film itself br br the biggest problem came from the lack of a script with a background in improv i know how hard it can be to keep scenes short efficient what happened in this film was that the actors were left to improvise the scenes and they didn't know when to stop they just kept going for ages on stupid topics at first i thought this was because the movie was short and they needed long useless scenes to flesh it out as the movie progressed i realized it was just a really bad movie br br there were a lot of parts where i could see that the film maker had a really good idea for a shot but not the resources or talent to pull it off effectively a lot of the scenes were taken from a single shot cause you know improv for what felt like a really long time so boring if you can stand to put up with and hour and a half of terrible improv watch it it's really funny at parts but also really stupid and annoying the acting ranges from alright to absolutely terrible it seemed like the only good parts were the parts that really had nothing to do with the main plot the ballsy kid who swore lots the barbershop etc etc br br but yeah painfully bad like i was literally hurting after an hour or so my friends and i just got bored and left
<START> i love his martial arts style it is quick close up and oh so fast but it seems like his movies are becoming more and more crime based lifestyle quality and less meaning i thought he was out to bring forth a deeper message at least some of the movies had a hidden meaning or agenda this one had some good redeeming qualities of the character but the rest was so far off i was very disappointed the martial arts is also suffering i am hoping to see a more devoted segal in his future films this movie also lacks in keeping the story line going there are too many gaps so the thought is lost too many things are cryptic without a solution
<START> this film is undoubtedly one of the greatest landmarks in history of cinema by seeing this film we can only retrospectively notice that world cinema in 1950s had such a purely humanistic dramaturgy such a strong and adequate use of sound image montage and almost religious admiration of ethical choices in human life cinema was then not only one form of arts it was much higher than ordinary life and it gave many people hope to live after the tragic war it is said that even picasso was moved and cried that such a work of art can appear only once in 100 years audience that time was also different i read that after seeing kurosawa's ikiru live in its first release young couple quietly told each other it is a good film isn't it i think contemporary cinema though technically developed and opened some new narrative perspective has lost the most important reliance of audience was once really the most popular art from and unlike modern fine arts and contemporary music gave millions of people hope and ideals in this point of view must be in the pantheon of classics of all the time as city light ikiru and la strada
<START> given the acting roles he played in the 1940s casper gutman ferrari mr peters jerome k ex superintendent count titus semple it surprises many of his fans to learn that originally sidney greenstreet made a name for himself in comedies in the west end and broadway he was usually such a total villain or serious actor to the public that his comic talents were ignored in fact he actually did make four comedy appearances one a spoof of his villainous portrayals with his villainy partner peter lorre in a cameo appearance his best total film appearance in a comedy was probably that of magazine publisher alexander yardley in christmas in connecticut although his autocratic half mad soap tycoon in the hucksters is a close second despite some problems with the screenplay it is a good film and usually revived in the christmas season br br elizabeth lane barbara stanwyck writes a column in american housekeeping magazine for yardley where she gives household tips and cooking recipes she is the 1945 version of martha steward except that ms steward is a cook and house owner and can vouch for trying out and testing what she advocates stanwyck can't her cooking recipes are those of her friend felix s z a gourmet chef and restaurateur the house she describes as her home a model farmhouse in connecticut belongs to her unofficial boyfriend architect john sloan reginald gardiner gardiner really would not mind marrying stanwyck but she is not fully ready to consider a final commitment to him br br as the film begins an american is shipwrecked by the nazis this is jefferson jones dennis morgan a sailor he spends two weeks in a raft before being rescued sensing publicity value greenstreet decides to grant morgan's wish to have a genuine old fashioned christmas in connecticut he basically tells stanwyck that she will entertain morgan and himself at her farm for the holidays stanwyck is unable to explain that the columns image of herself complete with her ability to flip flap jacks and raise a baby she supposedly had with her husband is a lie if she does she will be fired as will her immediate boss dudley beecham robert shayne in a moment of depression she accepts gardiner's proposal of marriage and then gardiner finds his connecticut home is dragooned into becoming the actual home of stanwyck and himself and their baby br br of course aside from putting off greenstreet's meddling curiosity stanwyck and morgan find that they are falling in love much to the annoyance of gardiner he does actually expect that stanwyck will still marry him complication following complication occurs as lies piles on lies and as neighbor's babies succeeds neighbor's babies before greenstreet begins to wonder if he is missing something but it is a comedy so everything works out well even greenstreet at the conclusion is amused by the entire madness his celebrated hearty chortle mirroring that of santa clause for a change this is not a classic comedy certainly not a great one but amusing enough for the season to be worth watching in december
