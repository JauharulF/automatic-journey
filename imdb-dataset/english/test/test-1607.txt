<START> this is an excellent tub thumper from the war years br br john mills leads a fine cast of regular british b movie stalwarts in a solo submarine attack upon a fictitious enemy battleship br br filmed in black and white it's well paced and also well placed considering that a war was going on at the time if anything it shows how seriously the authorities took positive propaganda br br the mission side of the movie takes place in genuine submarines things are cramped and claustrophobic the actors look suitably grimy and sweaty without being too offensive to the heroic palate other commentators have already drawn attention to the authentic little details like keeping the vessel trim and forgetting to read instruments as well as the engine room activities br br this probably is the first movie in which debris and a dead german is blown from the torpedo tube to fool an enemy destroyer and it's the only time i have seen part of the vessel exposed in a pretence of sinking a high risk gamble if ever there was one br br i'm a little sceptical as to whether or not a submarine could punch its way through a wire rope net submerged speed was barely twice that of human walking speed and the net would have had a great deal of also the engineer was at the same work station and operating the same levers both on the surface and submerged this too seems implausible as either diesel or electric engines were used and they were in different sections of the ship or so i'm told br br there was a wee bit too much shore side drama for my tastes but then this was a propaganda effort and clearly contained a subtle message for civilians to mind their behaviour as it could adversely affect service morale and therefor the war effort br br these niggles aside it's a pretty entertaining little adventure nowadays movies of such vintage tend to be screened in the afternoon whilst far more modern and inferior movies enjoy prime time but then it's no longer politically correct to mention the war in the presence of our european friends too many of them have guilty or our own left wing fascists non of whom have ever fought for the freedoms they now take for granted br br as a submarine movie it is eminently collectible better than 'the enemy i think though less demonstrative not so authentic as by any means but not so gross either
<START> a cranky police detective suspects a french duke of being the infamous thief lupin br br john lionel barrymore costarred together for the first time in a motion picture in this intriguing crime drama alike and yet so different they are the perfect counterpoint to each other john plays his role with suave sophistication when not in disguise and lionel is earthy common in his portrayal each obviously having a wonderful time trying to out act the other helped by a generous script the outcome is pretty much a draw with the viewer the clear winner br br although upstaged by the two male stars karen morley is intriguing as the mystery woman john finds naked in his bed tully marshall gives a colorful performance as a silly nobleman with much to lose to the master criminal henry armetta george davis are very enjoyable as two seriously inept security guards john miljan provides a sturdy presence in his small role as the police prefect br br movie mavens will recognize an uncredited mischa auer as a guide in the louvre during the climactic scene dealing with an attempted heist of the mona lisa
<START> doesn't mean this movie is good i was really frustrated by it on many levels it's kind of the tip of the hat to bukowski hey i've read that guy in college let's see what matt dillon does with him and i like matt dillon i thought he came close to looking a little like hank but mostly just the cheeks i have to care about a character though and there just wasn't much here to care about i think time might be cruel to bukowski and that bothers me a lot because the writing was solid in a sort of post counter culture time hard to sit through scenes that went nowhere and a soundtrack that made me want to vomit i ask for very little got less
<START> i saw this movie on a fluke i was standing on 42nd street waiting for a bus to go home and a sister started passing out free tickets for a preview of this movie i gave it a chance not expecting much the promotional movie posters i've seen on the subway station walls do not give this film justice at all br br the movie is about a young rocker who goes on a journey to learn the craft and art of heavy metal i'll leave it there the movie is a heavy comedy and lot's of fun if your are old enough to remember when heavy metal dominated the music scene in the eighties you are going to love this film jack black is an amazingly talented comedian and actor and assuming he really wrote and performed the songs in this film he is also a talented musician br br tenacious d is definitely worth a look
<START> should we take the opening shot as a strange frame i guess we have to anyway two women are behind a closing umbrella they walk upstairs to the talent agency and we go with them and then they are never to be seen again okay how come not inside the place at the piano or even outside with the sound of the piano then track inside and over a la hitchcock so i guess clouzot is already telling us in a not very subliminal manner that we are following a segment of postwar society especially how he then uses a citizen kane like song cut up into about five pieces to show the lady singing traveling from the talent agency all the way to her first roses and applause of her vaudeville debut br br after that we are relentless observers of more or less small disgusting details of a defeated country getting off its war torn tattered knees and nobody ever handled small disgust better than clouzot in fact too bad he never tried sartre's nausea almost everything we see after the first few minutes makes us ever so slightly queasy okay okay i'm grossly overstating that let's just settle for a general feel of a lot of the film look carefully in fact and you will even see one of the cops picking his nose and in how many films has anyone ever done that then there is a very loud nose blowing bit in front of the photographer lesbian by the main cop and notice that she does not literally blink an eye or raise an eyebrow br br the point of all this is an almost feverish immersion in seemingly until you can smell practically every scene as well as see and feel it br br as for the other aspects of the movie others here have covered them in a lot more detail than i but forget about the mystery here this is the ultimate mcguffin clouzot is about as interested in the real killer as those two women coming in out of the rain in the first few seconds of the film and are never seen again from beginning to end all he wanted to do was follow a bunch of people around not even particularly interesting ones at that and say here look at this woman's twitch that man's hitching of his pants in all their insignificance years and years before tina turner was singing we don't need another hero br br even the forced levity of the ending is bleakly done in a dilapidated part of paris and rather chilly bare walled apartment with only the couples love for each other to see them through as if to say there must be two or three million like you throughout the city working your fingers off by the day for a little love at night br br from this it was just a short step to wages of fear and the ultimate in despair br br they don't even know how to make films like this anymore in the u s for that matter they didn't even know how to very much in france then much less now the relentless detail of gesture makes even the of italy look like bad psychologists which i guess makes clouzot a kind of rosselini on speed br br very enjoyable nonsense this movie the only flaw seems to me and as was pointed out by another viewer the lead woman is somehow not quite right everybody else in the film is just about perfectly cast
<START> my children dd 7 and ds 10 enjoyed the movie so much they were squirming in their seats it was good old fashioned rated g family fun this movie was made for kids someone really understands them br br it was fun to see julia roberts brice willis garth brooks and the other stars make their cameo appearances br br as someone who lives in the city the fictional big texas was modeled after i can say that they did an honest and accurate portrayal the kids looked like kids not like superstars br br i hope everyone supports this movie to send the message to hollywood that we need more movies like this go see it then spread the word
<START> i sat through this on tv hoping because of the names in it that it would be worth the time but dear gussie whoever thought this script was worth producing the basic idea is excellent but the execution is appallingly bad with a constantly illogical sequence of scenes an ending that is almost laughably melodramatic and poor rock hudson wanders through this with an understandably confused look on his slightly sagging face looks like a bad b movie from the 40's
<START> lovely candace bergen as the widow are kidnapped and held for ransom by the sheik played by one dashing sean connery the incident comes during 1904 as theodore roosevelt runs for election to the presidency in his own right needing a good example to show off the muscular foreign policy of the united states brian keith as roosevelt issues a stunning declaration to the sultan of morocco alive or dead br br but in this adaptation of that incident the famous declaration is the only true thing about this story the in question was in reality one ion who was a greek immigrant and dilettante playboy in fact gave up his american citizenship years ago and was back as a greek national never mind that though his predicament was serviceable enough at the time br br the damsel in distress makes better screen material though so it's a widow woman and her two kids that are in harm's way here of course as presented here the incident is also used by some of our european powers to get their foothold into morocco the intrigues get far beyond one demand for ransom br br the wind and the lion is hardly history but it is an enjoyable film and sean connery is always fun to watch brian keith also fits my conception of theodore roosevelt and the scenes in the roosevelt white house do ring true to all the stories told john huston plays the ever patient secretary of state john hay who roosevelt had inherited from his predecessor william mckinley br br but kids don't use this film to skip reading a history assignment on the theodore roosevelt era
<START> a gritty look at new york city and dock workers this is a classic film realistic brutal at times always believable it was originally shown live on tv also starring sidney poitier john cassavetes was a fantastic director and actor
<START> this probably ranks in my top 5 list of the funniest movies i've ever seen i was not a big fan of robin hood or robin hood prince of thieves but this movie was a lot different it made fun of robin hood and was hilarious i was extremely pleased with how well it was put together and how well acted it was besides home alone mrs doubtfire and houseguest this was the funniest move i've ever seen i especially love the song we're men in tights if you have a good sense of humor you'll love this movie
<START> it s funny how instinct warns you of something for example as soon as the company credits read nu image i knew instinctively i d seen a really crap film by them somewhere before but couldn t remember where nevertheless i just knew judge and jury was going to be crap and it was maybe i m psychic br br mild spoilers br br the opening is rather violent with several people getting blown away for no more reason than being in the wrong place at the wrong time i don t know about you but i m geting slightly fed up with exploitive violence onscreen nowadays along with bad language especially if it s spouted by actors as bad as the ones in this movie anyway the plot revolves around the bad dude getting executed and coming back to reek revenge on the man who shot his wife oh did i mention the bad dude and his wife murdered a couple of people on their wedding night yeah he s a serious badass mofo in fact he s so bad and i don t mean the acting i ll get to that in a moment that he s impossible to take seriously and this is before he s executed only to return as elton john elvis a french chef etc i wonder if keith david got paid for this because he looks he s having so much fun on screen that s the only reason he s playing the role what a pity this reviewer didn t have any fun whatsoever watching judge and jury hey maybe the producers could send me keith s fee gawd only knows i deserve it br br i disliked this movie a lot as if you t guessed and my main beef isn t with the stupid plot or the cheap production values but with its attitude to violence if like me you ve had a wine bottle cracked over your head or been kicked in the ribs very hard several times you ll know violence is an obscene painful thing but judge and jury will have you believe that if you re thrown through a window crash through some and fall twenty odd feet onto a table not only will you be unhurt but you ll be able to outrun a couple of rabid devil dogs it could of course be argued that any film starring sly arnie or bruce also suffers from this same dishonest showing of violence but with judge and jury it yanked my chain
<START> as i sat in the theater almost crying to myself in dismay over the atrocity ron howard and tom hanks call the da vinci code i could not see the light at the end of the tunnel that is angels and demons br br hanks and company are back for the sequel prequel angels and demons and they have learned their lesson br br acting wise everyone is much better is very good as and better than the girl who played sophie tom hanks is very good as always he is better in this though because he works harder at giving the movie the feeling that it is a thriller i think ewan mcgregor does the best job of any of the actors he might even deserve a nomination come march but doubtful he had me convinced right until the very end he's dynamic and faithful but rational and realizes that the church needs to put their past behind them the minor actors also do very good jobs br br technically and visually the movie is much improved the cinematography is much much better and the visual effects are superb the final explosion sequence at the end is excellent howard does a masterful job taking you through a tour of rome br br pacing wise ron howard does an amazing job this time around at keeping the story moving and not boring us with a history lesson deemed at denouncing christianity the movie also makes you feel like more is at stake in our feeble minds discovering whether or not jesus had children is not as high up on the list compared to a cataclysmic explosion killing thousands including the roman catholic church part of the reason i think the story is so fast paced is due to the excellent score i cannot say enough about the score it was epic at times like something from lord of the rings but then sometimes it felt like a bourne movie which is a nice mix br br my only complaint about this movie is that it is ridiculously far fetched the chances of the being someone of ewan age are highly improbable and the chances of a cardinal with an adopted son getting elected pope are even more ridiculous not to mention the whole antimatter thing which has yet to be created and dan brown wrote the book in 2003 br br overall angels and demons is much tighter faster paced more exciting and more important movie than the da vinci code this is must see thriller for anyone who loves history and mystery combined into one
<START> i as many imdb patrons seem to have stumbled upon this little film when it appeared on the canadian showcase network i was as many of you also sucked in and watched the entire film i was hooked at first by the literate dialogue and wry sense of humour that the film is rich with i was coasting along comfortably on a sort of kevin smith meets killer films wave until half way through when the movie really buckled down and explored it's themes in more detail with a decidedly darker and more poignant edge far from being taken out of the experience i was brought further in this is not the best film of it's kind and will certainly not have universal appeal so i do understand some of the more negative reactions to it but i bought in and enjoyed it immensely the flash back type movement in the chronology was effective the characters were well realized and the issues raised were human accessible to my experience anyway and interesting i was quite impressed with the film's ability to remain sweet funny and entertaining while not shying away from controversial subject matter and raw emotional language dynamics and situations this movie is a great antidote to a lot of the schlock that has permeated the witty clever romantic genre a kind of male brigitte jones for the literate sect take 2 hours out of your busy schedule and jump into world or you could go rent you've got mail 'cause if that appeals to you you won't like this anyway those of us who did like it will be alright without you on our side
<START> i loved this program and for years searched for it on video i've contacted a great many folks in my attempts to get a copy to no avail br br i do however have the second half of the program i would be willing to share my half with anyone who can give me a copy of the first half of this show i'd offer to provide copies of what i have to anyone but it's just only part of the program so it's just not an adequate representation of the show br br there are a few folks selling this on ebay for some incredible cost and that's plainly not fair not to mention blatant copyright violations br br please send any correspondence to aol com
<START> i got interested in this movie because somebody had made a beautiful video for bachelorette with clips from it so i watched the movie and it is indeed stuningly beautiful a masterpiece of animation br br unfortunately the story doesn't keep up it starts out well with interesting plotlines about people fencing for the possession of the rose bride but suddenly elevators fill up with water and looses their walls people float away and finally for no reason whatsoever is into a car and a chase ensues br br i like much anime for it's ability to make alternative universes but this universe is just stupid if you are gonna watch this movie turn of the sound it's better that way
