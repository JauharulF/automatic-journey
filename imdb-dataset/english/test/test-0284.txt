<START> i remember watching this for the first time in the 80's as a teen man i've read the reviews on this trash and i find myself astonished by the voting this movie does not deserve four stars this movie is not better than has its own problems don't get me wrong this movie should be banned just for its own stupidity so many stereotypes so many loop holes so much poor dialog i cannot think of one redeeming quality of this vomit this is not action adventure this is a bad joke on film kinda like watching plan 9 with stock f 16 footage this movie not only defies logic and common sense within the context of a military setting it sends a disturbing message the military is not going to save your dad from the imminent evil of the middle east b ds so go out there and hijack a multi million dollar weapon and blast him out of the sinister clutches of the backwards anti american arabs cuz you can't reason with those animals this is a bruckheimer flick without a budget bland direction weak acting lame music idiotic plot equals iron eagle
<START> some less than inspired opening string music notwithstanding we somehow know that from the word go this is heading straight for the big fun drawer by the time we observe monica dolan in a truly genius bit of casting delightfully goofing it up as cora early on we're already hooked but it is only later on when she reveals herself in her marvellous screen creation that deranged scheming maleficent queen of murder and deceit posing in the guise of the uptight miss gilchrist that she not only effortlessly steals the entire telemovie for herself but quite simply blows off screen anyone who comes near her including the ever well measured david suchet who himself seems to be somewhat bedazzled by her acting talents and very gentlemanly allows her to take centre stage dolan is the true engine of the film and her miss gilchrist a genuinely well rounded character in this christie rendition helped by a zesty script and the sprightly paced direction and also by the rest of the cast led by geraldine james and dominic who all display signs of sympathy for the given material and play with relish accordingly br br the production values are spot on as usual and if there are any weaker links they might be located in the comparatively substandard music score to the majority of later poirots and also perhaps in the lacking of a genuine italian born actor for the role of husband other than that this is an hour and a half of pure televisual delight which is as self indulgent and entertaining as it is lovingly put together
<START> seriously if you want to see a clichÃ© horror movie you have to see this one i guess it contains all the scary parts where nothing happens the nerd type who actually isn't killed boy and girl coming together and surviving facing an old child fear etc i can go on i wanted to see this movie cause i tought the mix of a video game and a movie would work out guess i was wrong which makes the movie more bearable it is only so if you are bored it might be a good idea although i rather stay bored why absolutely not see it frankie aka malcolm is just irritating as the nerd type i could smack the guy and it is so sad he didn't die earlier and in the end he even comes back see something else
<START> this wretched psychodrama uses every shabby device in the book to wheedle attention and sympathy from us for its characters who with one exception are not worthy of any notice at all let alone two precious hours of time br br as in robert redford's ordinary people a superb film that in comparison clearly shows up the vacuity of heroes a late teenage boy has died leaving his family in the throes of bereavement in this case the death was a suicide an event that nearly always poisons the emotional well of the survivors in a particularly corrosive way we follow these people over the next 8 or 9 months br br the father jeff daniels becomes a withdrawn virtually mute usually drunken stiff who secretly takes leave from his job for months sits instead on a park bench all day and insists on setting a full plate of food at the deceased son's place for every meal he treats everyone else in the family with unerring nastiness he sees his doctor regularly but the issue of therapeutic intervention in his obviously dysfunctional state never comes up br br the mother sigourney weaver yells at the neighbor woman among others gets busted when she stupidly tries to buy marijuana her term at a head shop what adult in reality would ever try such a dumb stunt and near the end swoons into coma with a lung condition that everyone in the theater assumes is cancer she's a heavy smoker ms weaver has a few flip lines but generally behaves too to merit much empathy br br it's not that there aren't people out there who behave in these silly ways when severely stressful circumstances arise but why make a film of such drivel what can anyone learn from this pair's conduct br br the older sister michelle williams is away at college and all too happy to distance herself from the family zoo the younger brother played by emile hirsch is the only credible member of the family his suffering is genuine its causes and his conduct is coherent within the circumstances but hirsch's character is too soft spoken too morose and beaten down to carry the movie the other bit players subtexts and cutesy unreal dialogue don't help br br the suicide theme is echoed in an almost nonchalant manner in the case of two other minor characters so what is the writer director dan harris trying to say about this subject that it isn't a serious matter why jeff daniels agreed to play the sap of a father as written in this screenplay is something only his therapist might possibly be able to answer avoid this dog instead rent redford's classic my rating 4 10 c seen on 2 17 05 if you'd like to read more of my reviews send me a message for directions to my websites
<START> as spectacle it's hard to fault the japanese people have benefited from their intimate relationship with the sea and the concept of the film implies that an entire world and way of life at risk thanks to its volcanic heritage from the standpoint of reality it's rather silly to have a drama wherein the entirety of japan vanishes under the waves why just japan br br so presume instead that we have movie reality fueled by spectacle and popcorn and some may find this quite affecting compared to adventures with japanese radioactive monsters this comes off as more mature and better paced the emotional element is underplayed and it really works it loses a bit with the overblown theme song at the climax however br br is credible probably not but the thrilling eruptions and the relaxed pacing make for a more pleasing entertainment that one night expect
<START> an asian assassin takes out victims in niagara falls and new york city before getting run over by a car sheila morris former miss sweden janet given a hilarious southern belle dub to show she's from alabama finds a connection between these killings and the disappearance of her sister diana paola and sets out to investigate this brings her to new guinea where she promises a sleazy guide robert i e american porn star r bolla 80 000 dollars to help locate her sister after barely making it through a jungle full of bloodthirsty cannibals they finally locate diana who's under the control of jim jones type cult leader jonas melvyn ivan rassimov jonas does the typical mad guru style things like passing out lsd initiating group suicide threatening to kill anyone who disobeys him and raping with a giant dong dipped in cobra blood every once in awhile a character will look to the right or left and see a gory scene lifted directly from jungle holocaust or man from deep river both of which were also directed by i'm pretty sure they also use at least two scenes from cannibal holocaust as well here we get the expected animal slaughter scenes gutting a gator natives eating live snakes plus some additional nudity and a castration me me lai shows up to give her breast implants another workout playing a widow who is gang banged by three of her brother in laws on top of the ashes of her freshly cremated husband mel ferrer briefly appears as a professor and isn't given much to do br br so anyway with you pretty much get a promise fulfilled with all the nudity gore dead animals and bad taste you expect with one of these titles so if you're a sleaze hound by all means watch it personally i got bored with it about midway through and just wanted it to end the original heavily cut u s release in 1985 was titled the emerald jungle in order to trick people into thinking they were actually renting john boorman's emerald forest it was also called doomed to die and eaten alive by cannibals
<START> peter o'toole is arthur chipping a latin teacher with strict adherence to detail and in helping young minds grasp the meaning and definition of latin words and phrases he is seen as being cold and unfair and not in touch with the times but upon meeting stage actress singer katherine clark not only at a late supper after a performance of london is london but at an in greece his closed minded world starts to open up br br goodbye mr chips is an mgm musical remake of the 1939 movie also from mgm during this time musicals were out and the hollywood studio system was in total shambles when it premiered in new york los angeles and london the musical numbers were left intact but when it came to the local main street theaters world wide it was sans songs therefore making the movie shorter and gaped to the max br br thanks to mgm ua home video under ted turner in the late 1980's early 1990's when vhs and laser disc were the main home video formats of choice the musical numbers were re instituted and the gaps closed laserdisc though was the only format chosen to view goodbye mr chips in the widescreen letterbox format br br for awhile now the original motion picture soundtrack was only available on the original out of print vinyl and cassette tape and can still be found today on ebay br br thanks to the wonderful people at film score monthly com in 2006 the soundtrack has been digitally remastered and remixed into a 3 cd set featuring the completely reconstructed score the original 1969 general release album score and narrated sequences source music and interviews a plenty you also get 1 unused song which is a real lost gem tomorrow with me by clark which would have been chosen in place of you and i before hand br br this movie is both a classic musical and a real tribute to educators everywhere i most certainly would buy this movie if warner bros mgm and sony would put their money where there mouth is and get this film restored from all master film sources and put it on both dvd and blu ray with all the bells and whistles put back into place with all the extras you can find and stuff into a release
<START> although this film is set amongst the sophisticated english upper classes it is a simple story of a couple torn asunder it has a slightly dated air being an adaptation of a way through the wood a 1950 novel by nigel once hugely popular and now forgotten julian fellowes who despite an academy award for the script of gosford park has a somewhat anachronistic persona himself wrote the script and directed the latter for the first time with the dvd version i saw there is a most illuminating audio commentary by julian his primary focus was on getting his characters right and by and large he has succeeded in this he was helped by two outstanding performances from tom wilkinson as james the stitched up city lawyer and emily watson as his attractive wife anne he also kept it short the running time is only 80 minutes br br james and anne have a town house in chelsea and a comfortable former in anne is some years younger but they are childless outwardly they seem happy but james one of nature's unusual for a city lawyer is a control freak just down the road is the aristocratic the william who is not one for middle class morality and he is more than happy to take advantage but there's a complication a road accident in which an elderly cyclist is knocked over in a country lane by a ruthlessly driven range rover just like the bill's soon james anne bill and the victim's widow who happens to be james' and anne's cleaner are drawn in to a conspiracy to conceal what really happened the primary focus is on the corrosive effect of all this on james and anne's relationship br br the third person in this mÃ©nage a trios bill is played by rupert everett from the point of view of casting his languid superior manner is right for the part yet somehow he doesn't quite get there partly this is because he is supposed to be sick for some of the time and he looks well when he is supposed to be sick and vice versa the part seems underdeveloped it is interesting that john neville as bill's father who has only one significant scene manages to establish his character beautifully in the time he has br br the world of five star hotels and superior restaurants is nicely evoked as julian fellowes says in the audio commentary these people are able to convince themselves that the edwardian age still exists at bottom though the film is about what draws a couple together and what tears them apart nigel was going through a marriage break up when he wrote the book and fellowes has made a good fist of conveying the atmosphere as he says his is a fairly free adaptation but the central theme is the same
<START> the first time i had heard of guest house was in the er washroom after having just seen fight club in each urinal was deposited a small round black circle when the circle came into contact with moisture to put it delicately it caused a colour picture to form with photographs of the two stars and the tag line you'll p yourself laughing when you'd finished washing your hands the circle had dried and faded to black again waiting to spring it's surprise on the next victim br br okay maybe the punchline wasn't terribly sophisticated but you have to admit it was innovative in fact i think i can honestly say i've never seen anything like it in my life before and these days of over a century of cinema and marketing that's a real feat what a pity the film that went with it failed to live up to the promise br br i hate to pan guest house and i am indebted to richard and adrian eddie elizabeth for many years of laughter through their appealing television series be it the invention of the young ones 1982 1984 the sitting room plays of bottom 1991 1995 or even solo work such as in the new statesman 1988 1993 in fact this would have made an hilarious 45 minute tv special unfortunately its an 89 minute film br br there's definitely some merit to be had and i laughed continuously throughout the protracted finale which spoofed the exorcist and raiders of the lost ark and involved well you'll have to see that bit for yourself yet often the pace is leaden and a sterile atmosphere is throughout the two stars taking his usual backseat this time due to the fact that he adequately directs never really get into first gear only sporadically showing the foul mouthed mania that makes us love him on the small screen indeed the writers' presumption that we are already familiar with the characters leads to them being to the audience the slight hints of depth seen in the series richie's effeminate failed social climbing for example are not present here and instead we are left with parodies of parodies br br the fawlty towers accusation does pass water complete with drunken chef and unseen called for waiter which uncannily rhymes with manuel some of the ideas such a hotel next to a nuclear reactor with a childrens' swing hanging over a cliff face are very very funny but ultimately the frenetic pace is stolen the two constantly looking for a studio audience that isn't there and all the dead laugh areas patched up with incidental comedy music that would have been dated in a carry on film two decades ago br br brand of puerile sadistic perverse humour is funny and i feel sure it will make you laugh just not as often as it should
<START> the problem with tv today is that people have been spoiled by lite tv viewing this type of television show is the equivalent of elevator music or easy listening jazz the typical viewers idea of continuity is remembering who got voted off the island last week and wondering who will be the next to go show them a program like surface firefly dr who or anything with a plot arc of more than three episodes and well they'll just flip back to survivor br br 95 of the sheep watching tv don't want to rack their brains they want excuses to not think they want to make sure the boob tube lives up to its name and they don't want shows that try and go any other route because of this surface and many other high quality shows that should have lasted far longer have gotten the axe br br tv viewers don't want stories or morals or philosophy or anything over a third grade vocabulary level they want people eating or over dramatized real life series no such thing you cannot observe something without changing the very nature of what you observe or hormonal shows involving groups of people having trysts and then bragging about it to their friends br br today's television is nothing but a wasteland and the few diamonds you can pick out of the dust are just tossed out because no one even knows what a diamond is anymore surface was one of those diamonds
<START> one of the great things about the best years of our lives that even though it dates itself rather firmly in the post world war ii era the issues it talks about are as real today as they were on v e or v j day of 1945 the problem of how to assimilate returning war veterans is as old as the written history of our planet br br and while we don't often learn from history we can be thankful that for once the united states of america did learn from what happened with its veterans after the previous world war the gi bill of rights is mentioned in passing in the best years of our lives was possibly the greatest piece of social legislation from the last century so many veterans did take advantage of it as do the veterans like march dana andrews and harold russell who you see here br br all three of those actors played archetypal veterans characters that every corner of the usa could identify with they all meet on an army transport plane flying to the home town of all of them boone city iowa br br war is a great leveler of class and distinction bank employee march soda jerk andrews and high school football star russell probably would never meet in real life even in a small town like boone city but they do meet and war forges indestructible bonds that can never be broken br br march is the oldest a man with two children and hollywood's perfect wife myrna loy he settles in the first and the best he has some wonderful scenes getting cockeyed drunk on his return and later with a little bit of liquor in him tells the bank officials at a banquet off in no uncertain terms br br i also love his scene where another returning veteran a sharecropper wants to get a bank loan for his own piece of land watch march's expressions as he listens to the man's pitch for money you can feel him read the man's soul it's what got him his second best actor oscar for this film br br harold russell was a real veteran who lost both his hands during service in the pacific he got a special recognition oscar for his performance because of that it was probably unfair to nominate him in the supporting actor category which he also won in his performance especially his scenes with cathy o'donnell as his sweetheart who loves him with or without his hands is beyond anything that could be described as acting br br dana andrews is the only officer of the three a bombardier in the army air corps of the group of them maybe he should have stayed in he also comes from the poorest background of the group and he was an officer and a gentleman in that uniform that uniform and those monthly checks are what got virginia mayo interested enough to marry him the problem is that he's considerably less in her eyes as a civilian br br while mayo is fooling around with steve cochran andrews has the great good fortune to have march's daughter teresa wright take an interest in him they're the main story of the film andrews adjustment to civilian life and adjusting to the fact he married the wrong woman not all veteran's problems were solved with gi bill br br myrna loy gets little recognition for the best years of our lives my guess is that it's because her role as wife was too much like the stereotypical wife roles she had patented over at mgm still as wife to march and mother to wright she really is the glue that holds that family together br br the best years of our lives won for best picture for sam goldwyn best director for william wyler and a few others besides the two acting oscars it got it was a critical and popular success possibly the best film sam goldwyn ever produced it remains to this day an endearing and enduring classic and will be so for centuries it's almost three hours in length but never once will your interest wane br br the best tribute this film received came from frank capra who had a film of his own in the oscar sweepstakes that year in several categories in his memoirs he said that he was disappointed to be at the oscars that year but that his friend and colleague william wyler had created such a masterpiece he deserved every award he could get for it br br by the way the film capra had hopes for was it's a wonderful life the beat years of our lives can't get better praise than that
<START> this movie has everything it has a good storyline good acting great scenery adventure and some brilliant gags chris farley plays tommy mega successful company auto has to go on the road to stop the company going under after big tom dies the trouble is that tommy knows nothing about break pads and needs the help of callaghan auto parts worker richard david spade from the moment the two dorks hit the road the movie is just so much fun if you love slapstick with a great storyline you'll love this because the gags keep coming thick and fast and the movie will just make you laugh out loud it was so sad about untimely death in 1997 but a credit to his genius is boy' get it chill out and enjoy this brilliant slapstick
<START> first off i've read the comments by the director further down and i'd like to thank him for offering his opinion i've always wondered what the makers of the films lambasted on mst3k felt about their works being shredded not to mention how best brains acquired the rights comments make me curious however as to how much sci fi could have cut the film to make it seem different now i'm thinking i might rent it from netflix of course i've never seen the uncut non mst3k version of this film but even having seen it on mst3k i never thought of it as a bad film or something unwatchable though i did think it was a pretty funny mst3k episode certainly not as pearl describes it skin awful not after seeing the likes of future war and hobgoblins br br as far as cutting the film it's been done before on mst3k at least once case in point the joe don baker flick mitchell in which the subplot involving john saxon's character is cut in the mst3k version yet joel and the bots comment on saxon's absence after his appearance in the beginning of the movie if i may submit a criticism of mst3k if you need to cut the film for time considerations fine but be fair to the film being cut even if it is a film as lousy as mitchell of course such criticism is rather pointless what with the show being over but i think that aspect of the show was kind of unfair but anyway if it's the case with it gets my sympathies br br still i maintain that it's an enjoyable mst3k episode though the movie itself even the version that's been hacked in mst3k is no where near terrible br br as a final note in a weird coincidence or perhaps a case of synchronicity i happened to watch the hudsucker proxy the day aired and wouldn't you know it the guy who played vivian father had a bit part in that movie one of his three other credited roles actually i thought that was kind of weird
<START> i saw this movie over 5 years ago and the subject still infuriates me as it should her anger and initiative were inspiring not that i would takeover an army and kill people but the scene at the well and at the rebel strong hold will never leave my mind this is a great film but be prepared for the strong subject matter
<START> i didn't understand the people who rated it over 5 i think it's a horrible film from any point of view plots acting art dialog music whatsoever i don't mind a low budget however you have to get some point wandering wondering pointless then two boys started kissing in bed awful just awful i love indie films don't mind it is slow however this movie disappointed me from any perspectives even the not artistic br br i was wondering what kind of people would like it i am a female in my 30's is it for teens who have some kind of the loneliness about life or i just don't get it what i gained then wasting time please go for some others
