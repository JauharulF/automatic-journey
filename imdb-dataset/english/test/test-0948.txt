<START> terrible action movie in which lead franco nero exchanges his cowboy hat gun belt and the coffin he dragged around in django 1966 for an all white ninja outfit with all the snazzy paraphernalia that goes with it despite virtually non stop action the film is utterly clichÃ©d and unintentionally funny with a campy villain to boot in christopher george susan george no relation is the attractive woman with a washed up husband nero's wartime companion whom the villains are trying to push off her oil rich land but the latter haven't counted upon nero's martial arts and stunt heavy gymnastics the solution to their problems is to hire a similarly skilled ninja for themselves who as it happens turns out to be nero's deadly enemy played by sho kosugi who appeared in two more sequels and is currently engaged in another the climax takes place inside an arena where one man army nero george and what has remained of his gang from previous confrontations the subtle way in which he his nemesis however is effectively done
<START> saw this at the video store and thought i'd give it a try sounded like a good story and the cover looked good that was it the characters looked good and the actor who played noel was the most convincing though he didn't have any heavy time in the movie i find it really hard to give a movie a bad rating but this is one in a minute number that gets it my book as the movie went along i kept wanting it to get better but to no avail it was good the sound and lighting was good but the acting in this film killed it for me it was like watching a low grade soap opera i just kept saying i can't believe they released this move like this i paused several times out of sheer unbelief that the acting was that bad there's so much i want to say but i'll just say this everything else for the most part was good it was the acting as a final cut that really did this film in
<START> i seem to notice that a lot of people have never seen this movie and those that have usually dismiss it as garbage that's pretty bad really br br the first time i saw this movie i admittedly was almost one of those people thank god i'm patient otherwise i would have never found such a classic br br as goofy as this movie is it's also a must have for anyone who is either a fan of 80's movies or just happens to have a sense of humor br br i know that there are a lot of people out there that will tell you that this movie is sort of derivative of better off dead so what if it is they were both excellent movies br br i can honestly say that savage steve holland is a genius 10 10
<START> my house mate and i foolishly purchased the video of 'the roller blade from our local second hand video shop in the hope of finding a bad film to laugh at this film isn't even laughable it's pathetically poor worse even than jack frost 2 and that's saying something the script acting production stunts sound sets everything is absolutely terrible in some parts the actors haven't even learned their lines and are blatantly ad libbing or in one case actually having the lines read to them off set and simply repeating them set in the post apocalyptic zone' the film obviously consists of about 45 minutes of film many parts of which are edited badly or repeated ad nauseum from various different camera angles to make the film longer this gets tedious very quickly the plot makes no sense whatsoever it is apparently an amalgam of two books written by scott shaw there aren't even seven of them most of them aren't on blades they're wearing roller boots and it seems to me that mostly the film has been completely sold on the fact that there's about 3 minutes of female semi nudity in it the writer and star scott shaw obviously fancies himself somewhat of a samurai and throughout the film performs some very poor stunts and made up sword fighting moves that look massively amateurish despite all this his website states that the film should never be compared to a traditional film because it really pushes the boundaries of modern film making my house mate and i were left speechless by the whole ordeal and despite my frequent attempts to burn the videotape she has decided it may be some kind of ring esquire video curse that needs to be passed on if you see the video in stores take it from me leave well alone
<START> as a huge fan of the original operation delta force i thought i'd pick this film up i figured it couldn't be too bad however here's a list of things i learnt from watching operation delta force 4 deep fault br br the delta force despite being the elite in american armed forces are mostly mildly overweight men in their late 30s and early 40s br br the delta force despite being the elite in american armed forces carry standard police issue pistols or ak 47s on their most important missions br br the delta force despite being the elite in american armed forces haven't learnt that during stealth missions wearing bright red ski jumpers and running around in open spaces aren't exactly going to keep you out of sight br br when you drop a molotov cocktail into a tank it explodes externally like a grenade br br when you get hit by tank fire you can run away although the smoke caused may present minor difficulties for breathing br br you can die from one standard gun shot but you can also live despite being hit multiple times by a sniper rifle and a few times by an ak 47 br br in hand to hand combat members of the delta force despite being the elite in american armed forces are regularly pummeled by railroad attendants br br if bad guys are approaching you while on a slow moving train there's nothing to worry about between the 4 of them they can't manage to figure out how to get an automatic weapon to fire automatically let alone hit anyone from 5 metres 16 feet with at least 50 attempts between them br br if you're short on actors just recycle them the bad guy from operation delta force 1 plays a good guy called mac in operation delta force 4 and the guy who played mac in operation delta force 3 now plays skip lang a different good guy br br it's not ok for the delta force to shoot an unarmed terrorist even if he's attempting to reload his weapon to kill you br br grenades explode on impact with the ground when thrown by members of the delta force when thrown by non delta force personnel they explode at exactly the point where the delta force members have thrown the grenades back at the bad guys br br tanks can drive faster than standard trucks br br and personal armies use the exact same chopper that the un used in operation delta force 1 br br when a chopper arrives a bad guy in that chopper cannot see you if you lie face down br br shooting someone multiple times in the chest will cause minor damage stabbing that person in the knee will kill them inside 5 seconds br br the delta force steal cars from old people to get around when in foreign countries because the us military do not provide them with any means of transport this may also explain why they caught public transport br br as you can see this is not really the finest moment in film making but it's good for a laugh
<START> wow where do i begin i rented this movie because it sounded like something i would be interested in watching with a name like val kilmer starring in this film i thought how bad could it be this has got to be the worst film i have ever seen with such a big name attached to it i was wondering why it slipped through the cracks and i never remember hearing anything about it when it first came out it starts out pretty good and is somewhat reminiscent of the intro sequence in the bourne identity but after the initial 30 minutes or so it goes from bad to worse and then it ventures into wtf land if you haven't seen this do yourself a favor and don't rent buy it unless you are a masochist or on a quest to see every val kilmer film out there there are many more titles out there that are more deserving your time this film if you can call it that is a bona fide waste of time i want my 82 minutes back
<START> this film is about a woman falling in love with a friend of her boyfriend from then on she has to divide her time for the two boyfriends jack during the day and joseph during the night br br this film feels like as if it was made with minimum budget the majority of the film is set in a flat with minimal furniture there are only three main actors all the other actors listed in the credits make only momentary appearances the wardrobe designer doesn't seem to have much to do as the actors wear very down to earth clothes and actually most of the time they are naked anyway br br the film is very dialog heavy which should have made up for the shortcomings described above however the dialogs sound too composed and awkward in the beginning of the film most of the dialog is a person saying a very long sentence and then the person says 'me too' after the frenzy of agreement the dialog descends into a mess of disjointed and confused word salad br br the only merit of this film i can think of is that it serves as a feminist outlet which conveys that it is not just men who can be unfaithful br br this film is a great disappointment
<START> br br i understand that people have different expectations of low budget arthouse movies i also know that john sayles has a sort of glow about him that earthy intellectual anti hollywood vibe a la tim robbins the coen brothers and atom egoyan that makes him a darling with the critics from the get go br br but this is not a good movie i'm sorry it just isn't br br it meanders it has too many characters its tone is uneven its point of view is muddled the acting is all over the board from naturalistic to over the top it lingers for long moments with minor characters we don't care about and cuts away from tense scenes just when things are getting good br br it misses the mark br br the worst flaw in the movie is that the two closest things to a protagonist edie falco's and angela desiree are straight jacketed in characters that have no drive is an apathetic drunk steeped in her life's own inertia desiree is a woman trapped in her own repressed pain when your two main characters' world views can be summed up with the phrases i don't care and i want to leave here why should the audience give a rat's br br i'll be plain sayles writes funny dialogue he's very adept at crafting a scene the problem is these scenes don't go anywhere there's no spine to the movie no drive the movie doesn't create rooting interest in any of the characters in my opinion he's also too preachy about big bad corporate america gobbling up the little guy br br if you want to see a quality small movie see david lynch's straight story pass this one up
<START> i went into a screening of sister helen at the sundance film festival and did not know what to expect br br i was riveted by the people in this documentary sister helen is an incredible character the filmmakers captured the essence of sister helen's amazing soul and took me into a world unknown i was thoroughly satisfied by the journey and was completely caught off guard by this film's ending br br this film speaks to those who desire a second chance at life
<START> ants are shown in cartoons as being able to carry away chicken legs people etc this may be an admirable characteristic because ants carry the film phase iv this is not because they want to but because they have to br br the movie opens with a narrator cryptically explaining that some cosmic event has come over the earth and that a fellow scientist has been working on the effect this disturbance has on the ant population the movie is broken up in segments the first part after the cosmic event is phase i and so on until the end of the movie which is phase iv br br what is phase iv who knows we don't get to see that part presumably it has something to do with the bonding of one of the scientists studying the ants and a girl who lived in the area the girl who looks like a cross between alicia silverstone and liv tyler is mad at the ants because they killed her horse but except for one angry outburst goes around the with a blank clueless look br br these ants are pretty smart or the scientists are rather dumb i'll give credit to the ants why anything that usually ruins my picnics that can then build reflecting towers blow up trucks and adapts to poison with the greatest of ease gets my vote for being the smarter species at least in this movie br br sterno says stomp on this br br
<START> overall i give this film a decent 7 6 to start i'll say i love how the character was portrayed and adapted on to the screen if you read comics occasionally or simply watch dvd extras you'll see the blade character is drastically different from the one we see in the film among the changes blade is now most importantly half vampire therefore acquiring all of their strengths but none of their weaknesses the credit for this goes obviously to david a fellow fan of the darker genre of comic books thanks to him blade has become a much more interesting character and i find him one of my favorite anti heroes really wesley snipes is born to play this role although some would've probably washington or will smith lol his acting here doesn't need to be exactly oscar winning per say considering the character but i'm glad he to play the in the two sequels also starring is stephen dorff as our main villain and kris kristofferson as blade's alfred so to speak the acting is good actually and the action keeps the plot going for sure the opening scene in the club is one of my favorite parts i've got to say as much as like this movie there are few things that bother me which take away from this film ranking with something like spider man or x men stephen had the villains portrayed in a way i didn't like so much honestly their lines were so full of foul mouthed comedy it didn't really feel like a comic book film to me plus la a bit disappointing as the final villain but the intense sword fight makes up for it i guess not to mention a sense of extra non realism a black man in a leather coat with a sword the out of a cop in broad day light some how going unnoticed by the crowds walking by seemed kinda well dumb moving away from a few of its flaws the music by mark isham was great and fitted the film nicely luckily all these problems are fixed and improved on in the stunning sequel blade 2
<START> i'm amazed that the hospital has been so well received by the critics and the public i found it dreary visually ugly and generally meaningless after the first virtually unwatchable 40 minutes the film does improve relatively but it remains way too far fetched not to mention unfunny to be successful as a satire and has too little substance to succeed as a drama the film's uncertain tone is its biggest fault overshadowing even scott's terrific as usual performance
<START> i don't know if i'd go as far as to say that this movie belongs to the trash' pile but it's fair to say that there are no academy award nominees here what must be considered is that most of the actors in this film weren't actually actors as such just kids with nothing better to do at the time there were many others that were offered roles in the film but turned them down to go surfing up the coast all things taken into account it really wasn't a bad movie for its time in some respects it's really not unlike today's times where peer pressure is still alive and kicking just without the mobile phones computers and other similar gadgets that kids lived without unlike this generation anyway i have to rate this flick as an old fave that i watch once in a blue moon and never take too seriously
<START> at 20 years old francis shia lebouf as his whole life ahead of him in a way the son of an immigrant family living in the late 19th to early 20th century era united states class was a very limiting fact of life if one is born poor one stays poor if one is born into the bourgeoisie one has a tiny bit of opportunity if one is born into the wealthy class they essentially have it made in the shade british gold champion harry and francis' golf idol played by the criminally underrated stephen is the exception that proves the rule born and raised in a poor british family his accomplished skill at golf allowed him to rise from the dirty mess of the poorest slums to the lush greens of the english country clubs he has not forgotten this life lesson francis wishes to follow in footsteps and similarly uses his great skill at golf to get into the 1913 us open at age 20 but a tough course and formidable opponents including francis' idol harry are not all that francis must deal with as a less than understanding father and cruel societal framework stand in his way of living his own dream br br i know what you are thinking i thought it too a walt disney produced film about the 1913 us open starring the irritable shia labeouf holds the possibility of being entertaining but it cannot possibly be a great film well i am here to encourage you to think again despite what it may look to some on paper the greatest game ever played is one of the best sport films in creation br br as with every great sport film the greatest game ever played includes many exciting sport scenes but it is not a film about golf it is a character centered film about using one's talents following one's dreams and breaking out of class barriers where the greatest game ever played works excellently as a themed sport film it also works just as well as a period film the film's featured costumes and sets being the next best thing to actual time travel the film also simply looks great and virtually unknown music composer brian tyler set the film to a wonderful piece of music the cast is great as well with a subtle but powerful stephen as british golfing champion harry a hilarious stephen marcus as man's man golfer ted ray a hammy josh flitter as francis' pre teenaged caddy eddie and a surprisingly good shia labeouf in the lead role as francis actor bill paxton apollo 13 titanic turns director here for the second time directing a full length feature in the greatest game ever played he produces a fine product incorporating plenty of heart ingenuity and an attention to detail in the making of the film
<START> this is a film that i love above all others i try to revisit the main film locations in and whenever i can which help to re establish those magical qualities that this film seems to embody so uniquely recalling a gentler and more mannered age with its unspoken assertions that people really do matter that family life is not just another disposable and that life really is worth living though sometimes we may doubt that in short a film that soon brings tears to my eyes helped perhaps by the deeply evocative music some tunes are jaunty like the tune played on a trombone sometimes with spoons the stirring melody when the family first set off for yorkshire not knowing what lies ahead and the haunting little tune played on a solo clarinet or is it an that precedes sudden child felt changes in fortune br br this is as much a film for adults as for children appealing to the eternal child in us all a key that effortlessly those deep and apparently long lost values and feelings buried inside us which are normally swept aside by the demands of modern everyday life this is a film about basic human goodness and decency in which we the viewers are left to make of it what we will and there are welcome touches of humour sometimes added for good measure such as the arrival of the aunt or on a more earthy level the bedroom scene on birthday all right bert as it's your birthday i must know every scene every line of this film and yet so great is the magic that each time i watch it is like i am opening a box of delights for the first time each moment sometimes humorous sometimes well very different as peter says in the film it's perfect more perfect than you know and so it is
