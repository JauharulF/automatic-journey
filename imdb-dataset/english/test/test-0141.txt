<START> from today's point of view it is quite ridiculous to rate this film 18 or x in the us the film has a sexual yet sublime erotic story to tell but the pictures are rather innocent throughout the movie you feel and see the spirit of the late 60s and early 70s in the fashion the dialogues and the typical experimental cinematography and lighting and this is exactly the part that makes it worth seeing
<START> house of dracula isn't all that bad of a film and is rather decent at times br br spoilers br br arriving at the home of dr franz onslow stevens in his seaside home count dracula john carradine discreetly seeks a cure for vampirism he starts work on a potential cure involving blood transfusion the wolf man lawrence talbot lon chaney jr arrives at his estate looking for a cure to lycanthropy working with the two patients he discovers a possible cure in a mold found near the laboratory and after searching the area he finds the frankenstein monster glenn strange buried nearby becoming obsessed with reviving it dr keeps neglecting dracula and larry's requests and after demanding that they get their treatment instead of him working on the monster they turn on each other in a climactic showdown br br the good news this was a rather decent film there is one main idea that is quite creative and imaginative this is the first film to openly propose the idea of vampirism as a blood disease and one that can be transferred from person to person through the exchange of bodily fluid something that would be taken up by later genre works but rarely as directly as this there's even a microscope slide of the parasite that is believed responsible for the condition it works in some rather nicely used ideas and comes across as a rather nifty idea even if some of the execution is a little stale the fact that each of the creatures has at least one standout scene is a nicely done idea the wolf man has a marvelous scene where he transforms inside a prison cell to the doubting members of the search party and goes crazy dracula's initial appearance of appearing as a bat and flying toward a prone figure sleeping and then appearing in human form looks really impressive the monster rampage is well handled and an appropriate amount of destruction is caused the large bat that dracula transforms into always looks decent for once and is quite realistically done it's a thoroughly decent affair br br the bad news there are several things that weren't all that great about this one the fact that the film combines so much potentially intriguingly plots and ideas that it really doesn't know what to do with them there are several different back stories that have to be mingled together and which should be clear enough to mix well together and seem coherent this really doesn't have any of that the plot is rather flimsy and doesn't really give a treatment to any of the stars and instead concentrates on one then another and then includes all three in the ending the monsters only seem to get engaged with each other for the smallest possible reason makes it a big distraction the ending is for once a big let down and seems entirely like it was changed at the last minute there's a few other small things that weren't all that spectacular and pretty much also contribute to this br br the final verdict it's quite a decent film and manages to get through most of the time with an entertaining style nowhere near the classic status of each monsters' debut features but it's a nice enough watch for fans of the monsters and of universal films in general br br today's rating pg violence
<START> i am biased because i appear in this film but i loved it and i am only in about seven dispersed minutes and am not nearly the most interesting part of it the film is an honest and intriguing account of a noble independent group of filmmakers trying to make a lovable movie it is also an account of bloated expectations and fallen heros the interviews are well patched together in the editing the different people are all interesting and there is never really too much of one person also the interviews are shot in a pretty interesting fashion keeping the film visually satisfying definitely a worthwhile film i hope it gets around
<START> this is a cute little movie that provides pretty much what it promises some good entertainment after all when a movie proclaims it features top sass shooters you have to figure that it is not a likely candidate for the best picture oscar those guys are shooters not actors your next clue is that the movie doesn't star nicholas cage or jennifer aniston i e you shouldn't expect to see the current hottest names it was meant to be just plain old entertainment and in that regard it is every bit as good as a lot of the old oaters i have seen through the years br br so what do you get with hell to pay you get 100 minutes of good old entertainment you get a chance to see some stars from past years who act pretty much like what they did in their prime but a little older you get to see some good sass shooters in major roles and a few sass hams in the background it was a lot of fun for me seeing people that i have shot with visited in their homes and who are my good friends get to do something that a lot of people only ever dream about they're in a real live honest to gosh movie they're doing something a lot of wannabe actors and wannabe shooters will never get the chance to do and i think that alone makes it worth the watch br br admittedly not everyone is a sass member and so i saw lots of fun and humor that others may miss but it is still good old fashioned entertainment and frankly there are a lot of movies in the theatre right now that i wouldn't give a nickel to see so save the money to go see brokeback mountain get hell to pay and watch some real cowboys have some fun
<START> this version is very painful to watch all of the acting is very stilted but especially that of norma shearer who is still acting as though she were in a silent movie instead of a talkie check out the 1937 version with joan crawford robert montgomery and william powell which is much more entertaining
<START> i thought it was going to be a lousy movie honestly i mean rupert ron acting in a movie different from harry potter was actually really difficult to picture it but as the movie started it showed that this guy does have talent i mean is the best actor of the hp trio for reference have you seen emma watson trying to act or what about daniel's acting both lack experience even though they have acted in a million harry potter movies ben his character is a very shy boy incapable of showing his true feelings about everything his despise about his over ruling mom and the resentful anger towards his father who is unable to step up and confront his unfaithful wife julie walters was absolutely brilliant her interpretation of an old retired actress trying to live with the shadow of her past while she tries to remember shakespearian is absolutely wonderful also it appears that many youth is wasted in religious nonsense acts
<START> i absolutely love this movie i just managed to get a copy and saved it to watch on my birthday this movie brings up several questions one is who are the monsters of this world to be different is just that different the real monsters hide behind masks of ordinariness they are those that everyone considers a nice quiet bloke who didn't bother anybody or they are worse they are the characters such as played by men who draw pleasure and power from carving up people and creating their own books of blood i love the shapeshifters people with gifts and those that may be for people to look upon this movie touches on and explores what is normal who are 'other' and what fear does to some even though i gave this movie 10 i am still sick of women who either scream or are so set in their ways that they cant see what is happening and being a vehicle for the things that destroyed median my other complaint was why didn't they ever make a second film i for one would have loved to see a continuation of this most intriguing story that keep me captivated from beginning to end
<START> a poor basketball movie a gruff coach with a dubious background comes to a small indiana high school basketball team in the 1950's and coaches the boys to victory by breaking them down first and then building them up br br not a bad subject photography ok but the plot is totally predictable no real sub plots nothing added to make the movie exciting you know what is going to happen from the very beginning suitable for 4th graders
<START> i've seen all 3 now i just can't believe how bad naqoyqatsi is not in comparison to the others but simply on it's own merit or lack of br br i can't understand how the average rating for this movie is over 6 out of 10 i gave the first 2 movies 8 out of 10 they were thought provoking and beautifully done i gave this movie a rating of 1 if a 0 or negative number was available i would have given it that rating instead what a total waste of time it was watching this movie i thought after the first 30 minutes that i should turn it off but then i figured that it was just a very slow starting movie i thought the same thing after 45 minutes then 1 hour etc then i realized that it wasn't going to get any better br br it's very tedious to watch and without any redeeming qualities don't take my word for it watch it yourself be sure to see the first two movies before this one if you see this one first i can just about guarantee that you'll never want to see the first two but they are definitely much much better than this piece of work br br the best part of the movie is when the credits role at the end that's when your penance on this earth is complete and you can 89 minutes in purgatory for the suffering that you've endured watching this film if god is truely merciful he'll be more generous
<START> i often wonder how movies like this even get made and the most shocking part is that people actually pay to watch them br br with it appears as though the director made up the story as he went along adding twists and turns when he liked no matter how ludicrous they were the script was non existent with inane dialogs such as jo sheena roy hai fashion hota hai and yeh versace hai madam yeah right br br every one of the characters was shallow and underdeveloped acting was awful lycra for and awful suits for a stocky emran locales the numerous houses that were used for interiors did not even vaguely resemble a victorian mansion screenplay etc etc just one word rubbish br br for those people who love hashmi and his movies watch it as for me i'll never get those two and a half hours back the only redeeming factor was some of the music which was decent
<START> aaliyah blows all the female cast members out of the water including the official love interest marguerite moreau br br i would have loved to see this movie play out as power trip aaliyah is simply electrifying whenever she is on the screen she does sensual beautiful and menacing to the power of 10 watching her take on a bar full of vampires is a sight to behold br br lena olin is cast in the ungrateful role of the older woman which is hugely unjustified she looks fantastic and at 46 according to the imdb still looks stunning br br the story unfortunately is very limited plot wise we've seen it all before etc br br the most heart wrenching is death scene especially keeping in mind what happened to aaliyah after filming br br all in all a remarkable vampire movie
<START> i saw this movie yesterday on a public service channel they had advertised it as an awful movie and so i was drawn to see it and i was not let down br br a group of 18 19 year old go to an excavation site at an old viking castle in denmark to try to uncover the myth of the berserker vikings strange things happens something is in the forest and people start disappearing br br the main thing about this movie that really bothers me is that the story is supposed to take place in denmark where i happen to live there were so many places in the movie where the hollywood style overlapped danish reality it really made the acting and drama look ridiculous in my eyes br br you never see the characters interact with any of their surroundings its feels like a mini hollywood in denmark and it takes away the credibility of the movie when at one point you hear someone speak old danish it sounds exactly like modern day swedish really bad research considering the director is from denmark br br the characters in the movie used gps and maps and that's really funny since denmark is about the size of your backyard where you are there is never more than 50 km to the sea and 500 meters to civilization and if you are at a castle there are going to be tourists everywhere we see a lot of overviews of forests in the movie and sometimes we see what appears to be north american vegetation the story did not exactly appeal to me maybe because the acting was so bad when the characters see the bog creatures for the first time they are not even scared i guess their acting skills were insufficient to display realistic emotions at the end there is an unexpected twist but it didn't impress me since i didn't really care br br the bog creatures are cheap but they had the potential to be scary unfortunately they fail since we get a good look at them standing in the forest when the characters arrive at the castle also there are no really scary scenes since the bog creatures are mostly just standing around br br anyway conclusion disregarding the facts the movie is your typical b horror flick i guess people from other countries can enjoy it more as long as you are unaware of reality it doesn't matter just like i think of usa as one big action movie set everyone else can think of denmark as a forest with a castle and some living dead people in a bog
<START> the only time i ever actually laugh while watching this show is when i'm making fun of it jamie lynn spears only got the acting job because of her big sister and i don't think anyone could argue with me on that there is no expression in her face ever even when she smiles just watch the show and you'll see what i mean now let's talk about the show zoey 101 is one of the most unrealistic shows i've ever seen as a lot of people have already said zoey brooks is absolutely perfect everyone loves her she's a straight a student and all the boys think that she's hot is a boarding school full of rich kids that gives all their students flat screen tvs and laptop computers serving kids sushi from the sushi bar in one of the newest episodes zoey is completely clueless and thinks that chase is not in love with her and acts as if she doesn't even want chase to love her then when she into chase's dorm room to prove her friends wrong she finds chase kissing this girl named rebecca zoey of course freaks out probably because she likes the attention from chase anyway only watch this show if you have nothing else to do and the only thing on television is zoey 101 you can at least have fun laughing at how unrealistic it is
<START> dumb meaningless movie should appeal to southern rednecks teenagers with iq's bordering on retarded and the average bush supporter noble willingham plays the lead in this simpleminded script for what it is and uses a generous dose of eff this and eff that and sobs the ending which i anticipated to save this hollow story was the biggest letdown leaving me hanging and wondering why br br it's a story of cat mouse or more like bully vs victim br br don't waste your time unless you like hearing the phone ringing every 2 minutes and constant cursing and screaming throughout this 123 minute piece of dumpster droppings
<START> the concept for this movie was quite good but somehow the execution failed on many parts there aren't many horror movies that i can think of that used dolls that looked so realistic especially when these dolls start blinking their eyes or moving hands so much could have been done with this premise there were a lot of scenes where there was room for tension and suspense and i really was expecting creepy things to happen but never did the movie managed to be scary one of the main reasons is that the story is too minimal and predictable i actually thought that they did this on purpose in order to surprise us with some wonderful twist sadly this doesn't happen well at least not in the way that i hoped for the cast also failed to make it all believable it would have been nice if more background was given on the characters in the beginning when we get introduced to the main character it seems that she and other characters are invited by some sort of artist but it also is apparent that they don't have an idea themselves what they are invited for of course this is part of the mystery but it does seem unlikely if i got an invitation without having a clue what the deal is i simply would not go furthermore most characters aren't real likable with the end result that you never actually care for them another flaw is that the director deviates from the basic premise which is scary enough and brings up new elements that never get explained and aren't even relevant to the doll master mystery overall this movie has been a big disappointment to me if you want to see a good horror movie involving dolls go see dead silence
