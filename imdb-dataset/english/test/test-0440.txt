<START> this failed exercise in satire or commentary on the human condition easily earned a place as one of the 10 worst movies i've ever seen i'm seriously considering buying a copy if i can find one dirt cheap to chase away unwanted company it's honestly that bad i view it as some kind of anti personnel weapon if you're the kind of person who just has to see a train wreck to witness the carnage then this movie is a gem just to be fair kelsey grammar's character has 1 line that almost works but doesn't quite other than that everything in this movie strives to be insightful but misses the mark by approximately the distance between earth and the nearest pair of colliding galaxies i usually can appreciate a book or movie where the protagonist suffers from some sort of existential angst but the angst presented here is so unbelievable and over the top and the movie doesn't even address the nonsense it presents in any valuable way if you are familiar with the term word vomit then you may get some picture of the oh and the narrative structure is ill conceived pretentious and amateurish it has failed on both style and substance if you really hate someone invite them over for a double feature of this movie and the terror of tiny town an all midget western from the 1930's and put them in restraints with their eyes forced open a clockwork orange style but that probably violates some provision in the geneva conventions
<START> no doubt that the indie flick eddie monroe is one of the better independent films i've seen in a long time the highlight for me was the performance of paul i first saw paul or big paulie as he was called in danny hit indie this thing of ours thankfully the eddie monroe filmmaker s did the same and utilized paul's undeniable skills in a principle principal role out came a performance on camera and voice over as well that shows worthy of big budget studio roles in the very near future it's refreshing to see a trained actor who is committed to the trade prove the same to the audience keep up the good work big paulie and we'll be seeing you in hollywood real soon not bad for a kid from huh
<START> this movie is all about entertainment imagine your friends that you love spending time with the ones that you know inside out becoming a bit silly and perhaps taking on a character or two that's what this film is about an inventive script and brilliantly performed it's not about pleasing the masses with this one it's about having fun with a bunch of brilliantly talented people which is what i'm sure they all thought when they signed up for it br br the above review sounds completely unfair and i think that the person who wrote that was in the wrong frame of mind when they watched the film in a lighthearted moment there is great dignity in it if you care to look br br a job well done i thought it was a great film i'd watch this before the north american norm any day br br in a nutshell it's not the best film you're ever going to see but it has a hell of a lot of moments i haven't laughed that long in an age
<START> about one step above an olsen's twins film there's a nary a surprise in store here except for how repulsive the bloated hunchbacked depardieu looks walking around the beach without a shirt on this guy was supposed to be some sort of heartthrob quasimodo hubba hubba well whatever br br katherine heigl's a great actress whose career over the last several years has displayed a lot of her potential as both a comedic and dramatic actress but this movie definitely didn't do anything to offer her a break out role her vapid character lacks any trace of personality or self esteem spending her entire vacation crushing on a cute boy that she thinks is the greatest guy in then world basically because he's a cute boy yet she can't be honest with him for two seconds ladies let me tell you something if a guy's really into you he's not going to stomp off in a huff because you tried to pass your dad off as your boyfriend he may be a little confused about why you'd do something so silly contrived and um incestuous but in the end it's just going to be something you'll laugh together about br br the plot and dialogue hits every right on cue no originality and no wit but it's sweet and ben's cute so viewers who think titanic is the greatest movie ever made will of course say this movie is great because they won't notice that it doesn't have a brain in its head one star
<START> i was forced to watch last year in year 10 australian history looking around the class room both classes all 40 students were nearly asleep all 40 heads on the table whispering to the person next to them i refuse to believe that because i am only 16 that my opinion doesn't count having studied world war two i not only felt embarrassed and ashamed watching this australian piece of trash television i was out of my mind at the appalling effort this mini series applied in the usage of film elements the acting was poor the screenplay was very inaccurate and the score was dreadful please do not watch this film it is bias and very racists to the
<START> masterpiece of art gore this cat is definitely a talent to look out for we have in this several longer vignettes with some shorter segues this is all in all a very powerful film that relies on its intense graphic imagery and symbolism and it is not for all viewers br br the film kicks off with a short called eyeball very short segment that has a nude woman placed on a table naked an unseen woman's hand covers the woman's face with a red cloth and makes an incision in her abdomen out of which an eyeball stalk is extracted i've got nothing too much to comment on this one due to its brevity br br human larvae is one of the films and it is a totally unflinching portrayal of a perverse act committed by a disturbed man who has an incestuous love for his pregnant sister this is one of those must be seen to be believed type things i will say that this film has some of the best effects i've seen in an indie horror film but the subject matter will make this an undeniably unpleasant experience for most not me though i live for this br br rebirth could have been cut out of this film all together this is the film's weakest segment and it has a bunch of nude people f cking bloody holes in a field and whatnot very short but this one kind of blows the film's momentum br br right brain martyrdom is one of the most profane representations of religious imagery that i have ever seen and it totally kicks ass think p christ or blood paintings of the virgin mary very hard sexual sexually violent gory imagery is presented in this piece and it is definitely not for anyone who will be offended by sacrilege br br subconscious cruelty is one of the best films i've seen under the banner of extreme horror it will be a very divisive film amongst horror fans and the filmgoing public in general some will call it trash some will call it brilliant i don't see much middle ground i thought this film was pretty damn original and i will recommend it to anyone who is adventurous enough to try it 9 10
<START> i caught this on ifc last week and i thought it was typical of the indie short subject film heavy on style little on substance and originality does it comes as any surprise that a coming out film stars an unusually attractive and blond to boot boy with 70s shag hair and too cool for school clothes plus this film wallows in late 1970s chic which works for some sofia coppola's the virgin suicides comes to mind but not for this director br br another reviewer compared this to harmony korine's work and i agree yet i don't view this as a positive thing what has he done lately anyway is really just a waste of time and energy for all involved if you happen to see it late night on cable turn the channel and watch something else instead
<START> renee zellweger is a kansas housewife whose domineering husband is mixed up in drug trafficking two professional hit men morgan freeman and his son chris rock murder the husband in his dining room zellweger unobserved by the killers witnesses this and undergoes a dissociative reaction assuming the personality of a nurse the eponymous betty who is a character in her favorite soap opera believing herself to be the tv character zellweger takes off in her husband's car which has a load of dope in the trunk and travels to la where she hopes to link up with another character in this mindless afternoon drama dr david greg kinnear not realizing she is being pursued by the two hit men she drives to la where she manages to link up with kinnear and is actually written into the show as a nurse named betty a handful of men in the know including the local sheriff catch on to what's happening and also seek zellweger in la the ending is believable and poignant br br if that sounds crazy it's because it is and it's the writer's responsibility john c richards the curious thing is that richards and the director neil labute with considerable help from the performers just about pull it all off this isn't a plot that has been cast in a familiar mold nope i give it bonus points for sheer originality somebody went out on a limb somebody took a chance on a movie that was not a copy or remake of something that had made money ten years or fifty years ago i imagine the people involved down on their knees every night praying fervently i don't know if the film was but it's mostly successful on its own aesthetic terms br br it's what might be called an initial premise movie you start off with a single transformative event in this case the murder of husband and her adoption of a genuinely new personality and follow the resultant logical paths realistically groundhog day is another better and more intricately plotted example nurse betty has its logical cracks where the incidents give up their plausibility eg at a party in la zellweger finally runs into kinnear the guy who plays her ex fiancÃ© on tv she's stunned because after all she thinks she's betty who lost her fiancÃ© long ago she approaches kinnear and a couple of his colleagues and introduces herself as nurse betty the character she addresses kinnear by the name of his tv character david the group are puzzled at first then convince themselves that she's an aspiring actress who insists on staying in character during the conversation and afterward too after kinnear has become fascinated by her and the others bored kinnear drives her home and even when she kisses him goodnight she's still in character leaving kinnear wide eyed with astonishment at the relentless way she captures the character of betty on the next date kinnear returns her love that development the relationship between zellweger and kinnear at this point is a crack in the logic the kind that's absent from groundhog day by the end of night one kinnear like any other person would realize that zellweger is a few clowns short of a circus br br the rest of the film which includes many digressions succeeds beyond expectations the relationship between morgan freeman and his insolent nihilistic son is marvelously spelled out morgan is flawless in his exasperation he manages to fall in love with the image of zellweger as he unearths clues to her whereabouts and activities and at the end he can't bring himself to shoot her she's too sweet to shoot after her transformation into betty she left a note behind in kansas i want to help all life whether it be animal plant or mineral who could harm the author of such a preposterous statement his admiration of her comes as an epiphany as he stands near one of the floodlights at the rim of the grand canyon zellweger dressed as dorothy or maybe the good witch of the east well characters that like zellweger are from kansas anyway appears to freeman and he embraces her and kisses her tenderly it's a scene that's at once eerie romantic and a little spooky i once stood at one of those lights and threw some shredded paper into the from the dark canyon and found myself surrounded by a thousand swirling bats who had misperceived the fluttering shreds as moths br br right where was i okay i was trying not to run out of space performance deserves plaudits everything she does every movement every utterance is naive and tentative she really is a likable character and that despite the fact that she's no glamor girl by hollywood standards but what an actress compare her performance as the bumptious 19th century hick in cold mountain just the opposite but then everyone is up to snuff in this enjoyable film allyson jannings does a fine job in a minor role watch her when she tells greg kinnear that she's considering killing off his character in the soap opera in a drowning accident kinnear is one of those who wears the kind of ten thousand dollar thin black leather jackets that were popular at the time he chuckles and says oh one of those castaway deals right okay how do i get back jannings doesn't answer she just smiles at him with those enormous blue eyes and tilts her head mockingly br br not a masterpiece of film making but a good original professional job by everyone concerned
<START> of the damned '' is one of the worst adaptations of a book to a movie that i already saw the only thing that i like in this movie is the soundtrack anything else besides that since i am a fan of marilyn manson chester of linkin park and wayne static of static x br br there are so many mistakes and so many bad choices that i don't even know how to start so many stories were cut like the twin's legend one of my favorite armand and daniel's relationship and even louis is not present to mention a few the plot was dead first they should have made a movie of ''the vampire because it is the second book after ''the interview with the and not of they tried to squeeze in a single movie so many informations that you finish not getting almost anything unless you read the vampire chronicles br br so many meaningful characters doesn't seem to have a real importance in this movie it is pandora's case for example br br the actors that they choose to play all the characters doesn't match with many of anne rice's descriptions specially marius that is suppose to be a beautiful tall imposing blond guy with blue eyes like lestat stuart is also far from being like lestat i didn't understand why they changed maker to be marius instead of magnus as well br br with the was an awesome movie i loved the actors and tom cruise as lestat was perfect and far superior then stuart townsend i am sad that tom cruise declined the chance of playing lestat again only antonio as armand didn't match with armand's looks but anyway far superior from this crap movie called '' the queen of br br anne rice was so picky about interview that i didn't get how she just sold the rights for this terrible production
<START> would somebody please explain why anybody would want to make a british neo noir crime film with a cast almost entirely american the accents spoken in this film are bloody awful but entirely in keeping with the performances which are so wooden one fears to strike a match for setting the cast on fire br br really what kind of disgusting moronic cynical crud is this even neo noir films have some character you either feel for or want to feel for even if they're wretched and doomed they at least have some decency to them some sense that what they've done is wrong or that a seemingly good plan has gone wrong and that somehow they're stuck with the responsibility for it br br not in this stew these characters are putrid betraying each other themselves and the audience br br also note that they are low lives all right nothing wrong with that except that they seem to be living a life of luxury for a film supposedly about desperate petty thieves the keynote here is ennui it's all so terribly dull and dross doncha know so let's just rip some people off or maybe murder them and go get laid in a luxury hotel what ambition br br this whole mess to some bottom of swampy muck are boringly uneven pacing predictable 'action' sequences that aren't banal and incoherent set design made for bad tv camera work and editing forgettable score and an entire lack of any imagination or innovation in production and direction br br wholly unbelievable unlikeable and for less dedicated movie watchers or masochists like myself utterly unwatchable br br there are other nasty things i would like to say about this nasty film but they wouldn't print them here suffice it to say you can probably find something more useful to do with your time than watch this film just about anything in fact
<START> can they possibly get any worse than this probably but after all steven seagal gets to do what he does well kind of this time instead of mortally wounding the bad guys he just wounds them by reputation of being a bad ass agent seagal is hired to deliver a special package from france to america but it is not an easy task with so many people trying to intercept and foul up the mission the fights just don't have enough bite and the big bangs are just big and that's all anna louis seems to be the only cast member not to appear wooden also in the cast are jeffery pierce max ryan and harry van don't put all the blame on seagal for this clunker
<START> way back at the dawn of human civilization cavemen sat around and made lame jokes hit each other over the heads with what ever they could grab and women were never seen and apparently at one time had tails these cavemen lived in a geographically diverse region with a a camel a monkey but no women this film tells of the hilarious misadventures of seven or so cavemen having burned their land with the new discovery of fire moving on by water to a new land where they find this woman with the extra appendage along the way we get such great moments of comedy like a fat cavemen swallowing a frog that keeps croaking in his stomach a monkey throwing rocks at their heads a man swallowing a mouse to get the frog in his stomach the obligatory gay caveman the list could go on and on this movie is the very definition of cinematic dreck i was bored from the onset and it only got worse as the cavemen around hitting each other making poor jokes such as puns on the word perch hitting each other and mauling poor berger who looks like she lost a bet to a producer to appear in this nonsense she is indeed one of two bright spots in this film she isn't much of an actress so you have to guess why she is an ass et the other bright spot is the music as soon as i heard the score i said to myself that it sounded very familiar i had never heard the actual score but the music was unmistakably that of ennio morricone it's a nice score and the best thing in an otherwise crude boring lewd unimaginative and ridiculous film essentially about a group of finding a woman for the first time and first wanting to eat her like some animal being taught what she could do sorry i'm stifling a yawn as i relive the plot the end of the film has some 100 or so mostly naked women on screen with all the erotic feel of pulling a off your knee this movie was painful to sit through and offers nothing of any real merit whatsoever the fact that it spawned a sequel doesn't surprise me as it offers that one thing which will prick viewer interest tail
<START> mel brooks is a great writer director and actor but once in a while even he can have a the beginning of this starts out almost basically just meeting one character after another you have cary elwes who's charming and talented but he can't do comedy his expressions into the camera show that even he can't believe the inanities in the script richard lewis looks bored and distracted throughout without much to do and amy yasbeck is stuck in high school acting mode dave chapelle shows great comedy range mugging and hamming for the camera and mark blankfield is mostly stifled in the role of the blind man but then he does still manage to show great comedy range eric allen kramer doesn't have much to do but the few scenes he does have are binding the best roles are those of roger rees tracy ullman megan cavanaugh and brooks for when he does appear dom deluise has a funny turn as a mafia don employing a clint eastwood lookalike but on the minus side some of the jokes aren't very funny while some of the really funny ones seem stolen from mel's other movies
<START> i'm not sure why i picked for a borrow from mom for nurse betty i think just because i had heard a little bit of this movie but i'm glad i did nurse betty is an original and clever movie that has humor and a darker side br br this was one of renee's first big one's before hitting it major in hollywood i can see why she is an incredible actress the scene where she finally realizes what had happened and she's on the set of her favorite soap opera you can see pain confusion fear and embarrassment on her face just to let you in on the movie she plays betty a shy and insecure woman who stands by her abusive husband she's a waitress and is in love with soap operas especially one where a certain cute doctor dr dave when she happens to see her husband's murder accidentally in separate room the murders she notices are two customers she just had morgan freeman and chris rock she then just looses her mind and leaves town after talking to he police and says she needs to find her former fiancÃ©e dr dave so she travels along the country to california to find dr and wants a job as a nurse to work with dave she's seen the show so many times somehow she's just awesome at being a nurse when she saves a woman's brother despite everyone telling her that she is delusional she just looks at them like as if they were the crazy one's when she meets the actor who plays dave george his real name thinks she's just a crazy fan trying to get on the show she just looks at him with confusion and believes that he and her belong together br br renee was terrific she was so believable on loosing her mind in the movie she has come such a long way and wither you want to admit it or not she's adorable and a great actress br br morgan freeman plays one of the assassin's charlie who is the father of the two he is so charmed and smittened by betty and while chasing her around the country he becomes almost just infatuated with betty to the point where he almost falls in love with her he and his son wesley must find betty when they find out she was there at the murder scene and could give away their identities when charlie sees betty and catches her finally she's scarred at first but calms down and they know they have a real connection it was a beautifully played scene my opinion is that morgan gave a stronger performance he's just great br br a surprisingly decent performance by chris rock the son wesley he is so gun ho about just getting the job done in a rush and taking care of business i loved his comedic performance at the end where he and the gang he's holding hostage by gun point are just watching the soap together classic nurse betty is a great movie that i'd recommend for a good laugh and just in all a nice honest little movie i think anyone could enjoy br br 9 10
<START> i do not understand at all why this movie received such good grades from critics i've seen tens of documentaries on tv about the wine world which were much much better when if you watch it please think of two very annoying aspects of first the filming is just awful and terrible and upsetting to me it looked like the guy behind the camera just received the material and was playing with it plenty of zooms for no purpose other than pushing the button in out for instance i almost stopped to watch it because of that secondly the interviewer the director i think is not really relevant he looks like and ask questions like a boy scout not like a journalist even if the general idea and themes would have been interesting too bad conclusion overrated documentary maybe only for guys who do not know nothing about wine not recommended at all 2 10
