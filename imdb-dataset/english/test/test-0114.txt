<START> what about dj cash money this film fails in part by not covering the mid to late 80s there was only a small mention of dj cheese in 86 br br also it's not
<START> martin ritt seems to be a director who was always interested in social issues as the son of immigrants he had every incentive to be so especially since he was blacklisted in the '50s is based on pat conroy's novel the water is wide about his own experience in 1969 teaching a school of impoverished black children about the outside world much to the chagrin of the right wing superintendent hume cronyn what added to the movie's strength was the cultural and historical context conroy jon voight tells another teacher how many of the children don't know about paul newman sidney poitier the vietnam war or even where vietnam is he proceeds to enlighten them about all these factors br br somewhere i read a complaint that when conroy played music for the children he only played white music the truth is you can't blame the movie for that it was based on conroy's real experience either way the movie's a real gem
<START> paranormal state is an interesting show for most paranormal believers i enjoy watching what the team has to say and what they find however i know that the entire show along with it's build ups and story lines are completely set up they go to real haunted locations and i suspect that they speak with actual witnesses i commonly feel as i watch it that i am not watching non fiction but an actual movie that is contradictory to reality i personally would not advise or recommend anyone to watch this show unless you are a basic scare seeker br br interesting show stick to ghost hunters
<START> most people will consider that yul greatest performance was as the ruler of siam in the king and i certainly it gave him a wide variety of moods to test his abilities in from comic to tragic from eager to learn to dominating to hateful it also showed him to advantage as a talk singer and a dancer finally as it was also his tony award winning performance from broadway the film allowed us to capture something of the great broadway performance as well br br but he did other movies that showed his talents as well as the king and i his comic turn in once more with feeling was quite nice so was his performance as general in anastasia or his in the ten commandments yet he came terribly close to being a 1950s successor to eric von stroheim as the man you love to hate a certain vulnerability in his acting and roles endeared him to the movie public even after his best years as a star were behind him and he retreated more and more to repeating the king of siam on television and the stage br br to me his finest performance is in this 1959 drama with deborah kerr jason robards jr robert morley e g marshall anne jackson and ronnie howard the film is set in pretty modern times the powder keg that was hungary in 1956 when briefly it looked like the iron curtain was about to collapse there under the reforms of hungarian patriot and his supporters but the hungarian revolution collapsed due to bad timing the russians and their polish and east german allies sent tanks in to crush the revolt and arrested and executed and other reformers the west stood by and let this happen england and france had gotten caught in the crisis and the u s had berated them and israel for attacking egypt due to the actions of three close allies of the u s the west found it hard to condemn the overkill of the soviet union it was an unfortunate situation and the hungarians have never forgotten how they were abandoned in it br br in the film brynner is major a russian intelligence officer who is watching for some of the leaders of the hungarian revolt one of whom is paul jason robards may be getting assistance from some westerners on a bus tour through hungary led by robert morley including marshall jackson and howard and kerr the latter are being kept in a hotel while their bus is being repaired and brynner mingles with them hoping for a lead to the whereabouts of robards but brynner is human he tries to be ingratiating with these people all of whom see him as a monster and in sequence when he has drunk a little too much he confronts them with the questions that has bothered historians since 1945 how is it even if one notes that russia had stalin in charge that relations between russia and the west collapsed so quickly the allies on the whole had worked well together from 1941 to 1945 but after and all types of mutual suspicions just erupted did they have to is a good officer but he is torn in half by loyalty to the communist regimes in the soviet union and in hungary that he supports and his growing fondness towards kerr who is hiding robards but is also willing to note the more human side of the russian major and as the film reaches it's tragic climax we watch as has to decide if he will follow his sense of duty or take pity on kerr robards and the other westerners who want to leave it becomes a true struggle for him and one that he may win far too late it was a great film about a tragedy of post war europe and possibly the most thoughtful role yul brynner ever portrayed
<START> gone is the wonderful campiness of the original in place is a c grade action no brainer wich is not all bad but pales in comparison to the original all the meaningless sex and violence is gone and replaced with crappy jokes and unexplained plot pointers see it but don't expect the thrills of the first
<START> during the summer the cue line for this attraction is really long since it is a water ride it's very well themed but a lot of the artifacts seem to be out of order overall the ride is not worth it if you have to wait for almost 2 hrs in line the drop at the end is exciting but the whole ride itself could have been better creators for indiana jones could have prob helped these hollywood designers also many times the ride breaks down and causes even longer waiting periods for others it's also very when they only have one raft departing dock open and not the two like they are supposed to during halloween horror nights you ride in the dark and it's exciting if it's your first time but if it's not then don't bother waiting in a four hour line
<START> my top 2 actors happen to be in this film robert ryan and robert mitchum br br ryan could play anything from shakespeare to arthur miller and play it magnificently in this film when he starts his speech people with names like and others with names that are hard to say it is chilling to watch him br br robert young plays the policeman who is called to investigate the murder of sam levine a civilian who is chatting with several soldiers in a bar mitchell is the soldier wanted in connection with it his wallet has been found in the apartment but mitchell is a gentle soldier who is only missing his wife br br the story is told from different perspectives mitchell and strike up a friendship and go back to apartment seems to know the loneliness that mitchell is feeling for years you have been concentrating on one peanut and now it is gone you don't know what to feel he says about the war br br ryan is superb as monty the psychotic racist br br robert young along with dick powell was an actor whose career was re by film noir crossfire they won't believe me and the other woman are great examples br br robert mitchum is his usual laid back self as the br br gloria graham and paul kelly as the odd couple are outstanding as well in their brief but telling roles br br this is probably the best film about racism ever made
<START> i honestly have to say that a cat in the brain is one of the most fun and unintentionally hilarious films i've ever seen this film is packed with stupid dialog ridiculous scenes and a self involving plot starring legendary horror director lucio fulci himself br br the threadbare story line is about an aging director fulci who is also named lucio fulci in the film who is starting to go nuts and because of all the vicious things he's put down in film over the past many years he goes to a shrink who hypnotizes fulci and tells him that he will believe himself to be a killer but that the shrink will actually be the one doing the killing the rest of the film is made up of shots from the film that fulci is directing during all this action scenes of the shrink killing people all the while grinning like a f cking moron and some of fulci's hallucination sequences oh and a few tits thrown in for good measure as well br br a cat in the brain is completely over top and ridiculous in every sense the gore is classic fulci nasty and strong with some really decent scenes the chainsaw of a female corpse is pretty cool as is the chainsaw beheading of a small boy lots of stabbings and other cool kill scenes make this one a pretty non stop bloodbath the ridiculous dialog lick it lick it as well as some of the insanely goofy scenes the nazi orgy the opera singing slap fest and the running down of an innocent hippy come easily to mind make this one fun as hell not nearly as dark as some of fulci's other films cat is more of a self indulgent horror comedy that if it wasn't meant to be funny is actually kind of sad i say to grab a fifth of cheap bourbon and settle in to this one i watched cat with a few friends and we laughed the entire time this is the feel good movie of the summer recommended 8 10
<START> is a moving and rewarding documentary in the world of wine there is a huge different between the big and the small one it's not just about size of of your vineyard but also the amount of money and power you have if you have enough money to place ads in the wine spectator and hire a so called wine except then it doesn't matter the size of your estate also in business world of today wine often has to mass marketed and suited to people's taste what is means many times wine filtered of it's origin shows the commercial side of wine in that of mega producer robert and michael the wine expert who shapes wine to the taste of today's critics like robert parker who is also in the film now these men are not evil or wrong for they have done a great deal of good for wine but they have power on a grand scale as we all know power corrupts also shows small wine makers such as aime of the and hubert de of volnay in burgundy these wine makers are not starving wine makers but they know like all great wine makers that it's about where the grapes are from the best example of this is explained not by a wine maker but by a haitian man working for neal the wine the area the grapes are grown the that matters that a guiding hand that knows this makes important real wine
<START> i think downey was perhaps inspired by french new wave br br who wasn't br br unfortunately what he ended up creating here was more along the lines of crackhead new wave br br a synapse is obviously a terrible thing to lose and downey appears to have lost plenty br br just say no indeed in more ways than one including to watching this film br br i couldn't bear it after a while and began fast forwarding through it it would have been wiser to have just skipped it altogether
<START> all my friends and various other coworkers think this show is soooo great first i hate this show i think i might be the only female alive i only watched it because my best friend adores it and fancies herself to be the charlotte character br br first the whole plot if you can call it that is about four women samantha kim cattrall who most likely has every std available and brown and green genitals considering she is tri sexual she'll try anything br br samantha is not like most 40 something women even in ny but than the show would not have some kind of entertainment since samantha along with some good ny scenery is the only reason to watch and those are not reason enough br br charlotte kristen davis is a well dressed upper class ny idiot who still believes the charming myth however sweet and pretty she is do not let that fool you she spreads quite often br br miranda cynthia nixon now this woman is stereotypical angry butch feminist i think in one episode she is thought to be a lesbian but apparently is not what a shame she's almost interesting br br carrie sarah jessica parker the most annoying character i swear i thought i was watching twisted sister front man dee more manly looking cross dressing sissy boy brother this is a girl looking for can't live without you love heard of a puppy br br this show is stupid and i love making fun of it because i hear about how it is some kind of new awakening for women that is just sad if your looking to watch slutty pathetic addictive people in way too expensive clothes drinking cosmopolitans and sounding like an annoying 15 yr old on cocaine than there is a show for you just use protection
<START> this was a real let down for me the original bride with white hair is a great kung fu fantasy film but this one was pretty weak i didn't care at all for the new characters who unfortunately dominated the screen time and the story wasn't well developed while the first film was tragic and involving this one was tedious as i merely counted the time to the end when the ill fated lovers would actually meet the action was poor in this one as well the fights were not choreographed very well and there really wasn't much kung fu at all just a few weak sword fights between the highly dis likable lui and one of lin's lin herself mainly uses a sort of telekinesis to throw people into walls and sometimes her hair a far cry from the impressive showing with the whip and kung fu she displayed in the previous film i still gave this movie a 4 because at least it was fast pace and i did want to see what was going to happen at the end though i as most anyone who watched the first one predicted it would go down the way it did and after seeing it i found it anti climactic and wished they had either made a proper sequel or just left the story alone i really recommend the first one but as for the sequel only fans of the genre and those who really want to see lin as the bride one more time need apply
<START> i went into the movie expecting a little action mixed with a strong story line i understand that changes between written works and movies must be made for many reasons br br the changing of the relationship between the scientists they were father daughter in the book the director of was eliminated thus causing the scene between the and the director to be changed to the and the head of the swiss guard in the office br br ron howard made sure to get his dad inserted as a cardinal with a hayseed accent but missed all the symbolism both and the ascended to the heavens in the helicopter with hanks character landing in the river and the priest landing upon the chapel in what was described as a christ like image br br at some point this film needs to be remade by a director who is up to the job
<START> i'm afraid i only stayed to watch the first hour of this movie as it really seemed to me to be mindless tv trash and a waste of talent liv tyler plays a sumptuous beauty but her acting skills are not yet sufficiently developed to give the part any real kick as she slowly seduces a bartender into a life of crime it is difficult to feel any real concern over any of the characters even john goodman delivers his weakly comic lines with an absence of panache as if the witless humour needs to be recited slowly in case anyone misses the joke the ending is supposed to be good but the starter and main course left me with no appetite to find out
<START> i don't really know why but i watched this with quite a sense of anticipation unfortunatly it was misplaced firstly this is not horror it doesn't scare and unless it was even worse than i gave it credit for which is possible doesn't try to it's a trashy comedy and the fact i smiled once means i gave it a 2 not a 1 this film of gremlins in a truly special way i can't claim to have ever seen a film which devotes its self more very very bad avoid
