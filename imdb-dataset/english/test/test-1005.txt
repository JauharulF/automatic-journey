<START> seeing gary busey in a g rated film was a first and a nice one at that i don't know much about the director but he obviously knows how to spend a few dollars and get the most out of them where did jillian clare come from my kids love her the only thing i remember christopher atkins doing was blue lagoon disney needs to see this film and put him to work the wife thinks he is very cute i liked what he did with his character he seemed so real what we liked most was the message this film sends out greed sucks and faith love and family wins this is the first low budget dvd we've bought that had so much stuff on it the producers made this one for kids and the kids loved it they liked the music and all the extras on the dvd the director probably won't stick to family movies but i hope he does cause he really knows how to get the most out of kids animals and stars like gary busey the dog was great and seeing gary busey act like a dog was even funnier there wasn't much we didn't like about this one it hard to find a family film without all the crude humor and quigley was a delightful surprise
<START> this movie was one of a handful that actually caused me pain it might be enjoyed by anybody who thinks that it would be funny to see his her mother in a crowded discotheque full of people half her age inventing some totally ridiculous dance in a completely misguided effort to be hip in the parlance of that age to see ingrid bergman stoop to such a pitiful performance on the disco dance floor was hard to watch i was embarrassed br br to make matters worse the music in the disco was not realistic at all it is the bogus idea of some hollywood director about what pop music was like at the time that is always a total embarrassment in most films of that era the ersatz music is canned and bears only a painful passing resemblance to the music that was actually popular in the 60's br br mathau is hopelessly miscast as some kind of ladies' man he just looks grotesque hawn's wide eyed innocence is just too silly the handsome neighbor in her apartment is portrayed way too earnestly and seriously he seems like a brady kid who got lost in this farce painful pitiful mess
<START> jeff morrow is leslie gaskell barbara laurence is vera hunter and john emory is eliot along with some ancillary air force personnel and a comic geek they are in charge of a super secret underground laboratory on the west coast morrow is thrilled when he discovers a meteor passing through the atmosphere but nonplussed when the meteor decides to take a dip in the pacific ocean and emerge as a fantastic machine on the mexican coast br br nobody knows what this colossal blocky structure is obviously it's some kind of artifact because it's all made up of right angles with a kind of bald sphere half visible on top br br it turns out that the machine dubbed kronos is from some far away planet and has been sent here to rob the earth of energy you see here on earth we have learned how to convert matter into energy but on planet they have figured out the other half of the equation how to convert energy into matter and now they're running out of energy on the other planet are you taking notes on this good br br maybe you'll be able to fill me in on some of the scientific questions raised by mission for instance if builders can convert energy into matter and vice versa why don't they just convert a little of their own spare matter into energy instead of sending elaborate machines to earth to la's lights but it's doubtful the writers could explain it either reversing the of two antenna is described as an conversion which means a towards human change which doesn't make sense but it doesn't seem that any of the science makes sense for that matter the diagram that morrow draws on the board has the current going in the wrong direction from positive to negative br br there's a problem with too it marches along the coast threatening populated areas read southern california but it has no joints in its two or three legs these stumps just thump slowly up and down squashing some people the film doesn't make much of these squashed people they're shown as mexican peasants so maybe they don't count for too much the usaf also drops a hydrogen bomb on kronos while it's in mexico mind you nobody raises an eyebrow br br not much acting is called for and not much is given jeff morrow has a distinct and resonant voice great for radio or for tv voice overs his face is less expressive he has only one expression no matter what the situation is a tight smile as if he's having his picture taken at the universal studios tour barbara laurence had a fine golden quality when she made street with no name a few years earlier she was a slender seventeen year old as richard widmark's wife here her grooming and demeanor reduce her to the level of b movie actress though she's still beautiful it's always good to see morris in one of these movies he's made so many i get them mixed up br br on the whole the film comes across as flat i'm afraid there are some nice shots of a b 47 in flight though the sets reveal a low budget enterprise that's not necessarily bad in itself but there's nothing to make up for the barren settings little tension in the script no directorial display and little effort put into the performances br br you might get a kick out of it a relaxed high because this is distinctly unchallenging it's just that there are so many better films of the genre out there
<START> the love letter is a somewhat pleasant very very low key romantic comedy in which the use of just the right few words in a mysterious love letter unlocks the secret passions and longings of a sleepy sea side town's inhabitants br br it's not for all audiences the love letter i feel benefits from it's simple and quiet tone never intentionally wacky and phony like most romantic comedies it's quaint picturesque and comfy however for these exact same reasons many viewers will be bored and disinterested br br the cast is nice it's great to see tom selleck again and is such an underplayed role and it's hard to believe this is the same kate capshaw we met 15 years ago in indiana jones and the temple of doom she's quite naturally good here improving in every role i've seen her in since grating on nerves and is it possible capshaw is just getting lovelier and lovelier with age what is it about that spielberg br br it doesn't amount to much but after another noisy summer movie season i'll probably look back with brief fondness for this light as a feather romance
<START> okay let's cut to the chase there's no way i can give this anything other then 1 out of 10 and yet you have to see it the acting is bad but is nothing like as bad as the script which itself pales before the production values cardboard axes yup we've got then car floor mats painted silver and used as armour here it is br br the film itself pretends to be artistic but is just cheap the same shots are used repeatedly especially in the drawn out fight scenes there is thankfully very little dialogue and there is much 'artistic' music to ram home the horror br br and yet all this awfulness is compelling you have to watch it through just so that you can say you've seen it i've not even got onto the barren sets the 'plot' or the risible special effects this really is the 'how not to do it' school of filmmaking this must be viewed spread the word and let the world all join together in puzzling over what on earth is happening at the end br br the best thing though is that they made a sequel
<START> iÂ´ve seen this piece of perfection during the fantasy filmfest in berlin and when i went out of the cinema i felt like being drugged down iÂ´ve seen a lot of films but there are just a few that iÂ´d call perfect like koyaanisqatsi or fight club subconscious cruelty is definitely one of them half of the people went out of the screening in berlin and i can understand them absolutely this is not a movie for normal people with dreams and illusions a person that is living in his her dreams day by day not wanting to see all the horror in our life and on our planet will be very shocked by this film if someone reads this now who has seen s c and also thinks itÂ´s great just contact me so far i havenÂ´t met anyone who shares my opinion itÂ´d be cool this film earns 10 points out of 10 finally iÂ´m really sorry for my bad english iÂ´m not a studied person und das ist gut so g
<START> i wasn't so impressed with this film finding it quite tiresome and plain the plot line was interesting a kid creating his own college and hundreds of kids but the laughs were few and far between the jokes weren't really funny and i didn't bust a gut at any of the scenes the characters weren't intriguing and i didn't feel for any of them even the fat kid with glasses who tried to enter the frat group it was a good first watch but it didn't blow me away and its not one that i would recommend comparing it to other films in the same genre ie american pie is just cruel because there is a film which was laugh a plenty this accepted failed to raise a smile
<START> i'm afraid i did not like this adaptation when i started watching it i had a strange feeling of watching some 70s tv series due to the filter and the musical score i did not like the end scene mr appears dressed only in his jane austen would never have a gentleman ride out without a frock coat looks like the producers made a modern misinterpretation of a romantic girl's dream i appreciate the more modern ja adaptations much more that show an eye for these details that makes the bbc series so worthwhile sorry looking forward to the 2007 adaptation i hope that will be better and will show the benefits of 20 years of jane austen adaptations
<START> i don't know why they even kept the name how they could call the series 'the scarlet after they deviated from the novels so much i wouldn't have a clue the character names are the only things they kept and even then they changed a few of those and mixed them up and changed percy's relationships with them admittedly i only watched about two hours at the most of it but that was enough for me to realize that the series was nothing like baroness had portrayed her characters and probably would have been rolling around in her grave when it was filming and airing poor lady i hope that when the next person wants to make a movie series of the book they don't ruin it as completely as this series did
<START> when this film gets it right it really gets it right and when it goes wrong i'd say that a full 3 of the film is great i can even isolate the bad bit it's everything that has to do with the romance everything that you need to know about it is said in the first five minutes but it drags on for about 30 i'd recommend skipping that section if you can it does nothing except explain his exile it should have been a minor plot point quickly thrust aside fortunately the period from about 0 30 and 1 00 2 19 the end is excellent br br there are a number of excellent performances in this film and an equal number of terrible ones just like everything else in this movie the acting is either perfect or terrible peter ustinov as the slimy one eyed slave is perfect it is one of his best performances up there with his role in spartacus victor mature as the ambitious is also perfect again one of his best roles jean simmons is wasted as merit the perfect girl in love with our hero john carradine gives a nice supporting role as a philosophical grave robber and michael wilding is excellent as the idealistic pharaoh who tries to bring peace and monotheism to egypt only to see it fall apart due to his unwillingness to fight now for the bad edmund purdom as is sadly miscast this is doubly unfortunate as he is the main character the entire film revolves around him he actually does rather good as the disillusioned exile and the wise old man this is because of his sorely limited range he doesn't seem able to put any passion into his words this is especially apparent during the love scenes which are beyond awkward he spends the last half of the film as an old man a performance at which he is decent enough at he does have the perfect voice for the character the less said about bella as the treacherous babylonian woman the better br br the costuming and sets are magnificent this is the only film that i know of that attempts to depict life in egypt that isn't overshadowed by jews or romans the film takes place in the 14th century b c which is before even exodus the only are the pharaoh and his followers there is the same strong element of religious zeal that can be found in most epics but it is done differently and it only shows up at the very end an interesting note by having followed by as pharaoh the film completely skips over the most famous pharaoh of all seems kind of a strange thing to do when using that name could increase awareness of the film br br be warned this is a 1950s epic film if you don't like that type of thing then don't expect this one to be different it is different but it is still an epic i appreciate this film and i appreciate what it did and what it tried to do this is a film that should be better remembered than it is

<START> i saw this film at our crossroads film festival and was looking forward to it because it was filmed in mississippi and starred karen black i was severely disappointed by the clumsy script which never flowed and the apparent lack on the effort of the actors and director to understand anything about the culture they to portray how did lee and griffin become such deep friends in five minutes which of the two were f ing the girl under the tree it was unclear and there seems to be some law in hollywood about southern accents and rarely do you hear anything remotely approaching the everyday sounds of the south despite the awful this must be how they sound just soften the r approach to dialogue so many times the actors lapse out of it altogether especially sounded like a new york street tough during emotional scenes and nobody sounded at all walt character was supposed to have been from morgan city louisiana yet sounded nothing like that city's blend of new orleans and cajun accents the other bothersome point seemed to be an urge by the writer to make us all feel that every man must have homosexual urges inside him before i start a firestorm here and am accused of homophobia i've enjoyed many films with gay love themes notably punks when love comes and b monkey but this seemed to be some man's wish about all young men well tennessee williams has already covered this ground and did a far better job of it so i wonder if the coen brothers can get regional accents and culture dead on in films set in minnesota and in mississippi why can't anyone else what a waste of my time
<START> i watched this film with my family over a long thanksgiving holiday weekend i am thankful that someone insisted that we watch it though i didn't pay much attention until the end of the film when a head seems promised but alas doesn't happen br br on the other hand i watched this movie some years later and loved its liveliness absurdity sparkle and just plain fun i think that the film has a female tone women are not exploited in it even though i am sure that someone might think that the movie is pure exploitation i think the movie plays with tropes of the period br br i keep thinking someone ought to remake it and flesh out some of the implications in the original
<START> it's about time for a female boxing flick but this one ain't it though the acting isn't too bad the predictable storyline and silly dialogue pretty much ruin this one from the get go to top it off the boxing scenes display zero tension come on how hard is it to make a boxing match seem exciting
<START> one of the worst movies ever made if you can get through this movies without falling asleep then you are doing pretty good considering no matter how hard you turn up the volume you cant hear what the 'actors' are saying and if you can acually see whats going on from the terrible film i mean hell if you cant find anything that works better use a home movie camara at least you can acually tell whats going on br br it is beyond my imagination how people get a movie like this to slip through the cracks and escape on video and further more how do people making this not know how terrible it is good god br br after what i have just told you if you are waiting for me to give you a summary of this piece of trash movie there is nothing to tell a group of campers on motorcycles get lost in the woods and a bunch of people terrorize them or somthing to that whats more so an action movie than a horror this 'movie' is of no interest if someone acually likes this i feel for you br br absolute trash not even one of those cheap funny flicks to watch go rent 'plan 9 from and have a ball
