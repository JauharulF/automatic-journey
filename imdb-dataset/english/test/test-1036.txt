<START> it's the old old story kids have a party in an old house demons are unleashed death and gratuitous nudity ensues you all know it it's still a lot of fun br br many people okay many horror fans to be specific have fond memories of this movie and it's always with slight trepidation that you revisit an old movie to see if it's still as good as you used to think it was luckily this is br br it has something for everyone well everyone who happens to be male i suppose from a fun title sequence to a shoplifting scam involving cunning use of linnea quigley's ass to the mirror scene to the full on demonic fun this is a blast from start to finish br br the girls are cute the guys are male the death scenes are well done with some good gore effects and unlike some horrors from the era this actually keeps a good sense of atmosphere and even tension throughout don't get me wrong it's still fun first and foremost but it offers some nice freaky moments that should please most genre fans
<START> it's worth boning up on the hindu pantheon before watching this film three main female deities wise sita nurturing and kali the transformer as well as three main male deities grave rama playful krishna and shiva the are all alluded to knowing the folklore as surely every indian member of an audience does lends a richness to the telling of the present day story in fact one is enacted first on stage as part of a lesson in spirituality and then in the movie's real life fire speaks out against the misogyny and homophobia in the society to which its producers are native and it does so with a beauty that weaves the message into multiple levels of the viewer's awareness making it a deeply satisfying presentation this is the finest film i've seen in the past ten years very highly recommended
<START> sometimes when i hear an a list cast will be bunched up together for 2 hours in a movie i hope and pray that it is good not for the sake of my 10 bucks or 2 hours but for the sake of these actors' careers in the case of be cool everything went to waste br br in the beginning of the film john travolta aka chili palmer and a music executive played by james woods are driving in a car talking about movie sequels and how most aren't good if you look passed the fact that this scene was shot the same way quentin tarrantino filmed his car scene in pulp fiction and listen to the dialogue you can't help but ponder whether this is 1 a disclaimer to the audience that this movie is going to suck or 2 an attempt to get the audience laughing at the sheer humor of 2 people talking about sequels in a sequel oh the irony in case you were wondering choice 1 is correct the cool and slick chili palmer from the first and good film get shorty is revived to play a mobster gone music business pro he steals a young hot singer christina from her ghetto pimped out jewish manager vince vaughn and turns her into a singing sensation of course a movie about an ex mobster can never be complete without new mobsters causing havoc this time around the mobsters of choice are russian played by american actors who cannot act russian if my entire family hit them upside the head with their russian bare hands br br as a russian i wasn't so much offended by the way this film portrayed russians but instead as a writer i was more offended by the horrible dialogue this film tried too hard to get the audience to laugh it turned potentially good lines into a redundancy the russian black and gay jokes were the same ones only a couple of hundred times after calling the rock's character a f he plays a gay bodyguard to vince vaughn and cedric the character a n he played a black rapper with an entourage who threaten those who don't play his tracks with guns i wanted to walk out of the movie theater because it was painful to sit through if this was get shorty none of this would've even needed to be in the film to build up drama or a really bad laugh br br what lacked in this film that didn't in get shorty was hot attitude he's a completely different person in this sequel for one thing the old chili would've had more dialogue john travolta doesn't have more than 20 speaking lines in be cool because he is out staged by the repetitive lines and the hundred and two cameo appearances by the most random celebrities i won't ruin the shock by revealing all of the cameos for those who actually plan to see this movie please don't but i will say that it will forever amaze me that these people agreed to be in a film of such inanity br br what was even more stupid was the very lame dance sequence with travolta and uma thurman she plays the widower of james woods who luckily gets killed in the first 10 minutes of the movie tarrantino never made pulp fiction for an idiot like the director of be cool to mess around with this dance number was boring long and just plain throbbing the black eyed peas playing in the club with a total of 10 people didn't make the scene any memorable br br there were so many plot holes that i left the theater asking myself why everything about this film was a big question mark i just didn't understand the point to anything i couldn't even explain to you why the russians were after everyone or why this film was ever made because i'm baffled all i took out of this movie was that everyone in l a has a sidekick and the only way this movie was probably funded was through all of the advertisements by diet coke yahoo honda insight hybrid t mobile even the herself is in the movie and the bad screenwriters guild plot holes stupid dialogue too many random cameos horrible acting even by the pros and a not so entertaining attempt to mimic pulp fiction makes this film the worst movie of 2005 and it's only the third month of the year
<START> another must have film henry brandon is a favorite i was so surprised when i learned years ago that he was from germany because he sounds looks so typically american and wasn't he great in the searchers as chief scar another of my favorites i have it watch it over again now if i could add this one to my collection it would make my day this is a great wildlife story film for all ages the scenery is so absolutely beautiful the plight of the endangered snow leopards is told with such great emotion it will spark the interest in endangered species in anyone especially children if i could i would give a copy to all of my great
<START> hannibal must be the most god awful movie i have seen in a long time in fact i want my money back what a waste of time no plot minimal character development questionable motives poor dialogue sub standard acting what else can i say if you haven't seen it don't bother i wouldn't even hire out the video and if you happen to come by it on tv change the channel the only reason anyone might have to see this movie would be to see whether the gratuitous violence lived up to all the hype which quite frankly is why they added it if you want to see some eating his own brain then fast forward to that bit br br what was the purpose of this movie its like someone just asked 'i wonder what hannibal is up to these days' and we just went along for the ride he is free in the beginning and he's free at the end in between is a lot of self indulgence on the part of anthony hopkins and the film makers julianne moore tries valiantly to inject some life into her clarice but they gave her a sub standard script and as far as i'm concerned she was set up to fail br br in my opinion this is just a very very bad story in every sense of the word the only reason it made so much money was because of the senseless violence they added which at the end of the day leaves you more with a feeling of contempt than the horror you are supposed to feel br br i give it a big fat raspberry
<START> big fat liar is the best movie ever it is funny and cool jason shepherd frankie proves that he was not lying and goes to los angeles to get his paper back from marty wolf paul giamatti along with friend amanda bynes mess up his life since marty won't call dad and say he wrote the paper yet it all turns out good and is a good movie to watch
<START> critters 4 this movie was continued after the 3rd critters movies this one was released in the same years as critters 3 was released in 1991 critters 4 takes you in space as they hunt for the humans in a space ship i doubt if there will be a critters 5 because the ending for the 4th was quite a good ending which brought the end to the critters as there was no more left i give this movie 10 out of 10
<START> spoof films have come so far since mel brooks in 'the producers' 1968 said don't be stupid be a smartie come and join the nazi party it brought us delightful films such as 'young frankenstein' ' and even 'naked gun' but the good die young luckily the genre managed to make it all the way up to the end of the 90's and then the wayan's brothers unleashed the apocalypse 'scary movie' suddenly the word spoof was an innuendo for crude sex jokes most movies claiming to be spoofs since then have followed suit including 'scary movie 2' 'date movie' and the film to kill the genre movie' sure there have been some reliefs there was 'shaun of the dead' and 'hot will has become a vehicle spoofing close to every sport imaginable also the wayans brothers quit the 'scary movies' and they have been made by the dependable zucker brothers while these films have held some value in the rescue the genre is tragically doomed to be films only loved by prepubescent males who just discovered what an erection is people who haven't explored the term and cut and paste movies together for a quick laugh no heart no brain just cheap glue sadly 'the has been added to the list dave koechner who starred in alongside ferrell leads a teams of underdogs to win against a coach carl of 'happy fame who got him back into coaching koechner has shown promise as a supporting actor but as a lead in this film he just sounds scripted he sounds too much like he's doing a cold read passionately also the jokes about being a washed up coach who through the course of the movie encourages the team to fail in school and later runs from the police in his underwear have been done before yes this is a spoof film but let us remember that even spoofs can have quality give the characters dignity and a sort of sophisticated view on modern society also the reliance on stereotypes is not going to get us any more laughs who knew one movie with jive talking people could lead to gangster stereotypes not really but you see while i will admit to laugh at least a few times it wasn't on par the football team within itself had a lot of stereotypes including a mexican a cocky jock a fat guy the scrawny nerd and the mentally handicapped aid even the only female on the team got reduced to stereotypical female humor being mostly scantily clad and giving off innuendos in fact her character as well as most of the others never developed it's a sad state of affairs for this movie if only it wasn't so reliant on stupid sex jokes it could've made something for itself in fact this movie will probably be the butt of jokes alongside movie' for time to come koechner really deserved better the script in general was poorly conceived even naming the championship 'the toilet so yes spoof movies are dying there is a movie called 'meet the spartans' be ahead of the trend boycott now coming out that includes a spoof on britney spears' breakdown so let those kids keep getting erections but people grow up and lose them we need one day they will learn to stop spoofing spoofs and restore them hopefully one of the heroes will be 'get made by the master mel brooks coming out next year br br rating 2 out of 5 stars
<START> the last film by underrated director alberto de martino the antichrist the killer is on the phone is a truly suspenseful but incomprehensibly neglected giallo containing pretty much all the trademarks that makes this italian horror sub genre so magnificent and addictive to the fans there are some very disturbing themes child abuse phony loads of creepy moments plot twists left right outstanding music and Â last but not least Â a handful of really sadistic murder scenes especially the opening sequence which is some kind of prologue is a powerful piece of horror what is it about ordinary child dolls that make them so creepy when the anonymous man dressed up like a priest assaulted a little girl and the broken head of her doll bounced down a flight of stairs it really sent cold shivers through my spine years later the young girl from the prologue is an adult woman bound to a wheelchair she inherited a lot of money but uses her fortune to stimulate fellow handicapped people to practice sports and to remain positive minded she Â joanna Â falls in love with her personal coach and they get married right away naturally he's only after her money and starts terrorizing joanna by making her relive the childhood trauma that crippled her the repeated images of a sinister looking priest guided by eerie tunes and a nursery rhyme provide formula for a murder with a ton of genuine scares and alberto de martino's directing is very resolute the acting is quite competent with david warbeck the beyond the black cat in a glorious greedy villain role due some plot holes and a lack of originality this movie might not be able to compete with italy's best horror efforts but it definitely deserves more attention many formerly obscure and unknown italian gialli received marvelous dvd releases and hopefully formula for a murder will be given the same treatment really soon in the meantime good luck tracking this baby down
<START> with hong kong heart throb andy lau and veteran star ching wan lau chin has everything going for it for the beginning part of the movie unfortunately the movie falls apart at the end br br andy lau plays a sophisticated thief who only has 4 weeks to live but still has one thing unfinished he pulls an elaborated scheme tricking the police into helping him however the police is hot on his tail can he pull it off before being caught br br the build up of the movie is good bits of pieces of clues are left behind for the audiences to try to guess at the real intention unfortunately the build up leads to a disappointed final showdown it feels as if in the middle of the script the writer has changed and that all the build up becomes disconnected br br a 3 10
<START> director lesley thoroughly routine outdoor yarn the yellow 1954 pits the cheyenne against the u s cavalry with tough rory calhoun in the middle as the seasoned clad indian scout who has to lead the survivors to safety this united artists western was lensed in color but the tv print that turner classic movies aired was inexplicably in black white br br the action opens with adam reed rory calhoun of black spurs eluding several indians and riding up to with his old friend and cheyenne chief fire knife lee van cleef of the good the bad and the ugly who has killing on his mind fire knife warns adam that his cheyenne braves are poised to wipe out a nearby cavalry fort under construction because it violates a treaty that the indians made with the government on his way to inform stuck up camp commandant major ives warner anderson of objective burma about the impending indian attack adam discovers a beautiful wood nymph seductively treading water in a lake katherine bolden peggy castle of i jury is another of those silly women in westerns that bathe nude in the middle of indian country without a care in the world castle appears to be genuinely nude in her bathing scenes too perhaps the most memorable scene of all in this otherwise predictable western naturally major ives dismisses adam's warning from fire knife until the commander realizes that somebody has raided his ammunition dump far outside the fort this is one of the many questions that the richard alan simmons' screenplay leaves unanswered in this trim 82 minute oater why would the cavalry bury their ammunition at a secret spot in the desert rather than keep it on the premises in the fort no sooner have they made this discovery than the indians attack knock out of hero and leave him as the only survivor before this attack a pair of white prospectors rides into the fort sawyer peter graves of stalag 17 brings in his partner with an arrow in his chest while adam is getting hot water to help in removing the arrow the greedy sawyer grinds the shaft in deeper and kills his helpless partner later we learn that sawyer and his partner had struck gold the question of the of the gold is also left unanswered after our heroes survive the ordeal adam and fire knife have one final pow wow and fire knife demands that adam hand over major ives or everybody will die naturally adam refuses and the indians begin to whittle down the whites james best in a supporting role as a cavalryman gets an arrow in the back for his efforts noah beery jr plays a mexican scout pursued by a sexy indian damsel appropriately named honey bear oscar winning actress rita moreno of west side story and robert bray of lassie fame is on hand briefly as the ill fated cavalry officer that kate had planned to marry br br the biggest surprise in this unremarkable western shot on location in utah is that the evil cavalry officer ives who slaughtered indian men women and children at the infamous sand creek massacre has been keeping a secret that he is a native american too ironically the taut bow that fire knife gives out of friendship to adam at the outset of the hostilities is what our heroic scout uses to kill the stalwart cheyenne warrior after he has run out of bullets the yellow concludes on an ambiguous note the survivors reach another outpost fort ellis where adam and ives furnish their respective reports about the issue to an army general but we never learn the outcome of this meeting is this artistic ambiguity or yet another unanswered question producer howard w koch is no relation to casablanca scenarist howard koch ultimately the yellow is one of many pro indian westerns that appeared in the aftermath of broken arrow 1950 where the native american is viewed as a noble savage unjustly treated by some but not all whites who made dozens of westerns during the 1950s and the 1960s makes this minor western tolerable despite its thin characters and familiar predicament calhoun stands out of an above average cast as the always serviceable leading man and good looking castle is worth watching for her feminine charms peter graves plays a skunk as was usual in most of his early roles actually lesley did a more satisfactory dramatic version of this movie the year before called war paint 1953 with robert stack incidentally noah beery jr and rita moreno both went on to become regulars on the rockford files
<START> i was surprised after watching this piece of crap if you have seen an episode of tom and jerry in which jerry pours some liquid onto him and becomes invisible than you are likely to see the same cartoons with added erotic topping a man becoming invisible and doing s i is the conclusion of the movie involving too much sex in a cartoon themed movie doesn't increase its worth and most of all i was surprised when the same cartoon ending was used to show up the mr invisible and that was really awful i must say flour drops off the rack and our very own mr invisible becomes visible watch zack and miri make a porno i bet you wont get bored br br 1 10 from me
<START> i happen to love this show its a refreshing take on some older sci fi feels and styles they aren't afraid to shoot and when they do people tend to die far too many show's are afraid of this and end up just pointing the guns and then having it be a standoff farscape also comes complete with a large amount of heartwarming characters they all grow on you till the point where it confuses you to hear them discuss taking some of the animatronic ones out of their to make the mini series from beginning to end farscape leaves you with a feeling of hope and as new and unexpected things happen and then people live and die surprising you every time worth a watch even if you don't have the time
<START> anywhere but here is not exactly anything new but the excellent performances by both of the main actresses made it worth watching sarandon and portman are a mother and daughter who move from rural wisconsin to sunny beverly hills california in search of a better life the main conflict comes from the fact that natalie would much rather have stayed in wisconsin with all of her friends and family and she felt that she was forced to go to california with her overbearing mother br br spoilers while it's true that the film as a whole is disappointingly predictable susan sarandon and especially natalie portman give performances that are so good that they almost make the material seem new anywhere but here doesn't cover any new ground but it does have the rare quality of being able to take overused subject matter and make it fairly interesting again also seen in this movie is the most heartbreaking facial expression seen in years seen on natalie portman's face when her mother drops her off on the side of the road and she watches the car fade into the distance particularly noteworthy is the ironic subplot about natalie's mother pressing her to become an actress as well as a very convincing performance from shawn hatosy as one of natalie's very close cousins from back home his death is a tragic clichÃ© almost always seen in movies like this one but the rest of the film makes up for numerous weaknesses like this not great but anywhere but here is definitely worth a look
<START> i am having a holiday in hong kong now and i just saw gen y cops at the cinema what can i say it was sooo cool br br everything you could wish for was in it basically just see it if ya can i'm gonna get my friend to send me the vcd when it comes out br br only bad thing was the dodgy american style of talking employed by some of the actors like edison what's up my man but it did add even more humour to br br see it especially if ya like any of the following action comedy sci fi edison did a good song for it too so download it edison tse heroes
