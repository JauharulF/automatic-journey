<START> franÃ§ois truffaut young jerk of the cahiers du cinema main bastion of the coming so called new wave made a big show of hating this film and even accused it of dragging french cinema into mediocrity translation truffaut who was terminally repressed sexually was already jealous of the way carnÃ© could make a huge success of a story that pushed all the right buttons of its audience and actually involved it into something important with all the trappings and seduction of sensuality in other words where the general public and many critics saw a perceptive sociological analysis wrapped in a beautiful film truffaut saw girls on the loose br br carnÃ© after all had everything that would be severely lacking from the new wave intelligence refinement humour a great talent as a storyteller a great ear for dialogue dazzling technical brilliance the capacity to make his actors do what he wanted them to do and a good dose of good taste by comparison truffaut is a provincial bore with nothing to say br br a 50's tragic remake of pride and prejudice the french answer to rebel without a cause an updated version of children of paradise les tells a story of disaffected parisian youth who have lost their way in an atmosphere of existentialism sexual liberation and disrespect for traditional and religious values some young critics perceived carnÃ©'s take on the subject as the moralizing slant of an older person whereas i think what happened quite to the contrary is that carnÃ© being gay and knowing a thing or two about repression felt an untold sympathy for the young iconoclasts in his story furthermore this being a french film there is no mistaking that the rebellion in question is essentially sexual something that still had to be decoded in american films like rebel without a cause and the wild one br br carnÃ©'s young people are all supremely beautiful graceful elegant spontaneous and intelligent they are gods and goddesses they drive the latest and the right cars the cut of their suits dresses and duffle coats was a high point of the fashions of the last century their haircuts are still plastered on the wall of your local hairdresser their body shape which they attained and maintained without effort is still the modern western ideal they listen to the best jazz musicians they know how to move how to be sexy and how to make love Â even though the pill hasn't yet been invented they know how to negotiate different social classes and cultures unfortunately they are defined by and live by the code of the gang and their own heartless rituals that exclude sentimentality and make a sin of romantic love the only thing wrong with them is that their elders don't talk to them and vice versa the incidents depicted in this film got a lot of tongues wagging for a long time in france about the amorality and nihilism of youth while still making it a huge public and critical success br br this film is so stylish and gorgeous i suspect the older viewers who watched it wished they could be like the people depicted in the film and quite a few young filmmakers or aspiring filmmakers like truffaut developed a bad case of reflecting how they could never conceivably make a film as sexy or popular as this one although they would be very good at eventually aiming for the nihilistic bits on the other hand given a certain clichÃ©d aspect of the script amorous misunderstanding leading to a medical emergency one can only wonder at the horribly pious and puritanical mishmash americans would have extracted from the same basic script if they had dared to tackle the subject br br interestingly the movie was filmed in the same basic locations as the american musical funny face a year earlier where hollywood saw the picturesque aspects of the gauche and existentialism carnÃ© its tragic and ironic dimension watch this trailer on youtube
<START> note the wide release date of aug 8 1945 about a week before japan surrendered in wwii so there will probably be a message for us in over 21 irene dunne it happened one night the 1939 version of love affair is paula wharton who goes to live on an army base while her newspaper editor husband is in training school alexander knox the longest day is her hubby max look for charles coburn monkey business gentlemen prefer blondes as the stuffy commanding newspaper boss also look for cora witherspoon as mrs gates from the women bank dick lady war story written for the wives' point of view which wasn't too common in those days fun commentary on the shabby condition of the married housing wardrobe in this film certainly wasn't at all shabby since they never had to leave their little cottage it appears the whole movie budget was spent on her always exquisite dresses and hats
<START> simply put i was amazingly disappointed i'm a huge fan of asian horror and i can watch unoriginality i myself enjoyed the red shoes and phone but this was just poor br br the movie has a lot of elements that are very high quality the photography is eye catching the visuals are cool the directing is inspired the acting is pretty good the music is easy on the ears and the cgi is incredible but since this is a horror film we are expected to be scared which just won't happen with this film as with most south korean horrors this is unoriginal almost from beginning to end there's the trademark long haired vengeful female ghost ominous of thick black hair and puddles of water and near the end a twist that almost but not quite makes sense out of the whole thing the twist is easily one of the best qualities and to the viewer's irritation when the film isn't recycling at times so exact that it could easily be dubbed plagiarized imagery from other movies it's making you jump a lot and by jumps i don't mean things jumping out or anything just very loud noises and screeches in the soundtrack used to make the audience jump six feet in the air there's even a few made you jump moments that are simply infuriating and when it is not ripping off other movies it's boring and hard to sit through br br and it's a shame because could have easily been really good and it has everything to make it good but its the annoying overuse of completely predictable loud noises and jump scares that eventually ruin the movie a perfect example of how good it could have been there's a moment when one of out characters is looking at a corpse and without a sound the corpse looks back it's wholly predictable but the use of silence in that scene is brilliant and unfortunately that's as scary as the movie got for me br br admittedly has a few good features and even a couple jumps that aren't as predictable and do work there's a very good and sad back story used to explain the events and the twist is pretty unpredictable those are the only things that separate the film from any other asian ghost horror film but the problem with these is even though they do work they have been used before j horror fans will easily realize the big reveal was inspired by a tale of two sisters and it takes the back story a good fifty minutes to get going br br so in the end really seems like a truly wasted opportunity tae kyeong kim hoped that the plot twist and other good features act as diversions so the audience won't notice the huge flaws but he failed and well we noticed everything br br my rating 4 10
<START> i can honestly tell you that this movie is the most awesome movie ever if you are in the mood for a comedy i totally recommend this movie so here's the summary there is this girl nikki who is fourteen and a half and she goes on a vacation with her father andre whom she hasn't seen for about two years she expects the vacation to be totally boring until she meets this boy ben who is much older than she is so to try to impress him she says that she isn't on vacation with her father but her lover this is a hysterical movie from beginning to end and i highly suggest it so rent it and enjoy
<START> i tried to be patient and open minded but found myself in a coma like state i wish i would have brought my duck and goose feather pillow i apologize to all of the great actors in this movie maybe it takes a degree from mit to understand the importance of this movie
<START> i would have given this movie a 1 but i laughed so hard so many times that i had to give it a little credit in the off off off off chance the film was supposed to be funny a movie so bad you'll think chimps wrote it you'll wish chimps had written it dialogue so canned that only it and the cockroaches will survive the coming nuclear holocaust the movie exaggerates its awfulness by intersplicing scenes from the original carrie a really good film into scenes from this one like intersplicing scenes from taxi driver into baby geniuses do not rent it alone as you will not enjoy the experience you will need someone next to you to confirm the badness of what you are viewing worst actress of the millenium goes to poor poor amy irving as the stone faced monotone disastrously wooden school counselor worst movie of the year so far see also arlington road 3
<START> britain and france declared war on germany in 1939 but by then almost all of europe had fallen under the advance of the nazi war machine entering the war britain virtually started from scratch with scarce supplies and with an air force that was outnumbered by germany ten to one but the will of the brits was firm emboldened by their new prime minister winston churchill who declared we shall never go under br br on august 8 1940 the battle for britain was on however for the first time since hitler's declared stance to conquer the world he hit a wall though massively outnumbered the british royal air force went on the offensive and in the span of twenty eight days in september and october of 1940 german luftwaffe casualties climbed to two thousand three hundred seventy five lost planes and crew hitler's rage was seething but he had to call a momentary time out responding later in the year hitler launched a massive fire bombing of london on christmas day of 1940 when i say that there has never been a disaster movie to rival the real live footage of london in flames during this assault would be an understatement perhaps the most surreal effect of this chapter in the why we fight series would be seeing british citizens emerge from their underground shelters following the bombing raids to resume what was left of their life above ground even as you watch there is no way to comprehend the living horror these people must have gone through as the city of london was left in virtual ruin br br yet the nazis were stunned and stymied as well everything hitler wanted to believe about freedom and democracy was now turned on it's head instead of being weak willed and complacent like the french the british were not going to give up without a fight and fight they did taking the air battle to germany and responding in kind with attacks on the german homeland it was a turning point forcing hitler to rethink his strategy
<START> night hunter starts in as a young jack cutter chris is unexpectedly handed the family tradition of becoming a vampire hunter when a fellow vampire hunter sid sid haim betrays his family hands them over to the vampire's to aid jack on his quest he is given a book that contains the name of every vampire alive or dead whichever way you look at it jump to los angeles where the now adult cutter don 'the dragon' wilson also credited as co producer has but four names left in the book including argento vince carmella sophia crawford together they are the last of the american vampires as they all dine in a restaurant cutter crashes the party kills them job done right wrong as king of the vampires bruno fischer nicholas guest calls in the last four remaining vampires from around the world the french tournier maria ford the asian ron yuan ulmer david sangster vincent to track cutter down kill him meanwhile detective's hooper marcus aurelius browning cash casey don't have a clue a nosey reporter named raimy baker melanie smith becomes involved in the battle between cutter the vampire's on which the very fate of earth rests br br directed by rick jacobson i thought night hunter was quite a fun way to pass 85 odd minutes the script by william c martell mixes martial arts horror with a fair degree of success it moves along at a nice pace is at least never boring thankfully doesn't seem to take itself too seriously the character names that reference other horror film director's actors are a little tacky though some may be surprised at how closely night hunter resembles blade 1998 yet was made a couple of years prior the lone moody long coat wearing vampire hunter who happens to be an expert in martial arts the scene set in a nightclub the innocent woman drawn into the world of vampire's night hunter doesn't really stick to traditional vampire film law for instance sunlight only irritates their eye's they can only breed on a solar eclipse why stakes through the heart garlic is no good as the way to kill a vampire in night hunter is to break it's neck i could have done with a bit more horror a bit more blood as it leans more towards the martial arts side of things the dialogue is suitably cheesy the character's are just about likable enough in a silly way br br director jacobson does his best to ruin the film the actions scenes are ok but lack a certain something for some bizarre reason whenever an action sequence takes place he shakes his camera constantly it's like the camera is placed upon a washing machine full cycle hey rick mate it's not clever or stylish it's irritating annoying the gore is disappointing with a few gory gunshot wounds a few splashes of blood breaking vampire's necks don't involve much blood unfortunately br br with a budget that probably didn't amount to much night hunter is competently made throughout the acting was bad most of the time what's with 'the dragon' thing in don 'the dragon' wilson's name has he legally changed his name does he sign cheques don 'the dragon' wilson does he get mail addressed to him in that name i think i might do something like this from now on i want to be known as paul 'the killer andrews br br night hunter is one of those crap films that transcends it's limitations awfulness to become pure golden entertainment if you like your films fun then night hunter might be for you if your looking for big budget thrills in a similar vein vampire's veins blood get it then blade it's sequels would probably be a better choice what the hell i liked it so sue me
<START> at times i really when i look at the comments here it seems as if most people have seen a completely different film than i have i've just seen it and liked it not in the way that it made me happy but in the way of having seen a good film br br the film needs some patience yes and yes the main character is really annoying but that i'm sure is by intention br br maybe it really makes a difference if you watch this film in a cinema or at home most people watch films at home like they are listening to elevator music this movie definitely doesn't fit as background noise br br and no good directing doesn't mean having five laughs or explosions a second good directing means following your subject and keeping the story and actors together and while that doesn't work out perfectly at least i think it works quite good br br i liked the photography and sets even if they brink on the surreal at times the opening scene is really special br br i also liked the acting Â guillaume depardieu is not playing pierre he is acting the role of a pierre who is himself playing a role pierre is not the romantic hero that he so hard tries to be he is a presumptuous and self righteous idiot a downright weakling who by and by harms all the people he claims to protect that even his love for truth is simply a pose is beautifully demonstrated by his ongoing lying and not even once asking questions or explaining himself br br people are wondering where this or that person came from and other stuff no character who is seen for more than two scenes is left unexplained there is enough information scattered throughout the film on everyone br br and even the strange building begins to make sense as soon as the target practicing is seen remember that isabelle fled from a war zone and obviously this is a refuge for fighters in a civil war most likely bosnia which was still going on when the film was produced at least that's what is hinted at by the story isabelle tells pierre when she first meets him and by the later scene where pierre shows isabelle the book with his father on the cover which is surrounded by books on bosnia
<START> the omission of jazzy jeff the creator of the chirp and transformer scratch raised a few eyebrows but it's good to see he made it to the extras of the dvd after all with scratch doug pray who previously chronicled the grunge phenomenon of the '90s in hype 1996 made an excellent documentary about the world of the hip hop dj and the evolution of his latest documentary infamy 2005 explores contemporary american graffiti culture after a couple of viewings four years ago my dvd had been gathering dust ever since but recently i watched it again and besides the subject material i was surprised how well shot and edited this documentary actually is an immensely enjoyable soundtrack as well and not just talking heads but lots of music old school footage parties break dancing you name it one of the best things about the film is that it mainly examines where the art of is today in 2001 that is without disregarding the pioneers of course good stuff br br camera obscura 8 10
<START> i've read some about the court scenes these people betray their ignorance this production went to simply amazing lengths to recreate all aspects of the period in which the story occurred manners are something few people outside the court ever see while the acting may appear highly stylized it is in fact as close a replication as possible of the behavior of individuals in their particular stations as the director could create the actor's facial expressions are a marvel particularly the duplicitous marquis and the king's mother br br there are of course reflections of both greek and shakespearian tragedy in the relationship between the king his parents and his love the juxtaposition of the king transforming from good to bad and the assassin from bad to good provides much food for thought on the evolution of an individual's nature this movie would provide much to ponder in a college course on the humanities br br at the same time it almost rushes along even in the slowest scenes heading towards an inexorable denouement one suspects the involvement of large portions of the troop movements which were quite awesome it makes the lord of the rings battle scenes pale by comparison few directors have the ability to literally field thousands of humans on the field of battle just for art's sake i recall one scene in which at least 30 000 troops can be seen moving across a huge plain the logistics for such a shot would have been staggering br br i could go on but simply i can't recommend this film highly enough
<START> a young man discovers that life is precious after he is seriously injured in a street racing accident his father is a pastor who changes his outlook on life and he spends the whole movie sharing his new found love for others in this shocking and heartwarming movie the theme is built around street car racing and it is an excellent movie for people who are into that and movies like 'the fast and the furious' this shows how people can overcome their problems and gives the general message about the meaning of life in a new and exciting way
<START> i totally agree that the reenactments kill what could otherwise be a great show i'll admit that i'd seen 1 or 2 episodes last season and was not clear at all that it was all but when i caught one episode recently it suddenly jumped out at me big time and i lost interest immediately then i noticed the disclaimer at the start before an episode that followed has anyone followed the show closely enough to tell me did they actually make the acting and reenacting parts more artificial on purpose or did i just not notice before i'm usually pretty good at sensing this stuff but the recent episode was so obviously artificial i practically tripped over it now i have no interest whatsoever in watching and have given up entirely on it it just doesn't have any real value if it's all scripted and acted and at least lately it seems very poorly scripted and acted the comment above that says who cares if it's all reenactments i do without visual truth this is just a bunch of you know what happened one time this guy it's info better read in a book
<START> one of my favorites as a child growing up in the ny metro area in the late 60s and early 70s i was often afforded the opportunity to visit nyc with my grandfather or father as they conducted business there the gritty bustling human reality of that city particularly in winter have stayed with me br br this film very aptly captures the stark cold matter of fact feel of the nyc winter season while keenly exposing the underbelly of the region's infamous underworld of crime and policing a great snapshot of a place and a time and a culture br br and the car chase is simply amazing at least on par with the one in bullitt and surpassing the chase in the french connection i can watch time and again as the suspension comes unstuck on that plymouth fury police cruiser barreling toward the gw bridge in pursuit as it lurches into that sharp right curve bouncing and scraping into oncoming traffic the stunt driving coordinator for that scene did bullitt and the french connection as well as many other movie chases good acting too and a decent plot line the musical score is edgy and compelling and the cinematography and direction are top notch a great if underrated 1970s cop drama a keeper not out on dvd yet though br br comparable in style and content to the french connection and super fly early 1970's cop dramas set in the bleak nyc winter months
