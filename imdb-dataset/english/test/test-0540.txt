<START> the title doesn't make much sense to me i'm not sure what door in the movie shouldn't have been opened br br the movie starts uneventfully with a conversation between a man and a woman in a room that looks like a richly furnished train car complete with the sound of the train traveling in fact the man's house is a train car and he has a cassette of train sounds the woman leaves and calls a young woman the young woman tells her boyfriend a doctor that she's been told her grandmother is ill and she needs to return to her home town she hasn't been there in thirteen years br br flash back to thirteen years ago a shadowy figure enters a house he caresses a sleeping young girl then goes into another room and stabs the girl's mother the girl wakes up and enters her mother's room and finds her dead with a knife in her she screams and an arm comes out of nowhere and a hand over her mouth she looks up in fear that early scene in the movie of the killer muffling her scream and the girl's look is one of the few effective shots in the movie br br it doesn't have much going for it in the visuals department occasionally there's some strange use of sound and there's some weird lighting in an attic scene where many of the panes of glass are red and blue br br back to the present day the young woman arrives in her grandmother's house an old doctor is there who she doesn't trust along with the man from the opening scene judge and kearn the town's museum operator she doesn't trust any of them and it's true they don't inspire any trust she's rather crabby throughout the whole movie she wants to check her grandmother into a hospital the men in the town want her house and the museum operator wants the things in it his museum is already filled with many of the grandmother's things inexplicably the woman wants to keep the house br br the young woman starts getting phone calls from a man speaking in a sinister whisper he makes various threats and wants her to do things to arouse him such scenes recur often unfortunately there are so few characters in the movie that the possibilities of who it could be are limited worse still we see right from the beginning who is making the phone calls so while the young woman doesn't know even though the caller occasionally drops into his normal voice the audience always knows no suspense each call rattles her more and more br br the ending was unexpected for me so maybe gets points for not going with the obvious but i'm not sure i cared for it
<START> first the a cop drama crossed with a funny melodrama quay Â is disconcerting independent and a menace to banality jouvet's aplomb is put to good use in a tough cop performance immediately noticeable by its vigor and exuberant force his antoine is not so much a man of intellect but a man of vast life experience and earthly instinct quay Â is not subversive in the sense that today's and already yesterday's philistines enjoy using the word it is clouzot's most playful hour he tended to adapt books in a satiric note it's said that clouzot was a big reader of detective novels as a director clouzot's firm hand is successful br br it is not a mystery or a thriller but a satirical look at a parisian couple and at the police's proceedings those accustomed with clouzot's masterpiece les diaboliques might find slightly disconcerting the multiplicity of things styles elements in quay Â here clouzot speaks about many things about a couple and a hidden love story simone for blier about the entertainment's world and about old spinsters about police techniques and an old bitter cop with a boy to raise etc there is a note of only in jouvet's performance but also in the film's conception br br quay is a realistic crime drama made as a satire it offers an outstanding performance by jouvet as a tough police inspector antoine is an old cop with an adventurous past he fought in africa but did not climb the stair because of his independent behaviors he lives with his son a schoolboy at work antoine is tough and merciless an able inspector bitter intelligent and harsh it is a role of great gusto very picturesque jouvet composed his character of several defining clothes his expression his funny accent his brutality and that mocking air Â antoine is not made to look more clever than plausible when he interrogates blier antoine makes mistakes and his talent is presented like the talent we meet in real with errors and and defects talent is one that comes also from experience from daily not the almost supernatural genius of almost all the famous detectives br br quay Â is is a realistic crime drama and also a satire and a melodrama one can consider it among the first filmic forays into the legendary toughness of the french police long ago eastwood's and wayne's harsh cops there was antoine br br the title is interesting suggesting that this is a movie about the police not about a case or a mystery br br as craftsmanship clouzot was perhaps the best and sharpest in france in the way that welles was quay Â is very true to clouzot's sardonic comic sharp observations much psychology sharp irony the man was when he filmed knew what to shoot what to the introductory scenes of this film with jenny great stage success each scene is memorably shot clouzot's technical stylistic were amazing his style is inventive satirical sharp extremely limpid ingenious br br jouvet's style was exuberant powerful vehement some disliked it precisely for these features as he had been a great stage actor his movie style was deemed as too theatrical etc his antoine is a fine example of what was meant by composing a role by a composition br br jouvet had a very peculiar like a menacing bird of like van much subtler nobler and more intelligent and distinguished jouvet had this predatory ferocious air and it is useful here as he performs an old tough cop one of quay sides is that it is a jouvet recital he is immediately recognizable identifiable by the quality of his play i see that many watching this flick do not know it is a jouvet is an astounding quality in itself br br fresnay and jouvet are the two french actors that i admire the most the first one was revealed to me by a renoir drama the famous one while jouvet by a carnÃ© comedy i was charmed to see that clouzot gave leading roles to both of them br br to end a word about he wrote the novel used by clouzot who had previously adapted another novel as a fresnay comedy was an old school mystery writer in the wallace vein he became quickly outdated with the new hardboiled fashions when i was 11 i have read one of his thrillers and liked it much
<START> this film has not exactly remained fresh in the minds of film buffs and it's a crying shame its witty screenplay adaptation should have netted oscar nominations for the great screenwriter i a l diamond's adaptation and ingrid bergman's flawless performance it must have been an honor for goldie hawn at such a young age to work with bergman looking more than a decade younger than her 54 years fifty four when she's on the screen it positively br br this is a film which may appear dated at first but it actually made me wish i was around during the swingin' hawn's fashions are as tacky as bergman's are chic that's one minor flaw isn't her character a little too for a gal who still lives with her sister but then again would we have ingrid any other way and who wouldn't want to hang out at a nightclub called the slipped disc br br the best compliments i can pay to this film is that it somehow made me nostalgic for a decade that i never saw and that it left me wanting more speaking of wanting more i wonder what ever became of sexy supporting actor rick lenz he resembles griffin dunne in this film this was his film debut and i don't see any other major roles in his filmography as for goldie hawn she's done so much since then it's easy to not be impressed but i can't imagine any other actor in the role either br br since the movie is based on a play the line delivery may seem a bit stage y but it did not inhibit my enjoyment at all in fact i am amazed at how funny it still is after over thirty five years because this film represents a bygone era it has unjustly slipped from the consciousness of film buffs it is more linked to the era films that came before it than the ones that followed but don't let that stop you from savoring the delights it has to offer grade a
<START> this documentary was very amateurish it could have been made by college students assuming that it was my grading is as follows content c sound quality f cinematography f acting d soundtrack f casting c a overall grade d br br i found myself getting seasick as we walked down the streets with the characters bobbing up and down with each move of the my mother in law even changed the batteries in her miracle ear and she could not hear the muffled dialog extensive post production editing and cgi would not help this bomb these students would barely pass my course my advise don't waste your time or money for the one a
<START> when the american movie industry tries to critically look at their own government they make damn sure it looks good even when it's bad br br the film does 1 thing right it demonstrates perfectly what is wrong with the american politics the motto seems to be to f k with whoever it takes to get things done mix an american congressmen a cia agent a jew and an arab just to f k the thanks to us for giving us osama bin laden br br the disappointment of the film comes in the face of muddling up the issues using imagery of afghan children with no arms and the stories of soviet atrocities and then making a blatant attempt to suggest a link between those and the reasoning behind the american help every sensible person knows why the 1 000 000 000 was raised not the dying afghani children that's for sure br br as usual the serious issues are covered into facade of bullshit dialogue here is to you you m r f s chants at the end all that's missing is the american flag in the background and the stupid military the films can not help but leave the aftertaste of the feeling of american pride and glee on how we the americans have saved the world once again not even the last 5 minutes of the film can save it where an attempt is being made to stop praising yourself and wake up to the fact that its just another american f k up br br the acting and editing was good though
<START> as cute and adorable as they are the story of three singing chipmunks just doesn't seem to have enough meat to it to sustain it for an hour and a half i thought that the first half hour or so of this movie was well worth watching it was fun it had a few laughs in it it was full of energy then it somehow just lost that i wouldn't even say it faded away because it seemed quite abrupt to me the fun was gone the laughter disappeared my daughter noticed it too she's 4 she laughed uproariously several times in that first part of the movie then her laughter stopped perhaps it took on too serious a tone the evil movie producer working the chipmunks to death something happened anyway and it wasn't for the better br br of course the movie is trying to tell the story of how the chipmunks alvin simon and theodore began everyone knows the christmas song here we discover how they met dave and got their start the movie is updated to the present time although their real origin is noted by dave's street address of 1958 which was the year when the animated singing rodents were first created jason lee did a pretty good job as dave and the chipmunk voices were also pretty good david cross as the evil ian irritated me to be blunt and i couldn't figure out the point of the character of claire played by cameron richardson she added little to the movie it's a movie you can watch with the kids it's probably a movie you'd only want to watch with the kids in fact it gets a 4 10 from me
<START> i rented the dvd in a video store as an alternative to reading the report but it's pretty much just more terror br br while the film may present some info from the report in the drama you're taking the word of the producers there's no reference to the commission report anywhere in the film not one br br the acting all around is pretty bad pretty much all of the stereotypes of 'hot bitchy foul mouthed government agents each thinking they know more than everyone else there may be some truth to it but it really has a bad hollywood stereotype smell to it br br imdb's user community ratings comments tend to be more right than wrong and i have started to glance at the ratings before renting whenever i can br br i wish i had on this one
<START> just to save you money and time i will go ahead and tell you that this movie is absolutely not worth the match and gas it would take to burn it don't waste your time as a matter of fact you would be better off forgetting you ever thought about watching it i have seriously seen better b movies in a language that i can't understand who ever gave permission for this to be made needs to be the only positive thing i can say for this movie is that with a new script and the right director and actors it could be a great story let me break it down a virgin gets pregnant by a demon the baby while inside her womb wants to feed on people they try to make up for the fact that this is possibly the worst movie ever made with cursing and pointless nudity all in all totally not worth the dollar it took me to rent it
<START> i suppose i like this film as well as any i know it is not perfect but under the title the americanization of lily this charming and memorable semi musical satire might i suggest have been appreciated more and still loved by those who recognized its special blake edwards' produced spirit of gentleness clever humor and solid narrative the improbably but delightful story line follows lili smith a fringe type spy for the germans in a much simpler and less black and white war lili schmidt passing as smith is helping her uncle who is patriotic too for germany but neither cruel nor political merely opportunistic target is william a charismatic u s squadron leader who can supply her valuable information the plot thickens comes when lili falls in love with has her eyes opened to the consequences of her playing spy and sees the effects of combat on wounded men at a hospital and realizes what it might mean to his men whom she has met and likes she gets jealous of a rival for affections then realizes she can no longer do what she has been doing and gives up the spy business the logical end of the film comes when after the terrible wwi has ended as she sings the theme song of the film wishing in a darkened theater one by one the members of squadron appear including her lover himself indicating they have forgiven her and their former opponents and even uncle kurt enthusiastically joins in the singing of it's a long to to indicate all is well with the world again this is an audacious and sometime brilliant story idea written by director blake edwards and william peter blatty of john fame and it is a delightful narrative squadron including an who keeps crashing and other lovable types populate this lively film and the feel of this stylish and glowing film is almost epic both in its scope and realization credit must go to jack bear and donald brooks for their costume creations reg allen and jack stevens for sets fernando carrere for another beautiful production design henry mancini for his sensitive and appropriate musical score and to russell harlan for his shining cinematography in the beautiful footage the principal actors are julie andrews as lili rock hudson as outstanding as uncle kurt michael witney lance percival as the pilot gorgeous gloria paul as rival and many other fine actors in smaller parts it is hard to say enough nice things about the pace or the cleverness of the just this side of broad comedy this element is introduced by edwards to leaven the horrors of actual warfare to example the almost comic opera approach with which men made war back in a more innocent minded era of human civilization this comedy also helps prepare the way for conversion from uncritical acceptance of a duty to the german state to acceptance of the reality of what she is doing and potentially what she may be causing this is a rare sense of life film about americanization her assertion of herself in the real world and then among others before tragedy can happen it is haunting i find and beautiful in many ways i consider it to be blake of directing and under the title the americanization of lili i believe with hardly any changes it might have been recognized as the polished sapphire of a film it is by every standard i know
<START> i watched all of the doctor who episodes that my local pbs station played while growing up got introduced to the doctor by way of john pertwee as well as camera copies of doctor who sent to america by uk fans to their us counterparts i had a great time w the show but it never seemed to take itself seriously i mean as seriously as a sci fi show about a time traveler could be i went to the cons did the costume bit doctor 5 6 and tegan were my costume characters loved it then it all came to a sudden halt program politics and lack of interest and funding turned doctor who into a old antique that drifted into the ethos br br when i heard that the sci fi channel had picked up the new doctor my first thought was cool now my 11 year old son can see what i've been babbling on about all these years and know what the heck a tardis is i have several phone boxes and of various sizes around the house i didn't expect the excellent quality of story character development and f x i was to say the least pleased for the first time i found a doctor that wasn't a curmudgeon a clown a fop a trip head a pussy or a jerk christopher eccleston is by far the most believable doctor to date now now calm down tom baker fans don't get me wrong i loved almost every doctor and his quirks but christopher gave something to the doctor that he'd never had before real word believability i'm just sad that he decided against another season i'll try out david tennant as i would any other doctor but now the bar has risen br br bad wolf rules br br 2008 update i love david tennant his mod persona is something that my generation remembers my son's generation can deal with and fashion gestapo can relax he's a little more human than christopher but not as as other former doctors i miss rose i dig martha and what were they thinking with donna noble it's still the best ride on tv
<START> would it be too trite of me to create a review of just me saying the word stupid over and over again probably br br this is arguably the worst movie i've ever seen seriously there are better movies on mystery science theater 3000 i saw this movie for the first time at a friend's birthday party when it was still in theaters even though it was actually with friends and at one of their birthday parties i had to leave i actually had to leave i just excused myself and walked out fortunately some of the parents were doing the same thing so i didn't look like a total jerk anyway this film is awful there is nothing to like about it it's painfully as in actually causing physical pain slow and sickeningly literally does induce vomiting unfunny you almost feel sorry for tom arnold but then you don't because you remember he was actually in the movie it really does pain me to even think about it br br it was on tv a few months ago and i decided i had to watch it all the way through just once i remembered then why i walked out in the first place and felt guilty for boosting its ratings by even one viewer the gags aren't funny the characters arn't interesting it's just a senseless mess of pratfalls and stupidity br br there is a small crowd of then eight year old kids who watched the movie when it came out and considered it brilliant if you think that having your face removed piece by with an ice cream scoop is brilliant then by all means go rent it but if you have any dignity whatsoever avoid this big stupid mess altogether score 0 10 maybe a negative 1 actually
<START> this film is an excellent teaching tool as a pre study of to kill a mockingbird in conjunction with a study of the novel itself caged bird can be used as an independent literary study or as an introduction to
<START> i watched this last night for the first time in 40 years it's bad really bad but it has enough hilariously awful moments that it's worth watching first of all was it deliberate to make the boy being babysat completely effeminate he even says to costello a la mae west you fascinate me as costello does a double take god only knows what would have have happened if the babysitter had been a hunk this kid would have seduced him in a heartbeat then there's the principal male dancer he is totally inept roar with laughter as he leaps and prances with no talent whatsoever over the grave during he never looked better in his life the two romantic leads are wastes abbott gets to sing one line and that was dubbed in by another singer geez i guess he couldn't even carry a tune costello does manage to be charming in his i fear nothing number and i guess very small children might like it but there's not much to recommend it but oh that seductive effeminate boy that aspect alone blew me away plus the fact the family accepted anyone off the street with no references to babysit a child today little boy would be taken away from them
<START> in post civil war america the president van johnson travels to dallas and is assassinated by corrupt officials and businessman interested in installing the vice president whom they can blackmail due to incriminating documents a gunman gemma convinced that his black friend is wrongly accused of the assassination aims to uncover the truth tonino valeri directed this fascinating if flawed film which obviously is an allegory for the kennedy assassination the film may wrongly present blacks as slaves working on plantations in texas but the film is nonetheless enjoyable and presents an interesting interpretation that kennedy's death was the result of a coup de tat which many americans could not accept at the time oswald's murder is replayed here as the black accused of the assassination is murdered by the men responsible on route to fort worth prison this moment in the film is more melodramatic than oswald's death with his various escorts shot down before his over the top death scene nonetheless this is definitely one of the more interesting and worthwhile spaghetti westerns worth a look
<START> this is possibly the worst film i have ever seen what a weak waste of michael obvious talent disgusting film from start to finish all i can say is this director is no you never once get inside the game the character's head the amazing talent with numbers the real had the coke scene is bad enough to throw your shoe at the set it might have been a great scene had it been shot for movies and not the stage with the camera half way across the house hovering over a mirror with drugs on it while the drama is going on far in the background the scene where he wins the big championship is just laugh out loud ridiculous this should be screened in film making 101 what not to do in making pictures
