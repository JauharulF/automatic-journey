<START> what's there to say about pink flamingos it is beyond criticism or even explanation because it doesn't really aspire to be like any other movie you've seen you will either get it or you won't laugh at it or roll your eyes in disgust or both john waters is an odd filmmaker putting that mildly mixing both innocent childlike humor with shockingly offensive moments intended to well who knows what his intentions were it is like a form of assault albeit a funny one br br the thing that makes humor so infectious and effective is that his characters inhabit a world that can seem both alien and completely familiar to the viewer like the petty rivalries that form the plot of pink flamingos surely everyone has experienced this kind of thing at some point but almost certainly the matter at stake was not the title of the filthiest person alive what makes the movie compelling viewing for me is the way that waters creates giddy self contained environments and doesn't let you in on the joke right away the people in his films are completely in tune with one another for instance when cotton tells babs that she doesn't want to accompany her into town because crackers is bringing his lady friend out to the trailer babs reacts with a knowing smirk and says to her in a conspiratorial aside that little just perfect at this point we do not know yet that crackers plans to take his lady friend out to the shed to thrust live chickens at her naked body while cotton watches through a window but this weirdness is totally commonplace and understood by the characters in the degenerate world that waters creates br br another example would be the conversations between the girls in the basement and channing the deviant butler the first time we see them waters cuts jarringly from a scene in connie's cozy office to channing descending into the basement where we see that there are two women down there one dead and one very much alive and p ed off susan is not a cowering victim but is enraged and abusive to channing leaping up to launch a full scale verbal attack on her jailer they both have a weird understanding of the bizarre situation and she is not so much intimidated by her kidnapping as she is violently insulted and righteously furious she does not let up for one second while channing is in her sight and the two scenes that feature their delirious banter are two of the comic highlights of the film later in the film when divine and crackers break into the home and discover their crimes of keeping abducted women in their basement it represents the total lack of support that divine and her family have for the brand of depravity that the marbles are pandering here is something divine is unfamiliar with a corruption devised by her newfound rivals and she despises it furthermore while kidnapping does not seem like something divine would think twice about she is indignant that the girls are being held down there and happily sets them free relishing the revenge that they take on channing br br at the other end of the filth spectrum waters occasionally reminds us of the line between his twisted fantasy world and the real world the first time we see connie she is belittling a minor character named sandy who has never heard of divine cookie on the other hand reacts with a hilariously matter of fact evaluation of title as the filthiest person alive revealing that she inhabits this world of unspoken and understood lunacy as well br br something also must be said for the way the players are in touch with their respective roles especially divine who doesn't miss a note not once does he falter in the ridiculous garb and character he's been given and it takes pink flamingos to a new level or weirdness people actually believed divine was like this in real life and it's easy to understand why because while watching the movie you're not really thinking about the movie you're thinking about these people who made it since they're really doing the outrageous things in the script you start to think that maybe this is not a story but a bizarre documentary br br but even more so pink flamingos is not so much a movie as it is an event or something that happens to you even though its shock value is mostly gone for me now i say mostly because the a hole scene and the chicken scene still make me wince i still find this film to be hilarious and habit forming
<START> as was mentioned before in other comments the major problem of nva is that it cannot decide what it wants to be slapstick of the cheapest kind or an honest parody of the east german army there are a couple of moments which are quite moving for example when one of the recruits returns from the army prison in with a completely broken personality but in the end leander goes for the infantile humour no wonder the film flopped at the german box office as it's historically untruthful to the real situation in those training camps and led by an actor who is unfortunately incapable of giving a nuanced performance br br however there is the camera work of frank who as always does a wonderful job if it wasn't for his beautiful images i would have rated the film far worse
<START> i wouldn't exactly call this a good movie in fact it might even be a bad one br br but there are at least 2 good reasons to keep watching this movie those are the performances from agnes bruckner eden and jonathan jackson eric whom both deliver solid performances br br they are much better then the rest of the cast whom are pretty bad especially meagan goode cousin br br bijou philips was excellent in the suburban kids goes to the hood drama havoc but here she's far from good on the edge to being annoying br br the story is decent enough although nothing special but it would have been much better since it takes place in that any of the kids actually incorporated a down south accent but they don't br br especially in a movie where the monster is actually bounded so deeply into the folk lore with voodoo and such it's just plain stupidity not to include that accent into the characters br br the only one who does this is rapper method man he plays deputy turner and puts down a pretty good accent in his few scenes and i mean if a rapper is able to do this then why shouldn't the actors be able to do the same mister aka meth is highly enjoyable in his very very small role who know the stallion would ever be a cop even if only on the big screen br br anyways besides that it's a pretty stupid but fairly enjoyable slasher movie but if bruckner and jackson was as bad as the rest of the young cast this could have been really bad thankfully they are good as usual br br 4 5 out of 10 decent but there are hundreds of better slasher movies out there
<START> what a frustrating movie a small southern town is overflowing with possibilities for exploring the complexities of interpersonal relationships and dark hidden beneath placid surfaces as anyone who has read anything by carson mccullers already knows this does none of that instead the writers settled for cutesy cheap warm fuzzies and banal melodrama the thing looks like a made for tv movie and was directed with no particular distinction but it's hard to imagine what anyone could have done to make this material interesting br br the most frustrating aspect though is the fact that there are a lot of extremely competent and appealing actors in this cast all trying gamely to make the best of things and do what they can with this well there's no other word for it drivel a tragic waste of talent in particular that of the great stockard channing
<START> ineffectual molly coddled self pitying lousy provider jimmy stewart is having a bad marriage to carole lombard after falling on hard times he endures a demeaning job a fault finding passive aggressive over bearing live in mother who is in dire need of an epic smackdown and an endlessly crying baby the movie on failure and squalor to no discernible end do you want to watch a couple bicker with his mom for ninety minutes many scenes feature a shrieking baby the movie fails to elucidate why we would want to endure the mother from hell or why jimmy stewart can't grow a pair who wanted to see this who wanted to see stewart and lombard without laughs or charm br br it's absolutely depressing and unendurable
<START> this movie's one redeemable quality besides barely there loincloth is the hilarious acting on the part of the bad guy this wonderfully overplayed villain has a certain oh shakespearean presence that made this movie bearable hence the 2 i just giggled every time he lifting an incredulous eyebrow to henchman or hero a true example of someone not getting paid enough and that beard br br now really what was with the 12 minute hang glider scene really really really bad i can't emphasize that point enough br br so seriously if you even deign to see this movie watch the mystery science theater 3000 version with those dear silhouettes has many a horrendous movie been tolerated
<START> i actually though that black snake moan was great movie which takes place in the south the story follows a man named lazarus whose wife dumps him for his brother and finds rae abandoned and beaten up on the side of the road lazarus finds out that rae is a sex addict and was abused as a child so he decides to take matters into his own hands by tying up rae with a chain to cure her of her wickedness samuel l jackson and christina ricci have great chemistry together and their performances make you believe that through their struggles and search for redemption that lazarus and rae become best friends i was also amazed by sam's ability to play an electric guitar and being able to sing s is great as love interest angela justin timberlake plays boyfriend ronnie who is underused in the film but does the best that he can to deliver a fine performance
<START> a wide variety of snakes stage an uprising on tourists invading their island due their captain's boat damage the few remaining survivors who aren't caught vulnerable by the snakes will attempt an escape mission their goal to flee to available boats which can get them safely off the island br br presented straight faced with injected doses of visual humor featuring lots of snake gags wayne crawford's snake island features plenty of different breeds of the predators in striking position ready to attack their prey star william katt as an author researching snakes for a forthcoming novel has fun in his role along with writer director co star wayne crawford as the tourist boat captain as put upon heroes who stare down a most serious crisis kate connor is crawford's attractive love interest a lawyer on vacation the other cast members serve as either tourists or crew mostly fodder for the snakes br br as in many other movies of this type director crawford features live snakes with computer generated ones and the violence is really tame crawford even incorporates the point of view technique with the camera as the eyes of the snake as it faces the potential victim with the actor looking directly into the camera never to be taken seriously the tongue in cheek approach was probably the best way to shoot snake island because the premise is just too ridiculous to accept on it's own br br the effects and suspense scenes rarely work because crawford is often unable to successfully stage the sequences where humans face off with the snakes the snake attacks themselves also never happen on screen one or two tops or are so limply presented they leave little impression that's a no no for a genre such as this fans of katt will probably want to check it out because he does provide some facial comedy that establishes the overall tone of certain scenes where he must defend himself against the snakes the cgi scenes where we see a large number of snakes in a general area aren't very effective which remove the realism crawford might've attempted to establish there are plenty of better horror films featuring snakes as the aggressors than snake island surprising moments of nudity relegated to a scene where the tourists and crew unwind after a long day with the bubbly not knowing what danger lie ahead
<START> might contain spoilers br br this is just a good movie lots of good silly stuff to laugh at however do not watch the tv version they cut to much out dom deluise is rather awesome as the mafia don who is hired to kill robin all i can say about his ten minutes it's a long drive from jersey also you gotta love them checking the script to make sure robin gets another shot also 12th century fox br br any bad stuff the rappers at the beginning and the end seem rather out dated the songs were rather lame one time while watching this movie i could think out a few more times when they could have thrown in another joke or 2 br br on the whole however an enjoyable movie experience a must watch for comedy fans
<START> after having seen this show a few times i am thoroughly offended as a female that there are so many stupid women out there that fall for this bullshit im a little more mature than some of the players in this show but am still appalled that the whole dating game has been boiled down to a gameshow where goofy dudes can score points on their lame ass attempts to pick up chicks if young guys are watching this and using it as a learning manual don't save yourself the effort and hire a prostitute if all you are after is a piece of ass maybe there are girls out there with the same mind set but some how i don't think so
<START> i took my 14 year old to see this movie we left after 15 or 20 minutes it was absolutely awful this movie should be rated r at the least i am not that strict with movies but this was just too much it was a waste of money i thought it would contain some comedy and i knew the comedy would probably be crude but this was way beyond crude i was sitting there watching and reading a certain subtitle at the beginning of the movie was what really got me and i could not believe how crudely sexual it was i could not believe that it would be ok for a 13 year old to read and see this content i don't understand how the rating system works
<START> dexter kurt russell returns from the computer wore tennis shoes for a new adventure that can stand alone dexter ever the college student prone to misadventure has an idea for a formula to render things invisible dean higgins joe flynn is less than impressed and sets his hopes for winning a lucrative science prize with the pupil studying bees however the bees sting the student and he turns out to be allergic there goes that chance for a prize but wait dexter does it he actually concocts a liquid that makes him invisible trouble is a unscrupulous businessman cesar romero learns about it and decides he can use that formula thank you for something illegal can he manage to steal the bottle out from under dexter's nose this is a companion movie to the but one need not have seen the first film to enjoy this one russell is a genial leading screw up who comes through when it really counts the rest of the cast is also a dream with flynn romero jim bacchus and others showing why their comic abilities are still held in high regard today the script is just innocent fun that is charming with the special effects somewhat simple by today's standards but effective nonetheless if you want to sit down and relive a bygone era or just want to share a quality g rated film with your family this is a great choice although it is over 30 years old there is a great possibility that even now you will see your loved ones giggle away the blues with a showing of this fine flick
<START> this movie was terrible the plot was terrible and unbelievable i cannot recommend this movie where did this movie come from this movie was not funny and wasted the talent of some great actors and actresses including gary sinise kathy bates joey lauren adams and jennifer tilly
<START> bug juice changed my life i know it sounds strange odd weird but it did i am from england bug juice never aired there but five years ago i went on vacation with my family and saw it on the disney channel once i saw this tv series i was hooked i wanted to go it took a lot of convincing to my parents to allow my brother and i to go to i have been going since i was 12 and it was my forth year this summer if you are a teenager reading this come to this camp it changes your life you make life long friends at it doesn't matter who you are or if someone at home doesn't like you everyone likes you at camp you have so much fun if you want to have a look go on to www com and check it out for yourself it is so much fun i love it there it is my home away from home
<START> this is a very low budget film set in one location in a valley shielded by the effects of radiation the cast an older man and daughter a handsome visitor a couple a tough buy and gal a drifter a donkey and a radiation affected man interact during the after effects of a nuclear blast added to this is an entity watching the women take a bath br br they all have guns some of them get shot some of them are told to have children others are murdered and others just drift away and well this is the movie harvey first film it shows a certain simplicity in movie making to avoid expensive sets actors go through curtains to enter and exit the house ie the studio the location shots filmed in the hills near hollywood are the backdrop br br i would not say this is worth going out of your way to see but interesting to see how movies with human subjects were made in the 50s
