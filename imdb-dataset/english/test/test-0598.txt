<START> i thought this movie was quite good it was on tcm turner classic movies at three am one night and its offbeat humor kept me up til five kelly performs beautifully in this role especially with the grandma whose quip almost caused me to laugh out of my seat the main actress was alright but the father was able to keep his character isolated from the marriage conflict and kept the humor coming if you like a good offbeat older movie i would recommend it unlike the other comment i do like gene kelly he was the perfect leading actor for many of the early musicals and i think in this role he oozes his charisma one drawback is the dance scenes get a little long winded but if you can get through those you're in the clear
<START> ridiculous nauseating doggerel with terrible acting ineptly superficially and condescendingly trawling all the most banal clichÃ©s about tuscany and italy divorce and midlife the main actor nervously grimaces her way through the film struggling to portray the appropriate level of smug self congratulatory self pity the worthless character and script call for i'm sure the book was bad but it can't have been this bad the camera is permanently fitted with a vomit yellow tuscan lense filter perhaps the tuscan sun wasn't tuscan enough which they forgot to remove when the scene shifts to rome and how imaginative the coast you've never seen the white marble of vittorio emmanuelle monument looking so yellow i mean tuscan one of the worst movies ever and therefore quite worth a look
<START> this is one of the finest tv movies you could ever see the acting writing and production values are top notch the performances are passionate with beverly d'angelo superb as the older woman with a teenage daughter and rob estes simply perfect as the young stud boyfriend however the best part of this film was how it showed the consequences of sexual abuse instead of going for the usual happy ending it showed that abuse can happen in good families involve good people and wreck lives it is thought provoking and entertaining congratulations to all concerned with this exceptional movie br br
<START> i felt cheated out of knowing the whole story while there could be a twist this twist was so significant that i felt betrayed i believe it could have used a better writer who could weave all the elements of the story together better the writer could have revealed more of the 'twists' throughout the movie rather than all at once at the end that aside i believe that the actors did very well with what they had particularly matt damon who actually had a little character in his character little quirks that weren't egotistic or like a smooth criminal who always knows what he is doing the other main characters were their own separate entities who just happened to converse with one another the cohesiveness of the group in ocean's eleven was gone
<START> i laughed so much when i saw this film i nearly soiled myself awful acting laughable effects super imposed explosions and dodgy slow motion fighting br br one of the worst films i've ever seen
<START> grabbed my attention on netflix instant play because it was only an hour and a half long it's nearing 4 am here and because it's norwegian which i wanted to follow up with dead snow and see what else the country is offering in international cinema right now a droll and deliciously wry romp this movie features a man andreas who gets shipped out to some purgatory of a brave new world city where everyone is happy and bland and food has no taste nothing smells and even sex loses its appeal driven to the edge by his lack of common senses he feels nearly ready to kill himself br br after an hilarious botched attempt at latter andreas tracks down a man with similar complaints and the two discover a tiny vagina shaped hole in a concrete wall from which music emanates the two attempt to break through to see what is on the other side tracking a tiny bit of light they can barely see but of course in fantasy allegory land desire and nonconformity are not allowed and the elements of the city operate to end attempt at freedom and sensuality br br jens and crew create a simple straight forward movement to the story one that flows well with its themes and moves along at just enough of a pace to keep from lagging the similarities in other similar science fiction aren't worth enumerating but still the movie has a unique feel and balances some very funny scenes with some pretty horrifying ones i like the limited but effective use of gore in this movie some disembowelment and that will get your heart stammering harder than the passion of the christ simply because it is so perfectly out of place from the gray toned mise en scene is a dependably squirrelly actor who physically feels out of place from his surroundings which works very well despite the fact that the concept itself isn't anything to write home about everyone involved makes it work and the movie fully realizes its own world br br polarisdib
<START> this movie certainly deserves to be placed within the genre of horror but not for obvious reasons the horror of a tale of two sisters lies not with sudden shocks or large helpings of cgi guts and gore it is a psychological horror movie which the viewer's curiosity from the start and builds a suspenseful aura of mystery and questions throughout best of all the ending does not provide a clear answer pushing the viewer to analyse what they have seen and make up their own mind about what really took place br br do not be put off by the seemingly slow pace at which the movie begins and don't expect to be jumping out of your seat immediately this is not the conventional hack and slash movie with orchestral stings designed to make you scared of nothing in particular a tale of two sisters slowly builds an atmosphere of terror a terror of the unknown and a fear of things which evade explanation until the very end even when the final conclusion is revealed it is not so heavy handed and obvious as to make the entire film fall neatly into place the movie requires its viewer to reflect back on what they have seen and to try and square this with the frightening revelation of the final scene some things will still be open to interpretation and this is one of the joys of watching a film such as this br br the true fear of a tale of two sisters lies not in shocks or conspicuous scares it is a psychological gut wrenching horror that defies convention and expands a genre to proportions hitherto unexplored by the traditional horror film it is no exaggeration to say that this film stands apart even from the so called 'asian horror' genre indeed it would be a mistake to align a tale of two sisters with films like ringu and the grudge this movie can be understood from a variety of standpoints some requiring no suspension of credulity others embracing the supernatural wholeheartedly br br whichever way you choose to interpret this film it is one that demands an open minded approach rewarding viewers regardless of their preconceived notions on asian cinema or horror in general
<START> i wasn't really interested in seeing step up but my friend just kept bugging and bugging me to see this film especially since she is so in love with channing tatum i tease her constantly about it saying how that's the only reason why she loved the movie but she somehow convinced me that it was a movie worth seeing that if i loved movies like dirty dancing take the lead and save the last dance that i should love step up eh what the heck i guess every movie in some way has it's right to a view br br well you know those movies i just mentioned up top dirty dancing take the lead and save the last dance well put them in a blender with some gangsta love in it and that's what you have not to mention if you've seen those movies well frankly you have seen step up because channing is lower class with street smarts who just naturally feels the music while that snobby up class girl must follow step by step how will they ever fall in love if they are so different after all this is their chance to step up to the passion the mystery and the lust of the dance br br ok that was a silly plot explanation but like i said as long as you've seen those movies i mentioned or even if you just saw the plot you get the movie i don't understand how it actually has a 5 5 rating i bet it's those channing lovers lol i'm kidding with you guys but it's all good i guess i just didn't get what others did with the passion the mystery that is the dance oh antonio where are you when we need you br br 4 10
<START> this is a really dark movie noir indeed the title character is smallpox brought into new york city unknowingly by evelyn keyes br br she is on one mission when she arrives and on a rougher one after she's spoken to her no longer innocent sister but she herself is not intentionally a killer this doesn't mean she doesn't kill it doesn't mean her presence somewhere among eight million other people doesn't throw the city into turmoil br br keyes is excellent the supporting cast is very good too there are several little known people involved in this the director included don't be put off it is a movie to be reckoned with and how nice to see a columbia picture columbia and republic turned out wonderful comedies and noirs yet we hardly ever see them anymore
<START> i watched because over the last few years michael sheen has become one of my favourite actors and if you haven't seen him in anything before firstly shame on you and secondly get your hands on a copy of either or dirty filthy love this production did not disappoint michael sheen transformed himself almost magically into kenneth williams and gave a performance that was as tragically moving as it was skillful not to take anything away from the other performances but like kenneth michael truly stole the show i don't know how he does it but every performance i have seen michael give he seems to metamorphose until the character he plays is truly utterly believable and no matter how hard i try i cannot fault him must go get my tea enjoy
<START> when i borrowed this movie i wasn't expecting a high quality performance but this was just sad br br most of the acting was so unbelievably bad that you couldn't easily get into this movie if you tried there's nothing quite like seeing a kid announce things like oh no my dad is invisible or i wonder what this does in the same monotone that one might announce traffic over the radio with there are some good actors but they are wasted on smaller parts br br the story is decent though it would be fairly easy to guess considering that there aren't too many real plot changes lots of holes too for example the dad is invisible and the inventor figures out what part is needed to make him visible again so the boy goes and steals the part from an electronics store couldn't he just ask his dad for the cash br br this shows up in the comedy category but most of the comedy in this movie was fairly dumb like the invisible dad taking off his clothes while invisible and then almost reappearing naked during a meeting or walking around with his head covered at all times funny at first but it gets old br br 2 5 because it is watchable and it's one of those movies that are funny in their own way like the monotone recitation of lines
<START> i haven't seen all cage's works by any means but his acting in this one was truly awful the other characters run the gamut of ability but having most of the emotional scenes cage's scenes are just embarrassing to watch he's certainly come a long ways in 12 years
<START> most families will recognise similarities between their own family and that created through brilliant acting by natalie portman and susan sarandon natalie creates an on screen image that justifies her as one of the best actresses in america and one worthy of a golden globe nomination the control of her emotions are so in tact that at any point in the movie she can tap into them and release an unforgettable scene susan is also amazing in this movie as yet again she chose a role that is so different to any other and carries it through with true professionalism br br any natalie fan would've seen the film based on her past successes but you should also see it for the emotions that are released during the film it is a truly humbling experience
<START> naturally sadie sucks big time i have no idea what the people were thinking about when they wrote this garbage this is not funny its not cute in any way shape or form its just disturbing and a waste of money sadie is such a bad actor i lost all my brain cells watching this show it honestly seemed that this show is forced it was such a huge over hyped pile of crap br br this show sucks br br its a waste of time and money don't bother watching this garbage the characters are so stupid and ridiculous in the first season its just dumb and stupid then when i saw the second season i just couldn't take anymore it made me want to kill charlotte arnold the second season is juts absolutely a disgrace to disney this show is also a racist piece of sh
<START> the war at home is so good it's become my new favourite show me and my carly and april watch this together every sunday and laugh at how true to life it is i love how everyone is so sarcastic and so worried and they dwell on every little issue once someone does something stupid they never live it down and that is soooo how family is the father always harps on all three kids about every little thing i love how the parents have no idea how to deal with the kids it's so true to real family life and the fact that the parents are so overwhelmed and have no clue how to solve their teenagers problems just puts the show over the top the war at home is so brutally honest and so true to the world we live in that it has become a milestone for sitcoms to come this isn't happy days or the brady bunch this is real life
