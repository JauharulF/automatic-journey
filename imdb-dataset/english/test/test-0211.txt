<START> all the right elements seemed to conspire here to make this a memorable thriller for years to come you have the stellar cast michael douglas in an uncharacteristic 'free spirit' role that pretty much launched his movie career fonda playing her typical forthright female doing her bit for womens lib and jack lemmon as assured as ever showing us a man with a crisis of confidence give them a hot button topic about big business being duplicitous and that's encouraging for a kickoff but to have life imitating art so soon after is a marketing man's dream br br the script is impressively taut intelligent but mercifully keeping the jargon to a minimum and there is a genuine sense of sustained tension brought in play by the director as our three protagonists race to beat the clock if you like 'whistle dramas then this is not quite as good as the insider but the whole thing is more than nervy enough
<START> shawn michaels vs edge 8 kind of hard to believe shawn michaels is in the opening match but still a great match by both men edge whether you like or not is a great performer in the ring and shawn michaels is just ageless when it comes to his performance the undertaker vs casket match 2 ok after a good opening match now this what a crappy match undertaker has given some great matches at the royal rumble and 1998's royal rumble against shawn michaels was the same type of match but this is way worse then that match br br kurt angle vs big show vs bradshaw triple threat wwe championship 6 it's alright i feel all three men could of given a better performance this just really didn't show them at their best br br randy orton vs triple h world heavyweight championship 9 triple h gets a clean win can you believe it sure he takes out the sledgehammer but doesn't use it randy orton did great when acting like he got a concussion but how he got the concussion is really ridiculous i really liked this match this was the best performance i've seen from hhh in forever br br the royal rumble match 7 this was highly entertaining and i usually don't score the royal rumble match this high the winner is again very predictable but just this had a lot of moments that were very entertaining to watch the segments with flair and guerrero are hilarious the best segments i've seen in a while br br overall this is a great ppv and a must own for wrestling fans
<START> i've heard a lot about the inventive camera work and direction in this movie i thought both were a mess br br also some truly terrible acting the main 'heroine' in the movie is irritating beyond belief and has absolutely nothing useful to contribute in any situation everything she does or says is stupid and she generally just seems to mess peoples lives up if she could fight i might forgive her br br overall all the women in this movie are stereotypical in need of a man to save them and all the men in this movie are muscle bound dim wits capable of saving no one br br this is a poor movie and i urge you to avoid it watch something like 'the sword of instead i hear its much better than this confusing mess of a film
<START> first i don't see how the movie is on any best list or how it won any awards compared to la pianiste which is also on a best list la pianiste is gold this movie lacked so many things on so many different levels but i can't quite explain why i disliked it so much the lead actor was annoying i felt as though i never knew what was going on and i was bored even though this was supposed to be some worthwhile life change that pierre was starting i wanted it to end as soon as possible why did it have to be his sister and cousin ugh and why did get mean he just turned mean and also was it me or did i miss the whole purpose of what that guy in black was all about who were all those people playing music in the big basement of the big warehouse why did they have all that weird equipment and the guns and all those extra rooms for people to live in i mean this in all seriousness but does incest happen a lot in french culture european culture i took 5 years of learning about the culture and i never heard anything about that
<START> this is the kind of film that i am wondering why anybody would have considered doing it from the beginning this is the kind of movie that i cannot understand how people put money in it how the rental store can put the dvd on its shelves this is the kind of movie i blame myself for having rented it br br there are good class b movies and i do not reject the genre when they are good they catch the interest with the action they have characters written well enough and acted well enough so that you can care about them the effects in some of these movies support the film in many cases and you may like them for the originality almost nothing is true in the subject and the script is at the level of cheap comics just a cliche the effects are cheap and i do not care that the film is low budget you can do a lot with low budget but you need some talent there are so many continuity and other directing errors as in ten other films you do not care for the characters you do not laugh and at the end of the film you are left wondering if the parody was intentional or not the only quality i could find is the scenery there are some good locations worth a much better film br br 2 10 on my personal scale the worst film of the year so far
<START> this is a film about a six year old child from a village in maharashtra a state in india and his grandfather who come to a city in maharashtra to treat the child's eyes here the grandfather gets to know that the child has cancer in both eyes and that they have to be removed to save the child's life the movie is all about the main characters' and their feelings and actions until the operation br br the movie is not a typical clichÃ© indian movie so dun expect to see songs or romance or melodrama this ia a supremely crafted sensitive movie which resorts to silent expressions rather than over the top dialogs to get the point thru witness the scene where the grandfather is told about the need to remove the child's eyes the acting is superb dialogs heart breaking your heart goes out for the grandfather who has the unenviable task of telling the child and his mother about the operation br br the handling of the subject has been excellent the film was made under great hardship by the director sawant who had to knock many doors to gather the rs six million approx budget even then the final product seems polished and has decent production values also witness the subtle city village contrast shown by the director by incorporating some random shots of the boy's life in the village sawant definitely seems to prefer village life br br the acting by all is excellent as the social worker is competent adding the required humane touch to her role kulkarni as the is great showing perfect mannerisms of a doctor as the child is a natural he doesn't seem to be acting everything about him is natural and does not seem forced br br but towering above all is as the grandfather he is astounding in his role mere words cannot describe his work it is a performance to cherish forever br br is a sincere effort to make good cinema it should not be ignored just for the fact that it shows that if things are kept simple the the results can be really surprising 10 10
<START> is an australian comedy drama set in the world war 2 japanese prisoner of war camp of that name the story cuts between past events and the present day when the aged veterans plan a reunion this is a much publicised and controversial miniseries here in australia the budget ran over 6 5 million dollars historians and veterans criticised it's authenticity and critics pilloried the uneasy mix of comedy and drama shades of pearl harbor series writer john doyle half of the successful roy h g comedy team has tried to defend himself with comments about the characters are of actual people the troops used comedy to cope with the situation it's only based on actual events one of our actors was actually there etc i don't have a problem with any of these points many superb fictional and factual dramas have come out of the japanese p o w camp experience king rat tenko merry christmas mr lawrence bridge on the river kwai paradise road empire of the sun blood oath and a town like alice black comedy has often been used successfully in p o w dramas life is beautiful the great escape seven beauties stalag 17 the colditz story and even hogan's heroes so why is a monumental failure the acting in is uniformly excellent the music and cinematography is good it is the writing and direction that have let it down every scene seemed to give me waves of deja vu when anthony hayes is made to stand in the blazing sun i thought didn't i see alec guinness do this in bridge on the river kwai the sudden flashes into surreal song dance brought back dennis potter's singing detective but without the finesse this borrowing happened so often it smacked of lazy writing by cut and paste rather than homage the constant intercutting between the past and present stories left me unable to concentrate on either flash forward and flash back can be a useful tool here it left me distanced from characters where intensity was called for the is overdone every conversation seemed to include stone the bloody crows such that i was saying i get the point i know they're aussies cultural stereotyping extended to the british and japanese too sadistic young japanese officer uptight british officer wiser japanese commandant fun loving rascally aussies etc i thought i was watching hogan's heroes on the river kwai after 3 episodes i'm tuning out
<START> well i notice imdb has not offered any plot info that's because it's not possible to do that without sounding vile and disgusting because that's what this movie is vile and disgusting i watched it because i am a humongous fan of chris noth whom i have met in person and he is a great guy but if i ever meet him again i will have no qualms about asking him whatever him to star in something so awful he plays a former child prodigy who is now a brilliant doctor who spends his spare time running over small children with his car with the intent of maiming and crippling them this is not a spoiler because all this is made very clear from the begining sickening enough oh it gets better he is manipulated into doing this by his incestuous sister who threatens to with hold sexual favors from him if their latest victim fails to die even clive barker couldn't write anything so hideous please if you want to see chris noth in something worthy of his talent rent teddy roosevelt and the
<START> i haven't read the book of this and based on this adaptation will not bother i hated every character in this show miranda was slutty selfish and mumbled miserably through the appalling dialogue her sister was a total wimp and this was the worst depiction of manic depression i have ever seen i have a degree in psychology and this was not accurate in fact until it was mentioned i did not realise troy was supposed to be bipolar i thought he was a normal slightly grumpy teenager br br the only saving grace in this stupid show was david tennant whose brilliantly psychotic performance was the only thing that got me to watch the second half br br clearly the writers and producers of this show have not done any research troy's mental problems are not remotely accurate nor are the forensics involved in the twist ending and if you did not spot that a mile off you are a big ole dummy br br utter garbage
<START> i love this show my girlfriend was gonna get an abortion until we both watched wonder one night luckily she killed herself before the baby was born though technically i think it was considered a murder suicide br br my first thoughts upon seeing wonder now i know what god watches when he jerks off all the time br br wonder is to television what a toaster in the bathtub is to my self esteem br br you know how george w bush makes speaking gaffes all the time tyler wouldn't tyler's good tyler cuts his nails he's tyler he's good
<START> i really enjoyed this movie and i'm not a classical music fan the story of the tough street kid discovering classical music and changing his ways was great to watch without being sentimental or too unbelievable although some details had me scratching my head frankie and his dog can live in the basement of the school without any of the students or teachers discovering him where did he eat bathe did he ever get a change of clothes what did he feed his dog the owner of the school didn't think it was important to notify the police about finding a missing boy but let him live in the basement indefinitely but we can let such unrealistic details slide and just enjoy the touching fun and slightly suspenseful for me anyway story and wonderfully talented children br br i loved the scene with the mothers standing shoulder to shoulder on the steps barring the policemen from entering the school i doubt they would get away with that nowadays and i liked the nice touch about the boy frankie stole from turning the tables on him although that never really went anywhere and frankie's friends helping him out in the end br br all in all a great movie for everyone
<START> enter the ninja 1981 was the first of several ninja films produced by cannon starring or co starring japanese sensation sho kosugi but the star of the first ninja film was legendary tough guy franco nero sadly not even mr nero or sho kosugi couldn't make this film watchable when you have two bad dudes in an action film and it's neither watchable or fun somethings amiss but i digress skip this chapter and watch the next films in the series they're more interesting and a whole lot of fun br br next is revenge of the ninja instead of playing the evil oriental i use that term tongue in cheek mind you he's the star strange for a western film watch that one instead br br not recommended except for die hard sho kosugi fans or cannon film buffs
<START> say what you will about cinema's wizard of gore herschell gordon lewis it must be conceded that from his first films trashy blood feast and massacre two thousand maniacs to his last 1972's the gore gore girls the man remained faithful to his muse gleefully chopping up the bodies of young men and women for the of the camera in gore gore for example someone has been mutilating the pasty faced and pasty clad strippers at the tops bottoms club and obnoxious ex detective gentry is hired by a hotty cub reporter to assist on the case the film features remarkably annoying and repetitive background music terrible lighting abysmal acting repugnant characters problematic sound and of course some of lewis' patented gross out scenes thus one of the strippers has her face shoved into boiling oil one has her head ripped open another has her face ironed and her cut off and still another has her bum with a meat tenderizer until her entire backside is covered with what appears to be tomato sauce i could be wrong here it might have been the film also throws out some fairly lame humor although some of the lines are pretty funny for example we learn that the real name of slain stripper suzie was ethel a bottle of acid says made in poland on it don't know why but i thought this was funny and some of strip club owner henny lines are of course amusing still this is not the movie to show to aunt ethel or sister agatha it is one of the sickest you'll ever see with only one surefire crowd pleasing moment the title card at the film's conclusion that reads we announce with pride this movie is over
<START> e elias existentialist experiment in the enduring is definitely one hell of a boring watch this is like something alexander de large was forced to watch in a clockwork orange but despite just how unwatchable this film really is it is a success br br if you are reading this and have not already seen the film then it is too late for me at least the payoff after 3 separate viewings with lots of break in between mind you was seeing the list of characters after the story was told that's when the simple message hit home but i wonder if could have told a 5 minutes story in about 30 instead of 78 br br however seeing as how the cast of credits is displayed prominently on the front page for this movie the cat is already out of the bag and you surely will only appreciate this film if you appreciate existentialist film making from the early 20th century even then you might puke br br 4 10 but i commend for crafted a piece of art even if it is unwatchable
