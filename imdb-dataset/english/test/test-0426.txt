<START> i remember this film fondly from seeing it in the theatre i recently found a copy on vhs it held up to my memory of it while obviously not a big budget film the acting is quite credible the scenery locales costumes are very well done i only wish the mammoths had been in more of the picture but when you see them they are also well done remember sfx was done in those days without benefit of computers some poor devil had to actually put all that hair fake tusks on real elephants the same effect was used on the elephants in quest for fire a better than average adventure film a chance for the star rod cameron to play something besides a cowboy which he also did very well over the years
<START> a nicely evoked 1930s setting provides much interest for a viewer in the early 21st century unfortunately london belongs to me has little else to recommend it besides lashings of quaint english charm all of the problems rest with the deeply unfocused story the main plot concerns the actions of young lad richard attenborough the problems he gets into and how the community in which he lives bands together to save him from society's laws or something the main issue here is that attenborough's character brings everything upon himself and quite frankly is guilty of almost every accusation brought against him so it's baffling why the film and all the characters have so much sympathy for him he's treated as a victim of circumstance when he really really isn't and what's more he isn't shown to have very much remorse for his actions only caring about getting away with things he didn't mean to do alastair sim gets a lot of screen time in a subplot that has absolutely nothing to do with the main plot line and you wonder what he's doing there though sim is as always superb you know there's a problem with the structure when the main plot impacts constantly against the subplot but not vice versa and following a sedate pace and a careful build up the plot completely falls apart in the last 20 minutes with a deeply unsatisfying and unexplained conclusion which doesn't even show us if attenborough's character has developed at all from the previous proceedings the film doesn't end it just stops br br the acting direction and the general feel of the film can all be commended but unfortunately the story and structure of the piece jars constantly a last point of trivia alec guinness based his performance in the vastly superior film the ladykillers on alastair performance in this film right down to both the characters having almost identical first scenes
<START> this movie is really an entertaining good clean fun movie for the kiddies kaley played by talented amanda is the sidekick to a rambunctious boy who has a hard time telling the truth he eventually works this into a movie script that gets stolen i won't bore you with the details if you have children and want to see an entertaining if not thrilling kids movie i highly recommend this one
<START> the story of the bride fair is an amusing and engaging one and it is to the filmmaker's credit that he sets out to portray rural with the same respect ordinarily reserved for coast dwellers it is weird though to find an independent movie the brainchild of a single person that is as and clichÃ© ridden as a committee hollywood potboiler br br the portrait of rural people is intended to be affectionate i think but these characters don't ring true to me i have had quite a few meals in small town diners but never overheard a debate on the merits of different nineteenth century english novelists one might suggest that writer director has no more experience with rural culture than the coen brothers and considerably less satiric verve
<START> i remember when skateboarding had it's rebirth in the 70s i begged my parents for money to by a second hand skateboard from a friend it was a piece of junk complete with clay wheels and everything i also remember reading skateboarder magazine and being both completely impressed and totally terrified of the dogtown crew skating never became a way of life for me but in some ways it has always been a part of my life whether it is using a board for transportation or just having a bunch of friends that skate br br this film is a brilliant documentary of the real birth of modern day skating watching this crew turn skating from the flat boring hobby it was into the vertical lifestyle it has become had me sitting slack jawed for 90 minutes br br it's amazing that enough footage from this period still exists to have created this film and thank god for that the footage is brilliant it gave me the feeling of watching an old buster keaton film i've seen some of the tricks keaton did repeated countless times in other films since then but when you go back and see the first person to perform that trick it's amazing that not only were they the first person to try it successfully but that they lived through it and made it seem effortless that's the feeling this film gave me yeah i've seen people skate pools before but to watch the first people skating pools and inventing the tricks that eventually became the basics of modern skating is like watching the facade of the house fall on keaton leaving him standing safely in the frame of a window it's absolutely brilliant to watch something that up until that point had never been tried before but since has been tried by almost everyone br br this film is beautiful to watch and incredible to listen to the soundtrack is one of the best i've ever heard in a film this is a film that will appeal to people whether they like skating or not i've talked to a couple of friends of mine who made their girlfriends sit through this film after heavy protest and they all said that their girlfriends were mesmerized by the end of the film and loved it as much as they did br br as for the previous comments on this board that complain about the film being too self congratulatory i think that's an unfair disparagement i liked seeing these guys get excited about their past they created something that influenced their sport and changed it forever they have the right to pat themselves on the back they were stars for doing what they loved to do most of these guys girls never achieved the staggering success tony hawk enjoys today but that kind of success wasn't available to skaters then sure they had some success but more importantly they have been able to live a life doing what they love to do and as we see in the end almost all of them still surf skate or work in the surf skate industry how many of us can say that we have been able to live our lives and have been successful by breaking all the rules and doing what we love to do they can my hat's off to the dogtown and z boys for being themselves and changing the world of skateboarding forever
<START> this documentary is the most hypnotizing film i have seen in a long while i must have had it on for an entire day the selected material included in the piece flow amazingly well and develop three characters that are impossible to ever forget the different layers of these people peel back to make an oddly moving film about perseverance loyalty and determination these characters ended up suprisingly fascinating and the film is unforgettable
<START> two popular actors are paired in showtime like de niro and murphy playing a police and an actor although they share the most screen time together they do not reach their expected performances such films like analyse this meet the parents dr doolittle and nutty professor the film starts interestingly but becomes a thin ordinary comedy which is quite disappointing it feels like especially de niro doesn't enjoy being in showtime thats a shame because he really shows his feelings thats what i think unfortunately if the idea had been used cleverly this could have been a more interesting piece of work and could be followed with a sequel like any other popular hollywood movie well i don't think there would be a sequel to this at least casting de niro and murpy again out of
<START> i first saw this movie at a saturday matinee when i was very young i thought it was cool and often thought about it well i finally it on dvd it was still very entertaining but in a different way it has to rank as one of the goofiest campiest 1950's sci fi movies it seemed filled with stock military footage the dialogue is stilted and effects are crude there is one line of dialogue that had me in stitches the line jeff morrow says while on the beach with the babe rent it if you need a movie to watch with a bunch of drunken friends it is a classic
<START> this movie was a disappointment the story is essentially the shining with a castle or a very cheap set masquerading as a castle to be specific substituting as the hotel and a monster instead of the ghosts the budget is the same you'd see from a cinemax softcore porn as is the photography sets lighting and video it was shot on the story is a failed attempt at sincerity there's no easier way to make your audience feel sympathetic for your characters than to show them experiencing emotional trauma and the trauma in this movie is pretty trite want an example a blind girl listening to a language tape teaching the italian words for colors begins to cry at what she will never see br br this movie had a few things going for it however the monster is actually pretty cool pretty scary looking and there is a pretty decent amount of nudity from herself a star of italian erotic films the gore however leaves much to be desired as does the acting even from the experienced jeffrey combs br br other than this i've only seen two other stuart gordon films re animator and from beyond both of which were outstanding but i won't let this little footnote in his career keep me from watching many more of his movies
<START> this film was okay but like most tv series it would of been better if it just made for television the best and most loved characters only had five minute roles whilst the three mediocre characters were all the way through the film br br unlike most british movies that are based on television series this film does kick off and it seems to be on to a winner but the pace suddenly stops when the three mediocre characters are in the real world waiting to capture the three comedians br br the film then doesn't go anywhere when hillary in a room with the captured steve masquerading as steve and geoff somehow writing himself in to the medieval times which made me think 'hang on how come he doesn't need a key to enter in to that world unlike the royston vasey characters the medieval scene was okay but monty python did it a lot better and of course funnier with cameos from peter kay and simon pegg both didn't say anything funny kay had a line and pegg just sat up on wall looking bored br br what also grated me was that they seem to forget what happened in the previous episodes such as hillary escaped to the caribbean in the television in series 2 but in the film he's escaped from prison and also is a paedophile vampire which wasn't mentioned at all in the movie which was also quite disturbing when he's left alone looking after the children br br there were lots of plot holes and unexplained situations such as how did geoff and the dark one escape from the medieval times back in to royston vasey like series 3 it started of good but as the film progressed it slowly went downhill and had a very weak predictable ending br br they would of been better off doing what monty python did and remade all their best and classic sketches from series 1 3 and the christmas special and turned that in to a film which would of re introduced the characters to a whole new audience who can't be asked to watch the series or to tight to buy the dvds br br best advice is save your money and wait till it's on television where it belongs
<START> the brilliant australian comic genius barry humphries had a rare failure with this uneven and occasionally distasteful comedy which was snatched back from release after only a few days drunken lecherous australian diplomat sir les patterson accidentally sets an arab potentate on fire at the un and is posted to his tiny country as punishment arriving just as a palace coup puts a new leader american soap star on the throne sir les with the reluctant help of dame edna both played by humphries almost accidentally foils a scheme by the new leader to release a deadly disgusting aids like virus on the western world joan rivers has a cameo as the female president of the united states her desk plate reading president rivers extreme bad taste mingles with slapstick and usual scathing satire in a film which is more enjoyable in it's many funny parts than taken together as a whole dame tv fans may be puzzled by the presence of a different madge sadly one who lacks emily perry's wonderful drab comedy magic in the role the film was written by humphries his third wife diane and directed by the mad max man himself george miller for die hard humphries fans like myself essential all others beware
<START> the implausibility of the plot has been noted by several commentators particularly the immense amount of trouble fr mckenna would have had to have gone to and the sheer impossibility of some of the calculations he would have had to have made including that langdon was going to decipher each clue in minutes mckenna is branded a few seconds later he is giving orders and a few minutes later he is running literally around in charge of operations in real life he would be in shock and as usual in thrillers the assassin doesn't kill the heroes giving as his only lame explanation that they were not on the list of those to be killed as though every other innocent bystander he shot was i have always used independence day as the hallmark of a truly awful film us president jet plane and beats off aliens ha ha and this effort runs it close for such an implausible film angels and demons contains a remarkable number of predictable incidents who didn't laugh knowingly when the assassin went to get his reward in the volkswagen i felt like shouting you are going to be blown up who didn't know that the heroine was going to find a body in the lab who didn't spot the baddie technically also the film was awful the dialogue was more often indecipherable than clear while the races across rome to the next church were accompanied by deafening music moreover many scenes looked like mud the one redeeming feature was the shots of rome and what looked like the vatican an achievement because i am sure that the vatican officials would not have wanted this dross shot in and around st peter's and the interiors were convincing rome is a magic place and i enjoyed seeing it fleetingly
<START> i first heard of this film from a friend she loved it and always watched it when she told me about it and said how old it was i immediately decided that i wouldn't like it i was so wrong dirty dancing was such an amazing film i love the music and the dancing i bought the soundtrack and dvd immediately after watching it patrick swayze and jennifer grey were brilliant in it they captured the emotions and feelings of the characters so well they were both such good dancers after watching the film i wished i could dance like them and i'm hopefully going to take up ballroom and latin dancing soon i've become a fan of that sort of dancing and am now hooked on all films and programs about it dirty dancing revealed my passion for dancing and music my favorite parts of the film are when baby goes into the headquarters and sees them dancing and obviously the last scene where baby and johnny dance together in front of everyone i believe that everyone must watch dirty dancing at least once in their lifetime if they don't it's their loss
<START> it wasn't until i looked at the trivia section that i found out that the original producer star of this movie tyrone power died during its making this no doubt explains why everyone on screen seems to have their minds on other things a symptom of which appears in a very early scene involving a battle that can only be described as pathetic you know when you've been painting a wall until you're completely bored well that's the sort of expression the combatants have on their face when they're swinging their swords in a highly unconvincing manner br br the plot centres on the king of israel having an affair with the queen of sheeba and his people not being happy about it you can't really blame them since there's few things more beautiful in the world than those israeli though the israeli women here all seem to look like cherie blair modern day israel is also very cosmopolitan with the majority of israelis being born outside the country but would this have been true a couple of thousand years ago where everyone speaks in european and american accents br br after much talking and a dance sequence that has to be seen to be believed and no that's not praise we have a climax where the heavily outnumbered israelis have to defend themselves against a egyptian army who can't read a map otherwise they would have known there was a canyon in front of them this is what i don't get even though their blinded by the sun the egyptians spend ten minutes charging towards the israelis never ever realising they're charging towards a gaping ravine isn't this somewhat illogical it's also something of a revealing error since the horses chariots and men falling into the canyon are obviously miniature figures br br anyway the film ends with killing his treacherous brother and praising god for his victory but who needs dayan sharon or god when you've got an idiotic enemy who can't see a ravine in front of him or waves a sword like he paints a wall
<START> the original female convict scorpion is an all time masterpiece the first sequel jailhouse 41 was not quite as good in my opinion though it's still notable for the fact that it took the idea from the original and created something in a completely different style director ito has managed to do the same thing again with this film the story is a bit different here but still he's managed to take what made the previous entries excellent and better than many films of this type and craft something fairly original around it again the action focuses on nami a k a scorpion and this time she's out of the jailhouse and not too keen on the idea of going back after escaping from pursuing police officers one thing leads to another and scorpion finds herself getting it together with a prostitute and her retarded brother the prostitute ends up getting impregnated by the retarded brother while scorpion is kidnapped and caged up by someone who she made an enemy out of in prison but scorpion doesn't like spending time behind bars and it's not long before she's back to doing what she does best br br the film gets off to a great start as we see scorpion hack the arm off a copper intent on taking her back to jail from there however the film slows down a lot and beast stable ends up being more of a drama than the previous two films that's not to say that there isn't still plenty of action scorpion still spends a lot of time in mode' and the film isn't exactly short on general sleaze once again reprises her role as the sinister title character and it's another understated almost wordless performance her screen presence is great however and she manages to have a menacing presence despite being only small physically the plot structure for this film is similar to the other two in that it all builds into a crescendo of revenge there are more people who have angered scorpion in this film than in the previous two so this section takes up a fairly large part of the film there's a few surreal sequences not as many as in the first film and nowhere near as in the second but the film stays in with the rest of the series on that point overall i would say this film is between the first two in terms of quality not as great as the original and slightly better than the second
