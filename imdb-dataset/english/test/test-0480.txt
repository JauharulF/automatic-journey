<START> this is quite possibly the worst film i have ever seen i would think you could get that from the title also there is a particular love scene that could be the strangest in the history of film i can't even remember why i saw this film or when only that is an absolutely horrible movie viewing experience on the other hand if you are looking for the absolute weirdest movie to waste two hours of your time then by all means rent it good luck finding it at your local store though i doubt this movie is in a very wide distribution and please do not show this to children by any means as it may warp their impressionable minds forever
<START> from the director of oldboy comes this slick vampire flick kang ho song stars as a priest who is accidentally changed into a vampire while being cured of a deadly mysterious virus his vampirism and priesthood are quite at conflict but he is able to survive by robbing the hospital's blood bank and unconscious patients who might not mind some blood because of his supposedly miraculous survival he comes into the lives of ha kyun shin's family shin has cancer and his mother believes that song can cure it unfortunately song's vampirism raises his levels of lust to a height where he can't help but fall for shin's young wife ok vin kim kim is intensely interested in the world of vampirism and the two become lovers the film from there goes in weird directions that i think one should experience for themselves what really should be mentioned is chan wook park's mastery of the medium of cinema my god i've rarely seen such a masterful visual artist at the peak of his powers the major flaw of the film is that it's a little incoherent especially near the beginning park is interested in telling his stories mostly in the visuals which can be difficult to follow at times but when it works man does it fly the film is also perversely hilarious the final sequence easily one of the best of the decade is simultaneously heartbreaking and delightfully ridiculous ok vin kim should become a worldwide star after this film she gives one of the best performances of the year
<START> of all the e r burroughs screen adaptations that doug mcclure starred in the 70s this is the of all it's so stagy you can taste the dust of the sets and feel the heath of the lamps above the thing looks like a very very big budget school play or indeed a very very low budget action movie which it actually is it's been said on many occasions that this was the last of the genre entries and i do hope it was the genre didn't die peacefully but in horrible agony amidst a lot of smoke fake blood and lousy sound effects peter cushing must have felt a boy again as a nutty professor whose shirt stays white as snow after the gentlemen has dragged himself through the slimy crap holes of the underworld what a sport he was to accept a part in this mishmash and carry it so bravely br br shot entirely on a sound stage and accompanied by then trendy now unbearable synthesizer soundtrack the main anti attraction of this film are the cardboard monsters yes there are always monsters like that in a burroughs adaptation but they rarely manage to be so completely ridiculous helpless or void of any credibility on a few occasions during the elevated action combat scenes where mr mcclure heroically attacks the creatures you can almost hear the empty hollow sound as his head bangs against the side of a fortunately the animals explode and go up in flames the minute they trip and fell over indeed there is a great deal of unmotivated exploding as the film and the genre draws towards the finale and lovely miss munroe loses her accent br br the triple bill currently on the market features this film plus two others the land that time forgot and the war lords of atlantis the first two are quite strong entries especially the first one with a lot of money invested and occasionally even fascinating script turns don't expect any of these qualities from this film get drunk with pals and laugh shamelessly at what you see after all the makers didn't have any shame either
<START> bad acting combats are very awful 3 4 second between each text bad music bad effect and always the same plan during the movie if you want laugh go it 2 10 for the fool laugh
<START> while i can understand some of the points made regarding the cinematography i thought a more purposeful approach would have better supported the low fi home movie feel i must say that i thought the script and acting of what alice found were excellent dean bell has crafted a real gem that judith charms with character driven delight her performance of sandra is a pleasure unfolding alternately as diabolical and romantic we are at once intrigued and repulsed by her actions and never given more information than is necessary her's and the supporting cast's efforts meet bell's post modern fairy tale with arms wide open emily grace's alice is infused with a eyed magic she seems to mold like clay before us morphing into some sort of beautiful lost beast by the end we are at odds with words as she is saying goodbye to her mother kudos also should be doled out to jane lincoln taylor whose mother provides the right amount of tragic historic weight and justin parkinson whose shy first time john sam provides one of the sweetest if not most awkward sex scenes in film bell has created a first rate story and assembled a plethora of talent to make it
<START> what could ever happen in a dull texan town in summer well a bunch of teenagers find out a few things can and do happen br br it turns out the mexican werewolf of this story is nothing less than el and the movie unlike the name would suggest is not a remake or lookalike of the american werewolf movies but something completely different br br overall for an obviously low budget movie it's not bad some clever camera work quite decent looking traditional creature and gore effects and for once not all knowing people that can and do make mistakes like shooting a colleague thinking it's the big bad beast and are baffled by things they could not possibly know br br sit down at this expecting a blockbuster million dollar production and you will turn it off in disgust after a short while sit down at this expecting a bit of entertainment and a relatively simple story and it's quite good overall it gets an 8 10 from me for being creative having ok acting and pulling off some good work for the budget this movie had
<START> being a completely broke film buff with a house to furnish i'm a big fan of ikea my whole domicile practically is packed to the brim with the cheap particle board stuff and you know how all those stylish household items at ikea have those funny names a called and a bathroom mirror called a well it just adds to the whole euro charm br br like those interestingly named but horribly translated items on the shelves at ikea i'd like to provide a bit of translation to some of the reviews i've read about the swedish made br br original comment for a low budget film this is pretty cool stuff it would be great to see what these guys could do on a hollywood budget br br translation the film stock is crappy the lighting is pedestrian the cinematography is uninteresting the sound recording is hollow br br original comment david sci fi drama set in a strange forest town with equally strange characters br br translation these actors are acting for free the storyline is circular and tiring the ideas that the flick desperately try to be existential but are simply mundane and the settings especially the interiors are dull and filled with ugly wallpaper br br original comment the editing is well done and the conservative use of computer graphics shows that compelling cgi effects don't have to come out of a hollywood studio br br translation when you've got sketchy cinematography to begin with hide the imperfections by digitizing all of it onto a mac and blending vigorously for three minutes ingenious br br i took a chance on this dvd because i'm a sucker for independent films especially those that attempt to tackle the often expensive and awe inspiring genre of science fiction i mean some of the best sci fi flicks of all time have been realized with little or no budget and actors take peter fonda's eco warning time travel flick idaho transfer for example a classic br br but doesn't fit the category of carefully crafted low key idea dependent sci fi it relentlessly focuses on characters that don't do much and don't say interesting things it goes round and round in circles it is much too long this coming from a major tarkovsky fan worse its concept of reality shifting aliens is twilight zone fodder from 40 years ago it's just not a well made film and i really wanted it to be dammit br br however being the ikea fan i am i did make one ground shattering observation first anyone who has shopped at ikea knows how their tricky shopping carts work all four wheels being the carts can spin a perfect 360 degrees and it takes some familiarity to handle them like a pro as any avid ikea shopper knows well i'll be damned but one of the lead actresses in goes to some dinky grocery store in the middle of nowhere and what is she pushing around a shopping cart so that's not an ikea invention after all but is yet another wonderful invention let's call it a for the hell of it from the land of doo
<START> i can't believe some of the comments here in the reviews the film is dated of course and from our comfortable viewpoint in the age of a lot of the special effects are deeply unconvincing now but even allowing for this helen of troy is so bad that it is almost laughable br br the scripting is awful just awful with no characterisation at all the performances suffer as a result you can see the likes of hardwicke and andrews writhing in an agony of embarrassment as they deliver the most ridiculous shallow trite codswallop lines the writers seem to feel the need to explain almost everything in a dreadful didactic screenplay that allows the viewer to decide nothing for him herself at all the beginning of the movie spells out the historical background as if no one had ever heard of ancient greece i know they had american audiences to take into consideration but the patronising way we are told everything twice to make sure we understood the action is really awful br br i honestly can't believe the comments above describing this movie as a great epic film even allowing for the comparatively primitive cinematography and the relative sophistication of today's audience this movie truly stinks
<START> the incomparable laura gemser appeared briefly in an erotic scene from the french emmanuelle 2 this amazing woman did not go unnoticed and was soon cast as the lead in this all new italian series where she is the centerpiece a beautiful photojournalist who travels the world experiencing all the mysterious eroticism that the world had to offer in this first installment mae jordan emanuelle is sent to africa to photograph the people as well as the stunning landscape and wild exotic animals much like sylvia character emanuelle has not come into her own when it comes to being open and comfortable with her own sexuality this first film is basically about how she becomes the emanuelle that most exploitation cinema fans are familiar with filled with gorgeous cinematography beautiful people and an intoxicating 70's score from the legendary nico this one is sure to please those who enjoy the more story driven style of the original french emmanuelle should definitely like this as well the main story here being an interesting cat and mouse tale of a womanizing playboy who comes to the realization that he has fallen in love with a woman who is the female version of him sexy fun and totally entertaining throughout a soap opera to be sure but one with enough skin and general eye candy to keep the male viewers entertained for some reason this is the hardest one in the series to find on dvd there has never been a legitimate dvd for this which is very strange the bootlegs that sometimes appear online will have to do until someone gives this diamond of a film a proper release
<START> this movie is one of the worse movies of all time i'm kind of upset this movie isn't on the bottom 100 it deserves a spot at least number 60 or 70 on that list this isn't just a film i think is bad in a campy fun sort of mst3k way it's just bad this is one of the few films that i really really hate freddy got fingered is in the same category of bad br br so the story in this one goes that the daughter goes to california to go to school and comes back with crawl shore and he tries to learn to be a farmer then the boyfriend tries to set shore up so that the girl will leave crawl and go back to him it ends and what's left of the audience can leave br br the main purpose of this movie is for pauly shore to mug for the camera and try to be funny but i'd say about 100 of the time he fails at that their horrible inaccurate and out of date view of farms and farming is offensive and there's nothing in this movie worth seeing if you think of seeing it don't the one time i saw the movie it felt like i was watching it for 5 or 6 hours if you've already seen it you have my sympathy
<START> i can't believe this isn't a huge cult hit perhaps people in 1968 thinking of the monkees as a silly factory made pop band rip off of the beatles refused to see it that cynicism probably covered it from sight ever since don't make this mistake head is an amazing film that most open minded people will appreciate it is very funny and very intelligent and very trippy
<START> i've been waiting since last october to see this film it was supposed to come out october '98 and now i've finally seen it i am not disappointed bloody marvellous ok it was a tad slow in the beginning but once it got going it's a very exciting nail biting tense robert carlyle is so different from either gaz in 'the full and in 'trainspotting' that it's hard to recognise him and johnny lee miller no longer with his sick boy from 'trainspotting' blond hair plays his dashing gentlemen highway man with the right about of humour and sensitivity that it is easy to see why liv rebecca falls for him a great film as hades in disney's would say two thumbs way way up
<START> a movie like this makes me appreciate the work that professional actors do i think movie goers in general are a little too hard on professional actors and are ready to bash them for the most minuscule reasons just watch a couple minutes of massacre and trust me you'll change your views a razzie would be almost a compliment for these no talent actors but then again it's a jim wynorski film wynorski is a popular director of these ultra low budget b movies having worked with roger corman on many an occasion the problem with this movie is it actually tries to develop a plot and when you have actors delivering lines like they're reading letters off an eye chart how am i supposed to care in bare wench 2 he didn't try to develop a plot he simply tried to make a softcore porn goofy takeoff on the blair witch project it was fun and it was titillating cheerleader is no fun there are a couple obligatory female nude scenes but they are few and far between so it's not even worth enjoying on an erotic level i must say the worst scene is the one where nikki fritz walks across a bridge that's about to collapse first of all her character didn't have to walk across that bridge second of all as the bridge starts creaking rather than try her best to run across she just stands there and acts helpless and top it off we don't actually see the bridge collapse because the filmmakers made this for a budget of 2 dollars unlike a lot of b horror films this one's actually boring and that's what makes it the worst of all bad movies one of the few bright spots was lunk johnson who's probably the most natural actor in the film though certainly no more than halfway decent he was funny in bare wench 2 and had some funny scenes in this movie too
<START> it is hard to judge heroes' without referring to the fact that director and script writer dan harris is only 25 you can hardly believe seeing this film which is not only a mature piece of work professional and deep but also with some of the defects of routine specific to older directors br br the setting is the american suburb too familiar from 'american beauty' or 'desperate housewives' as in 'american film turns around a suicide but here it happens at the beginning of the movie and we are left watching a mid class family coping with the death of the gifted sportsman brother and son emile hirsch plays the younger brother sigourney weaver is the mother both are excellent trying to cope with the loss to find the reason and motivation to survive harris drives his actors with a sure hand and the first two sections of the film there are four in total as the seasons of the year build a wonderful tension with credible dilemmas and real questions it is the second part of the film that disappoints slightly it looks too tired and conventional and i suspect that the producers may have interfered in the work of the young script writer and director trying to bring him closer to the hollywood convention that's how this film fails to be a somber version of 'american beauty' with a different focus i am sure however that we will hear a lot about dan harris in the coming years
<START> i had been waiting to see this movie for so long and finally got to yesterday in summary i'm glad i finally did the humor is off the wall hilarious the plot is so unbelievably believable that it has to have at least some truth for it if anything stood out in this movie it is most definitely the coffee shop scene i have been there every guy has you get dumped you find out that your ex has fooled around with some guy who you are sure is an asshole now every time you see anything for the next few days you just get horrible thoughts of this placed in all the wrong areas she is screwing everyone and everyone knows it i could probably watch that man lick and finger his wallet all day long and look back at myself and laugh for having been there too
