<START> before i start my review here is a quick lesson in australian slang which may help you with viewing the movie and understanding some of the other reviews from australia and overseas br br in australian slang thongs are a pair of rubber sandals not to be confused with the same american word that pertains to butt revealing underwear are a brand of australian short a stubby is a small can sized bottle of beer and a stubby holder is a foam for a small bottle of beer br br if you love black comedies about smalltime criminals then you will love this movie a lot of people on imdb with weak stomachs and no appreciation of dark humour have reviewed this movie which unfortunately makes this movie appear to be more mediocre than what it is a lot of reviewers have also compared it to lock stock and pulp fiction while it is the same genre it is a completely different and original style br br a lot of reviewers have also panned this movie for using heath ledger's characters dead brother to open and guide the narrative for this movie without watching the movie closely enough to realise that his brother was killed by the same villain that wishes to kill character this is explained midway through the movie but not clearly enough for most to understand br br this movie is also reminiscent of lock stock and reservoir dogs in that it is the director writers debut feature and for a debut feature it rates as well as these two movies as a matter of fact like lock stock and reservoir dogs i rate this movie as a 10 10 for a director writers debut unfortunately unlike tarantino and ritchie jordan fails to live up to expectations in his subsequent movies like ned kelly br br this movie is one that you should definitely add to your dvd collection and is one that holds up to several viewings quite easily
<START> in the universal series of modern sherlock holmes stories with basil rathbone and nigel bruce sherlock holmes and the secret is not one of the top films although it is entertaining i think the problem with it is that much of the film's dueling between holmes and his nemesis moriarty here played by lionel atwill seems to delay the actual point of the professor's work br br moriarty appears in three of the holmes films with rathbone in the adventures of sherlock holmes he was played by george zucco who gave real relish to the love of villainy for its own sake to the role for my money performance as the professor was the best of the three there is even a brief moment of comedy in his performance when he's disguised as the sergeant of police towards the end like he's preparing to sing a policeman's lot from gilbert sullivan next comes mr atwill's performance here more of that later finally there is henry intellectual moriarty in sherlock holmes and the lady in green it's a typically cool classy performance by mr daniell but his confrontations with holmes seem to be a tedious bore to him they keep him from completing the main plan in the stories that the professor pops up in he really senses holmes is a nemesis who will remain a danger as long as he is alive yet because of the intellectual tennis match between him and rathbone rathbone in his autobiography actually felt daniell was the best of the film br br if zucco captured the love of evil in the professor and daniell seemed to demonstrate the tired oxford don in the stories the professor is a well regarded mathematician whose volume on the had a european vogue and who wrote an intriguing book the dynamics of the asteroid atwill demonstrates the professor as pragmatic businessman first of all he's sold his services apparently to nazi germany this is never gone into but one presumes as this is before the nazis began to really collapse he figures they will win the war secondly he is not a fool when dr william post jr has shown he is a state of near physical collapse due to the torturing of moriarty's gang the professor decides to kidnap one of the other scientists who are assisting because he's as good a scientist as and would be able to put together the bomb site i somehow can't quite see zucco making such a sensible decision on the spot and if daniell had to make it he would seem annoyed that there is yet another delay to his plans br br by the way one trick used in all the holmes series regarding the professor is how to rid the film of him if you read the holmes stories moriarty appears as the villain three times in the memoirs of sherlock holmes' last story the adventure of the final problem in the return of sherlock holmes' first story the adventure of the empty house and the last of the four novels novellas the valley of fear it's amazing how much mileage the professor got out of so few appearances he is mentioned in two or three other stories as well in passing but because of his fate at the falls in the final problem and the empty house we always see him fall to his death zucco falls off the white tower on tower hill daniell with more imagination tries to flee gregson and the police but is shot as he jumps and wounded fails to hold on to the wall of an adjacent building atwill here it is not seen but heard seems to fall down a trap door he's planted in an escape tunnel it is really tedious after awhile to see the professor always fall in these films one turns to the gene wilder comedy admittedly a comedy sherlock holmes' smarter brother wherein leo is a wonderfully wacky and villainous moriarty complete finally with an irish accent who is not killed at the end but just left mulling in a rowboat over how his careful schemes did not work out i rather liked that better br br the use of the dancing men code here like the use of the devil's foot root in dressed to kill snags a part of a mystery from a short story the adventure of the dancing men appeared in the return of sherlock holmes and deals with a client of holmes whose wife has been getting weird blood curdling messages in this code charles higham in his biography the adventures of conan doyle suggests sir arthur may have picked up the code from a magazine game in the 1870s but we really don't know the code is basically one of letter substitutions for the figures of the dancing men the story in the short story is dramatic but deals with a triangle the only innovation in the film is that makes a slight change that confuses both holmes and moriarty br br the film will entertain but i still think the house of fear the scarlet claw and sherlock holmes faces death are better films
<START> this has got to be the worst piece of crap i have ever seen randy quaid funny as a supporting actor in the original but not as the leading too much eddie the original is a classic like the original the supporting actor carried the show ed asner was very funny he is the eddie of christmas 2 how come still looks the same after all those years and everyone else in the original looks 14 years older after 15 minutes of watching this movie i don't believe i had even laughed yet the island thing just didn't work if it wasn't for the good looking south pacific female guide on the island the movie would have been a total loss i sat on this review for a week and yes i still think the movie should never have been made lets hope there is not a third br br shawn
<START> i've seen both movies and i saw without a doubt the re make is the best i know a lot of people would disagree those who have become fans of the original will most probably not like this re make but i thought it was well thought out and definitely scary it was so good i'm going to see it again tonight the original creeped me out because they kill the children i mean who does that in movies anyway but in this one the children have at least half a chance the only bad part about this movie is when the babysitter jill walks towards the sounds she hears and runs outside into the bushes to check for someone clearly no one in their right mind would do that whilst babysitting so that is the only thing i found wrong with the movie and even so they probably had to put that in there to build suspense i don't want to give too much away for all those who have not seen it i recommend you do instead of listening to all these people saying its crap and worse than the original it would be a better movie for teenagers as it displays things that most of us are scared of but when i was in the movies there were at least 10 adults over the age of 70 in there watching it and they enjoyed it if they enjoyed it i think you will to i give it a 9 out of 10
<START> a handful of nubile young college sorority sisters decide to go camping with a professor a giant druid want to sacrifice them to prevent the apocalypse come the year 2000 they also have to contend with bikers an indian and a loch ness monster type thing worth watching for only 3 reasons george flower a sadly unsung b movie staple is on hand as a hobo and the other 2 belong to the stunning savannah in one of only 3 non porn roles she had both have very small roles too bad everything else in the movie is horrendously bad br br my grade d br br retromedia dvd extras original trailer br br eye candy 4 pairs of breasts 2 asses
<START> i saw the film in its original theatrical release in austin texas the old paramount theatre i don't know if it still exists went all out with speakers around the walls connected accurately to all six channels at 15 years of age i was blown away the concept of surround sound was completely foreign to music and film at that time br br i vividly remember at least three outstanding scenes where the surround sound made a huge impact though please forgive me if time has warped my memories with inaccuracies the first was a travel by the camera through catfish row alive with the sites and sounds of daily activity you saw each one first such as a blacksmith for example then as the camera passed them by their sound would continue to be heard passing left or right down the side of the theater to the rear the second was a marching band that was seen first in the front then it marched past the camera splitting left and right not only did the sound of each instrument follow its own directional path it also changed in timbre as it played toward you to the side of you and then away from you and if that wasn't enough they also accounted for the doppler effect for each instrument as it went by the third scene was near the end of the movie as is leaving catfish row for new york to look for bess he and about half the cast members pass by the camera as they leave the village with the same sound effects as the marching band the other half of the cast chorus sing along with them and also wave and voice goodbyes to and their other friends the friends' replies can then be heard from the sides and the rear br br surround sound was used with splendid effects throughout the movie i think i remember a rock or something thrown from a pier and hearing it land in the water behind me little things like that were evident to theater goers lucky enough to have the full six channels things that would just seem mundane in theaters without it br br i stayed in the theater for several showings you could do that then and i went back several more times before it left town i never saw the movie again it literally begs for release on dvd with restored picture fidelity and surround sound i do hope someone somewhere has preserved it please gershwin family allow it to be released before it is lost for good to other generations
<START> you don't review james bond movies you evaluate them rate them according to how well they meet expectations there are certain things one has come to expect even demand of a bond film and each individual effort either delivers or it doesn't so here are ten elements that make a bond film a bond film and even though never say never again is not technically part of the official bond filmography the mere presence of sean connery returning as 007 makes it something more than merely an honorary member of the series anyway here's how it rates on a scale of 1 to 10 br br title never say never again the clever title has no apparent link to the actual storyline but is instead an in joke reference to sean connery's vow to never play again after having been lured back once before for diamonds are forever whatever the case it is a catchy title 8 points br br pre credit teaser perhaps trying to avoid any obvious parallels to the official eon series of bond films there is no teaser the opening scenes are just shown behind the credits and even that is disappointing yet another oh no bond has been killed 4 points br br opening credits other than a screen full of tiny they didn't even bother trying to jazz up the credits with graphics or split screens or interesting camera angles 1 points br br theme song as written by michel legrand and sung by hall never say never again would make for a perfectly pleasant part of a particularly long elevator ride as a bond theme it's merely okay 6 points br br bond james bond appropriately since this film sees connery being lured back into service as bond after a decade's hiatus the story begins with 007 facing the question as to whether bond connery is still up to the job happily connery more than proves himself ready for bondage again though he is a bit sporting a bit more girth and wearing a slightly more obvious toupee he seems to have no trouble slipping back into action all in all it is one of connery's best and most relaxed turns as the character 9 points br br bond babes even in the best of the bond films the female characters aren't given much dimension they exist largely as necessary props for bond's use future oscar winner kim basinger is granted a great deal of leeway in creating her character of domino and the film benefits from this she does a nice job and she's not bad to look at either 8 points br br bond villain the reports of his death being obviously exaggerated is back at least for the moment showing he has more lives than his prized pussycat one time jesus portrayer turned stereotypical villain max von sydow isn't given a lot to do in the role but is a silky presence nonetheless but he is overshadowed by a wonderful performance by klaus maria brandauer as maximilian largo after a string of banal bond villains it is so refreshing for brandauer to gave a performance that is both subtle yet colorfully evil funny without being campy ruthless without seeming cartoonish his largo ranks right up there with goldfinger as one of bond's best villains 10 points br br bond baddies blush what can i say as played with all the bold style of a particularly flamboyant drag queen barbara carrera breezes through the film displaying a mix of self amused evil and more than a tad of pure psychotic insanity bond has crossed paths with a variety of femmes fatales most of whom have been so easily disposed of that they existed more as amusing eye candy than as characters but few dared to exhibit such a flare for the dramatic or such fierce determination even her untimely demise is spectacular even by bondian standards 10 points br br sinister plot as a remake of sorts of thunderball the film does seem a bit been there done that nuclear missiles are stolen and major real estate will go if all the countries of the world don't pay a multi dollar ransom but at least producer kevin was lucky enough to find himself forced to remake one of the weakest bond adventures by comparisons this effort blows thunderball out of the water and despite the absence of many bondian trademarks the film succeeds on its own 9 points br br production values the film starts out with an uneasy style like a tv movie trying to be more than it can but as the story progress the film gains momentum and a sense of purpose making it a superior adventure 8 points br br bonus points there are several odd changes that sets this bond film apart from the official series miss moneypenny is hardly acknowledged as played by edward fox m is a cranky old grouch with no respect for the double os a foreshadowing of how judi dench would later play the part and q suddenly has a cockney accent and is all buddy buddy with bond and there is a curious sense of nostalgia throughout the film such as replacing bond's astin martin with a vintage packard and a tango dance number that is cleverly inserted into the story and a big rescue near the end is on horseback an homage to the raiders of the lost ark which was itself a tribute to the bond films 5 points br br summary never say never again is a mixed bag in the really important areas it more than holds it own thanks to hero connery villain brandauer assassin carrera and damsel in distress basinger but the devil is in the details as seemingly unimportant as the opening credits theme song and such seem the film is lacking because of their absence it all comes off as a faux bond film a very good substitute but a substitute nonetheless br br bond o meter rating 78 points out of 100
<START> i mean nothing happens 5 dumb kids go to oklahoma to find a magical forest of marijuana this could've been fun if it hadn't been for the 5 worst actors in the world and the dialogs weren't even half an inch of fun the only thing that i almost showed my teeth of was when the dumb cops stopped the teenagers in either oklahoma or kansas the plot could have been fun had it not been for abysmal interpretation if you even think about watching this piece of crap movie don't how dumb is it that the guy gets away from the cops by telling them he's gay like his friend did just that he wasn't pretending and there's that dumb hick joke about the several meanings to the word gay i'm laughing my hair off not anyway worst movie i've ever seen
<START> i didn't know what to expect from this hugely popular and hilarious swedish comedy satire team as they released their first feature film more broad satire well we do get four contemporary exceptionally memorable tales of family pains generation gaps and fatherhood in particular but it's drama thankfully and what drama epic in its scope as each episode is from carefully picked geographically different parts of sweden but each story could seriously carry a whole movie if expanded separately br br it's dark twisted harrowing yet massively entertaining and breathtakingly executed script acting and cinematography are absolute world class as three hours seem to get by in a blink it's four shades of mastery and easily one of the best films in the nations' cinema history it's answer to short cuts or magnolia if you like and instantly on par with those br br 9 out of 10 from ozjeppe
<START> it's always a good feeling when a movie delivers the goods when you weren't expecting it the dead end kids bowery boys found themselves in a lot of uneven films and usually did better when in a support role as in angels with dirty faces here their presence as a backdrop to the story of a boxer framed for murder gives them a lot of screen time without distracting from the main action br br john garfield is light heavyweight champion johnny a hitter who's a lot different from the image he portrays to the sports world and the press when a newspaper reporter inadvertently learns that johnny's a party loving womanizer his plans to spill that information in a column is interrupted by a whiskey bottle to the head from johnny's manager doc ward robert in turn doc talks johnny's girlfriend goldie ann sheridan into running off with him to avoid the legal hassle of dealing with the reporter's death as both flee a police chase winds up in a fiery car wreck and doc's body is as johnny from the gold watch he was wearing br br claude rains adopts an edward g robinson sneer that doesn't quite work as a detective who's been reassigned to morgue detail after a bad arrest years ago his character is monty phelan and he has a pretty good hunch that the body in the car crash wasn't johnny he his boss to hand over the closed case to him and is given the assignment to get him out of town and out of the way br br meanwhile johnny looks for advice from his lawyer and winds up being screwed even worse when he gets conned for most of his ten thousand dollar savings making his way cross country johnny winds up at the date farm in arizona run by a crusty granny may robson the farm is the legacy of granny's brother a deceased priest from brooklyn and is now the home of a band of rag tag street boys the dead end kids who work the farm billy halop is the nominal leader of the boys in this one and his sister peggy gloria dickson becomes the romantic interest for johnny now going by the name of jack br br i get a kick out of the historical perspective offered in these pre war era films when johnny and the boys take a joy ride in the truck they fill up at a gas station for a 1 28 tommy halop gets the idea that a gas station on the farm would be a good way to earn some extra money and with that thought jack decides to take on a barnstorming boxer offering 500 a round to anyone who can stay in the ring with him the clichÃ©d premise is turned on it's ear somewhat when jack gets knocked out in the fifth round but by then he's earned enough to give the fruit farm a fighting chance of it's own maybe grandma should have been in the ring she just about took out everyone sitting around her at ringside as johnny jack comes around in the locker room detective phelan is on hand to take him into custody knowing that he can redeem his reputation with this collar it's a toss up as to whether phelan follows through on his arrest you'll have to watch the film to find out br br i like the dead end films where leo in charge but he doesn't have a lot to do in this one however he does a great film flam on the ticket taker at the gate of the boxing match another thought wouldn't it have been great if the ever present picture on the wall of the priest had been that of pat o'brien br br all in all this is a pretty good entry in both the john garfield and dead end kids filmography and an entertaining way to spend an hour and a half if there's one downside it's not enough screen time for pretty ann sheridan the film might have wound up even more satisfying if the roles of sheridan and gloria dickson were reversed as the on screen chemistry between peggy and jack seemed more forced than natural
<START> it didn't feel like a movie and was thankfully short under it felt more like a commercial of in computer graphics most of the special effects are great to be sure but that don't a great or even a good movie make not saying it's absolutely worthless viewing since it's possible to see what are the possibilities in cgi or gci or what ever it's called br br as i read somewhere you can't fix it in the cutting room a bad story and non directed actors can't be fixed in the cutting room or even with the most magnificent special effects things can be improved in the cutting room if they have a real director and material to work from br br however they thought this could be sold in usa is anyones idea since usa is the crooks br br and isn't it sooo typical of low budget stories they have to create an imaginative country south of mexico br br well well i it 2 just because of the special effects the rest is absolute trash
<START> i thought sliver offered the most boring and trivial trick ending in movie history but of course i was wrong i had no that this movie was going to be good unfortunately it was worse than i expected the worst part is that the obvious ending is so ridiculous and horrible that you can't believe it until it actually happens
<START> this film blew me away i thought i knew a little about the prison riot after watching this i see i knew nothing the story is told through the relationship between the attorney and the black inmate both the personal story of these two men and the unfolding courtroom drama were riveting the flashback sequences in the prison were awesome it's hard to believe it wasn't documentary footage it was so real it was not only a great piece of drama it was an incredible lesson in an important chapter in american history i'm with ebert and roeper i give it two thumbs up
<START> veteran british television director alan gibson's dracula a d 1972 qualifies as one of the least appetizing entries in the hammer studios series about bram stoker's immortal bloodsucker actually this represented the first time since terence fisher's memorable horror of dracula 1958 that christopher lee and peter cushing fought each other as mortal enemies they would reprise the same roles a few years later in the final hammer dracula the satanic rites of dracula further it was the second to last dracula for hammer in which lee performed as the infamous for the record dracula a d 1972 was the seventh hammer dracula br br the exciting prologue from prepares you for something vastly different than what the rest of this disappointing horror flick yields eternal rivals count dracula and his nemesis professor lawrence van helsing are literally at each other's throats atop a runaway carriage in london's hyde park for a vigorous opening scene that makes everything else look comparatively anticlimactic the carriage crashes and dracula emerges hugging half of a wooden wheel with its shattered embedded in his chest of course christopher lee has to grip this broken wheel against his body but the imagery is striking enough in its own way to pass muster the count expires and so does his opponent van helsing however one of dracula's disciples snatches the count's ring and scoops some of the vampire's ashes into a vial for safe keeping br br don screenplay hurtles the action ahead a hundred years to swinging london in 1972 we meet a smarmy young man johnny alucard christopher of no blade of grass who loves to raise hell with a group of hippies that crash parties and drive the british police with their antics alucard happens to be the descendant of one of dracula's servants now alucard has the count's ring and a vial of his blood alucard chooses the sight of a desecrated church to arrange a black mass he invites his trendy friends among them laura super sexy carolina munro of the spy who loved me marsha hunt and jessica van helsing stephanie beacham to attend this black mass because it offers them something different not surprisingly they resurrect the count and the evil bloodsucker sets his eyes on jessica meanwhile after laura's body is discovered drained of blood scotland yard inspector murray michael coles of doctor who and the solicits help from van helsing's modern day offspring peter cushing dracula wants to exact revenge on van helsing by taking the latter's granddaughter as his bride tracks down alucard they fight in his chelsea apartment and the young vampire drowns in a tub of water remember running water is just as lethal to vampires as sunlight and crucifix van helsing finds dracula in the deserted church with his daughter awaiting the count van helsing and dracula tangle van helsing flings holy water into dracula's face the vampire falls into an open gravesite with a stake awaiting him and he decomposes again br br the chief problem with dracula a d 1972 is that we don't get enough of lee as the count though we do get considerably more of cushing as van helsing furthermore scenarist don houghton keeps dracula confined to the ramshackle church and never allows the vampire to venture out into the city despite its low budget dracula a d 1972 could have been a lot better the scene where the contemporary van helsing has to jot down alucard and spell it backwards to get dracula seems almost laughable you'd think that he'd know about this backwards spelling trick unless you are afraid of horror movies this one will make you yawn occasionally gibson presents us with a superb close up of dracula with his bared fangs and blood shot eyes but this is about as scary as this chiller gets and that isn't saying much
<START> when a dowdy wife shearer loses her husband she decides to completely make herself over to win him back not politically correct by today's standards but still fun to watch especially the scenes with marie dressler and hopper
