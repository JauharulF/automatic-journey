<START> that this film flopped at the box office and still struggles for the recognition it deserves today is a great pity yet somehow rather appropriate the commercial suicide the monkees committed by making this film is mirrored by the metaphorical suicide they commit on screen to destroy so brutally their carefully constructed image as a wholesome american alternative to the beatles is courageous to the point of rashness as is the admission of being no more than pawns in the entertainment industry trapped in the movie literally in their own artificiality the television series was not that conventional but head is utterly plotless although in the end there is actually some kind of circular logic to it all unrestrained by a genuine storyline the surreal sequence of events is by turns hilarious and rather disturbing the greatest irony is that the monkees effectively signed their death warrant as a commercial force at a time when they were reaching their artistic peak their exploration into psychedelia reached its zenith with the soundtrack to head all the songs are memorably woven into the film which is one of the landmarks albums of the the monkees began to disintegrate after the box office failure of this movie but head serves as a noble legacy
<START> the box at my video store is why i rented this one it looked cool from the guys face axed in half so of course i had to give it a try i was pleasantly surprised when i actually watched it being an evil dead fan the swedish makers must of been fans as well as they included lots of references in this masterpiece a criminal tries to break into the house evil ed was editing the movies that ultimately drive him insane in and says groovy as he looks at his weapon quite like bruce campbell does when he finishes his chainsaw hand in evil dead 2 there is also many posters of that movie scattered around the house and office in the movie they don't just spoof evil dead as there is a gremlin style puppet monster that at ed in his refrigerator my personal favorite is when he chases his wife around the house and says i'm coming to get you barbra which in case you did'nt know is barbra's brothers main line in night of the living dead this movie pretty much has it all good plot cool characters funny stuff gremlin puppet scary stuff demon doctor excellent effects exploding head and a fair amount of female nudity i only gave it a 9 because its kind of slow before ed goes insane but its well worth the wait so if you liked evil dead 2 or any of the other movies i mentioned above you gotta rent and watch it with a and when your done try brain dead because i hear it is similiar to this masterpiece br br
<START> bottom has been my favourite sitcom ever since i saw it on t v and the movie is even better if your a bottom fan i say this is a must buy the plot is that eddie and ritchie run a hotel named guest house paradise but not all goes right for them as customers leave until a famous actress come to stay they try there best to impress her but not all well go right this is a upbringing to british cinema so buy this and you will wet yourself with laughter also starring simon shaun of the dead and also bill neigh love actually it might of not done good in the box office or by the looks of it on this website but don't listen to them buy this and i swear you will love it
<START> talk about false advertising what was this doing in the comedy section of my video rental place i think there was maybe one laughable part in the movie i can appreciate black comedy but this had only the blackness without any comedy the movie was generally disturbing and un funny yes kevin spacey was good as buddy and the rest of the cast was also good but generally the movie falls apart because we don't really see a good enough reason for guy whaley to lose his mind so badly the ending was disappointing as well what would buddy's motivation be for letting guy get away with what he did this isn't really explained at all why would buddy go for such a plan wouldn't it be more like buddy to screw guy completely by turning him over to the police the ending didn't seem to make a whole lot of sense to me no matter how i looked at it br br generally i disliked the film despite the good acting spacey essentially chews scenery for most of the film but towards the end he gives buddy a bit of needed humanity the story just wasn't as good as the cast
<START> surprisingly well acted well written movie about hard rockin' but decent young man getting that much hoped for ticket to stardom his favorite heavy metal band wants him to replace their lead singer not far fetched the film tries keeping things in perspective and doesn't go over the top it certainly makes you think twice about those lingering adolescent fantasies about being in the music business but the script despite solid dialogue follows a tried and true formulaic pattern and gets bogged down by its own clichÃ©s in the final act i enjoyed it much more than the sugary fluffball almost famous it has a nice bitter edge to go with its heavy metal decadence but a stronger finish might've made it more memorable 1 2 from
<START> hehehe this was one of the best funny road movies ever i laughed so i fell out of the chair with many norwegian and foreign celebrities playing themselves harald is the producer known for films like agent cody banks and of course one night at br br it is about norwegian crazy fans going to the world cup in soccer in germany 2006 and all sort of crazy fun that comes with it it was hilarious i couldn't stop laughing i haven't had so much fun in ages rumors say it will come a number two but i do not know it will be hard beating this one br br recommended to everyone it is a must see film i was suppose to see it at the cinema but i had work at the times it where shown and been trying to rent it for a month but all the time rented out got it today on dvd well worth it
<START> i was waiting to welcome arnold return to action after the dismal movies he'd made after eraser end of days however can be added to the dismal films he's had the misfortune of appearing in br br end of days starts well with a gripping action sequence yet quickly becomes a bore taking the focus off action and suspense and instead concentrating on the investigation of demonic happenings and the quickly approaching millenium read doomsday br br performances are stale special effects so so and gore plentiful considering myself a die hard schwarzenegger fan i couldn't believe i didn't like this film but with such an awful lame script what could arnie have done besides passed on this turkey br br 3 out of 10 br br
<START> i think homegrown is a bit of a misnomer for this movie more like plantation grown but it doesn't have quite the same ring to it my guide described it a comedy but the pathetic travails of these hapless buffoons is not my idea of a belly laugh more in the genre of the farcical thriller drama the characters developed well enough an all star cast made it oh so promising just a shame the plot was patently absurd ted danson provided a fine cameo as did jamie lee curtis in her walk on part jon bon jovi has this amazing ability to measure content in the front seat of his car i guess if you imbibe a few beforehand you should be able to sit through this one not for the gun shy paranoid types though
<START> especially if you love horrible movies when i first started watching it all i could say was i hope there's a dance sequence in it imagine my delight when not only did the two main characters dance but the main ghost began break dancing as well and on top of that sherman hemsley sings the break dance song not to mention the theme song it makes me a little sad that he went broke because of this movie but i've never liked him as an actor and he really should have known better not even the director would take credit for this movie and you should check out some of the other films he directed br br one note of warning though the writer seemed to really like jokes about the um male lower regions for example one of the characters discovers a book called groins of the darker species i am not kidding and that to me is the most disturbing part of the film other than that find the most obscure video rental store in your town get the movie invite all your friends over and laugh until you cry with ghost fever
<START> i remember reading the original balzac story in college french br br i remember ken of tv in chicago reading it as one of his late night shows br br always loved the story but never believe they could or would make a movie of it to my surprise they did and did it very well br br few of any balzac stories lend themselves to dramatization which is unfortunate and cat lover that i am i was always hoping it would be filmed without a lot of hollywood up this is as close to perfect conversion as could be done br br the theater of the mind is always better than what the eye can see but this is as close as i think it can come to letting the imagination of reading meet the reality of seeing
<START> ruthless evil warlord superbly played to the hateful hilt by cruelly mistreats the peaceful residents of a small village the giant stone statue majin eventually comes to life to destroy and his wicked minions director and screenwriter tetsuro yoshida give the compelling story all the power and simplicity of an ancient age old legendary there's a very strong sense of an ancient time and faraway remote place it's specifically set in feudal japan the good guys are noble and appealing while the villains are truly nasty and detestable the occasional stirring swordfights are staged with considerable skill and gusto the special effects are fine and impressive the serious tone and steady pace never falter for a minute and last reel rampage of savage destruction is extremely lively exciting and more than a little scary moreover the fantastic elements of the narrative are given substantial credibility by being firmly grounded in a throughly believable dark harsh and gritty world this film earns bonus points for depicting majin as more of a brutal and frightening force of angry vengeance instead of a pure spirit of absolute good veteran composer akira supplies a typically rich robust and rousing score morita's sharp moody cinematography likewise hits the bull's eye the capable cast all give admirably sound and sincere performances with especially praiseworthy work by jun as the valiant protective and endo as mean henchman highly recommended
<START> if you ever visited acres as a child and wondered could there be a worse vacation spot in the world well you could have watched this movie and had your answer flavia a k a dude ranch is often frequented by business casual gordon at least since resident water witch jessica was 13 but jessica can find much more than fresh spring water with that rod Â buried tray shure lost jewelry dead bodies even a talisman that will keep her from dressing like a slut and raising drinks with a phony beat and a suzanne pleshette look alike while hypnotized by a disembodied head evil evil evil
<START> this show is the worst show ever norris and his family write it produce it direct it etc etc the only reason i ever see it is because my goofy wife likes it how many times can norris fly though the air from plain sight to land a kick on an obviously blind villain no trees no building just whoosh thin air he always solves the case or is the best at whatever skill there is no co star ever gets the glory its all norris its truly apparent that norris is awful stuck on himself and will not allow anyone to one up him in any scene no matter what the content terrible acting terrible script terrible series
<START> i work at memorial hermann hospital tmc and was also working at texas children's hospital women's hospital and west houston during allison first the shots of the hospital are sadly suburban the texas medical center has a daytime population density similar to wall street there are huge skyscraper professional buildings and hospitals tch was the largest children's hospital before it doubled in size twice methodist with its 1500 beds is one of the largest hospital in world the texas medical center skyline is bigger than that of memphis yet the best pics hollywood could muster are that of some dinky hospital in the middle of nowhere besides the real pic of the hospital taken decades ago also they combined several real life characters and portrayed them all in one super nurse i actually know the medical technologist s working in the blood bank two where actually working at the time but the movie shows only one pregnant mt there was a pregnant mt and another mt that took the precious patient research for more info i will not mention their names privacy there was no nurse in the real life lab scene hollywood combined these two most likely to save time and money in the movie military helicopters true had to transfer the our babies and to all the way to galveston why you may ask when we have the largest children's hospital just down the street because texas children's hospital refused to take them you read right they refused being employed by them i was ashamed needless to say i'm no longer affiliated with that facility any other comments would be repetitive to the ones already posted by the people that who actually live here or lived through the experience
<START> if you love drive in cheeze from the early '70s you will just love this one how could you go wrong with a low budget film about bloodshed in a lunatic asylum you can't crazy folks and sharp objects are always an entertaining combination br br the film looks like it was shot inside someone's house for about 65 for me that just ads to the fun of watching this type of stuff the gore is a bit mild compared to others of this ilk but there is enough to keep us bloodthirsty sickos like myself happy some horror films drag in parts and leave you waiting for something to happen that's not the case here the characters are entertaining enough to make every frame quite enjoyable there is never a dull moment from start to finish the mind melting climax at the end that is just unbelievable i liked it so much that right after the end credits i watched it a second time it's an absolute must see for any self respecting drive in horror nut br br 9 5 10 on the drive in freak o meter required viewing br br yea i love you i do love you now take your thorazine and put your clothes back on please 8
