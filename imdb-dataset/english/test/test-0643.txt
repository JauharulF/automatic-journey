<START> this movie is not realistic at all more of a comedy than a serious war film very old fashioned too maybe i was just expecting it to be on a same level with platoon i wonder why 50 of the voters gave it 10 something must be wrong
<START> i know my summary sounds very harsh but this film has very limited appeal the average joe out there would have a hard time sticking with this film the entire film consists of animated loggers doing their jobs and dancing on floating logs this is all done with very splashy and artsy colors and the film might be great to show to patrons in an art museum however unless you really love this sort of art or are a canadian who loves films about your native land then this is probably going to be next to impossible to finish i have a rather high tolerance for this sort of thing and even i had to force myself to watch after a couple minutes i can respect the work that went into it but it's just not compelling
<START> i just watched this movie on it's premier night out of curiosity and sheer nostalgia i liked not loved mork mindy as a kid mostly for robin william's zany energetic performance this movie made me remember why was the original show great not really but robin certainly was which brings me to this movie br br i was pleasantly surprised expecting nothing more than a paint by numbers chronological retelling of the show which in a way it was but of course the real focus was on robin it was interesting to see robin's journey from struggling street jester to national t v star and how such a drastic difference affected him and his long suffering wife and my hat is off to star chris as he portrayed mr williams with integrity sensitivity and heart not just a cute impression although it was even dead on on an unrelated note i noticed that robin's struggles were in some ways similar to andy kaufman who was under appreciated by network t v and held back creatively but that's the taxi behind the scenes biopic br br all in all this was a very enjoyable flick in which i felt i got to know a little more of the man behind the the acting was solid by all never melodramatic like i suspected and the story moved along well performances that were particularly good were by those who played garry marshall and john belushi the scene in which belushi robin was a hoot not a great masterpiece by any means i would have liked to have seen a tad more about pam but definitely watchable especially for those robin williams and mork mindy fans out there
<START> i don't watch very many 'horror' movies but one night i sat down and watched this with my cousins now we're teenagers so we tend to make fun of a lot of things but honestly the acting here really wasn't very good especially at the beginning one line that stood out was when scarlett says to jill and tiffany this is so high school while the next scene shows jill walking past a sign with their high school name on it many parts at the beginning reminded me of a corny badly written badly acted lizzie mcguire episode however as the story progressed and the cast moved on to just about only jill most of the time i was able to appreciate the movie more camilla belle did really well in this movie and i think that the other actors and actresses ruined the movie for her and i must admit this was one of the scariest movies i've ever seen well no there weren't big monsters and white faces appearing in dark corners and possessed dolls but the thing that made this movie scarier than ones containing those things is that it really could happen and this movie really reminded me of what really is scary we all know we're not likely to stumble upon the living dead any time in our lives but the idea of having a murderer inside the house you're babysitting at could really happen the only flaw with this movie is that it's one of the most clichÃ© movies i've ever seen it has everything in it that any horror movie has ever had turning the keys and the car starts shadows in the corner turning the corners of the stairs with suspense turning around and seeing a dead body ending a fatal scene quickly with waking up from a dream etc at the suspenseful scenes it was very predictable but overall i would give it a 7 10 it's definitely worth seeing br br by the way this is my first review so i don't know if any of those things were spoilers but just to be safe
<START> this movie was horrid and at the end made me wonder why someone went to the trouble to make it now it was not all bad i have studied film and this film was put together very nicely and had very good cinematic everything with interesting angles to very nice lighting and excellent camera work i wish i could have seen it back in school because it would have made a good film to write a paper on but since i have graduated and lost most of my film pretentiousness i have realized that a film should be entertaining above all this movie was long and boring and i'm not sure when it finally got to the point that it was worth my time br br
<START> the sun was not shining it was too wet to play so i went to the movies that cold cold wet date day br br the cat in the hat was the name of the flick and when it was over my stomach was sick br br mike myers played the cat his humor was lame and kids needn't see this the humor was not tame br br the film was like drinking milk from a rabid cow so it is fun to have fun yet the filmmakers didn't know how br br this film in short is atrocious the acting was bad the plot was tweaked too much and the humor was surprisingly very crude br br it starts with conrad and sally a rule breaker and a future sheriff when their mother has to go to work she gets mrs kwan to babysit possibly the lone funny part in the movie is when mrs kwan is watching a taiwanese court room a la c span she soon falls asleep and here comes the cat br br the film starts to spiral out of control the cat came to try to let the kids have some fun he's got thing 1 and thing 2 who suddenly start trashing the house he improvises a tv infomercial and accidentally slices his tail off and when the cat goes full carmen miranda it's not funny possibly his only funny disguise is as a hippie activist and there's a fish who tries warning the kids about the cat br br too bad he didn't warn us this film was as much fun as sour milk or chopping your tail off br br soon the kids are outside looking for the family dog who has the key to a crate on his collar if the crate is not locked soon their house will be home to the cat's universe here it gets a little more interesting but not enough to save the film br br the acting overall is horrible mike meyers brings his brand of irreverent austin powers humor to the cat saying things like you dirty ho and imagining himself as a woman for the rest of his life after a whack in the testicles while posing as a pinata spencer breslin is great as the trouble making conrad and dakota fanning is cute as sally though they alone are not enough to save this horrendous aortic dissection waiting to kill john ritter accident waiting to happen alec baldwin's slick and slimey lawrence quinn is disgusting ever trying to woo the kids mom who is played by kelly preston and sean hayes is mr humberfloob mom's boss and is also the voice of the fish the latter three are also bland br br overall if i were a parent i would not take my kids who are into potty humor cause there's plenty of it and more save your 7 00 and see something else as the late great dr seuss once said br br it is fun to have fun but you have to know how really universal stop theodore's already turning over in his grave br br like my mom always says curiousity killed the cat the cat in the hat out of
<START> considering that they wanted to do a vampire movie in space i thought well it'll probably be pretty cheesy but at least interesting enough to see a different take on the whole genre whoops i don't care what kind of movies you like even if you're the biggest vampire horror thriller or suspense fan in the world or adversely if you've never seen a horror movie before and would expect that your first would be impressive in any way whatsoever you're wrong i don't think i've ever seen a made for tv movie or after school special this bad i've never seen a tv pilot show this bad i've never seen footage of animals sleeping or that's as bad as this this is by far the single biggest waste of hours you could otherwise spend contemplating the importance of dish towels and their effect on your life i would far rather be trapped in a bathroom for weeks with nothing to consume but my own urine and excrement than watch even a single clip of this movie again watching this made me wish for the fates that the characters fell to instead of dealing with knowing that i paid money to watch it it was however like a train wreck so bad you just couldn't help but watch hoping something good might happen it didn't please for the love of god if you or your friends even if using illicit substances while doing so even consider watching this movie choose instead to have a contest to see who can shoot a snot rocket farther it will bring you far greater enjoyment and entertainment
<START> a town in japan is being taken over by a horribly brutal abstract shape the spiral it's becoming a theme in everything from animals to clouds to people and twisting them mentally and literally this film shows it happening to several groups of people some demonic possession is implied but nothing is entirely sure except that the best bet is to get the heck out of dodge the film progresses really well from normal life to abnormal phenomena giant snails and crazy people to the truly supernatural walking dead br br as a jaded american horror movie fan this was just what i needed maybe it was just the novelty of a different culture's film but it seemed to have a very original progression set of characters and the premise was definitely new the japanese may think horror shapes means spiral i'm told are old by now but it was nice for me because i'm used to monster alien virus disaster undead films in an american movie you know who's going to die the annoying nasty lascivious racist characters and who will live the children heroine dogs cats nice guy that's not true in japanese horror it was not predictable how they would fight the evil or how it would end up also it had this really new but probably typically japanese color pacific northwest style cloudy day thing going which was a fresh visual effect for me the horrific moments were seriously creepy relying on a little gore but mainly just impossibly overdone facial expressions think the ring and body manipulations this should be one of the greats up there with once original ideas like the first nightmare on elm street or night of the living dead
<START> i did a screen test and read the script for this turkey in 1988 it was awful then and even worse now i spotted it on vhs at the local video and said oh what the hey for auld ang sine yech br br they had to shoot most of it in mexico after they ran out of money a couple of the stars pitched bitches because they ran out of some kind of exotic fruit drink crap the movie's plot is ok i suppose but i happen to know that the writer intended for it to have a spy catcher thread running throughout br br dr o ended up being a cartoon character he must still be whirling in his grave over in the kremlin wall br br technical errors were all over the movie not only with the infant atomic technology but with the uniforms insignia and military jargon they were too cheap to hire a professional military adviser of course even mr newman's august and expert presence couldn't have saved this bird from being stuffed for thanksgiving
<START> in the era of the farrelly brothers and the jackass series to have a movie made and performed by americans come out that is well paced and full of charm as well as hilarity is well nigh miraculous this ensemble has been behind some other efforts most recently a mighty wind which was so subtle it seemed to be an actual documentary without the overlay of entertainment but best in show hits on all cylinders it is superbly cast with some of the best of current us actors parker posey who exudes energy even when she stands still eugene levy as tolerant everyman who is nobody's doormat even when he appears to be or maybe the brilliant stylings of fred willard the understated performances of so many others which is a characteristic not normally associated with americans or american actors one of the few humorous movies i can watch again and again
<START> patricia arquette plays american doctor laura bowman who takes a holiday to burma in an attempt to heal her spirit after the murders of her husband and young son she is left behind in during a military crackdown and leaves the city with an aging man who works as a tour guide but he is no simple tour guide he is a professor who introduces her to the life outside of the tourist traps the two of them get caught up in the political upheaval and laura sees with her own eyes how the government betrays and oppresses its own people br br this movie is one of my favorites because of its themes first it's informational describing some of the injustices that are occurring in burma secondly it's about a woman's struggle to find meaning in life after an incredible loss thirdly it's about compassion and sacrifice and people coming together without even knowing each other to endure pain and fear br br just about every beautiful scene in this movie is important nothing is wasted here it's an earnest and moving film there is also a very emotional score composed by hans zimmer which complements scenes nicely br br a definite recommend especially to people concerned with human rights and people who want to know what purpose can i serve br br
<START> i really enjoyed north and south very much i think it is one of the best and most lavish television series i have ever seen the calibre of the cast is amazing you have actors from the golden age of cinema people like james stewart gene kelly elizabeth taylor robert mitchum and jean simmons with other actors who were the new faces of the 80's like patrick swayze james read jonathan frakes genie francis philip casnoff and lesley anne down br br at the heart of the story is the friendship of two completely different men there is orry main patrick swayze who is from the south and george hazard james read who is from the north throughout the series their friendship is continually threatened with the differences in their backgrounds particularly about the treatment of slaves in the south especially at plantation but when each needs the other they will forget the arguments and go and help their friend i really liked the chemistry between the two men and was really interested to see if their friendship could survive the war br br i liked how the series showed what life was like before the war so the audience could see what were the factors that lead up to the war what was going on at the time then the devastation of a nation that was being torn apart and then the nation having to rebuild the country again the war scenes were very well choreographed and very realistic to me br br i think what is great about it is it has so many elements running through it romance history battles that would interest most of the audience there is something for everyone i particularly enjoyed the romance between brett genie francis and billy parker stevenson john stockwell especially when she stood up to her sister ashton for the first time the other romances were interesting as there were not all the same each had something different to the others which kept me watching particularly the madeline and orry story strand to see if they would be together in the end br br it is one of the best american mini series that i have watched the story had the right balance of romance and the more serious history side that was happening in the country at the time but it is paced just right the characters are very watchable and the locations are beautiful and the music particularly at the start and end of the episode is so toe tapping good and works with the mood of the story
<START> well this is new famous italian horror director lucio fulci shoots a film about a famous italian horror director called lucio fulci after years and years of witnessing gruesome horror sequences it becomes hard for lucio to separate reality from fiction and he often hallucinates about committing violent murders he quickly descends further into a seemly endless spiral of madness and venom even the dedicated psychiatrist can't seem to keep fulci on the right track now when it comes to pure fun and entertainment value cat in the brain certainly is one of fulci's most pleasant films the gore is overpowering and copious to say the least the amount of filthy massacres is impossible to describe especially when you manage to get your hands on the fully uncut version referred to with the aka nightmare concert decapitations all around victims ' intestines are spread on all sides of the screen and the chainsaws are working overtime the film also becomes unintentionally funny quite soon since it's so exaggerated and a perfect experience to watch with a group of friends when there's beer in the fridge of course from a more professional viewpoint this production can't exactly be called a masterpiece there's not the least bit of tension or atmosphere to detect and the characters are completely empty headed in order to make more room for the gore characters are just being introduced for 5 seconds and subsequently die a horrible death especially compared with fulci's highlights like the beyond or don't torture a duckling this film looks like a quickly warmed up snack the best way to interpret cat in the brain is like a personal statement made by fulci and a direct attack towards censorship perhaps after seeing so many of his films Â especially the latter ones Â being cut by censorship committees and bashed by pseudo artistic critics he wanted to avenge himself by delivering a gory mess that simply can't be cut if you take out all the explicit violence and the truly sick make up effects you only got about 10 minutes of footage left especially because the insane killings re occur later in the film as fulci hallucinates about them again you can almost hear our director think stuff like let's see how you're going to censor this now even the entire development of the murder investigation happens in the background are the victims missed by any of their friends or relatives are there any police officers looking for clues that'll lead them to the killer you don't know and lucio doesn't bother to inform you about that because that would lead to sequences that don't require cutting oh and it's pretty damn pretentious as well the name mr fulci or even lucio is mentioned every 3 minutes 34 times throughout the entire movie to be exact and our director clearly enjoys being in the spotlights for a change hey i certainly don't blame him after over 30 years of delivering amusing movies he deserved to have a little extra fun you're a god mr fulci
<START> i thought this movie was great not only because of it's storyline but because it was portrayed greatly by the excellent cast i read that drew barrymore wasn't exceptional as josie geller because she is beautiful yes she maybe but in the movie she played outside herself which brought on a plain girl searching for who she is in the world the story is sweet and definitely for the hopeless romantics out there i for sure am david arquette is mad as her brother rob and michael vartan is gorgeous as sam coulson leelee sobieski did an excellent job as her mate someone who wasn't afraid to be herself i think this movie should get more credit rather than being branded as a teeny flick
<START> beautiful that one word pretty much sums up this whole film everything from the cinematography the directing the acting brilliant at any point of the film you can pause it and you will no doubt be looking at something mosaic or artsy fartsy as some people would say i assure you that after one viewing will be stuck in your head i know this from first hand experience even the soundtrack is great it goes together very well with the tone and pace of the film be thankful that cam archer exists in this world we need more people like him to make films that show love and shame in totally real and surreal imagery
