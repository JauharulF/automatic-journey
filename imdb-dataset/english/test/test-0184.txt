<START> i had to suffer through this movie three times while i was a zombie extra in the director's new movie after sundown the first time that i saw this movie the director was standing next to me and a clearly fake and cheesy looking hand popped out of nowhere and grabbed one of the characters i could not take it any more i busted out laughing right in front of the guy the movie has no direction whatsoever and the one thing that could make this movie decent female nudity was nowhere to be found i am a fan of low budget horror movies but this was just too much for me the worst part was that i had to watch it so many times also do not expect the new movie to be any better
<START> this unintentionally amusing mid 80s tv movie is based on the premise that sex bomb donna mills in a mostly appalling wardrobe throughout is a neglected housewife pining for her sexy past as a cheerleader she escapes her empty life by fantasising about random sexual encounters with one of the many attractive men she comes across finally giving into her fantasies and indulging in a bit on the side although all she really wants is to reignite the flames of passion with her boring husband james brolin br br there are many laughable aspects to this film mills' first foray into co producing later following her departure from knots landing she found great success as a trashy tv movie queen starring in mostly issue of the week melodramas through most of the '90s she usually played a victim of some sort clearly determined to wash her hands of the wonderfully wicked and entertaining she played for so long on knots funniest are the drawn out fantasy sequences filmed as though they are meant to be soft core porn wind and smoke machines backlighting porno music but as this is a network tv movie the scenes are all very chaste and ultimately not very sexy at all the most amusing and bizarre scene has mills taking a walk on the wild side downtown among the spiky haired punks complete with robert palmer soundtrack br br less laughable is the dreadful dialogue that the cardboard characters are forced to utter pity poor cicely tyson as the mandatory psycho analyst or veronica cartwright as the mandatory best friend or even pre babs james brolin with that daytime soap style of clenched fist anger br br of course as in all of these sorts of films we learn that all problems can be solved through psycho therapy and then the film just becomes silly as we explore briefly the reasons for mills' shocking behaviour as if it can't just be that she wants a good shag br br vacuous
<START> i found this movie at the flea market for cheap i was so psyched because i thought it was a skateboarding movie i got home put it on the previews rules and the opening scene with the old guy rolling down the street on the skateboard was awesome at that moment i realized it was a post apocalyptic movie but i still had high hopes for it this movie was awful a friend of mine was stoned out of his mind when we watched it and even he thought it was horrible and a waste of being high i kept falling asleep during the movie because it was so boring and the music was utterly awful i don't know if during the apocalypse all the good music and all the music that is only kind of crappy is destroyed and everyones memory of how to play it is wiped clean but i think i would rather die than have to endure that crap also what the hell was up with the tv studio i can only assume that this movie was adapted from an old greek play with the names and title but some plays are not meant to be adapted into a futuristic sci fi setting or at least not by the people who were involved with this movie if you are forced to watch this movie i can only suggest bringing a hand gun and finishing yourself off before the end it would be a good movie to kill yourself too everyone will understand why
<START> jack black and kyle gass team together to promote their band tenacious d in this rock classic called tenacious d in the pick of destiny jack black and kyle gass invent their own rock opera it was like an opera of rock 'n' roll some of the most twisted events took place in that movie the big foot part the mushroom part and in the end when they did the rock off against the devil a classic formed in tenacious d one of the best films i have seen in a long time the last couple things i saw in the theater were stupid but this movie rocks this really made me laugh hard the whole basis is jack black runs of to find his rock partner in los angeles his partner is kyle gass and man who has always been bald they work together to find this magic pick that can make the most terrible musician play greatly they finally make it to the rock 'n' roll museum and steal the pick on the way they meet the stranger played by tim robbins they make it to the club to win their prize money when the owner grabs the pick and all along he was the devil and he battles the d in a rock off the d doesn't win but the devil's horn falls off sending him back to hell therefore long live the d
<START> if you need a clue as to whether is decent or not look to its star colin firth who refers to it in an interview as absolute rubbish i sincerely hope no one ever sees it br br the script and plot are ludicrous the female lead is unconvincing the only thing worthwhile is colin firth and he seems slightly embarrassed throughout br br for diehard firth fans only the shower scene alone is worth the 3 99 you might have to shell out should you find it in a video cutout bin like i did br br i'm happy for mr firth that his days of taking projects like this one are over
<START> contains spoiler the movie is a good action comedy but i don't know if the director cut too many parts but it seems that the bad guy die too fast the end of the movie come the bad guy dies and that's it br br the special effects are good and i don't regret paying to see it at the theatre
<START> sitting in a big wing chair with a huge book in his lap the one and only bela lugosi looks into the camera and in a dreadful vocal delivery that sounds as if he were mocking a reading of shakespeare intones sloooow ly man's constant groping of things unknown drawing from the endless reaches of time brings to light many startling things snicker startling because they seem new lugosi's eyes now bulging with raised eyebrows and mouth sneering he continues but most are not new the signs of the ages cue a visual of lightening accompanied by the sound of thunder which then continues to rumble for an astonishing 86 seconds br br and so begins what is arguably the worst film ever made this movie almost defies description told in semi docudrama style with an unseen narrator explaining the plot such as it is the story revolves around the vicissitudes of a man named glen ed wood jr who cross dresses hence the reference to glenda the film has no real structure instead it consists mostly of a random assortment of vignettes that may or may not relate to glen or to the cross dressing motif one long sequence consists of some unknown woman wriggling on a sofa followed by a man whipping a woman in what we would today refer to as s m br br then at odd moments bela reappears for no apparent reason and babbles more inane dialogue like when he's wrong because he does right and when he's right because he does wrong pull the string dance to that huh br br about twenty percent of the film's visuals consist of stock footage accompanied by a vo that relates to the story motif but not the visuals hence we see stock footage of bustling city streets freeway traffic a thunderous herd of buffalo and a playground full of kids but it gets worse in a film about cross dressing we have 58 consecutive seconds of stock footage of a furnace making hot steel and 84 consecutive seconds of battle scenes from wwii br br even the simplest items are botched in one scene we see a newspaper headline that reads man nabbed dressed as girl underneath the headline which has clearly been glued or pasted on the article is about taxes in one of my favorite scenes an off screen woman spouts out airplanes why it's against the creator's will in a voice that sounds like she's just inhaled helium br br except for the performance of lyle talbot the acting is uniformly horrendous production design is cheap looking and drab but you gotta love that tacky wallpaper the editing is sloppy most of the background music is suitable only for 1950 style elevators the b w cinematography has way too much contrast and the costumes look like something that came from a thrift store br br this film is so bad it makes plan 9 from outer space look like citizen kane by comparison i just don't know how one could make a film any worse than ed wood's glen or glenda but thankfully it's got bela lugosi in it every time he opened his mouth and gazed into the camera with those big bulging eyes i about fell on the floor laughing
<START> dragon ma jackie chan is back having rid the seas of the dreaded pirate lo back on land he is assigned to the police force where he is to clean up corruption and crime in a local suburb along the way he is caught up in the fate of several chinese patriots attempting to secure sympathy and support for their revolutionary cause the chinese manchu government is after these revolutionaries and anyone that stands in their way is in trouble even if they are in the police force i had big expectations for this movie after i saw project a but sadly i was a little disappointed there is just too little action compared to the first film there is just one good fight scene until the big ending that fight scene is in the gangsters place and its good a lot of people flying all over the place and hard kicks and punches are throw jackie chan and his stunt team don't disappoint here at all the ending is very entertaining jackie chan shows us why he is the best stuntman in the world really exciting stuff the only bad thing with the ending is that the fights are too short and forgettable conclusion many funny moments good acting and crazy stunts but not enough fighting for a top rating
<START> hulk hogan plays rip a professional wrestler who has a big heart but is pushed to the limit when his girlfriend joan is kidnapped by thugs who are forcing him to take on another wrestler tiny lister jr bottom of the barrel actioner is such a failure that even hogan looks ashamed to be in it and with the evidence portrayed he should be
<START> 4 out of 10 br br this film was neither funny as a whole nor was it even worthing investing any kind of emotion into the characters eugene levy is probably the most funny the rest of the cast do their jobs but the story never really gets very deep and there are a lot of holes in the plot that never get filled this just wasn't very much fun despite being funny at times br br
<START> this really is a cringe making exercise dressed up as a tribute to fire fighters it contain stupid scenes of we're just a bunch of wacky guys in the midst of the my goodness this can be really dangerous parts mostly it is just plain dumb you couldn't believe for a single minute that real fire fighters act like this it is so awful i couldn't bear to watch at times if my daughter hadn't rented it and then insisted on seeing it through to the end i would have had no option but to turn it off br br thing is i'm a john travolta fan every interview of his i've seen just raises my opinion of him i think this was one strictly for the money i'm sure he'll be happy when this one gets forgotten
<START> i saw the movie hoot and then i immediately decided to comment it the truth is that nature needs protection from us because we are the dominant specie of this planet some people think that if they have money they can do whatever they want to which probably is like but if they think about the future more then they think about themselves they would do something useful this movie is not just about kids this movie is showing us that the kids are usually the ones that care more about it then the adults do when i was twelve i saw some and i knew they are protected by law and didn't even dare to touch them not fearing of the law but fearing that i might harm them actually i am currently 15 what so ever the acting was great the 3 main characters are well interpreted and we all have to learn from them i hope you all think about what you saw in that movie and enjoy
<START> this one is a poor attempt at spinning the old cons turn good yarn which we have seen so many times before it actually reminded me of the american series 'the players' although nowhere near as good omar epps is totally unconvincing as the hard man of the bunch as is ribisi who's attempt at being the funny guy gets lost along the way danes performance was decent though and you can see from this performance why she was cast in terminator 4 br br the mod squad is a film which lies in a kind of grey area between serious thriller and comedy at times it takes itself serious but other times it tries to be humorous but fails miserably the film has a kind of half finished feel about as if it was stretched to the 90 minute mark br br you'l be disappointed
<START> this film won't win any awards for greatness but if you have an hour and a half free and fancy a bit of light hearted entertainment then you could do much worse than watch this br br the cast are mostly young and pretty the script has some genuinely funny moments and the soundtrack is pretty cool too rupert penry jones as jake seems to have the most fun while laura fraser as justine is sweet likable and funny br br i rented it because i like the series that is currently starring in and here he's young and buff and the perfect eye candy for a girls night in br br get some wine and some ice cream and have a chuckle
<START> ok so i have recently been collecting a lot of vipco and hardgore titles on dvd and i have to say that this one is one of the most disappointing ones a more recent film compared to other titles in the hardgore catalogue this was a straight to dvd release i've always been interested in the myth of el ever since i saw a documentary on it as a teenager however this film is a terrible let down shot on tacky dv the storyline and acting are terrible it took me three goes to watch this film all the way through while cheap 80's and 90's horror films are good because of their cheap budgets and comedy this film is not br br check out some other titles in the hardgore series first for example is older but much much better
