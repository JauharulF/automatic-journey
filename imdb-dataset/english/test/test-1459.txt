<START> only watched this to see joe morton in an early role and honestly wished i hadn't bothered he can and has since done much better than this crap cannot understand why anyone finds this kind of stupidity funny but each to his own it is an absolute mess and not funny in the least no wait one line only was funny where mr kent joe and his family are having dinner with this nut job as he's been invited for dinner lord alone knows why pest to mr kent you know what it's like dog you've been there mrs kent not lately joe's expression was funny but that's it one line does not make a great comedy and this tat is so far away from being funny it should be consigned to the nearest trash cart it's only good enough for that joe morton glad to see you don't appear in rubbish like this anymore you are far superior and a great great actor
<START> while it was nice to see a film about older people finding each other and falling in love and the performances by andrews and garner were not bad this picture poured on the and schmaltz at every turn every curve in the plot was in view from a mile away
<START> this is an apocalyptic vision of the hell of our contemporary world the social criticism of our shallow commercially oriented values is what makes this film an exceptional vision of the war is hell clichÃ© underscored by a mythical journey upriver to cambodia by a special forces captain whose mission is to eliminate with extreme prejudice a rogue colonel who's left behind the army's concepts of justice to create his own world when i saw apocalypse now in 1980 i thought it was a deeply flawed masterpiece in particular i found the final segment of the journey with brando which encapsulates conrad's heart of darkness to be rather boring i finally got around to seeing apocalypse now redux and the flaws have been taken care of redux makes the movie an outright masterpiece certainly among the top 100 films ever made brando's performance now seems full and complete perhaps rather less mysterious but much more profound martin sheen is brilliant at the heart of one of the best acting ensembles ever assembled it's great to spot a young harrison ford scott glenn etc in early screen performances that suggest what fine actors they will eventually be recognized as the work of robert duvall fred forrest lawrence fishburne and sam bottoms is greatly enhanced by the additional footage if you've never seen this film skip the original and head straight for redux i wish we could get a gangs of new york redux from scorcese to fill in all the gaps in that deeply flawed potential masterpiece
<START> first i would like to apologize for my rating of 1 the only reason i give this film such a high rating is that i can't delve into negative all this is a spoof musings aside and while i certainly have tried to give it due consideration have left me with a certain notion namely this is quite possibly the worst film ever made on any level and in any plausible of qualitative measurement seriously i tried i'm just as in to any indie born for cult video distribution film as the next buff but seriously this movie sucked rhino balls br br honestly if i had directed this film i would have seen it as a legitimate cause for suicide
<START> now i'm a bit biased since i'm a big fan of late night television i've been a loyal fan of jay leno for about 6 or 7 years and think he's one of the funniest most talented comedians out there and david letterman is one hell of a comedian as well though i only watch his show unless jay's a repeat during commercials or when he has a better guest than jay on the show daniel roebuck and john michael higgins are both fine actors and they very much resembled jay and dave but did they disappear into the characters nope roebuck barely nails down jay's voice and expression mumbling at a high pitch sounding like a castrati marlon brando higgins nails down david's facial expressions for example his trademark squirm but he doesn't nail down dave's voice those who aren't big fans of late night tv might be a lot less biased there's a couple comedians who can do dead on impersonations of jay why couldn't they have selected one of them for the part and the same goes with dave i'd rather they had norm mcdonald play the part norm doesn't look a hell of a lot like dave but he did a great impersonation of him on snl hey you got any gum that was so hilarious br br however i learned a lot about the late night wars which i had very little knowledge of at first i never watched the tonight show prior to when jay leno was host so i didn't know about the struggle to finally replace johnny carson and the countless negotiations that finally convinced dave to move to cbs i knew very little about what happened behind the scenes and found the film very enlightening and kathy bates gives a knockout performance as the foul mouthed former executive producer of the tonight show she basically steals the film br br my score 7 out of 10 br br
<START> having enjoyed koyaanisqatsi and i was looking forward to this third part of the trilogy and seeing what direction it had taken rarely has a film so spectacularly failed to live up to its predecessors and lost its way although it tries to represent civilised warfare in the form of sport science trade and other forms of competition it lacks the global scope and even the coherently developed themes of its predecessors war is chaos but even wars have an aim in mind and this film had little structure and unclear goals br br naqoyqatsi is flawed by being a chaotic melange of images that does little to develop its theme on the plus side it wisely avoided using some of the iconic images of last century's wars br br naqoyqatsi is also so insular that several times i had to remind myself that i was not watching an advertisement promoting the american way of life perhaps this reflects the ongoing war on terror when representing sport as war the prominent team logos ensured that the usa was depicted as the winner hence it missed the opportunity to depict some of the many sports around the world and showing that humanity is united in its use of sport as a form of civilised warfare br br apart from newsreel the footage seemed to have been shot on a budget in the confines of new york and there was little recognition of life as war in the rest of the world the gallery of faces waxworks gave only a nod to the existence of important personages outside of the usa the makers missed the point that globalisation does not mean br br the philip glass soundtrack sounded much like every other philip glass score i've heard with the possible exception of koyaanisqatsi and at best can be described as inoffensive neither adding to nor detracting from the chaotic imagery
<START> sherlock holmes basil rathbone and dr watson nigel bruce have been hired by the british government to protect a swiss scientist dr franz william post jr he has a bomb that the british want to win the war unfortunately the evil dr moriarty lionel atwill is working with the nazis and will stop at nothing to get the doctor and his invention br br moving sherlock holmes to the 1940s sounded like a stupid idea but it does work for one reason basil rathbone arguably he is the best sherlock holmes ever put on the screen he plays the character so well and accurately that it doesn't matter what era he's solving crimes as for nigel bruce as watson everybody has problems with it he plays watson as a bumbling old fool that is not the watson of the books you seriously wonder why holmes puts up with him still he does grow on you in a way then there's atwill having a whale of a time playing moriarty the discussions and battle of wits between him and holmes are just great i've never liked dennis as inspector lestrade he's such an idiot makes watson look like a genius and post jr is pretty good as even though his accent amusingly keeps changing br br this movie is done elaborately and runs only a little over an hour still it does have it's slow spots and i never understood the secret code section br br still worth catching if just for rathbone and atwill
<START> i remember seeing this film in my late teens or early twenties on tv probably hbo i watched it with my parents a brother and a few friends since that was about 30 years ago i don't remember a lot of the story i do remember that the entire group of us watching agreed that this was the funniest movie we had ever seen when it was over our hurt from so much laughing my dad worked at a hospital so that made it all the better br br every time i see the party in the tv listings i look to see if this one is there too to my dismay it never is although i loved the party i feel this one is funnier peter sellers was great as a crooked hospital administrator why it's never been released on video is a mystery to me it's a classic but it appears that nobody under 35 or 40 has been allowed to see it i'd buy it in a second if they ever release it to dvd
<START> it seems incredible that the same decade which brought star wars to the screen such unutterable tripe as this and many other movies i am reminded of the similarly lavish but equally wretched outlined elsewhere br br whatever motivated a list actors to sign on for such wastes of celluloid is frankly beyond this writer they must have been very very desperate to be perfectly candid roger moore's appearance in any movie is the kiss of death although extremely handsome in his youth his entire acting career has been predicated upon an ability to raise one eyebrow every emotion from a to b is conveyed by this simple stratagem his were the dog days of james bond lee marvin on the other hand has featured in some very worthy outings perhaps most memorably your and 'the dirty he has a comic streak but he is much better when he plays it straight br br the excellent ian holm is a throwaway hardly recognisable blacked up as a mute african everyone else just turned up for their pay cheques br br the only plausible and watchable element is the german cruiser it looks like a very large model but it is believably massive and appears authentic as do its crew the rest isn't even hokum the childish comedy jars with the brutality and violence in a story that meanders clumsily about as if the script itself had had too many whiffs of lee marvin's gin here is a director who simply doesn't know where he's going there are hints of 'the african queen' a snatch from 'the pride the and one or two other rip offs from movies who's titles don't come readily to mind br br strangely i have seen it 3 times each occasion it has been shown on television when i have been laid low with a cold or the flu perhaps that is influencing my judgement but not much br br compare it with any indiana jones movie and you will see what i mean br br i have given it two stars one for the battleship and the other because it finally comes to an end though heaven knows it takes long enough to do that br br time for another i think
<START> for a while it seemed like this show was on 24 7 then apparently there was a second season or some other kind of continuation of this horrible show about the two most vapid and conceited people who have ever been filmed all the other comments have captured the essence of these two selfish airheads perfectly not much less can be said about them besides what everyone else has said br br i doubt these two ladies have souls and more than likely they made some kind of faustian bargain in order to get their on a television series may the fates protect the human race from any more exposure to the ghastly girls
<START> i wasted 5 dollars renting this complete piece of crap dr zack is the most unlovable lead character i have ever seen the movie was full of every cliche you could ever think of and contained not a single ounce of originality there was the typical sexism portrayed by rugged foreigners all the guys had those 'too proud to take attitudes that are as stale as grandma's christmas fruitcake the concept and deaths were really cool but they lose all novelty once the monster is revealed read the spoiler at the end nothing else is really revealed though the ending is the biggest cop out you've ever seen i predicted everything before it happened including who would die and how the dialogue is lacking and that's an understatement by far there's mostly just random yelling thoughtful staring and chunky sentences the actors are just god awful i don't want to talk about this movie anymore it's making me angry i just wonder if the director even watched it when it was done br br spoiler alert save 5 dollars the monster is just a bunch of ants that evolved so now they need bones so they can move around nevermind the fact that this serves no evolutionary advantage whatsoever and that the ants just killed whoever was available though the movie acts like they kill out of necessity this movie made me dumber the end consists of the lead idiot killing the mother ant a big blob thing which destroys all the other ants pretty cliche eh he almost wusses out at the end because of a sudden emotional attachment to the mother thing that overcomes him give me a break
<START> a group of young filmmakers with virtually no budget set out to make something clever and original and while there is a bit of originality and some skilled drawing in this slacker puppet show take on dante's inferno there is nothing especially clever dante's divine comedy was a brilliant piece of social commentary this film is a vaguely moralistic student film with pretensions to high art br br i suspect those who loved this film were those readily amused by the sophomoric pokes at some icons of the political and or religious right and that those who hated it took offense at seeing their favored icons poked be that as it may few of those pokes actually rose to the level of satire br br the high point of the movie is a sudden outbreak of schoolhouse rock on the subject of and the revolving door it's really a shame that the entire film couldn't have been a musical that would have stripped away a great deal of the annoying film school pretentiousness and added a far stronger element of fun
<START> many americans are lazy and this has manifested itself even in our dvd watching many of us don't like to take the time to read an hour and a half or more of subtitles so we choose not to see many foreign films one film that is totally worth your time no matter how mundane a task you might think the subtitle reading is however is the green butchers it's by far the best foreign film i've ever seen and tops many american films i've seen lately as well it's a complex situation told in a remarkably simple and funny dialogue the character depth derived in this film is amazing the way and sorry if those are spelled wrong feed off each other's contrasting personas is downright spectacular the actors were well cast and i'm very much hoping that a sequel is in consideration it needs very little of and what's her face just give me and on some sort of journey with supporting characters and more amazing dialogue to the author of this fine screenplay i say write more the story itself is rather twisted but you'll find yourself rooting for the bad guy anyhow with no remorse please check this movie out
<START> i have only seen this once in 1986 at an artsy theater in minneapolis but i remember it like i saw it a thousand times this morning hilarious sawing for teens playing scrabble with all e beautifully animated taking off her eyes shaking them back into position then putting them back on and poignant the end of the world the pettiness of a snit br br required viewing for the human race calling this simply a cartoon is like calling the great gatsby nifty typing
<START> as a word of explanation disney's the kid has absolutely nothing in common with the charlie chaplin 1921 classic of the same name what we do have is a pleasant enough though unbelievable feel good family comedy as only the folks at disney can provide br br bruce willis in a change of pace plays a self centered stuffed shirt of an image consultant he degrades not only his clients but those close to him as well you know that he is going to have to change before the final credits br br into his life comes a chapter from his past in the form of willis' character as a nerdy 8 year old played with cutesy pie conviction by spencer breslin disney always finds these kids somewhere this forces willis to come to grips with his past and well you know the rest br br appearing as willis' love interest is emily mortimer and lily tomlin as his executive assistant both have little enough to do as most of the movie involves the inter action between the willis and breslin characters br br the kid though not the greatest of disney movies is one nonetheless that you can sit down and watch with your family and come away from with a warm feeling
