<START> in this follow up to the naked civil servant we see the final years of quentin life in new york john hurt is again crisp come on who else could play the part and its a role he inhabits to the point of disappearing for me hurt is crisp and i've always found it very hard to take the man himself because hurt was more him than he was himself its masterful performance his equal is denis o'hare as phillip steele long time friend and confidant br br unfortunately outside of the performances the film has little to recommend it to be certain the film gets the details right filmed in and around new york the film the film looks and feels like new york and its environs but dramatically its kind of inert its crisp talking to people being witty trying to come to terms with the world as it is he ended up regretting some poorly chosen words concerning aids and dealing with the that old aged thrust upon him quentin the man is always interesting but his life as portrayed is really not br br i am disappointed by the film i've always admired the man and his unique point of view i just wish he was better served by this film about his life
<START> seems to have been made as a vehicle for w c fields and carol dempster and they dominate it fields already has his film character well developed carol dempster seems to dance through the film and her acting reminds me of mary pickford who also worked a long time under d w griffith typical of later griffith films technically br br later remade as poppy the original title with fields in the same role
<START> there is no esperanto in this movie br br i watched this movie specifically because imdb lists esperanto as one of the languages used but imdb is mistaken about the languages used in this film there is absolutely no esperanto at all it's almost all english with a couple of words of navajo do not watch this film if you're looking for esperanto movies other options instead are delight with clark gable which has a bit of esperanto incubus is all esperanto although completely mispronounced and there are some esperanto street signs in charlie chaplin's the great dictator there was supposed to be some spoken esperanto in gattaca as well but i never heard any br br aside from that the other reviewer is right this movie is a complete mess br br spend your time elsewhere
<START> maureen o'hara is always beautiful and appealing here she plays an actress terminally ill we don't know with what it is a bit of a precursor to love story in that respect br br william bendix is good as is most of the supporting cast john payne is meant to be grieving but he seems to sleepwalking the girl who plays the child he and o'hara adopts does her best with a contrived plot device of course adopt an orphan she will live on after the passing of your wife it's a sweet movie but it doesn't feel sincere i was hoping to be moved i was by o'hara's gentle performance but i don't like to feel manipulated
<START> this should have rocked vh1 moved away from the traditional divas whitney houston celine dion etc that had made the 2003 show so stale sadly the move backfired the show had no mc keeping the show together queen latifah did a fantastic show at the 2003 divas the show kicked of with a horrific rendition of lady marmalade featuring patti cyndi lauper and jessica simpson okay in the studio with some control they can all sound great br br however when they are competing with each other why it just sounds torturous jessica simpson has the most bizarre facial expressions when she sings that i've ever witnessed cyndi lauper also performed girl just wanna have fun that wasn't as bad but it was hardly impressive the worst was yet to come cyndi and patti teamed up to perform hit 'time after time' it was acoustic and didn't fit in with the rest of the show still it could've been okay if they both hadn't insisted on squealing like animals it was just dire br br debbie harry from blondie is always cool she has a style of her own and although maybe she can't compete vocally with a many of the divas although she certainly can sing very well debbie came out and performed blondie's 1 hit 'rapture' with some lovely vocals she really hit the notes perfectly she looked stunning rapper eve provided a new but sadly inferior rap it was good debbie's next performance was a team up with newcomer joss stone they performed the blondie hit 'one way or i think joss misunderstood the style of the song and just shouted over debbie a rather sad bit was when debbie tried and failed to match her style which spoiled it a bit she should've just let joss get on with her totally inappropriate the whole of blondie performed this track the final track debbie performed was blondie's massive hit me' it was pretty poor not debbie's fault because you just couldn't hear her the sound was atrocious all the way through the show br br joss stone also performed a few songs on her own they were quite well done ashanti also showed up to perform two inexplicable cover versions firstly she did diana ross' 'i'm coming out' and then khan's she is not a diva she can sing to an extent but she has no presence whatsoever why not just get the real singers in was even interviewed on the show br br gladys knight showed up and did a medley it was very good she was probably the best bit of the show i don't know much about her other than she is a seasoned performer in las vegas and her experience and class really shone through patti fitted in another performance this time her 80's hit 'new it was the finale and it was okay but it was too little to late this was one big dud better luck next time vh1 br br the version i saw was a heavily edited version which was shown on vh1 in the uk if these were the best bits

<START> at the first glance of this film the camera angles immediately make you think that this is a low budget film that will bore you to tears or make you press the stop button surprisingly the storyline comes forward and is played through the screen in a way that i feel most would relate to i scored this movie at 7 but like most would felt it should be a 10 you will understand as you watch it because its a rare thing for a film to be in touch with a persons feelings and how life should be shown by a tv set most films try to leave you in awe of their special effects twists and turns etc this film dealt a true hand showed a good film backed by an alabama style storyline that most would feel was a good waste of a couple of hours wish i had put the popcorn maker on after all well done
<START> just once i would like to see work given to a decent screenwriter director and producer just once br br this is a good attempt by jean leclerc and chris sarandon and an even better attempt by victoria tennant but everything else is pure unadulterated garbage the screenwriter should be shot for bastardizing work this way and the director please br br the story is a well written story but the screenplay is quite dull unbelievable and horribly executed the only elements which work are the performances by leclerc sarandon and tennant br br on a personal note i really wanted this to work i adore novels but they have never given them the attention backing and talent they deserve if they put the same money into work that they shovel by the barrels full into king's koontz would quickly rise above but alas without powerful people who believe in his work i fear he will never get the chance br br as an adaptation to the novel this movie was a total suck fest as a stand alone movie it wasn't that bad though extremely weak in many places with huge plot holes and terrible stiff unprofessional dialog which never should have made it to the final cut this movie failed miserably to live up to its potential had they followed the original work by koontz a bit more closely and invested a decent amount of production money this could have been a far better endeavor br br however all i can manage to see in this is how good it could have been and wasn't br br it rates a 4 3 10 from br br the fiend
<START> oooooh man was i pleased i didn't miss this i wanted to post this review as this episode in particular does what a certain recent movie did not it pays true homage to the game doom its plot is different yes and the characters are obviously set in an entirely different universe obviously the doctor who universe however the feel the pace the references and the location are perfect and for all original doom fans listen out for the door opening and closing sound effect it was the icing on the cake for me br br please all doctor who and doom fans alike check this one out its a gem
<START> realistic master piece thirty years later the pictures can look a bit old but actually it only accurate the in the face' effect of the movie i never saw in my whole life a film like this one first time i saw it i didn't know if it was a fiction and it didn't looked like that movie is a masterpiece that every single person in the world have to see it's the best ever society critical movie the ultimate movie that demonstrate that the system is down and the system has not change a lot in thirty years i think this movie would have to be watched as an education piece
<START> charlie wilson's war based on a true story tells the tale of a texas congressman and a cia agent working to secure funding for covert support of the in 1980s afghanistan following the ussr invasion of the country this conflict played a major role in the final years of the cold war between the us and the ussr br br in terms of film making charlie wilson's war is a definite winner it well written well acted and well shot while most of the attention has gone to tom hanks for yet another fine performance i was even more impressed with philip seymour hoffman's turn as cia operative gust scenes of soviet attacks on under armed villages and of the refugee camp effectively tug at the heart the film also gives a good behind the scenes look at the wheeling and dealing that congressman wilson must go through to secure the desired funding br br there are however two complaints i have about the film the first is that there is a subplot involving an scandal investigation that is not well developed and as such only serves as a minor distraction to the story line the second complaint is that the film lacks some of the context of the war the film makes the look like innocent victims and while they did suffer large civilian casualties the were in fact rebels trying to topple the government of afghanistan this government ignored entirely in the film not surprisingly fought to suppress the rebellion later calling on the soviet union for support in their effort the film also ignores that the us was aiding the prior to the soviet deployment in afghanistan the film did hint at the unintended consequences of our covert actions consequences we are still feeling today but it seems as if screenwriter aaron and director mike nichols were willing to sacrifice some historical context to provide a cohesive narrative not having read the book i do not know if george made the same compromise those complaints notwithstanding i did enjoy watching charlie wilson's war and do recommend it i would have preferred a film that more accurately depicted the complexities of the situation as stephen gaghan did in syriana but the audiences connected better with cohesive narrative of charlie wilson's war than with the ambiguities present in syriana
<START> when i see a movie i usually seek entertainment but of course if i know what genre the move is then i will seek what it is meant to do for example if it is a deep film i expect the film to thoughts up in my cranium and make me ponder what it is saying but who's that girl is not a deep film but it is entertaining nonetheless it's a campy sort of film that's a joy to watch there's barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts i've watched it when i was younger the cast is always entertaining as usual i had a small crush on griffin dunne even though he wasn't the typical male heartthrob at the time haviland morris also stars and late austrian actress bibi besch is here too overall a delight
<START> hope the summary line won't irritate you that much it's a little homage to the show charlie murphy but also to the character but i'll try to put all the things i liked about the movie in one paragraph and everything i didn't like in another paragraph so it will be easier to read br br let's start with the good things the quote strong bloody violence which is used by rating boards to describe the content of a movie does fit here very well this is not a movie for kids or for the faint of hearted it has blade as a central character wesley snipes is phenomenal and a crazy enough story thread to hold justify the action scenes the original idea is also very engaging and intelligent the action scenes are great here too br br ok over to the things i didn't like the overall story is too thin it's enough as i've written above to hold the action scenes together but there could be more and a character like blade deserves more imo the drama therefor isn't the best also it's use of clichÃ©s doesn't help some characters are underwritten that's that o
<START> a big waste of time is all you'll get out of this bag i rented this hoping for a suspenseful movie with maybe a few believable scenes but boy was i ever dissapointed i think the title should've been camping 101 or something to that effect well anyway stay the hell away from this film it numbs you to death don't be afraid of big foot be afraid of this crap
<START> when a bomber a patricide a pornographer and a mad biker together with various other forms of social scum have had enough of their sh infested cell they spot a rat and look for the hole escaping from the sewage the group of 9 souls take advantage of their new found freedom and head for civilization what soon follows is not surprising complete mayhem and terror follow in their wake it seems that each has some unfinished business to take care of br br loosely based on the great escape 9 souls is by far in the top 5 best films i've seen this year running at right around 2 hours 9 souls will deliver a story so powerful it'll literally leave you breathless the beautiful yet subtle use of the rolling country sides adds the realism that is expected from this story the vision of director blue spring porno star is completely mind boggling as he implements a sense of pity towards the characters as quickly as each character grasps their dream it's as quick as it's torn from them now all responsibility of the success of this film should not fall solely on the shoulders of the director yet props must go to the actors as well this film was full of excellent acting from top to bottom ryuhei matsuda the son of matsuda of audition delivers a stellar performance and seems to bring some of his mothers eeriness to the screen br br i must give props to dvd as well this is the 6th film of theirs i've seen now and they seem to get better and better each dvd the sound quality is perfect and the picture clean and crisp it's very annoying trying to watch a film that is too dark in transfer so the discs from theses cats are nice br br bottom line is this film will soon receive masterpiece status by viewers' world wide keep an eye out in 2005 for 9 souls it's really amazing film to watch
