<START> dirty dancing follows the story of frances 'baby' houseman jennifer grey and her family as they spend the summer at family summer camp we get to see her discover herself as she falls in love with the dance instructor johnny castle patrick swayze br br the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title some great music and terrific scenery it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here a happy wonderful feel good ending you know how it's going to end from the beginning but that's really not the point here the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family br br it's one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tv never mind the fact that i already have it memorized
<START> this was a pleasant musical about the creation of the moulin rouge dance hall in many ways this reminds me of the hollywood musicals of the 40s and 50s in that it has many clichÃ©s leading up to the inevitable conclusion will the show still go on while of course none of this is new it was enjoyable and well made the musical numbers at the end are frenetic and beautiful to watch in many ways it reminds me of a sexier version of the great ziegfeld in real life ziegfeld was quite the player but this was sanitized in the american film but in french cancan the characters have fully functioning libidos but nothing is really shown so the movie is okay for kids br br nothing new but well done nevertheless
<START> baby boom was bad enough basically making a series of every straight mans nightmare is worse yeah watched a few always made me feel better after a bad day it reminded me it could be worse guy was rich successful single smart man and dating celebs from singers to actresses then his screw up of a cousin dumps his biggest mistake on him in reality it would have been straight to foster care i'm sure this was definitely a chic series oh and what's all the wining about the baby change most the time it's probably a doll besides at that age it's nothing more than a prop anyways br br any case i'm glad it didn't last more than a year
<START> i was once a big olsen fan i received this movie when i was six and watched it almost nonstop until i was nine then it lay on my shelf gathering dust until yesterday i was left speechless br br mary kate and ashley play allie and mel two twelve year olds who are sent to spend spring break in paris with their ambassador grandfather along the way they meet as one might expect two cute french boys who show them the more fun side to paris i guess the two boys were okay fake french accents aside br br the plot is predictable and the humour is shallow and corny mary kate and ashley play two shallow girls with too much make up on their face br br don't watch this movie if you're not into the olsen twins or family movies
<START> i think that the costumes were excellent and the hairdressers also performed well it has the very authentic feeling for that period of time br br i don't know if it was the computer magic or if it was real some of the big scenes have hundreds of extras in the background i was especially impressed with the scene of that bridge br br the main character the actress also performed well she showed us a nervous witty woman who knows how to use herself to seduce men to get what she wants br br some of the scenes were hilarious even though it was about 2 hours long but it was never boring a very good entertaining movie
<START> ok well no one in their right mind s would pick up a movie titled the man with the screaming brain and expect it to be serious this is an outrageous b movie and that means a truly hokey plot strange characters clichÃ©s over the top action and oh so cheesy one liners for that odd segment of the population including myself that gets a kick out of that kind of thing this is a gem br br the acting is better than expected stacy keach is embedded in his character bruce campbell brings a spirited convincing performance his physical comedy skills are truly impressive in this movie and hearken back to the evil dead films
<START> the bridge at contains some of the most preposterous war time screenplay i've ever seen aside from the acting which is wooden no tank commander attacks with his tanks parked in nice neat rows up the middle of roads and with troops bunched all together with their arms not at the ready the constant suicidal behavior set off my tilt switch so often i found it impossible to enjoy the movie apparently the screen writers and director have never been through actual warfare and never bothered to bring in an expert who had this movie is the very antithesis of the excellent detail in saving private ryan unless you are under 7 years old i recommend watching something else br br gb
<START> when a stranger calls belongs to the group of this year's remakes with movies like poseidon just over the horizon director simon west con air helms this updated version with plenty of relative unknown casts which signals either the death rate is high it isn't or that established stars are steering clear from a potential turkey br br clocking in at a relatively short 87 minutes it's primarily made up of two acts the first which takes a full one hour is the setup our heroine jill johnson camilla belle chalked up 800 minutes of talk time on her mobile phone do the math and as a lesson in responsibility her parents had confiscated her mobile and grounded her to pay off her debt she works part time as a babysitter and looking after the wealthy kids is her first stint br br the huge mansion gets a full tour treatment as it is where all the action will take place plenty of rooms makes for good hiding an indoor pool sized aquarium pond to get wet in for the wet t shirt treatment and check this out motion detector lights which you just know will contribute to the scares with the manipulation of lights and shadows naturally prank calls red herrings are aplenty which chalks up this runtime but most of them fall flat in the suspense department br br there's a minor trend emerging with actors being the unseen providing and acting through their voice instead recent attempts include edward norton in kingdom of heaven and hugo weaving's v for vendetta here lance henriksen does the honours for the anonymous nameless psychotic killer but it just falls flat why the script doesn't give him much dialogue most of the phone calls made were of the silent mind masturbatory nature which i felt was a waste they could have also casted some unknown instead and the job will still get done br br the second act where the main action takes place is too little too late and the bogeyman well is purely a bogeyman those expecting blood and gore will be disappointed as basically it's a one woman show to hold your attention in the first hour eye candies always succeed and this act will have her resolve everything in double quick time ala rachel mcadams in red eye don't expect any form of character development nor subplots that will engage br br the ending tried to be too smart for its own good and came across as a cheap way to end the movie there's not much of goodness to highlight from this movie no scares no thrills no enigmatic villain and plenty of security flaws especially with that door alarm the only thing it's good for is to provide a number for 4d
<START> my god this was a fantastic film every time we watch it takes us to another place of wow rhett scarlett were played brilliantly by joanne timothy they did a fantastic job revising the roles of our two favourite heros everyone it is a must see dont deprive yourself of this movie if u loved gone with the wind you will love this mini series go rhett go
<START> unlike the many who have posted here i'm not movie literate i stumbled across this movie by accident channel surfing and couldn't surf away this is a truly incredible movie worthy of all the praise the critics and those on this site have heaped on it the actors are terrific tatiana is beautiful and innocent her fiancÃ© boris is sweet and patriotic you couldn't help but feel boris' father's exasperation and sorrow as he upbraids his son for such foolishness as volunteering to serve in the great war br br others have summarized the movie so well so i'll just mention a couple of scenes that moved me the most when boris' brother reveals to his family that he has broken trust with his brother and has to marry tatiana twisted mouth shows her revulsion at this betrayal even though her part in the unfaithfulness might have been through rape you fear that the rest of the movie might right this wrong by visiting just destruction on tatiana and the brother or worse show tatiana destroyed by an immoral descent into cigarette smoking decadence since this isn't french existential cinema the latter doesn't happen thankfully br br another scene that tears at your heart is when the unnamed musician soldier who was saved by boris returns to tell boris' father of the death of his son he unwittingly breaks the news to tatiana i can't describe the sorrow of this scene still tatiana finds finds a straw to grab and hope that boris will yet come home the musician actually never saw boris buried after all br br i won't mention more scenes but do want to observe that the touches of soviet political correctness didn't detract at all from the film boris' brother is revealed as the piano playing anti soviet slacker that someone who steals his brother's wife to be would have to be no doubt he gets at least a tenner at the conclusion of the film the ending when tatiana finally learns for certain that boris is dead still manages to end with cheerfully and full of hope for the future you don't even want to imagine the tears and catharsis that must have swept through the theater when survivors of that war with their own losses in mind first saw this movie br br incredible go see it
<START> i write this after just seeing the latest episode broadcast in the uk and to me it must be a tough job to keep up the standard the last episode shown called blink has elements of gothic horror all to do with statues that aren't quite what they seem the doctor and martha don't appear much but that doesn't detract from a well crafted episode the general standard has built to a high level and the last three episodes the two parter with the family and the latest have to me been the best that the current team have ever done br br it's not just david tennant holding it together the whole supporting cast week in week out are helping as well for those awaiting series 3 abroad the wait is is well worth it
<START> red sonja is a career step in the wrong direction for arnold schwarzenegger having made a couple of sword 'n' sorcery films as conan he had moved onto slightly more serious acting roles in films like the terminator and commando only to make a mystifying return to the sword 'n' sorcery genre for this 1985 debacle it's hard to figure out why he bothered as this is weaker than both conan films in every conceivable department allegedly this was to have been the third conan film but for one reason or another the emphasis was shifted onto the leading female character the titular red head leaving poor old arnold to play an incredibly dull supporting role spare a thought too for director richard fleischer who had given the world classics like 20 000 leagues under the sea fantastic voyage the boston strangler and 10 rillington place in this his penultimate film fleischer also has taken a gigantic career step backwards br br evil queen bergman wants to rule the world and she needs a priceless and powerful talisman to do so she and her brutish army storm a keep populated by priestesses and steal the said talisman massacring the helpless priestesses as they go one of the dead priestesses has a sister named sonja brigitte nielsen a fiery red headed warrior who upon hearing of her sister's death swears revenge upon the evil sonja rides across the land in search of lair along the way she picks up travelling companions in the shape of a boy prince ernie reyes jr and his bodyguard paul smith she also meets the muscular warrior conan sorry i mean who offers to join her in her quest initially sonja doesn't want the help of arnold schwarzenegger preferring instead to prove that she can confront and defeat her enemies alone but eventually she warms to him and accepts his assistance br br red sonja is a staggeringly poor film all the more so when one muses that it was made in 1985 when the sword 'n' sorcery genre was close to its end it seems so simplistic and amateurish that one could easily mistake it for an early example of its kind the performances are poor on the whole ranging from bergman's embarrassingly ott villain to unbelievably irritating spoilt brat to schwarzenegger's wooden and unenthusiastic hero nielsen is slightly better as the heroine presumably full of enthusiasm at the thought of being in her first starring role but she is let down very badly by the stupidity of clive and george macdonald fraser's script the film is riddled with goofs including a scene where schwarzenegger is seen in close up hacking down bad guys but in a long shot in the same sequence there isn't a corpse in sight technically it is very inept too with sub standard special effects and appallingly mechanical monsters there are a few compensations such as ennio morricone's enjoyable music morricone spent a great deal of the '80s providing good music for awful films e g the island treasure of the four and another compensation is giuseppe lensing of the locations in fact much of the time it's a hell of a lot more gratifying to look at the lovely scenery than the actors standing in the foreground there were very few sword 'n' sorcery films after red sonja so in some ways it might go down in history as the film which destroyed its own genre
<START> this movie is absolutely horrible i thought because it had good actors in it like gabrielle union hill harper and of course the infamous billy d williams the movie is long and drags on with a documentary style of showing gabrielle union who has died in the movie talking about her family which by the way is a confusing family because you never know who's who and who's related to who i would not recommend this movie to anyone and i wish i could take it back where i got it from i fell asleep from time to time because of the boredom do not waste your time or money on this movie it could had been more true to life with more drama and less boredom
<START> tart is the worst movie i've seen this year and that includes both the affleck j lo bomb gigli and the rob zombie borefest house of 1000 corpses i don't know if that's a fair comparison seeing that tart was made two years earlier and probably has a budget half that of even the low budget 1000 corpses regardless all three movies suffer from the same shortcomings horrible script horrible acting horrible direction br br spoilers although i honestly don't think there's anything to spoil br br tart is about a group of super spoiled private school kids most of them reside in super sized apartments along new york's hyper expensive park avenue thanks to the finances of their neglectful parents the film showcases the aimless life of one of the students cat as she discards her only true friend as frivolous a person as she was in the pursuit of the good life with the in crowd that of course leads to sex drugs and music that is substantially worse than rock roll everything is overly in the way that truly bad movies usually are cat's first sexual experience leads to her being branded a tramp and ostracized by her newly acquired circle of friends her first encounter with drugs leads to her nearly being dumped down a garbage chute after her cohorts believe her to be dead from an overdose no heavy handed messages there he said sarcastically br br that's mainly what the seen it before 100 times plot entails other minor and even less interesting plot details include one friend who steals jewelry and trinkets from all the others a wild child who lives life on the edge and finally falls off of it one night in the east hamptons an anti semitic british chick who ends her close friendship with cat the moment she finds out cat has a jewish father and cat's strained relationship with her single mother who tries unsuccessfully to get cat to appreciate the privileged life she has the thief turns out to be an irredeemable lowlife the wild child is played as a toned down version of one of the hilton sisters the british girl disappears from the film after the break up the mother daughter relationship is seen as totally inconsequential until the film's final schmaltzy scene where she and her beleaguered mother have a reconciliation of sorts yawn br br end spoilers br br about the cast and crew dominique swain came on the scene strong with her role as the underaged seductress in 1997's highly watchable lolita and face off her performances were strong enough to land her on quite a few ones to watch lists at the time she was 17 at the time and i hope that they will not be the best roles of her career if she takes a few more roles like the one she takes in tart it very well may be br br i've only seen bijou phillips in one other film bully and i swear her performance in that one was nearly identical to the one she gave here i'm not sure if she's incapable of giving varied performances or if it was just a coincidence her roles in the two were so very similar my guess is that the former is true i sense this woman possesses very little talent as far as acting is concerned here she is the actress tapped to portray the watered down hilton sister that she gives such a weak performance is amazing considering that she grew up with and remains friends with the real life hilton sisters she's essentially playing a version of herself in this film and doing a damn poor job of it br br as for writer director christina wayne i know nothing of her other than tart was her first and only film project to date with a first effort like this it is no wonder her career in show business was short lived
<START> right then this film is totally unfunny puerile has gags from other films has songs from other films blink mutt grand theft we luv u an unlikeable leading man a ridiculous plot and lame parodies of films like mission impossible 2 and american beauty redeeming features shannon elizabeth and jaime pressly enough said
