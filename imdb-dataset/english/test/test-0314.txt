<START> a quick resumÃ© almost nonexistent badly chosen musical soundtrack steady cam filming done without the steady but with lots of coffee and a hyperactive cameraman no plot and nothing ever really happens the film goes from one dialog into another sounding hollow never achieving depth never creating the illusion that you really are inside a cobweb of conspiracy and the everybody has an affair with everybody is just a boring excuse to show the main actress in nice underwear which combined with her rusty voice certainly is nice but nothing to base a movie on the high point for me is the opening scene and the film just degraded from there to a point where i just wanted to quit the film about 45 minutes into the story i regret sitting it out
<START> dirty war br br aspect ratio 1 78 1 br br sound format stereo br br emergency services struggle to cope when islamic terrorists detonate a so called 'dirty in the middle of london br br daniel frightening movie uses all available evidence to dramatize the possible effects of a radioactive explosion in the heart of the uk capital using the kind of documentary style realism which has distinguished this particular subgenre since the 1960's in essence the film reveals a catalogue of flaws in the british government's current strategy for dealing with such terrorist outrages and carefully honed script co written by lizzie vents its spleen against mealy mouthed politicians who would rather maintain the economic status quo than tackle this issue head on the film covers all necessary bases and makes the salient point that this kind of terrorism is practised by a tiny handful of fanatics who have tarnished the islamic faith with their reckless disregard for human life though viewers won't be reassured by the subsequent scenes of devastation and horror not merely a drama the film acts as a warning against complacency either that or its just another post 9 11 tactic you be the judge
<START> cecil b demille directed a series of domestic comedy dramas in the late teens and early 20s he found his perfect leading lady for these provocative pieces in gloria swanson in don't change your husband swanson plays a bored housewife whose wealthy businessman husband elliott dexter pays more attention to work than to her she is chased by a handsome roue lew cody until she relents and divorces the boring husband for the new lover br br things soon become familiar and swanson discovers the new husband is as neglectful as the first to make matters worse she discovers cody has a woman on the side julia faye after several confrontations and convenient meetings things are resolved br br this was a smash hit in 1919 and helped make gloria swanson a major star although she was only 20 when she filmed this she is very good as the maybe foolish wife she looks great and wears some stunning gowns br br there is one memorable scene that is 100 demille in which cody is luring swanson with promises of wealth pleasure and love as he coos to her she imagines the scenes pleasure is a fantastic scene of swanson in a hammock swinging out over a pool while people dance around wealth is a scene in which swanson is like a babylonian queen as servants bring her chests of jewels which shes tosses aside love is a scene in which she is a wood nymph making love in a forest with a pan like character ted shawn pure hokum but very entertaining and swanson looks great br br dexter is very good as the bland husband who shaves off his moustache and starts to work out in order to win his wife back cody is also good as the fake charmer who is a liar and cheat faye is funny as the bitchy other woman named no less who gets hers sylvia ashton plays mrs ted shawn was married to ruth st denis and together they were groundbreaking and influential modern dancers of the school br br swanson impresses me more every time i see her she seems to have been such a natural actress and yet there is a way that the camera captures her expressive face that is just mesmerizing she's a joy to watch br br very entertaining film with lots of color tints in varying scenes to keep things lively and a lot of the furnishings are back in style 86 years later
<START> necessary roughness 1991 was a bad comedy drama that tried to hard on every level to be a serious film about college football a lot of current and former superstar athletes appeared in this production during one of the film's comedic highlights other than that it's a very mediocre movie they should have just stuck to making a straight out comedy filled with no realism instead the film makers try to play both fields and they end up on the short end of the stick when will somebody make a decent film about college football that's funny and realistic br br not recommended unless it's for free on t v
<START> the worst film ever with characters from carnosaur 1 3 inserted merely to fall to the same demise that they had in the first film so that footage and special effects could be reused br br stay away from this debacle br br corman is ruining his legacy he made and produced some amazing films but that era ended with carnosaur being his last creative in its badness film
<START> and call really did nothing why are they hero's they did nothing other then get to places after the bad guys where dead what was the point of this show i was very very disappointed i expected more action more story and to see the birth of heros and great deeds instead i saw very little it seemed like and call where just side story's for the great indian chief br br i'm not even sure that the history is even very close they did very little to show why the texans and comanche fought against each other br br the only good part about this movie was who played gus very very well and is a great actor a lot of good story that could have been gone to waste it was sad and i wish that i had not watched it
<START> this movie was very funny with just a bit of gore it is about two grave robber that are going about business as usual when they discover that there is a different clientÃ¨le they can serve this changes the direction of the corpses they collect the movie is told by the younger of the two as he is explaining the business to a priest before he is sent to be beheaded his partner had already been beheaded the priest is required to take down the last confession and it takes the form of a story there is some animation thrown in which gives it a tales from the crypt feel in the story we meet another group of grave robbers that everyone fears but at one point the younger of the two up for execution is offered a job so this calms some of the animosity between the groups when a woman joins the two men she oversteps her boundaries and gets them in trouble with the feared grave robbers the story leads up to the meeting of the two groups which led to the arrest of the man that is confessing and the man that has already lost his head
<START> there comes a time in every big name actor's career when they get sloppy and accept projects that they wouldn't have touched with a 1000 ft pole in their golden days remember taxi driver that was a fine film i can hardly believe that the de niro of showtime is the same actor br br i would rather watch time chasers twice than see this film again if anyone offers to take you to see showtime or gives you free passes or whatever run away as fast and far as you can
<START> poor second string feature from universal pictures about a mama's boy movie actor doing criminal investigation work for the military fending off the advances of the brash young woman he's been assigned to romance robert montgomery directed and stars in this adaptation of the short story come be my love and his acting performances of this era are unrelievedly lazy the plot is sappy predictable stuff and writer robert carson has given all the really funny lines as usual for films of this period to the feisty black maid it's always nice to see ann blyth and jane cowl in support but they can't do much with this hokey material from

<START> i'm currently slogging through 'fall and decline of the roman empire so i've had all things roman on my mind i'm not very far into it yet maybe two hundred plus pages but it is amazing just how many of these roman were killed i believe i've read through maybe 15 so far and only antonius and haven't been killed or at least suspected of having been killed i have also been fascinated by the mad excesses of many of these princes of rome not the least practitioner of these was caligula this brings me to reviewing this film i'm thinking of the film on a historical basis as far as i understand it from explanation of rome as well as other research from some good web sites and some fiction novels dealings with the period br br my point is i do not think that this film is what it is thought to be by many of it's i do not think the depravity shown with the sex and horrendous violence of this film qualify it as accurate the general ideas of the film seem accurate caligula is raised on an island exiled with his family and in content fear of being murdered by the increasingly mad suspicious and strange emperor he grows up paranoid and afraid and can never shake the cutesy nickname given him by his guards little boots this helps him grow up feeling abused and powerless he is handed the empire after dies the senate hoping he will steer away from the informer squads which brought death by whim of the former paranoid tyrant and lead rome away from the madness that dictator had settled it into caligula begins as a decent if hands off emperor but gets sick almost dies and comes back from the brink of death a true monster his with his sisters do begin here if not before he does have macro killed and many others who were his originally supporters the acts of madness seemed not to be the murders of caligula as much as his new thinking of himself as a living god him seen talking to the statue of jupiter as an equal doomed him his violent mad excesses would have doomed him anyway and three years seems to have been quite a decent run for the successors of well the film basically sticks to these lines while it manages to be coherent which is not common through it's entirety it does so while trying to shock the audience at all turns in every single scene the film begs you to be disgusted by the depravity of ancient rome the shocking scenes are what this film is built entirely upon and where it entirely fails it is just too much to see successive rulers have man after man murdered raped tortured for no reason but fancy the depictions of the violence are possibly but not probably accurate murder certainly was the order of the day in imperial rome torture beforehand was rote but the director's visions of these deaths and the bored amusement of their protagonists while the bystanders watch with nonchalance i just don't see it having gone down exactly like that the death machine the is certainly something like you've never seen in movies and something once seen you shall probably never forget even as i you wish you could the wine drinking while the penis is roped off is the same once you've seen this shame it is yours forever these things strike me the director's and that porn magnate's fantasies they sprung from their sick imaginations and not from any proved record br br the acting is pretty good i actually think mcdowell is the weakest link here mirren is always something to behold and here in her youthful years she is formidable and beautiful the portrayals of and are done very well by their respected actors the film could have done so much better story telling it is such a failure that way its just a whole other layer of what a shame this thing was for example it could have given opinion on how and why caligula went mad or shown that he was mad paranoid before his illness and that fever then broke the mental restraint he had possessed previously it could have shown the weakness of claudius and the miracle it was he survived caligula it could have these and many other things but it stuck to it's sad nightmares br br finally about the sex it is porn it shows these sex acts being done all over the palaces by many people male on male female on female male on female it is passionless disgusting sex sex that if your point is to get off on it i seriously doubt you could both and caligula may have been sex addicts and orgies may have been common enough but the visions in this film seem to recall more a greek time than a roman i don't think that kind of acceptance of homosexuality or orgies right out in the open were common until the the strange depraved reign of and he was killed for it br br this film should probably never be watched if your curious about it let it go it is something as i said earlier if you do watch this you will unfortunately retain it's sick visions in your minds eye for years to come i don't think its an accurate historical picture in particular even if it is historical in whole
<START> stupidly beautiful this movie epitomizes the 'so bad it's good' genre of films br br the only two talents in it are richard boone and joan van ark and only boone is any good it's kind of sad that the man who rose to fame as should wind up in this ugly pile of celluloid while he turns in a fantastic performance i couldn't help but feel that he so outclassed all his fellow actors in this piece that he shouldn't even have been there br br the effects in this film are laughable but fun the idea of a dinosaur being buried in the wall of a cave and suddenly coming to life is b movie gold when the gets killed watch how it falls it's clear that the stunt performer in the front of the costume knows the timing best he falls to the ground well before the back half of the dinosaur follows suit br br speaking of there is nothing good to say about the purple tyrannosaur in this flick it seems to have some kind of stealth technology since reputed to be the best tracker in the world twice fails to notice it until it's within biting range of him i don't know how all the prints are but in the version i own the roar contains godzilla's trademark bellow br br this is loads of fun to watch if you like bad movies i love them and especially bad monster movies so i consider this the gem of my collection if bad movies are your thing definitely get this one
<START> i just saw princess raccoon at the asian film festival in new york the gentleman who introduced the film congratulated the audience on their fine taste you could be at herbie fully loaded he said with a smug smile but instead you're here to watch seijun suzuki's princess raccoon the audience applauded and cheered well let me tell you i would have rather watched herbie fully loaded twice in a row princess raccoon an allegedly whimsical musical based on japanese folklore easily qualifies for one of the ten worst films that i have ever seen it is so wretched that its wretchedness actually makes me dislike other seijun suzuki films which is quite a feat br br there is such a vast expanse of things wrong with princess raccoon that i hardly know where to start perhaps its worst faults are being both aggressively unintelligible and mind bogglingly monotonous if the reels got mixed up or if half of them got lost in shipping the audience would not know the difference if you don't believe me i dare you to steal a print and have someone run the reels in random order if you can tell me which one goes where i will give you every penny i have br br the first third of the film features a mishmash of scenes songs including a cringe inducing rap number and images that don't seem to be related in any way at all horribly integrated computer animation is thrown into the bargain adding yet another brick to the immense and rapidly growing wall of incomprehensibility it wouldn't surprise me to learn that the writer wrote down any japanese folklore that came to mind of on a bunch of note cards stacked them up shuffled them dealt the cards out on a table and then wrote the script according to their order br br about thirty five minutes into the film some semblance of a plot arrives on the scene something about a shape shifting raccoon princess in human form and a regular human falling in love i hoped that this was be a portent of the film being something other than a series of perplexing scenes but no such luck the film continues in the same absolutely baffling manner i wish i had gotten out then but i was trapped in the middle of a narrow row in retrospect it would have been worth the awkward scene br br i'm exhausted just thinking about the last couple of reels i spent every moment hoping and praying that it would be over every big dolly move swell in music or scene that looked remotely like it was concluding things renewed my hopes that the credits were about to roll for agonizing minute after agonizing minute it went on and on and on and on finally after dozens of false alarms it cut to what i was sure must be an abstract pattern over which credits were about to appear then in defiance of all reason it cut to another scene how could i forget the completely unrelated subplot concerning a ninja being captured on and boiled in a soup hadn't been wrapped up yet br br i'm never going to get those 111 minutes back but you can spare yourself the pain unless you want to taint your memory or future enjoyment of great seijun suzuki films like youth of the beast and tokyo drifter do not see princess raccoon i would have rather spent my time vomiting
<START> a young woman jodie foster is witnessing a mafia murder reports the killing to the local police and becomes herself a hit target by the mob operatives a professional killer dennis hopper hired by mafia is stalking her to prepare for the hit but eventually he falls for her then as a parody of the stockholm syndrome that defines a case when an abducted hostage begins to like and cooperate with the kidnapper jodie foster falls for her abductor too make love and both prepare for a getaway br br denis hopper the actor tries to align himself with the creative ambitions of dennis hopper the director the result is disappointing and fails to keep pace with the artistic level of a great performer as dennis hopper is there is no real thrill and the script is sometimes naive and predictable the film is saved to some extent by the performance of jodie foster who is not at her best but still shines with her talent beauty and gift of historical interest is the short appearance of vincent price and in a small act of charlie known from his great part in wall street br br if you decide to spend the 116 minutes to see the film it is not a complete loss this movie offers easy entertainment but we would expect much more from the director of easy rider and the actress who gave us the character of sarah tobias in the accused
<START> good movie all elements of a good movie was there story actors script and direction i was on the edge of my seat the whole time br br no question about it is a low budget film but i liked it more than many big budget films br br andres plays martin sanders who is dealing with his unfaithful wife then a voice in the telephone and then just fear br br virginia lustig is beautiful and brings a powerful performance she is an excellent part to the film br br i liked the increasing ambiguity near the end even though we know that the main character can be involved we continued seeing everything from his point of view and asking who is the killer
