<START> well it has to be said that monster man is a huge mess of a film but somehow multiple different genres and a clichÃ©d plot come together to make one of the most enjoyable modern horror films i've seen in ages the two biggest styles that the film mixes are a 'road trip' style teenage comedy and a 'texas chainsaw massacre' style redneck horror vibe and while one gets in the way of the other quite often director michael davis manages to keep things moving thanks to the fact that the constant shift in tone means that we're never quite sure where the film is going to be taken next things start out worryingly as we're introduced to two characters both irritating in different ways adam is a wussy virgin while harley is a fat big mouthed a hole they're both driving across the desert to attend the wedding of some chick they both liked in high school after a couple of strange events they pick up a hitch hiker and then find themselves being chased by some maniac in a monster truck for reasons unknown br br the idea of someone being chased by someone else in a bigger vehicle is hardly original but the way the monster truck is used here is one of the film's biggest assets the truck itself looks spooky because it's so haggard and rusty and the fact that it bounces around the screen makes the unfolding action exciting and suspenseful after a while you begin to get used to the characters and once aimee brooks enters the fray things start to look up the teen comedy side of the movie actually works pretty well as justin ulrich is always on hand to deliver some entertaining lines of dialogue and the scenes between the dorky virgin and the hot female hitch hiker are interesting enough just when you think the film couldn't possibly get any messier things take a turn for the weird in the final third without spoiling things it has to be said that monster man features the sort of ending that couldn't possibly be seen coming and along with the twist is a big surprise some people may feel ripped off by the sudden turn at the end but i actually thought it worked quite well as it fits the film in that nothing here really fits overall this isn't a 'great' film by any means but if you're looking for some silly entertainment monster man should hit the spot
<START> killjoy 2 surpasses the first movie by just a little bit the stuff that improved in here was the acting the killjoy make up and story this one is more of a gore fest it doesnt have the supernatural elements like the first one did in this installment killjoy kills his victims in more normal ways he doest set them on fire and he doesnt shoot them with bullets that were in his mouth the only thing i didnt like about this movie was that the ending was a little half assed in fact it was half assed they killed killjoy in a very cheap way i would strongly recommend this to anyone who like horror movies seriously the first movie was good but the second is better 9 out of 10
<START> i loved the first movie the second one was okay disappointed john cleese wasn't jean bob anymore as hes my favorite character but the third one what happened to the animation it looks low budget like a sat morning cartoon except for the flashback which was taken from the first movie they really should have stopped after number 2 this just makes the rest look bad derek's voice has changed but its not as recognizable as jean bob rogers also looks very strange i also don't understand where came from i thought he died this movie made me want to turn it off as much as i love the first one i was very disappointed with this installment they will never beat the original
<START> a 10 year old kid fed up with his parents arguing decides to hot wire a car and go on a surreal journey across america to find cards which is a gas station card game that if he can find to spell out he has a chance to win 500 million dollars he meets many bizarre characters along the way no one can make an cult classic' joe previous after hours achieved that by sheer merit an amazing director but it wasn't instant this movie on the other hand is just bizarre just to be bizarre no rhyme or reason to any of it the plot is incidental at best and seems to exist just to showcase various cameos it's just not a fun film nor a thoughtful one it's way too slapped together i've heard many comparisons between this and david lynch films that's damn near heresy as even lynch's 'worst' film worst in quotes as he doesn't have an bad films really is still miles above this dreck br br eye candy cynthia king is topless very briefly br br dvd extras trailer for joe
<START> a young theater actress reluctantly accepts her first major part in a staged play as lady macbeth thanks to the mishap of the production's diva falling in front of a moving car a success winning her accolades betty christina finds instead horror as the one responsible for getting her to this point terrorizes her in cruel ways br br first her stage manager boyfriend stefano william mcnamara is viciously stabbed with a knife while she has to watch rope tied to a pillar in his uncle's vast mansion keeping her eyes from closing thanks to needles scotch taped under her eyes with pricking a result if she blinks allowing her to escape betty again finds herself in this unfortunate position when a specific gold chain is found on her lady macbeth wardrobe that had been torn to shreds by the madman after killing a series of crows which escaped from their cage in the equipment room by the clothing designer who is first knocked to the floor by an iron and subsequently stabbed heinously by a pair of scissors to cap off this nasty scene the chain falls into her throat with the killer having to cut open her throat to find it while not specifically elaborating this act dario uses the ripping sound of the scissors for optimum effect with the camera often retreating back to the victim's dead face having nowhere to turn inspector alan santini playing him cold and bland at request promises to catch the psycho as betty relies on her few remaining friends for comfort the theater director marco ian charleson of ghandi chariots of fire who would later die of aids a sad footnote dario revealed in an interview that charleson informed him at the end of the shoot that he was hiv positive attempting the stage after a successful horror movie career despite being rejected by critics and pal mira daria former squeeze her agent and confident but the serial killer is quite driven and a showdown between them will of course occur in the theater as marco has added an interesting change to the production using the crows at his disposal br br i think this is dario at his most savage nihilistic although he has certainly made later gruesome films such as his masters of horror entries and sleepless would suggest this film really ups the ante in pure violence towards the victims of the psychopath his method of forcing betty to watch was admittedly a gag by dario regarding the type of audience who like to look away from the more horrific parts of horror movies i found myself rubbing my eyes every time she just has to blink brilliantly dario shoots the pricking from point of view achieving a tormenting effect from our perspective as if we were the ones with the scotch taped needles holding our eyes open i like how dario will show the widened eyes of betty horrified at what she's being forced into watching as little blood tears down the needles when she has no choice but blink the photographic work of ronnie taylor is impeccable such as the point of view shot in the theater at the end as it searches for the killer or when the camera travels through rooms in the theater following the killer who wishes to see his muse from a box seat or the dream sequence where we are taken into betty's memory of an event regarding her mother's death by a certain killer donning the same mask and gloves as the one causing her trauma at present the highlight in my opinion is the peephole bullet fire sequence masterly staged by all involved as the camera follows a bullet which shoots through the eye of a victim exploding from the back of her head going through a telephone betty planned to use to call for help we even get a crow pecking the eyeball from the killer to add to this vicious scene the crow is shown with the eyeball rolling around in it's beak only aspect i didn't care for often pointed out by naysayers of the film is the final ending which i personally felt was a bit unnecessary but i guess dario wanted to point out that betty was indeed not like her mother a woman with sadomasochistic tendencies which in a twist relate to why the killer torments our heroine the rock music used during the violent scenes didn't bother me because i felt that those moments of wicked graphic attacks needed a jarring thud which heavy metal can often provide
<START> the brands in this film like suit supply take away from the story cause it's supposed to be set in the eighties it's not a very thrilling film also the single from on the soundtrack is very bad it has a chorus that is repeated numerous times' like i'm a cruel man i take it all away i'm a cruel man i'm here to stay couldn't those have come up with something better than that i guess they wrote it in a couple of minutes br br it's really annoying just like the product placement in this that cashes in on the controversy and publicity around a criminal who should not be a celebrity like he is now made out to be but should be forgotten like rats ought to be
<START> low budget murder mystery about a public defender trying to clear his client of a murder the man had been convicted of 12 years previously complicating things is the fact that he escaped custody after his conviction but the pd believes the man to be innocent of the murder and works to find the real killer gig young as the pd is okay and james anderson as the convicted killer is actually pretty good but the picture as a whole just rambles along with little suspense and despite some good character actors in the cast the performances are generally below par director george was apparently more at home making westerns he was churning out gene tv series at columbia at around this time but even if he had tried to inject any liveliness into this picture the hack script would have defeated his attempts average at best the film climaxes with a courtroom scene that's straight out of an episode of perry mason and is just as predictable
<START> i have fond memories of watching this when it came out it's one of those films that you know is rubbish even when you're a kid but at that age you overlook the ludicrous acting special effects and plot so there's a race of big busted nymphets living underground huh and just enjoy the campy monsters for all they're worth
<START> i was flipping through the channels and had to stop and laugh when i came across this movie it was so clearly about teens in the early 80s and i called my mom hahaha turn to channel such and such the kid totally looks like if dad were a kid br br um yeah turns out this movie is about my dad his friends br br even without it being about loosely based on my dad's childhood i'd say watch this movie br br it is just bizarre to say the least the apathy instilled in teens even back then this is a good human interest and showcases some strange sides of the psyche
<START> this is a entertaingly bad b movie actually it really is much better quality than a lot of b movies it had a consistent script decent direction and i have seen worse acting the zombies were great clearly these were romero zombies and was really a interesting zombie story obviously not oscar material and if your not into zombie movies or b movies you probably wont enjoy this but if you are you'll like this movie br br the main clint eastwood knockoff western character guy is pretty good although they never really clearly explain how he can heal himself from gunshots and zombie bites but if he has more than a line of dialogue that where his bad acting is really evident br br it was a good ending to at least i thought so romero should be flattered if he ever saw this
<START> island of death is not really a good movie by any standard but it is a curious one imagine if natural born killers had been made 20 years too early as a greek eurotrash porn film that's what you get here the quaint story of a young sociopathic british couple cutting a deadly swath through the population of a lovely little greek island br br i'll spare you a detailed breakdown of the plot it's not really important except to set up increasingly perverse or violent sex scenes followed by disturbingly brutal murders often lovingly photographed for posterity by our charming young couple it could have been brilliant in its own sick and nasty way but instead br br instead i found myself impatiently checking the run time and chapter index to see how much longer the parade was going to last sluggish pacing and listless bland acting turn even vilest into and connecting scenes into an eternity of dull plodding ah well you can't win 'em all
<START> every time the supposed explorers and we the audience is primed to set its first sights one of the wonderous new worlds for some ungodly reason the filmmakers decided to distract with an emergency or some false alarm or some bit of artificial dramatic suspense br br so instead of calmly enjoying the surface of or standing over the rings of saturn or concentrating on the magic of flying by a comet or an asteroid we are distracted into worrying about the wellbeing and survival of the characters big let down br br the filmmakers seem to be unsure what they want a documentary of the natural wonders in our solar system or a suspense thriller in which the viewer cares more about the characters than the subject matter come on br br hello if i wanted suspense and tension i'd watch a real narrative sci fi movie br br sure it's a docu drama but the characters and their survival here the risks of such a mission should be secondary to the subject matter wait yes the risks of such a mission are an important part of the subject matter since essentially this is a film about a space mission not just about the solar system but it was overplayed and distracted strongly from the discovery of new worlds we were supposed to be enjoying br br otherwise the film was remarkable in giving a very realistic feel for the human elements of a space mission the squabbles the tensions the weight of responsibility the near fatal mistakes the sacrifices etc also it would fit very well in the hard sci fi subgenre in fact it would be one of the best because here the science was almost closely adhered to br br but the distractions were awful br br otherwise i missed showing the effects of being in space for several years on the astronauts after landing on earth also not
<START> it must be so difficult to tell a story where not much happens yet still grip the viewers attention i think this short film achieves this with effortless quality rutger has an amazing voice that is very soothing wise and fatherly i'm not gay it reminds of the qualities that robert redford has in narrating the end is very sad but beautiful one wonders how long harry has left will he be lonely and will he get to say his goodbyes also one gets annoyed at mr hauer for not getting involved in more work of this caliber lets hope he continues to do fine work in holland and stays away from hollywood br br worth watching
<START> the 1979 film musical of hair was loosely based on the infamous 1960's broadway musical that became famous because of its infamous nude scene the stage musical isn't really much more than a group of skits strung together with some amusing musical numbers however for the film director milos foreman who won an oscar for directing one flew over the cuckoo's nest and the writers have taken the basic premise of the play and the score and constructed a real story to make the show more user friendly for the big screen in the film naive farm boy claude hooper john savage is about to go into the army and decides to spend a couple of days in new york where he meets a group of aging hippies treat williams dorsey wright annie golden don who get him involved in a group of nutty misadventures including the pursuit of a snooty society girl beverly d'angelo the story divides into a series of vignettes that range from the ridiculous to the sublime but it is all gorgeously photographed with a clever use of nyc locations and imaginatively staged musical numbers outstandingly choreographed by the legendary treat williams lights up the screen as berger the unconventional and free spirited hippie who does his best to get claude to loosen up and is matched scene for scene by savage as claude who brings a lovely sweetness to the role of claude annie golden is a charmer as jeannie the pregnant hippie who is pregnant by wright or doesn't know which one is the father and doesn't seem to care there is one outstanding musical number after another here aquarius is a tour through central park which includes dancing horses treat williams disrupts a fancy dinner party in i got life black boys white boys features the late nell carter and ellen foley extolling the ethnic virtues of men and easy to be hard is a powerful rendering of one of the best songs in the show by original cast member cheryl barnes who plays wright's ex girlfriend and mother of his child this is a beautifully photographed well acted sung and danced psychedelic acid trip of a movie that must be seen and once seen will initiate multiple viewings as this dazzler has to much to offer to catch it all in one showing
<START> i wonder if i could take sitting through a whole musical comedy from russia or east germany or other countries that for decades put out almost always propagandistic film anti fascist films anti war films as this documentary points out that just reflected the dark grueling times under stalin and life behind the iron curtain it's fascinating then to see the other side of the coin the sorts of clowns and rebels with music at their side to try and please the masses more often than not stuck in the socialist walk of life one film actually seemed rather impressive called jolly fellows by the pioneer of the very small group of musical filmmakers from the clip s i saw of that film i'd wager that it was one of the only works to actually step out of itself and go into just wild manic make you laugh kind of mode but as this film shows if you were a filmmaker looking to entertain it better be with a 'message' br br through interviews some occasional quasi dramatizations of russia germany sort of motion picture association at the censorship table and clips one gets the full picture of what it was like both behind the scenes and on the screen to just make sheer entertainment for the masses some of the films well most of them as apparently only 14 screened over 40 years in the countries mentioned made a good chunk of change but for what purpose really one also gets drawn into the culture of it all how it differs greatly from the american way of 'if it works make em while they're hot' attitude but at the same time perhaps out of this repression some interesting funny and from what i saw up beat films were made they might've been fairly typical of what was asked to be shown to the masses under fond but demanding terms like life with tractors it gets to be even juicier a story though as we get shown what it was like in the 60's the last wave of musical comedies as rock and roll and pop tunes finally hit their airwaves br br in short some good stuff but only if interested really i was shown the film in a class on documentary films and half the class fell asleep so be warned on the one hand though on the other if looking for it it can make for a really rewarding trip into european film history
