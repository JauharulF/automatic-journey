<START> i have always been a fan of the show so i'll admit that i am biased when the show's run ended i felt like too many questions remained unanswered this movie to me felt like closure to see all the people i'd followed over the past few years together at last was most rewarding i have heard that this is probably the only homicide movie that we can expect if that is so this is the appropriate way to go out this movie is sometimes poignant sometimes upsetting but always satisfying if you are or ever have been a fan of the show watch this movie
<START> a film that tends to get buried under prejudice and preconception it's a remake doris day is in it she sings hitchcock's second crack at 'the man who knew too much' is his most under rated film and arguably a fully fledged masterpiece in its own right br br this is in more ways than one doris day's film not only does she give the finest performance of her career more than holding her own against james stewart but the whole film is subtly structured around her character rather than his this is after all a film in which music is both motif and plot device what better casting than the most popular singer of her generation consider day's jo mckenna has given up her career on the stage in order to settle down with her husband and raise their son this seems to be a mutual decision and she doesn't appear to be unhappy but look at the way stewart teases her in the horse drawn carriage over her concerns about louis bernard implying that she is jealous that bernard wasn't asking her any questions about her career this is clearly a recurrent joke between them she responds with a de har that denotes the familiarity of this gag suggesting that she has a certain latent resentment about her confinement and that they both realise it br br after their son has been kidnapped stewart insists on doping her before giving her the news this is a cruel scene brilliantly played by both actors which illustrates the power imbalance in their marriage he is seeking to control and subdue her reactions in essence using his professional knowledge to suppress her voice in the marriage just as his medical career has suppressed her singing career br br the potency of that voice is demonstrated in the ambrose chapel sequence when she has to reign in its highly trained clarity and volume to blend in with the congregation of female they almost act as a warning of what will become of her if she continues to suppress her talent at the albert hall it is her need to cry out to exercise those impressive lungs that saves a man's life and in the embassy finale it is her talent and reputation that allows them to locate their son by contrast all of stewart's masculine activity is counterproductive his visit to the taxidermist is a dead end he gets left behind at the church whilst everyone else moves on to the albert hall and his efforts there only succeed in getting the assassin killed thus depriving the police of potentially useful information it is only when his action is joined to his wife's voice in the rescue of hank from the embassy that he actually succeeds in doing something useful br br far from being forced into the film to give day an opportunity to sing sera acts as the first musical device in the film foreshadowing the nightmare that is about to engulf the 'the future's not ours to see' indeed it also neatly prepares the way for the finale in which the close bond mother and son share through music will allow doris to save the day br br the most famous sequence in the film makes music the central feature the build up to the assassination attempt in the albert hall this lengthy wordless sequence may be the single most extraordinary thing hitchcock committed to film the ultimate expression of his belief that films should be stories told visually we see people conduct conversations in this sequence but we never hear a word they say we don't need to the images say everything it is also his most exquisite suspense sequence with the pieces moving slowly into place as the music builds the editing is incredibly tight matched to the music perfectly there isn't a frame out of place anything that doesn't relate directly to the assassination is giving the viewer a sense of the environment the geography in which all this is playing out it builds slowly but by the end the suspense is nearly unbearable when jo screams it isn't just a relief for her but for the audience br br the ambrose chapel sequence is witty and particularly effective for anyone who has had to sit through a service at a particularly stick in the mud church the embassy sequence seems a little flat after the albert hall one that preceded it on first viewing but second time around actually seems more effective with the final walk at gunpoint really benefiting from the gorgeous use of day singing in the background reminiscent of the music as ambient noise in the score as a whole is subtle allowing the music from on screen sources to be foregrounded effectively br br bernard miles is a low key villain a little banal but with a dry wit he's outshone by brenda de as his wife who walks a fine line between sinister and sympathetic just look at the way she smokes a cigarette whilst her husband preps the assassin her stance is pure gangster's moll belying the middle england exterior but she clearly has a soft side and possibly maternal feelings towards hank br br stewart is excellent although if hitchcock really did always cast him as 'everyman' as the director's daughter seems to think then it confirms that hitchcock had a cynical view of his audience stewart played a hypocritical intellectual who espoused fascist ideology in rope a voyeur who mistreated his girlfriend in rear window and an obsessive necrophiliac in vertigo day is nothing short of phenomenal just look at her reaction to the news that her son has been kidnapped she never overdoes anything but neither does she sell it short this is one of hitchcock's most emotionally effective films he never lets us forget what the stakes are for the they feel the most fully human of all his central characters
<START> my brother was working at a movie theater when i saw this movie i saw it for free and still walked out i have seen a lot of movies in my time but this was the worst when people ask me what the worst movie i have ever seen was i mention this movie in less than one second this movie is bad because it goes from one lame plot set up to the next it encourages stereotypes about blacks that are sickening and the flow is awful if you want to see how to make children cry and vomit at the same time then study this movie okay this movie is not good bad but terrible bad if you are like one of those people that watch horrible movies for fun like me you will not even be able to make it through this very short film please for the love of god destroy all copies of this movie
<START> i saw this movie a time ago because some of my friends wanted to rent it and i got voted down i tried as best i could to get the story because some had said that this would be a movie that would be for rob lowe that pulp fiction had been for john travolta well we can all see that he not only failed but he fell the way down this is actually the worst film i've ever seen and i've seen a great deal of bad movies it's just not even worth seeing for free on tv
<START> boring movie poor plot poor actors the movie happens in a room supposed to be in morocco but actually in some american city the arab terrorists are the patriots the blonde patriot is the arab terrorist damn br br there is something good about this movie though that's why the score is 2 out of 10 the director turns the ridiculous stereotype about terrorism the media feeds us every day into the real thing the terrorists are americans or western people if you like br br the movie is divided into two parts the first part of the movie concerns the dutchman travel 15 seconds while the second part is about the staying in the amazing dark brown room 1 hour and something br br the dutch guy is going to deliver money in morocco to some charity organization gets off the plain takes the bus and ends up kidnapped in a dark brown room he is kidnapped with another guy that is shot after telling they will not shoot at us the dutch survivor is forced to play chess with a morpheus like arab guy for so long that you'll learn how to play chess too at the end the dutch guy reveals his plot not because they cut four of his fingers off but because he is tricked by such a lame game you should watch the movie for br br good when you are so tired you can't sleep
<START> when i went to see this movie i thought that this would just be another chic flick i would have to endure with my sister plus too amanda last movie was not so hot making me doubt the movie for she is the lead actress however within 5mins i was laughing so hard i had tears in my eyes the jokes were not out there that it took more then a second to understand it but very funny the script was not too complex that i could not understand the love triangle but was very true to the original play by shakepeare i loved every minute of it so much that i kicked a guy two seats away from me in a fit of laughter lol very embarrassing i'd definitely advise people to see this movie especially girls as the guys in this movie are hot hot hot lol so much so that i might just get it on dvd
<START> to begin with its a rip off of the japanese film battle royal except it's missing the one thing that made br unique balls it's a weak satire at best and as far as the real tv phenomena it attempts to comment on well everyone knows how warped and stupid that genre can be so why was this film made
<START> when you think of brilliant australian comedy you don't think of skit shows although i'm quite partial to a bit of 80's and 90's full frontal or even sitcoms you think of satire something that we australians really know how to do well eg front line the program we know how to take the pi and the war on everything is a classic example of how to do it and how to do it really well br br i've been a huge fan of chris taylor and craig for a long time i remember listening to them on triple j's afternoon show they were and remain two of the funniest comedians around br br although i was sad when they left triple j i was excited to find out what they were investing so much time in that made them have to leave they were doing and triple j at the same time so i figured this was something much bigger and what an amazingly hilarious show chaser is biting political and social satire at it's best br br i'm also pleased to say that it has recently received a much better time slot than friday nights and has been moved to wednesday nights right after and specks thank you abc finally i don't have to tape it
<START> if you like the three stooges you'll undoubtedly like this 17 minute short there were certainly some amusing moments in it but like all the stooges' work this revolves around their particular style of slapstick comedy and i have to confess that somehow the stooges just never really did it for me their slapstick always seemed angry rather than funny and even though it was obviously fake their antics always seemed more likely to cause hurt rather than to cause laughter in this short the slapstick revolves around the attempts to find shemp who is a professor of music in this a wife because he's just inherited half a million dollars on condition that he marry within 48 hours of the will being read one of his students is interested but once word of the inheritance gets out there's suddenly a long line up of potential brides and a pretty good cat fight emerges between them fans of the stooges will enjoy for me it has all the elements that drive me nuts about them 4 10
<START> this movie rocked saw it at a screener a weeks ago kinda a strange story where james franco plays this jerk who marries sienna miller just to get out of the country and they go to niagara falls for their honeymoon don't wanna give it away cuz the movie isn't released yet but its totally cool and you would never expect the stuff that happens i kinda thought i would hate it cuz its a romance but its also kinda twisted and stuff which i like a lot the acting is really good and sienna miller is totally smokin' and plays this really sweet girl i think she should do more roles like this james plays a jerk but you end up liking him and the end of the movie is really good david carradine plays a cowboy and he is good i gave this movie a 10 because i came out of the movie really liking it and wanting to see it again which i didn't expect and my girlfriend really liked it and cried good date flick
<START> if you thought day after tomorrow was implausible wait till you see this br br okay so the premise of most disaster films is usually a 1 in billion event occurring compounded by other circumstances in this case the even is the joining of two huge storm systems fair enough so far oh but hold up no the event is the sabotage and subsequent destruction of the power grid br br next throw in loads of human interest elements in this case a cheating husband a psychotic gun wielding boyfriend a rebellious daughter a hacker with a point to prove a senator trying to push an agenda a reporter trying to stand up against the man and a pregnant women stuck in an elevator br br finally add a handful of taster events to add excitement br br jeez if the director tried to fit in any more meaningless plot lines there would have been no time less for the actual disaster which given the pitiful state of the computer graphics was almost certainly the intention br br jeez if you can't even model a truck convincingly you really should not be taking on twisters exploding power stations las vegas getting ripped apart or destroyed oil stations br br in case you didn't already gather how appalling this movie is let me just add that all three bad guys get killed in separate and wholly ungratifying implausible manners that stunk more of moralising that good film making br br i'm have no problem with first month film students writing jaded hackneyed clichÃ© soaked scripts but for god's sake that doesn't mean anyone has to make them into movies br br it manages to make the abysmally implausible 10 0 apocalypse look not quite so dreadful avoid them both
<START> well built doris day as ethel s dynamite jackson is mistaken for thespian ethel barrymore and falls in love with dancer ray bolger as s sam putnam older frenchman claude dauphin as philippe also digs doris what were they thinking this wildly inappropriate musical does feature ms day prettily singing the standard april in paris and others certainly there nothing as good as her columbia recordings from the time and nothing approaches day's stunning and forthcoming secret love although the material does not serve him well it's nice to see mr bolger performing some of the musical numbers are obnoxious br br april in paris 12 24 52 david butler doris day ray bolger claude dauphin
<START> apparently the writer and director of this direct to dvd slasher movie is a fan of friday 13th and other summer camp slashers this movie has everything a group of teenagers who want to spend the weekend with fun alcohol and sex in an abandoned summer camp called camp blood the old man who warns them not to go there and of course the crazy killer with the machete who keeps on slashing and hacking at the teenagers without any reason at all the whole thing could have worked if it had been shot on 35 mm film with acceptable special effects but instead the special effects are poorly done the killer walks around as if he's out on a sunday afternoon stroll and the only good things about this movie are the acting of the talented main actress and the sex scene at the beginning other than that dull and forgettable jasper p morgan
<START> biographical tale of the life of charles lindbergh the first man to fly solo non stop across the atlantic in 1927 aboard his plane the spirit of st louis br br while not amongst director billy wilder's best films it does boast some very impressive production values especially for a film made 50 years ago the story is well told and the performances are also good though not outstanding br br one definite limiting factor upon the storytelling is that lindbergh flew alone and without a radio which meant he has no one to speak with this necessitated a few different story telling techniques such as internal monologues speaking with a and the occasional bouts of talking to himself especially once the exhaustion sets in also in order to avoid an extended sequence of the famous flight it is interspersed with flashbacks from his life and the methodical preparations for the flight br br charles lindbergh was a huge hero of his era but his controversial beliefs would taint his legacy somewhat despite this he would continue to contribute to the aviation field and assisted as a civilian aircraft consultant to the us effort in wwii br br jimmy stewart certainly had the flying background to back his portrayal of lindbergh he rose to the rank of colonel in us air force during wwii and while in the reserves following the war would reach the rank of brigadier general
<START> this aussie flick filmed in 1999 does an ok job of portraying a bunch of small time crooks in kings cross sydney the plot focuses on the plight of a young would be who's life is in danger after botching a job for his future boss very well acted by heath ledger and bryan brown the plot is fairly believable with some very humorous moments in one scene which revolves around a bank heist the setting up of various themes central to the story is quite well done eg when one is searching for bullets for his gun i personally have a dislike for gratuitous violence in movies and in this regard the movie did not offend it attempted and succeeded in showing us the human side of the baddies such as bryan brown the rest of the cast did an ok job without any real stand outs that i remember the direction was very good in succeeding in making a believable movie that provided good entertainment the main overriding feature that makes this a good movie is the acting and direction of heath ledger and his successful portrayal of a naive young man who makes stupid mistakes for short term gratification thinking he is indestructible and not realizing that there are sinister people waiting to pounce on any mistake the director gregor jordan deserves special mention rating in my book 7 of 10
