<START> from what i understand mr bava abandoned this project before completion and rightfully so if i were him i definitely would have made sure that every copy was burned and if anybody in the future ever asked me about this film it never happened it never existed end of story br br despite some great sets and good photography this is one horrible film is it supposed to be scary not in the least is it supposed to be funny puh leese a total waste of time and i really don't like to have to say that
<START> if all movies had to be destroyed and only one could be spared death in venice would have to be it it is a monument in movie history much criticized for being slow boring and too obvious in stating it's point an old man discovers beauty in a young boy and is tragically destroyed first mentally then physically we should appreciate this movie for what it is a was shot over 30 years ago and it portrays a period even further back at the beginning of the twentieth century br br life was slow then compared to now people were supposed to behave in a certain way hiding their true emotions even from themselves director visconti and dirk bogarde the leading actor admirably succeed in showing how the aging composer von discovers his romantic interest in a young boy for a man like von in his time this must have been a shock too powerful to come to terms with we see his inner struggle mostly on the face of bogarde against the beautiful backdrop of venice and accompanied by the most wonderful music composed by gustav br br this movie is slow there is no denying it no special effects car chases or fights to keep the audience pinned to their seats no perverted sex scenes either the interaction between man and boy is limited to stolen glances from afar and the occasional smile br br so basically nothing much happens in this movie not if you want your senses to be hit like a base drum if you want them to be played like the strings of a violin in a romantic concerto this is the movie to do it
<START> first of all let me just say that after watching this movie i felt like i'd been sold a bill of goods mind you it's not the movie's fault that imdb has it listen as a comedy first and a horror second although i don't know how that's entered maybe some moron from the film's crew put it in being a fan of the horror comedy genre i checked it out based on that and i'm so so sorry i did where to start first of all to touch back on my beginning there's no comedy in this movie it tries once or twice but never gets more than a chuckle at best my reaction was primarily rolling my eyes and wondering why someone thought such tired material would be funny also there's no horror here not a second of tension can be found you think i'm exaggerating i am not no tension very little blood and not much violence on screen sorry but in a horror flick cutting away just as the good stuff starts is a major foul hell there's even zero nudity call me a purist or juvenile i prefer some in a horror flick if it can't come up with an original plot premise and that tired as all hell reality tv show gone wrong thing it's been done before and a lot better like wrong turn 2 or ummm whatever that movie was called with edward furlong that's how bad this movie is i don't even remember the name of that movie but it was better than this i also enjoyed the one comment claiming the timing for this was good because reality tv is taking over did someone from the past post that with a time machine are you freaking kidding me this thing is trash and not in a fun way
<START> as you may know norway is the most developed country in the world regarding to human development index this film craftily reveal our future to us our future would be that of norway since we are all paddling to achieve the best and offer the least the life that was shown was maybe an exaggeration yet comparing today's concerns with those of our ancestors it is not far from reality reasoning br br watching this film free from all of our pre assumptions we can find both of our faces the one that is laughing at the brilliant scene of andreas dumping her girlfriend and the one that is searching through magazines hours and hours to choose some stupid chair among stupid collections br br the idea of the hole with the hope of lightness was another magnificent idea of the film the slight glory yet the only one and the effort that was put to reach it makes us feel closer to andreas br br although i was attracted mostly to the idea and production of the film played pretty well and the atmosphere of the film was quite
<START> ladies and gentlemen be sad or be glad we are in the disgusting forensic t v series era now count with me and our luck br br csi crime scene investigation csi miami csi ny ncis crossing jordan da inquest even the cosby mysteries didn't we already have enough br br from the late 1990 till the late 2000s we've got almost the same sick series about the genius criminologist with a partner or a team who go to solve crimes by scrutiny the autopsy and what a nauseating mission to do so you will have for sure lots and lots of repellent scenes where we see clearly accurately and awfully the most horrific shots in the history of t v br br oh god once we had the great days the good cop or detective era such as columbo kojak magnum and simon simon or the good old sci fi era like the six million dollar man the bionic woman knight rider and oh boy we've got also the hot sexy such cover up the love boat baywatch even a flop as thunder in paradise br br all of those were unforgettable original had good real good thoughts action women till the x files came and then it was the beginning of the misfortune or to be exact the catastrophe br br x files undoubtedly was one of the greatest but there was a few slight disadvantages we had have agent dana scully medical doctor and fbi agent at every episode doing an autopsy and of course her lap as the series succeed became part of our living room so the thirsty for money producers loved it with all the physical terror the exciting hunt for the truth therefore they tried to repeat it in another not too far classification the forensic br br but it became so ugly full of and very cruddy just like bones plus the unsexy present of emily deschanel and bleeder as david boreanaz he was much better in angel and all of these corpses to the extent that every time i've watched it i found my self screaming what a terrible gross br br cancel it please you've canceled before real good shows such as the lone gunmen or a man called hawk here it's a bad one so please little mercy and enough with the bones era or we'll drop dead ourselves of nausea and monotony
<START> this is an incredibly fun action exploitation 80s rocker charles bronson rules as paul the villains are hilariously bad the soundtrack by jimmy page is laughably bad alex winter bill of bill ted is great as one of the street punks who gets wasted by bronson and crew crew oh those are the downtrodden townsfolk who team up with bronson to win back the streets the whole movie is enjoyable with the last half hour or so exploding into non stop action and mayhem 9 10
<START> o boy was this really bad br br i saw this on videotape br br in scenes that had soundtrack music it was hard to hear the dialog when people were on the telephone it was hard to hear the person on the other end it appeared that at least two different kinds of film or video stock were used because the colors and focus sometimes shifted drastically between edits and there were a lot of out of focus shots that didn't seem intentional br br one indicator of the budget one of many was when a news report comes on tv there is just a news flash title card badly superimposed with a video effect onto a tv screen and a voice over by a newscaster they couldn't shoot footage of a newscaster and then actually show it on the tv br br the movie starts off with a killer wearing surgical scrubs and mask wielding a scalpel supposedly he's a paranoid schizophrenic who escapes from the hospital to avoid having a lobotomy performed on him br br students are let out of school for a break and three young women decide to have a slumber party three guys decide to crash the party and a geek named science decides to crash it too the slumber party is pretty boring and the guys just keep showing up randomly wearing masks taking the masks off and then disappearing the mother and father the surgeon who was to do the lobotomy of one of the girls keep showing up too the killer knocks slices people's throats without anyone really noticing the apparent lead of the movie more or less sleepwalks through the movie perhaps that was bad acting or maybe it was intentional since much of the movie is a nightmare and some of it a nightmare within a nightmare br br the ending is really horrible too br br the best thing about the movie is the cheesy united home video vhs box art which was revived for the dvd release a double feature with terror at i honestly can't tell if it is a photo or a painting or a combination of both the women pictured on the cover are not in the movie and the clothing they're wearing is way more revealing than anything the women in the movie wore the throat slicing on the cover is scarier than the ones in the movie where people tend to affect a goofy pop eyed look for that matter that's what the killer has most of the time head cocked and eyes bugging out mugging for the camera frequently the scalpel was held up close to the camera in focus while the killer's mask covered face was in close up but out of focus in the background
<START> excellent example of the disaster that happens when you combine a challenging script with two actors chosen for physical appeal it is rare for me to be consciously aware of the acting during the first viewing of a movie because i try to just go with the story and save the analysis for the second viewing in the case of full ride the acting was so weak that the movie was impossible to appreciate as a story i was too busy during first and only viewing alternating between laughter and nausea br br fortunately for most individual members of the cast pretty much everyone in the ensemble is weak the individual talent limitations do not contrast with any actual competent acting riley smith and meredith monroe are at least well matched physically finding common ground in looking far too old for the credible age of their characters br br unfortunately the script requires especially intense and convincing performances to portray their characters which just exposes smith and monroe's staggering lack of talent on the positive side they know enough to not look directly into the camera and they do not stutter br br better to have used a less attractive pair who could physically pass for the proper age the basic story is not particularly original just another variation on an officer and a gentleman but it would have provided a nice showcase for a talented pair of teenage actors br br then again what do i know i'm just a child
<START> walter matthau is best remembered for the long series of comedies he did with his equal comedy partner jack lemmon from the fortune cookie to the odd couple ii but people tend to forget that in the late 1970s he appeared with another partner in two films a female partner this was glenda jackson the english double oscar winner who demonstrated her comic abilities against matthau's first in house calls and then in matthau's role was slightly larger in both films because his characters were more central to the plots but the chemistry between them was quite good if you ever want to see two pros demonstrating how sexual intercourse can be crazily funny watch walter and glenda as dr charley nicholson and ann atkinson experimenting to see if two people could have sex on a bed under the old movie code rule of the two parties each having one leg on the floor never has sex been looked at from such a clinical and mechanical point of view br br matthau's charlie has just been widowed before the film began he has only had one woman in his life his wife so now he's the eligible bachelor he also is the leading surgeon in the hospital he works out of but the chief surgeon is dr amos art carney carney is apparently senile there are moments later in the film that show he turns his senility on and off see the scene where he rams richard benjamin's car amos is up for re election charlie is his closest competitor for the post if he wants it however amos manages to convince charlie to let him keep the job for reasons of self esteem br br one day charlie notices ann in the hospital she has had a slight accident and is resting in bed but amos has put her into a cage like apparatus which charlie remarks has not been used since about 1920 he gets her out of the device and soon is romancing her she joins the staff of the hospital but she is critical of charlie's willingness to cater to amos and she is critical of certain selfish tendencies she sees among the doctors in the hospital br br bungling causes the death of a wealthy patron of the hospital lloyd gough who owned a baseball team his greatest innovation being separate admission costs for double amos tries to calm down the young widow of the team owner delivering the eulogy at the burial service the line in the summary above is the line of the eulogy however she is still determined to sue her lawyer thayer david says the hospital is the most incompetent he's ever seen so amos suggests that charlie romance the widow to satisfy her from that expensive lawsuit but how will ann react to this the film is quite amusing and was so successful that besides causing a sequel for jackson and matthau it led to a television series as well
<START> after watching this movie on tv i looked it up in the imdb and imagine to my surprise a user rating of 7 6 this is not a good film especially bad is the editing the poor way the story jumps from one point to another was amateurish and a huge distraction it's not very fluently done i do agree that the acting was fairly decent especially kelly and that the story was intriguing enough
<START> first off let it be known that i came into this movie not for the music actually i find it repugnant really i was interested in the psychology of the punk subculture on this point the documentary did fairly well one disagreeable aspect was the numerous scenes in which songs are played and the hyped up band and belligerent crowd are shown running amok if you've seen the first such scene you've seen them all this is party made up for by printing lyrics for some of the songs with these the audience is able to somewhat connect mentally with the band the lyrics are of far more interest than the jumble of sounds projecting from the speakers i don't know why all the lyrics were not printed scenes without lyrics slow ironic eh given the many references to the speed of the music the flow of the movie also insightful were the interviews with fans and bands though there is a letdown when the latter band's interviews prove to be not nearly as enthralling or humorous as the first two overall a good movie that i'm glad i saw i'll check out the follow ups if i ever get a chance br br favorite quote he tried to hide the fact that he couldn't play by rubbing peanut butter over himself and breaking glass br br broad punk generalization though their lack of vocabulary and hygiene and drug induced is often hilarious in the end it is understood that punks are just pathetic juveniles who rebel just for the sake of rebellion as seen through sophomoric lyrics and naive attempts to philosophize and disregarding black flag who are slightly less misguided than their peers
<START> a strange relationship between a middle aged woman and a transsexual who gonna be a woman soon charlotte and both trapped by their inanimate lives and don't know how to get out of them charlotte is an owner of a beauty clinic she has broken up with her aggressive ex husband moved into an apartment alone with all the furniture packed except her big bed veronica lives downstairs with her poor dog she's sensitive and desperately bothered by her mother's visiting and the bad relationship with her dad her only hope is that the upcoming transsexual operation will turn her into a real woman and then everything will be fine all she can do now is waiting for an approval certificate br br then these two individuals meet by chance and gradually they are all involved into other's lives there are some sparkles between them but no one is brave enough to face the truth because they are not willing to accept the change as most people do eventually the ending is quite satisfying and leaves some imagination for us to think about it br br the director's great work gives me an great impression she handles the development of characters very well the emotional atmosphere is quite full and intense also i am so obsessed with the gloomy lights all over the apartment but full of desire br br two main characters are played by and david they are amazing in their roles a very impressive performance and the chemical reaction between them is genuine and convincing br br this swedish indie film is about encountering and change no matter you're homosexual or heterosexual male or female the oddness of life exists everywhere whenever you fall across it you'll be hesitate and bewildered but at least don't be afraid follow your heart and choose the right way
<START> ok let's start with the good nice scenery channing tatum is easy to look at amanda has nice hair that's about it how much of this movie went on the editing room floor probably the plot action good dialogue and point terrible acting horrible choppy dialogue let me tell you how bad it is my friend who always cries at movies got to the part that was meant to evoke tears and she laughed so hard we thought she was crying the movie seems to want to take a stab at too many issues war loss autism cancer but fails so miserably to cover any one topic satisfactorily make sure you have something to munch on and your cell phone to return text messages
<START> this short has all the elements of a great movie every time i show it to friends on dvr they love it too the dialog is so 'real' the acting is superb while the effects props weren't as convincing by themselves taken with everything else in the shot they are expertly placed used the music is so haunting perfect for this kind of film people who hold dear their beliefs and thoughts are shaken to their core about what they see in this movie most go 'that's it ' but in the end they blossom with new understanding and leave the movie with one word to describe it br br 'beautiful' the beauty of the film is also skin deep i love the fact that there aren't any conflicting views no other voices and the voices that you do hear are agreeing with each other no conflict but at the same time there is one and the ending made me love it more harsh reality sometimes is more film worthy than any plot device or twist br br wasn't joshua leonard the guy in blair witch project movie by a fictitious dead guy great
