<START> this is not your run of the mill police story where the characters were only secondary to the gun battles and car chases the episodes so far are more realistic and intelligent br br if you are looking for something with a lot of butt kicking rambo style cop story you will not find it here br br i gave it a 9 i wish this series lives long morse is excellent
<START> sure it has its pretentious moments it plays like art house live action fantasia but it also has moments of deep beauty and humor omnibus films are always a problem but i have always had a keen interest in them i will now rate the segments individually br br nicolas roeg un in maschera this segment may very well spoil the film for some people because it is absolutely the worst of the whole bunch it is difficult to follow mostly because it tries to adhere to a clear plot a hackneyed one at that the photography is unaccomplished the best thing about it is the bit of lesbian homoerotica that it never does enough with this segment made me very nervous about continuing 2 10 br br charles la virgine degli angeli an unclear segment but it hardly matters the film has the best cinematography of the bunch mainly because it is in a stunning black and white the segment is dreamlike and beautiful 7 10 br br jean luc godard i chose to brave this much maligned film for the godard and altman segments with godard i was much more impressed than i thought i would be i can't claim to have seen all that many of his films since he made so many that almost no one has seen but judging from what i have seen this may be his best work since the 60s it is the funniest segment in this film and the most artistically accomplished bravo jean luc 9 10 br br julien temple rigoletto a very funny segment it is also quite predictable still this story about a husband and wife who are cheating on each other at the same resort is wonderfully filmed with long complex tracking shots that depend on precisely timed choreography from the actors it also has a great self referencing joke about omnibus films themselves the final scene is very weak 7 10 br br bruce beresford die tote this short segment involves too lovers in i think venice it is pretty with some nice shots of doves flying about the city it is slight but nice 7 10 br br robert altman les not one of the better segments unfortunately this is more of a music video than a concept short film it involves the occupants of an insane asylum attending a theatrical performance the music and images work well together so at least i can give it credit for being a good music video 7 10 br br franc somewhat unfortunate for beresford's segment this segment is very similar to it as you might assume from my phrasing this one struck me much more it is about a young man and his girl going to las vegas on a fatalistic voyage 8 10 br br ken russell nessun dorma maybe the most visually striking segment it plays in a fantasy world more than in reality it is a beautiful tale of a fallen angel 8 10 br br derek jarman le jour i have heard a lot about jarman and this is the first piece of filmmaking i have seen from him hopefully i'll see more in the future this one is also music but it is better than altman's it mainly concerns an old woman remembering her younger days the editing and the use of different film stocks to represent both time and emotion are very beautiful 8 10 br br bill bryden i the sad clown possibly one of the most famous arias particularly memorable from an episode of seinfeld this serves as the material separating each and the finale it is simple and effective 7 10 br br overall i give it a solid 7 10 it isn't anywhere near as bad as you've heard
<START> intriguing premise should have been a 20 minute short that's how long it would take his biological parents to think hmm we lost one son and never found him who is about his age and he looks like our remaining son oh yes and he's a runaway hmm but no this is the most clueless family in history and the conclusion while trying to jerk tears manages only to induce more groans of disbelief
<START> a good entertainment but nothing more in this western we are between the classics and the spaghetti ones this provides us a good a conventional story but it's always a pleasure to see robert mitchum with his legendary although he isn't as fit as in the forties or the fifties and don't forget david carradine is the son of john carradine
<START> an extremely down to earth well made and acted rodeo western no gussied up stars needed here as all cast members were regular people telling a real life story about a rodeo hustler and his entourage in the 60's and 70's west but hats off particularly to slim pickens for giving what i think was his signature performance especially given the fact that he had been a rodeo clown in real life his role went far beyond the mere clown role as he deeply dealt with all the ups and downs of the hard nosed rodeo life and the psychological devastation that so frequently surrounds such a life style he and mr coburn teamed up extremely well as partners not only on the circuit itself but also in the real world outside the corral also check out anne archer as coburn's native american love interest in the latter part of the movie must have been one of her first roles br br not as flashy perhaps as junior bonner but equally heart rendering and impacting in its portrayal thanks to the encore western channel for showing this true grit of an under rated movie from time to time
<START> to start off i'm easily pleased i'm in no way a real critic and movies that authentic critics friends family and newspapers may find awful may even be fun for me to watch br br not this one however br br i got it since it was the newest wesley snipes movie in my dvd store i like snipes but this was a let down br br bad story bad actors continuity glitches crappy sound depressing locations a pseudo cool snipes i really had to force myself to finish the movie br br they even left some markings in the shots where a car was supposed to come to a stop br br and i'm not talking about small production company young director low budget kind of bad where you may ignore some mistakes because you feel sympathy br br a wanna be block buster action movie that disappoints like no other in a long time
<START> from a bare description of the toll major plot elements one might think it's a revisionist western of the 60s or 70s br br our hero is a robber killer and arsonist br br the love interest is a single mother whose shiftless husband abandoned her and their child br br twice our criminal hero is unofficially released by authorities in return for some good deed and this is presented as a praiseworthy act br br the only acts which are presented as truly evil are the betrayal of one's family and the betrayal of a criminal associate br br the hero tries to go straight but turns back to a life of crime after he can't get a job br br the hero is on the run from both a sheriff's posse and a criminal gang br br the hero's final redemption is accomplished by strangling a man with his bare hands and tossing his body over a cliff br br and the good bad man ends the film by sending the young mother and her child back to civilization and riding off alone into the mexican desert never presumably to pay for his life of crime br br just goes to show you that there is nothing new under the sun br br of course the toll gate doesn't display quite the cynicism or moral nihilism of its successors the hero's redemption is set up when he surrenders to the posse after reading a passage from the bible can't quite imagine clint eastwood doing that br br the toll gate an excellent movie by any standard and hart was a very fine actor not given to the broad histrionics often used to convey emotion in the days before sound br br 9 10
<START> want a great recipe for failure take a crappy leftist political plot add in some weak completely undeveloped characters and then throw in the worst sequences a movie has ever known let stew for a week the amount of time probably spent making this trash br br the result is this movie ' a cinematic experience that takes bad movies to dangerous and exotically low places never before conceived br br this movie utterly blew chunks at my face for its entire run time words cannot convey how painful it was to watch this is not one of those bad movies that you and your friends can sit around and make fun of this is not 'plan 9 from outer space ' this is a long boring and sad waste of time this movie' is the biggest waste of energy and talent i have ever seen it depresses me when i realize that people actually took time out of their lives to act in this tripe if you can call it acting but then again when you have poor direction poor writing poor everything acting is the last thing to criticize br br this movie is like a huge disgusting turd that you yearn to quickly flush out of existence fearful that a friend or loved one might somehow see it i really wish i could somehow destroy every copy of this film so it will not pollute the minds of aspiring filmmakers thank you robert for giving me newfound respect for every other movie i have ever seen you have shown me what is truly awful and why i should appreciate all those movies that are merely crappy and or boring
<START> two hands is a highly enjoyable aussie crime caper which ultimately succeeds by the way the film easily combines tense dramatic moments with very funny characters and situations to give the film the right balance and feel the comedy of the film occurs naturally and the laughs haven't been set up too elaborately haven't been too worked at it really is very funny thanks to the fact that each character in the movie is excellently cast and that each actor actress recognises and can relate to the aussie humor they portray it very well and very realistically of course they're helped out immensely by a fantastic script by writer director gregor jordan i was reading another review of this film by an american who had seen it and he heavily criticised it basically passing it off as a pulp fiction clone i think that that's just rubbish this film isn't trying to be pulp fiction the feel and style of each of this excellent films are totally opposite without wanting to sound superior or arrogant i think to fully understand this film the humor the sincerity the characters etc you have to be australian or at least understand the culture which the other guy obviously didn't have the faintest clue about some americans whose reviews of certain non american films seem ignorant to and have trouble comprehending anything that isn't an american product it's a real shame because this is a really great film the love story featured between the main character and the girl is also portrayed in a very real sincere and sweet way i'm very proud to have this film in my collection 4 5 out of 5
<START> i watched this movie when it was released and being really young and not too much into cinema it was one of the most fascinating cinematic experiences i ever had and it really left a mark inside me at first i didn't quite understand the story and probably failed to make the necessary between past and present as the movie presents them to the viewer br br years after i first watched i managed to watch it again and this was the time that i fell in love with 'the english patient' it touched me so deeply and for me it became the best film ever made br br anthony made an absolutely stunning film all the locations are amazing and through his camera he manages to create unbelievable emotions inside you br br of course the music of the film is such a big part of the whole emotional journey of the characters and the film would not be the same without it br br but personally the best thing was the fragile performance that ralph fiennes gave in this masterpiece he plays so well the man that falls in love slowly but so deeply with katherine clifton opens up his heart and dives into this prohibited affair br br the most heart breaking scene for me will always be the one where hurt katherine is carried by towards the cave of swimmers and she wears the that he bought her she says 'i always wore it i always loved you' and at that moment he starts crying with such pain flowing from inside him br br juliette binoche is also amazing in her performance and really deserved the oscar she won br br overall this is a film that anybody who proclaims himself a cinema lover should watch in their lives
<START> spoilers ahead br br great wrestlemanias were still a few years away but this one was certainly good with lots of good matches and one great match br br demolition was always at their best at wrestlemania i'm glad their last wm hoorah i refuse to include the other version was a win over the colossal connection i liked the gag of andre never tagging in br br few fans know that this was the first time anyone ever beat mr perfect for some reason brutus feat was never recognized or the fact that he did it pretty easily br br the hart win over the bolsheviks was the shortest in wm history including the 24 9 second match between king kong bundy and s d jones br br i'm glad jake and dibiase got to fight at wrestlemania this made up for the fact that the feud had to be put on hold for so long br br i expected the big bossman akeem feud to heat up but the bossman just clobbered him as good as bossman was as a heel he was just great as a face he was always intense and obviously loved his job br br if the warrior just had a better work ethic and maybe tried to learn to wrestle he would have been a great wwf champion br br worth a watch especially since the boring matches are too short to complain about and the tag team matches are all very exciting
<START> i am a german student so sorry for eventually mistakes i'm working on it br br the stylistic very interesting converted and with effective sound effects accentuated platitudinous action of the drama deflect in no way from the horrible bad actors insincere and unnatural moves and expressions of feelings and makes so the relatively weird and senseless story less better just the typical slasher genre with in this case very odd action many by plays destroy partly the main story and let the viewers up to the end into the dark create weirdness and let surmise the senses of actions and the point mere for sure its an hit for slasher fans but not for me but although the interesting style of cinematography and adeptly use of light is turned out well br br so not the best one
<START> this quirky and watchable film is the story of a deluded dentist who starts out on his mission or crusade to fight tooth decay in the back and of hailing from northern ireland via new jersey the main character sees his crusade as a mission of mass importance and approaches it with all the enthusiasm vitality discipline and attention to detail one would expect from a trained dentist which adds to the hilarity as his grand plans unravel and gradually fall to pieces as he goes from disaster to debacle in the outback on the back of a customised motor bike or his er mobile dental unit we never get to meet his wife nor the rich philanthropist who is sponsoring the ill fated mission but we do get a solid display from lewis fans of his work will not be disappointed with his very believable performance as the deluded dentist who is adored by the innocent but sexy 18 year old female lead who tags along on for the ahem ride br br this film is not for everyone and i can understand why it wasn't pushed by the suits it's a low budget sometimes charming always disarming mildly amusing and instantly forgettable film that sets out with low expectations and almost succeeds
<START> it could not have come from a different country nor from a different time this movie simply oozes psychedelia influenced late 60s italian cinema so pseudo serious and sexually free sumptuous settings and dreamy music make this a visual and aural delight plus we get the lovely dagmar lassander surely at her very best looking the kinky goings on make for a wild ride and if the romps amidst the towards the end seem overlong it is but another rather charming trait of the time you were probably expected to split those few minutes between the screen and your girlfriend and it does of course herald a twist in the proceedings it might have been better if philippe leroy didn't look quite so odd with his red hair and twisted facial expression he does well though and has many silent moments where dagmar is cavorting and he has to show a mixture of love and hate not an ordinary narrative film by any means but for those who like that something different this is certainly that
<START> and are part of an dying breed of political film makers the swedish population should appreciate that they try to uncover the truth when the government and media actively distorts and cover up the events surrounding the eu meeting in gothenburg it is absolutely heartbreaking to see how these innocent kids have been abused and drugged by the swedish police and convicted to prison in political trials for sending text messages and as revenge for others actions the only unfortunate thing about this movie is that it will not reach the broad masses in sweden as it will only be shown it theaters and not be released on video or aired on television br br the political film is important as it can bring new perspectives and insight into complex issues and has a role to play as an educator of the masses
