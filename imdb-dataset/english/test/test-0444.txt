<START> it's not real flashy but this movie does a great job of developing a large cast of characters and letting you know their hopes and desires while still managing to be both funny and bittersweet a very sweet movie fun also to see vincent d'onofrio and mary louise parker so early in their careers
<START> i really don't know if this was supposed to be science fiction or horror it was confusing to say the least what really upset me however was the lack of story development between the characters br br the sheriff's bruce 17 year old daughter clara bryant is stuck with him for the summer and they don't spend 30 seconds on screen together at any one time br br the hot native american jennifer lee wiggins apparently has the hots for the sheriff but they don't spend any time together either br br the hot secretary kristen honey ends up dead and she had more acting ability than the other two put together br br the bad developer vs the native americans is an overused story but i personally like evil developers getting theirs as i live in florida br br the only reason i stayed with this was the creature it was original i have never seen anything like it and i am a sucker for new creatures
<START> warning some spoilers included though it is a documentary br br i bought this documentary because i like the work of the directors d a and chris which includes moon over broadway com and the war room all terrific documentaries i would highly recommend watching this ultimately boring and account from 1988 tour i realized they had nothing to work with when they went to edit this film together the band members were certainly less than forthcoming on camera hence undoubtedly the contest to add fans on a one week bus trip was added to liven things up a bit really now i mean c'mon who thought a concert film of a synth pop band with three keyboardists and a singer would be a good idea granted i like music and martin gore writes good melodies but seeing them in concert never seemed like it would be interesting and this movie is proof positive unless you are a huge fan of mode stay away from this documentary it's a complete waste of time
<START> here is a movie that was so pedestrian for 90 of it that it had no right to become so challenging and frustrating at the end did the director decide to become auteur suddenly 80 through the making of this movie yeesh spoiler alert thing start out typically enough for 50's youth gone wild there are drifters good girls bad girls gangs the kindly old diner manager and the town creep things follow the expected path until about 15 minutes before the end when the only likable character is killed off and the anti hero is blamed this would not be so unexpected if this were the main plot of the movie but all this stuff starts happening and during the final reel major curve ball then things get weird the kindly old codger forms a mob and beats the hero to a bloody pulp the mere presence of the hero's friend somehow drags a confession out of the real killer the leering creepy town nut which in any real universe he'd have been the prime suspect to begin with even if the anti hero was found with her body br br we're left with a somewhat feeble happy ending which is about as out of character with the rest of the movie as the events of the 10 minutes preceding it br br even more odd is this film's insistence on playing homosexual innuendo to the hilt but constantly presenting the two male leads as straight maybe this was on purpose perhaps resistance to settling down with the girl was more because of his sexuality which in the 50s would have to be kept quite repressed and thus not discussed or even admitted by him than his need to be a drifter if the director's intent was to spin this as a sexual yarn that the drifter drifts because he feels he's an outcast sexually that his paternal regard towards danny is not in fact paternal but spousal that his inability to remain with carrie is rooted in a sexual revulsion that even he does not quite understand it could have been made more clear instead we get this very bizarre alchemy of homoeroticism and behavior that is completely heterosexual br br these young men sleep next to each other even when they can get some room to spread out when danny is propositioned and once even in bed with a woman flips out and takes him away danny pays way sure there is another explanation for it but it still strikes a chord every time you see danny buy lunch they end up living together at the end not since hitchcock's rope has homosexuality been so blatant but denied br br mst3k did the right thing by taking this one on aside from jack elam there is little to commend the film
<START> i have been a huge errol morris fan ever since i saw thin blue line and heard it saved a life to date this movie is his best piece of work br br the plot is a mixing of stephen hawking's book of the same title intertwined with the man's life the story is told through interviews with family friends and himself br br don't be fooled it totally sounds boring but the whole package is dynamic and thought provoking the blending of life and theories is seamless and thoroughly entertaining i was particularly moved at how well they humanize this genius and omniscient man tho physically powerless hawking's greatness and shear brilliance is encapsulated into a real live human being that we are allowed to laugh at and aw over at the same time br br find this movie watch it and enjoy and if the studio who owns this picture reads this a 15 year anniversary edition would be perfect now
<START> what will be prospero in the twentieth century what is his life why a man would need to choose to live on an island with his daughter and girl friend because it is too hard to live and love in good conditions in civilisation this man john cassavetes is a broken hearted giant he can command the storm he's got the power the but he is human deep love of life is the subject of this movie the acting is incredible all the genius of john cassavetes gena rowlands vittorio and shakespeare and paul mazursky of course don't miss it it'll be a mistake this film is one of the most beautiful i've ever seen and i've seen a lot of movies
<START> this was pretty bad pedestrian work or worse i don't think it was homophobic just really bad if anything it was really amateurish like when you're 14 and first discover curse words and skin mags br br the main point of this movie the romance falls really flat i can't help but wonder if the writers ever had any serious relationships before this movie br br plotting and pacing are horrible going nowhere at all one minute we're watching these guys catch cheaters then we're at a gay club then we're at a date out of nowhere the girl apparently likes comics and then they sleep together none of this feels real like an elementary school production of shakespeare if hamlet was written by a frat boy br br the ending was some kind of creepy over the top revenge fantasy by a loser who got dumped by a girl unnecessary and actually kind of disturbing br br still you have to watch it why br br as others noted the director's commentary actually is hilarious what kind of of professional talks about banging or hooking up with the actresses dialogue sucked relationships lacked chemistry you will be on the floor laughing at this pretentious jackass
<START> this movie will likely be too sentimental for many viewers especially contemporary audiences nevertheless i enjoyed this film thanks mostly to the down to earth charm of william holden one of my favorite stars and the dazzling beauty of jennifer jones there are some truly heartwarming scenes between the pair and the talent of these two actors rescues what in lesser hands could've been trite lines the cinematography of hong kong from the period of filming is another highlight of this movie all in all a better than average romantic drama 7 10
<START> it's hard to tell who this film is aimed at the characterisation and style smacks of a children's itv series crossed with an aussie soap yet the subject matter nudity and language aims it at an older audience br br the first half hour has the heroine justine philosophising about losing her virginity and is excruciatingly embarrassing to anyone over 18 a complete rip off of ferris bueller from the talking at the camera bit down to the on screen graphics br br her nerdy friend brings her to a computer fair where an explosion during the use of a virtual reality machines turns her into a man or actually creates a male alter ego of her called jake don't look at me like that i'm just relating it the way it was shown br br after this the film is mildly amusing for a while amongst all the drama school mugging only rupert penry jones brings a real comic touch to his woman trapped in a man's body role of jake there's some funny scenes with jake dealing with his new body and new feelings nothing you haven't seen before but then in this film you'll clutch at anything that's entertaining br br unfortunately justine and jake meet up and hilarious antics ensue i wish involving the owners of the virtuality machine who want to kidnap jake in order to have sex with him or examine him or something anyway it's just an excuse to fill an extra half hour with some explosions and car chases for such a cheap looking movie the explosions come often and loud suggesting the money was spent in all the wrong places br br in the end the heroine realises she can't fall in love with herself deletes her alter ego and ends up in a one night stand with the nerd to lose her virginity this presumably is what is meant to pass for a happy ending in the 90s but only after he removes his glasses and puts some hair gel and a leather jacket on god forbid she actually have sex with someone who looks like a nerd of course this is a bit subversive in these days of pc movies which tell you to love and be yourself and that everyone is special in their own way it's refreshingly reactionary to have a film which screams conform at you and treats virgins and nerds with the contempt they deserve br br the characterisation is simple dire the nerd is very nerdy room full of computers thick glasses social virginity no leather jacket there's a slut she's very slutty blonde tight dresses orange tan accompanying music there's a jock he's very well you get the picture you can get away with this kind of characterisation in a broad comedy but virtual sexuality isn't very funny it's only mildly amusing in parts and excruciating in others it takes a lot for a woman as cute as justine played by laura fraser to annoy me but she manages it br br don't be fooled by the title there's absolutely nothing erotic about the film and it doesn't deal with the topics of how the new communications technologies are changing the way we view and acquire relationships unless you actually think there is a chance your playstation might blow up and change your sex br br
<START> the plot of this movie is as dumb as a bag of hair jimmy smit plays a character that could have been upset by the ridiculousness of the story he is evil and a wife beater it's a character as far from his nypd and la law roles as you could possibly get br br if you've thought he had the looks and the acting chops to play the really bad boy role her's your present br br but mary louis parker wears black miniskirts and little black throughout the movie br br she has always had some of the greatest legs in the history of the movies this makes the movie well worth it for this leg admirer br br i'd buy the dvd for this reason only if it was available
<START> okay so writer director larry bishop obviously has some important connections and knows the right people in hollywood in order to produce his own film and fill up the cast with eye catching names good for him now what he really still needs is inspiration and talent in order to come up with an actually worthwhile scenario rather than the overly pretentious and wannabe convoluted crap he penned down here hell ride isn't a movie it's a hectic and hopelessly inept fan boy endeavor to bring homage to the notorious biker flicks of the 60's and to the recently revived grindhouse cinema formula in general with hell ride larry bishop embarrassingly fails in his set up and there are many obvious reasons for this he hasn't got a story to tell Â or at least not a very interesting one Â but gravely tries to cover this up through numerous redundant plot twists loads of gratuitous and very women unfriendly sleaze overlong and piteous dialogs aspiring to be cool and giant amounts of senseless violence the plot looks complex but can actually be summarized in one sentence the ancient vendetta between two rivaling biker gangs flares up again with the arrival of a new member a boy who may or not be the long lost son of a double crossing wench that got executed back in 1976 that's it seriously all the rest going from betraying gang members over to the recruitment of old timer members over to toying with his nymphomaniac informant girl is all completely pointless and confusing padding material another major problem in hell ride is larry bishop's very own tremendous and seemingly insatiable ego he definitely shouldn't have rewarded himself with the role of tough and relentless gang leader as that only comes across as incredibly pretentious and narrow minded especially when there are so many other and more experienced stars in the movie granted bishop starred in a couple of genuine 60's biker exploitation movies like the savage seven and angel unchained but that was a long time ago and he honestly isn't any good as an actor maybe it simply was bishop's life long dream to play a character that always outsmarts his enemies and for which every hot babe sexually craves and just wrote a whole screenplay around it the veterans in the cast like dennis hopper and michael madsen don't really bother to leave a plausible impression and i can't say i blame them this whole production is lame and pathetic and i can't bring myself to recommending it to anyone regardless of many beautiful babes parade around with bare breasts and naked butts
<START> i don't see that much wrong with this movie granted the principal singers might not be luciano pavarotti and maria but they can certainly carry a tune burt bacharach and hal david are talented songwriters and i happen to love their songs especially the world is a circle the things that i will not miss and question me an answer some people claim that hermes pan's choreography is ghastly and that the snowy mountain sets look as if they were made of plastic i disagree on both counts i've seen powdered snow before and the snow in those mountain scenes looked realistic to me and most of all in this film's defense it is appropriate for a family audience at least i remember it being that way when i saw it on christmas day a few years ago with all the outcry over sex and violence in the cinema these days i find it refreshing to note that this film deserves its g rating and they don't say that naughty f word every ten minutes like some films i've seen thank god so although this film may not be everyone's cup of tea it does have some redeeming value and i give it ten points out of a possible ten that's my story and i'm sticking to it
<START> hands down the best drama comedy show on television a cleverly written show about a young mother and her 16 year old daughter exploring life and finding things out not only about the world but themselves too gilmore lauren graham struggles to find a way to remain in close bond with her daughter but steer her in the right path which through out the show is becoming harder and harder rory gilmore alexis caught in a world of books and learning is just beginning to discover boys and her own sense of rebelliousness which surprises them both with the help of luke danes scott patterson and sookie st james melissa mccarthy and an enormous variety of other hilarious characters this show easily remains one of my favorites what really puts the show over the top is the complex yet incredible and witty writing often using references from pop culture to the mink dynasty
<START> probably not the same version as most of the other reviewers because there s no real hard core sex what do people mean by hard core sex the sort of explicit hard core sex seen in films starring traci lords and big john holmes well anyway this is really poor film i doubt if i ve ever seen so many big name actors wasted in a film the script is really poor and plotless the directing and cinematography is awful and the editing is non existant it truly is an absolutely awful film you could watch this ten times and still not understand what the hell it s about the only memorable scene is the one where people are buried up to their necks and a giant lawnmower comes along and decapitates them yes you read that right a film set in roman times has a scene with a head chopping giant lawnmower br br trivia point many years ago a pirate copy of the thing 1982 version was doing the rental rounds on my island and it been copied onto a rental tape of caligula meaning the pirate version of the thing starts with the first few seconds of caligula of the man and woman walking through the forest then the title sequence of the thing starts this led people who d seen the pirate tape to believe the forest scene was the opening of john carpenter s 1982 film and were very confused as to what it meant well that s what you get for renting pirate videos but having seen the whole of caligula i don t know what it meant either
<START> i'm thinking of some things for this movie first really is a very bad movie this is really superbad the film looked very promising in the trailers but fell flat maybe the original idea was good but between a bad script and bad acting the movie became boring and empty my advise is don't waste 2 hours of your precious time you have been warned this is the first movie i rated 1 star at imdb com second none of the characters are likable you really don't care what happened to them third the villain is very easy to identify the grandson kills his father sodomizes the friend's son get the maid pregnant smothers his grandfather like jt says if you like evil with no retribution this is your movie nothing more to say
