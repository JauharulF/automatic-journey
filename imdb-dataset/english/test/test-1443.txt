<START> spoilers to understand what really happened first you have to be a warrior to stay alive in real war to think off line critically and not linear otherwise you will come to false conclusions that gray was dumb or unstable person truth is something completely different he was firm hardened veteran and only way he could be killed by capt is that he wants her to kill him it was his way out he choose it he was not man who will retire if you've never been on a first line you can't understand it he intentionally prepare his own suicide first he seduced mary jane than intentionally acted as a dumb than argue shutting incident before witnesses to protect her later after she done what he wants her to do if it comes to trial than gave her son a bullets to assure he could load her gun later came that night loaded her gun woke her up put her gun in her hands acted as he was attacking her after shot first time he raised knife and cried one kill so she shot him again and before died he put knife off like he was trying to took him back again after first shot he also gave her a message with his last cry after first kill everything will change inside your mind and destroy your life this is the the only way for me to die as a man yet to be killed by somebody i love is my choice and my only war and army is not what you thought so far grow up finally and save your life till you can she left military life at the end she did understand him and he did not die in vain the man who helped him to prepare all that and after to carry out the trial and the outcome of that trial was col sam doran with help of lt tim macy macy didn't know what is really going on and what will be the outcome but did what he was expected to do he took photos of mary jane and gray by order of col sam doran who gave that order because gray asked him to do that after she refused to leave army what col doran asked her to do col doran convinced prosecutor to charge her with a premeditated murder he knew she cant be found instead of manslaughter there was some possibility to be found with taken photos col doran also suppress argue shutting incident to escalate to prevent prosecutor to have any doubt about premeditated murder charge but let it be revealed during the trial what greatly influenced the jury i have no doubt about outcome of that trial why col doran did that way because he will do anything gray ask him to do why because he saved his life on a battlefield why mary jane choose to go to trial because she was a person who have integrity a principles and that is why gray choose her it has to be somebody deserving somebody honourable keeping his secret about what really happened that night she also prove her honour br br
<START> nero as the title of the movie is in germany is a another attempt to show one of the most interesting roman lucius better known as nero although this attempt at least tried to show a more historic accurate nero than the amusing but completely fictitious nero peter ustinov played in quo vadis it still is a major failure and to those imdb commentators who still believe that and propaganda is true please read a book about nero that was published less than 20 years ago nero did not burn rome this is proved he did not murder he did not torture kill and for pleasure he was the first emperor who banned the gladiator fights the movie still shows a lot of mistakes errors and is by the way made in a really cheap style especially the sets were cheap and unconvincing the palace looking like some villa the city itself looked like well like a cheap set the acting was between good and sub par the music nearly insignificant and the movie soon deteriorated after nero became emperor to a rushed bad edited mess without any clear narrative structure so there still is the potential for an epic biography of nero that shows the true nero who was one of the best who ruled rome despite the lies of et al
<START> with a 500 budget and a bottle of ketchup br br if you are a fan of c movies with no talented actors whatsoever a ridiculous story cheap effects and lousy camera work this film delivers br br all others be warned you could probably make a similar movie with a couple of friends in your backyard and a home camcorder br br the film is good for some laughs though watch it with some friends and discuss how not to make a movie br br 2 10 for unintentional comedy br br why the hell do you have to write 10 lines i have seen comments with less lines and writing this is just a lame filler
<START> one night at is a very funny movie that is more intelligent than what it should be its form is more sophisticated than what i expected and its randomness was superb the thoughts behind the movie sadism stupid men are are infantile that's what i have to say about this movie is that not only does it hate women but it loathes men it doesn't have any sympathy for any of the men really it seems that way because of the form but the ending says it all nobody cares br br the form has the first 2 3 of the movie told in flashback by three characters dillon the stupid bartender reiser the stupid lawyer and goodman the stupid holier than thou cop the story is therefore always perverted by their own self images and altered realities reiser's bbq fantasy is a great touch in the end we never really know the truth and nothing is what it seems dillon was never that innocent etc br br actually the rest of the movie is funny too from the randomness of the last 5 seconds of the movie to the overly obviousness of tyler's manipulations the movie seems to have an energy all its own everything is just out of the blue and nothing seems to make sense do we really care if it does no br br it is also a very dark comedy but has a shallow presentation think nurse betty or jawbreaker very candy coated outside dark chewy inside if you like your movies random dark or just purely mean see this movie this one will satisfy your urges for the strangeness that is one night at br br 8 10
<START> this movie is not what it appears to be clint eastwood is not dirty harry or a cowboy here the movie's appeal comes from its careful manipulation of atmosphere and theme it's a gothic tale set in the civil war and as such all the film's action or lack thereof takes place inside a house populated by southern belles of all ages and shapes br br the horror comes from viewing the whole story through the eyes of the clint eastwood character seeing him stranded in the house and held captive by the women is a very beguiling experience indeed and who is beguiled here exactly are the women beguiled by eastwood's incredible looks are we the viewers beguiled by both his sexual allure and the potential deviant sexualities it unleashes or does beguiled refer to what the director does here holds us enthralled for a short space only to maybe let us go don siegel does all of the above in one of the most memorable and disturbing films i had the pleasure of watching
<START> had it not been for to kill a mockingbird this movie would be much more famous had it not been for gregory peck as fitch the acting here would be much more lauded had it not been for william faulkner perhaps to kill a mockingbird might never have been written in his shadow br br i found this movie to be sadly familiar because it showed me that one of my favorite movies to kill a mockingbird may not have been as original as i'd always thought it was perhaps it was inspired by this very similar movie oh the whodunnit is different but the underlying story a lone righteous white attorney against a white southern town defending a black man is all too familiar and written by a woman mockingbird concentrates on rape the ultimate betrayal to a woman while this movie concentrates on brother against brother hatred the rape a man feels by fraternal betrayal br br there's not the depth of mockingbird here not the comfort that brings with his presence so you're just left with the sadness that whether she intended to lift the plot from this movie or not harper lee's mockingbird reflects nothing changed in that 10 or so years since the time she may have read book and saw his movie while in college in alabama and unconsciously or not took most of it as her own in later years nothing changed in race relations and some may say nothing has changed even now these many years later br br it's all too sadly familiar and one wishes there were an of our day to make it all right where mockingbird leaves you with hope of that rocking in the arms of and waiting for a morning of better times this movie leaves you just sad that pride from black people might equal or better the pride of white people but pride from either is no answer at all br br rather it's the answer of we need comfort that we are all flawed and that in our frailty we should have mercy not pride when facing each other in our differences
<START> what we have here is a film perfect for anyone that participates in the world of post those who sit in their home earning money by buying and selling sensual less and perpetuating a system that values little other than the preservation of self br br the beautiful filming i always appreciate fix and soft boxes makes it an even stranger place to travel through both enjoyable to look at but frightening to comprehend perhaps that's overly dramatic but its true br br journey through his hell is overwhelmingly tragic his quest is honorable laudable and precious the conclusion is necessary and we are left not sure if he's better off which is the perfect conclusion br br highly recommended to all people who view their world with a critical eye and especially to those who don't perhaps it will encourage a reflection or two
<START> this is a great dark offbeat little film a modern day adaptation of the quest for the holy grail myth it's a sleeper if there ever was one i saw it on cable some years ago and taped it i've loaned it to many of my friends and everyone loved it
<START> in the late eighties and early nineties the decline and death of independent video companies like vestron and media effectively shut off italian horror films for much of it's american audience coincidently italian genre films also declined in quality and profitability br br occasionally movies like primal rage sequels like beyond the door iii troll 2 and a few dario argento films limped out onto video but most remained unreleased until dvd in the us for nearly a decade or longer movies from these lost years became very sought after and talked about among horror fans br br of these films cat in the brain is probably one of the most hyped of all due to the legions of lucio fulci fans and the fact that it was not only directed by but also starred their idol fulci himself br br though not quite fulci's best it's still better than most of his later efforts his rabid fan base will probably love it italian horror and giallo aficionados might also enjoy it depending on their tastes but i'm not sure about anyone else people who only watch hollywood stuff might not want to take the word of the many glowing reviews here br br one thing i personally found fascinating were the scenes featuring probably benito mussolini's only lasting contribution to italy cinecitta studios the name is instantly recognizable to any fan of italian movies until i saw it here i could only imagine what it looked like
<START> happy 25th birthday to valley girl great soundtrack plausible story wonderful performances captures the spirit of the 80's the slang of the and the outcasts a wonderful rendition of high school life and gritty downtown from a suburban perspective br br the soundtrack contains songs by modern english josie cotton sparks josie cotton the the psychedelic furs men at work the flirts and br br this movie truly is romeo and juliet minus the double suicide set in 1980's los angeles julie's dad played by frederic forrest sonny bono anyone is hysterical as a hippie idealistic dad who wonders how he sprung such a materialistic offspring yet he doesn't judge ya dig
<START> richard gere and diane lane star in a chick flick romance with the sort of ending i get really angry about lets just say its not my cup of tea just like the dime store romances are not my cup of tea br br the plot has a doctor stopping at an inn and meeting a woman that he has a deep but brief affair with he goes off to meet his estranged son and she goes back to her life br br well acted and well made the filmmakers forgot to get a real plot line this is the stuff of dime store romances that makes the women swoon and the men shake their head in disbelief i wouldn't be so adverse to the film as a mindless romance except that the film takes a turn in the final reel that is so out of left field as to be completely unbelievable why must certain types of movies do stupid things like this it really ruined it for me br br if you like romance give it a shot though wait for cable
<START> wow i just saw demon wind a little while ago and i don't think i'll ever be the same it has the power to inspire nightmares but for all the wrong reasons actually br br never before has humanity seen such a gratuitous change in make up for no damn reason or similarly so much bad zombie makeup that makes you hungry for those halloween green marshmallows br br or so much naked old lady for that matter but then there was the shining br br the plot here is so amateurish that it actually almost holds a little bit of charm as does the dialog the last shot of the film is just so silly that its beyond description it's like some drunk college student got together with some pals and decided to throw bruce willis type dialog together with i guess teenybopper dialog from some elm street film the result is jarring and it'd be truly funny if it was intended that way br br ah what the hey i'll laugh anyway br br hell get together with your friends and watch this but make absolutely sure you're drunk first or you may go insane particularly if you're a college film student br br cheers
<START> i saw this version of hamlet on television many years ago and have seen every other version since whether television or movie however this is the one that remains the truest depiction of the story for me most excellent derek jacobi made hamlet real for me before i saw this version shakespeare was simply gibberish to me and i never tried to understand the elizabethan english having seen jacobi's hamlet several times not only increased my knowledge of literature but also that of my family i promptly checked the play out of library and read it and poured over the accompanying recording jacobi's rendition attracted me to a deeper knowledge and yet i have been searing for a video of it for years and years to no avail it gets a very high rating from viewers why then has it not been released on video it's the only hamlet that i'd invest in
<START> for a kid's movie this is great as an adult and mother i enjoyed watching the movie with my daughter there is a lot going on in this movie the following might be considered a spoiler barbie learns courage and learns not to judge others so quickly in this movie she also learns not to give up hope and to master her anger i loved the sense of teamwork you get from watching barbie and her sister and friends solve the puzzle there's nothing in the movie i found offensive or inappropriate for young viewers in fact i felt that the moral messages of the movie were superb and well done br br the animation was pretty good i really enjoy the ice skating scenes and think that they were very well done there's a lot of action in this film so i suspect that most kids would enjoy it not just the ones that are really into barbie my daughter actually picked it out because of the pegasus she loves horses but she enjoyed the movie very much my daughter is autistic and was able to sit through the whole movie and enjoy it she really liked the action scenes and any parts with horses involved br br one thing that i was thinking about was that many people object to barbie and ken because they are so beautiful yet i think that kids just like adults like to look at beautiful people and things it's natural as adults we enjoy watching beautiful movie stars too it's wonderful though that the barbie character and her boyfriend have a lot of personality while it's fun to watch pretty people it grows old if there is no substance behind the pretty face br br overall i'd say this is a great movie for kids and parents will enjoy it too
<START> the storyline has too many flaws and illogical sequences to be worthwhile jolie's acting is pretty flat and poor washington's is ok the rest of the cast are cardboard cutouts somehow almost everything about this film oozes mediocrity the plot is lame the only thing i liked more or less about this film are the fairly original methods the perpetrator uses to end his victims technical details are worse than the most far stretched csi and gizmos and halfway the movie one wonders if the director even cared about detail credibility some spoilers hereafter i mean an machine with a pure sinus wave reflecting a man's heartbeat a with full body muscle spasms and one working index finger sure a killer gutting a man's bowels whilst keeping him alive to allow the rats to feast on him followed by a rat aiming for the guy's face what's with all that stupidity then there are quite a few continuity goofs but you can find those elsewhere here on imdb honestly i found it a bit of an insult even to my limited intelligence br br waste of time still 4 out of 10 to keep my girlfriend from kicking me
