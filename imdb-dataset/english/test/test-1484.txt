<START> this movie is extremely funny the character of momma keeps me returning to the movie time and time again i can't get enough of her dry lines like when she tells her son owen to bury his friend in the back yard before he smells up the place and her suspicion that owen is trying to kill her by giving her unsalted nuts it's hilarious br br if you like movies such as national lampoon's vacation uncle buck or planes trains automobiles this has similar humor it's a great wholesome laugh a must see
<START> i've been watching a lot of asian horror movies lately but this one has to be the worst so far it started out interestingly enough but lost momentum after the first 15 minutes of the movie the added drama scenes flashback sequences and serious plot holes left me hanging what really happened in the tunnel just something terrible who started all the killing if it wasn't the ghost what did she want returned to her no answers whatsoever overall not very scary at all and the movie makers need to come up with a lot better ideas than this br br one positive was the cute actress but that's about it br br not recommended
<START> by 1952 hollywood decided to remake the al jolson first talking classic br br this time the son was played by danny thomas coming home from the army it is expected that he follow in the footsteps of his father and other male relatives by becoming a cantor however young mr has quite a zest for show business br br at this time he meets peggy lee an aspiring singer she acts very well and her rendition of her favorite song lover is remarkable the film writers were smart not to plug the obvious jewish guy and non jewish girlfriend relationship if anything this is glossed over in his anger for betraying his pledge to become a cantor his father makes the traditional jewish sign indicative of a loss in the family this would not be done under circumstances of breaking a pledge it would be done if among the orthodox an inter faith marriage would take place br br thomas does a really good job of playing the son his singing is up to par as the film ends on a positive note br br am surprised that technical advisers did not realize that women do not carry pocketbooks into synagogue on the sabbath or at all during that period
<START> this movie is not for those expecting a martial arts extravaganza as for historical accuracy i will leave that issue to those better informed on that subject i thought the performances were wonderful gong li never disappoints as the resourceful and initially loyal consort of the king of zhang showed a lot of flexibility portraying a ruler descending into madness he chose the hannibal lector route rather than resorting to ranting for me the best performance was from wang as the marquis the character came across as very oily but in a subtle sir humphrey appleby yes minister kind of way br br the cinematography is the standout feature of this film the scene when the marquis and his men stormed the palace was breathtaking there are also a number of wonderful battle scenes therefore this film is highly recommended on the big screen
<START> the problem with this movie is that it is trying to compile a 6 hours movie into 2 hours the result is clear it seems too forced unclear and too simple minded br br the only plus side is the beginning it explains well why and how hercules was born the rest of the movie was just mumbo jumbo that is put together it has a potential to be a great movie like lotr if only it is not forced into 2 hours br br the acting is not very convincing either ok not all is bad but most of them are special effects are stupid and look like it is made ten years earlier although the 1st monster is pretty good overall i give it 4 out of ten for the reasons i described above
<START> this is without a doubt the worst sequel i have ever seen i've seen plenty of them to make that conclusion the plot is simply ridiculous i can catch a ball run around a field too why can't i play in the superbowl yes i know this movie was intended for children but there are just some plots that even children can realize are totally dumb unrealistic the first air bud movie was pretty good but this one was a total crash disney is loosing it if i controlled who won the razzie awards i would give this one a couple have a nice day
<START> people must learn to watch what is up there on the screen this is a great film that is based on a slow careful gathering of details which serve to establish the personalities of these two men the passivity of the country cousin is well described by his fear of talking to women he has at least three chances to start a conversation with a young woman and loses all of them he has many decades of ahead of him and maybe unemployment as well br br is a different case he got out of the small town by working very hard we imagine and his resentment of slackers like is palpable he leaves crumbs on the expensive carpet the slob we are shown a group of friends talking about tarkovsky among other things and we note that feels regret but only slight regret that his work has become commercial over the years the gulf between the cousins just gets wider and wider the mouse trap theme is wonderfully vivid it brings out the compassion and confusion of and the cold blooded problem solving of br br i was reminded of two classic films of men driving each other nuts les cousins by chabrol the rich boy with hitlerian pretensions played by is always in my mind and kiss of the spider woman william hurt can't figure out why everybody's so mean bilge takes his place among the dozen important directors now active i just hope that in future he will come to rely on collaborators instead of directing writing and shooting his films himself
<START> anyone who thinks kool moe dee carol alt and corey feldman comprise a list of good actors must be smoking something i'd love to try sometime where to begin lousy soundtrack hammy acting action in places this is the typical amateurishly written hack fodder that washed up has been and never was's love to star in i actually felt embarrassed for the stars in this film the only thespian missing to top this turd was gary coleman who if he would have been in the movie would have made it at least somewhat howlingly bad rather than just plain bad br br there was one part in the film where carol alt screamed do you think i'm an idiot yes carol i do your agent does and please for the love of all that is decent and holy go away and stop degrading yourself like this this film is something anna nicole smith would take part in br br i would tell you what the plot was but that would be one more sentence fragment to this article plus my mind drifted many times during the movie anyway so i barely paid attention
<START> i only comment on really very good films and on utter rubbish my aim is to help people who want to see great films to spend their time and money wisely br br i also want to stop people wasting their time on garbage and want to publicize the fact that the director producer of these garbage films can't get away with it for very long we will find out who you are and will vote with out feet and wallets br br this film clearly falls into the garbage category br br the director and writer is john it's always a bad sign when the writer is also the director maybe he wants two pay cheques he shouldn't get any so remember the name john and if you see anything else by him forget it br br i won't say anything about the plot others have already i am a little worried by how much the director likes to zoom in to the poor girl's face when she is crying and screaming these long duration shots are a little worrying and may say something about the state of mind of mr maybe he should get psychiatric help br br enough already it's crap don't waste your time on it
<START> this movie was released in all major cinemas in australia i watched the movie on the weekend of 7th aug and i thought is was absolute nonsense and i am using that word extremely how it got released to every major cinema no idea the plot seemed simple enough about the world being divided into and people needed identity cards and the actor tim robbins playing an investigator who goes to shanghai to investigate a employee stealing id cards which turns out to be the actress samantha morton br br you think from that summary the rest of the story should but it doesn't it just confuses the audience even more with different storyline that don't relate br br if you thinking of seeing this movie let me save u the trouble do not get this movie
<START> it is hard to put the devastating beauty of to words partly because i am still grasping to comprehend it myself several hours after my second viewing first it must be said that contains some of the most incomparably and unforgettably haunting scenes i have seen in a film or television production the acting is excellent particularly that of bill paterson as a british minister grappling with his heroin addicted daughter and an aid deal to pakistan that hinges on drug issues another plot line describes these drug issues at a ground level in pakistan and revolves around a struggling opium poppy farmer and his interaction with a successful heroin smuggler the third main storyline involves the prosecution of a hamburg drug and the conflicting efforts of his wife and two german detectives while he is under trial it is a profound accomplishment that the interaction between these stories feels natural transcending the forced plot entanglement often found in hollywood movies it is an even greater accomplishment that a work spread over three countries and half a dozen main characters can be so focused and enthralling without having to oversimplify it is devastating bleak and brutal but never apathetic in short is a rare work of film that handles challenging subjects with unmatched compassion and clarity
<START> this is a case where the script plays with the audience in a manner that serves only in extending this story to 90 minutes story starts out in 1969 where a young girl named faith cameron diaz travels to europe with her boyfriend wolf christopher eccleston but she dies under mysterious circumstances then in 1976 faith's sister phoebe jordana brewster decides to travel to europe as well and try and find out what happened to her sister in france she looks up wolf who has stayed there and she wants him to help her retrace the steps her sister took and answer some questions he is reluctant but decides to travel with her along the way he fills in the gaps of the occurrences and tells phoebe that faith had joined up with the red army who are an extremist group that is involved in terrorism phoebe and wolf engage in a romance and this complicates the trip to portugal where faith died their is several things wrong with this film and it all has to do with the script first the romance between wolf and phoebe is all wrong and does nothing for the story it rings completely false and comes across as forced it seems weird that wolf would engage in a romance with his dead girlfriends sister secondly wolf knows completely what happened to faith but only lets out little chunks of information every 15 minutes or so wolf will look at phoebe every 15 minutes and say there is something i didn't tell you gee thanks a lot wolf if wolf had come clean the first time he talked to phoebe then the film would have been over in about 30 minutes another thing that bothered me was that i don't think this film recreated the 1960's at all diaz wears hippie clothes but the time period just didn't ring true i did enjoy a few things like the authentic locations where the film was shot it is a very good looking film and the scenery is beautiful the performances are all good especially by brewster and diaz besides the fast and the furious i had never really seen brewster in anything but after watching her performance in this film i came away very impressed she's very good here and i hope better roles come her way the script is told in a very contrived way and the film never comes across as believable
<START> this film was terrible i thought it would be ok but it just got worse and worse from the starting scenes it seems to be heading in the direction of another safe predictable rom com but the moment he arrives at the house it just disintegrates none of the characters have any depth and the only person who was anywhere near believable was tom although the way he became so easily distracted just annoyed me after a while the dialogue is ridiculous and the structure of the film almost completely non existent in an insulting attempt at comedy the writer director introduces a new character or event in practically every scene none of which are realistic making it very confusing to keep track of what is going on the plot is barely an excuse for a movie guy likes girl house sits fathers home to get to know girl destroys house gets girl a complete waste of time
<START> hello there i would just like to say how much i enjoyed your review and comments about that excellent film in the dust' i believe that the points you made were insightful intelligent and totally valid it's also a shame that this film is hardly ever shown on tv these days and that it isn't available on dvd region 2 i live in england once again many thanks for your review the actor hernandez was in another brilliant film 'young man with a which also starred kirk douglas and lauren bacall that was a very evocative and stylish film with some superb music i wish that someone with influence could release the entire back catalogues of films like 'johnny 'i remember and 'the on dvd region 2 we love these movies in great britain i'm not of age i'm still reasonably young and my family and i love classic films films like these were so beautifully made and they bring back wonderful memories anyway many thanks for your comments
<START> at school i was taught how some shots were called and there were two directors constantly mentioned orson welles and sergei m eisenstein i didn't care that much then i was a kid but now i know why eisenstein is a genius and it is a shame to see what was possible in 1938 where as almost more than a half century we're stuck with countless blank movies some say this movie isn't worth the genius of eisenstein then they have to watch it over and over till they can say anything bad or even worse that it is just some for the russians let's say it as it is it is indeed pure propaganda for patriotism but isn't saving private ryan or the longest day so i could sum up so many movies in where america is being raised to the top so why not russia and besides every war is fought for patriotism why else would they raise flags aleksandr nevsky is a must for anyone who cares about cinematography as almost every shot is a sublime picture perhaps it's all overseen but i am in wonder why this isn't included in imdb's top 250 where as there is so many overrated in it as well
