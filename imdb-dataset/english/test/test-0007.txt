<START> as a i got the michigan jokes very funny make fun of pontiac ann arbor all those lame suburbs of detroit yes yes i've heard these jokes a million times i'll give them credit for accurately depicting the lameness of grosse pointe it couldn't get more white did you hear those lovely michigan nasal accents where the girls talk so fast you can't understand one word that comes out of their mouth nose as much as i love michigan i hated this movie br br i have never met one person from grosse pointe that i liked listen to that awful live band and that annoying and horrid background music what is that one of your gross pointe band probably wow what a great detroit scene you guys have over there funny how people from grosse pointe always say they're from detroit they're so white and rich they wish they had something to complain about br br anyway this movie blows all the way from the lame jokes about girls in thongs to the terrible character development oh wait a minute you mean the entire basis for a character is that he says the f word a lot what a deep personality great job grosse pointers and i love all the sexist lingo like how the narrator calls the first girl who gets killed that we never even hear speak a naive b tch that's really lovely br br and those homemade masks with the marilyn manson contact lenses are really great and i love how it made perfect sense as to why the bikers came by and killed people and how their narrating master had such a obvious role in the movie the main boyfriend dude was so boring i fell asleep looking at him the three idiot guys or was it two or four how can i tell they all look and act the same were so desperately trying to make me laugh but beavis and butthead already got out my butt humor laughs back in 1994 and what's with the gay jokes no wonder this movie sucked everyone involved must have some minor problems with their masculinity eh boys br br the only saving grace to this film was the main girl despite what the other people on here have said she actually was a good actress teenage girls talk the way she talked they really act the way she acted her acting was very natural and believable i really thought she was a grosse pointe convenience store employee maybe she is and yeah she had big boobs most the women here do michigan is the state in the union you know in all aspects br br so those of you who think this is a representation of detroit it's not it's the suburbs of detroit they are very white and full of aimless teen angst limp yes is from one of our suburbs and 75 baggy khaki pants all the way lame rich kids who are mad because they have lots of money and nothing to complain about and they make bad movies too br br
<START> this is a parody that means there are no characters as such they are all plain stereotypes and the movie relies completely on the quality of the jokes br br well there are quite some good jokes in this movie unfortunately they are hidden in a mass of real stupid ones if one expects all dialogues to be absurd the fun wears off br br you see there is american pie 2 my all time favorite teenager movie it contains a lot of real original characters maybe the jokes are tasteless but all the people have some kind of live for example they feel embarrassed if something embarrassing happens that is what makes the jokes themselves actually funny br br not so this movie every scene is clearly arranged as a pure parody so there are no characters at all therefore there is really no room for any sympathy too if you know the original movies you know whole scenes in advance add the fact that many jokes are not funny at all and you have this movie br br the only thing that saved me from getting completely bored where in fact the comments from some teenagers in the cinema where i was watching the film br br ah and my personal highlight of the movie was the very short appearance of melissa joan hart in one scene sigh she is just too cool she can't be real hmm worth a whole movie
<START> i think it's two years ago since i have seen the movie and till this day it's the worst film i have ever seen the only thing i thought after seeing this movie was that it was made for some tax reason so after all this time i finally spilled my gut and now imdb says i have to fill 10 lines with comments br br sorry you must provide at least 10 lines in your comment please return to the edit window or use the back option if this isn't a new window br br please there is nothing to say anymore br br sorry for some bad english

<START> i wasn't expecting a whole lot when i rented this film as a lot of independent films seem to be a bit overrated these days well hollywood films too for that matter but this movie was fantastic really great it's too bad it didn't reach a huge audience because it's just superb i really love alice's determination it really makes me look upon my life as a gift and i see how privileged i am just to have an education but all of that aside this movie really proves that a good artist can tell a good story no matter what the budget it's an excellent film and everyone should watch it they will love it and definitely learn something from it i don't have to be roger ebert to know it's one of the best movies i've seen all year and certainly one of the most truthful

<START> i at first thought this little fantasy excursion would be a little entertaining i was wrong br br a good cast roy scheider as the president didn't help it any the story had every conceivable possible worst case scenario that could take place in a terrorist nuclear disaster and none of it could possibly happen br br true the kidnapping of the president could only be accomplished with the inside help of a traitor in the secret service ala air force one but everything they depicted regarding the football and the helplessness of our country if were to fall into enemy hands is ludicrous to the nth degree seriously not even the president can fully over ride our missile control the case is only used to relay orders in this situation our system would have completely deleted the codes and the whole thing would go nowhere the destruction of beijing couldn't happen there would not have been a missile launch because the silo crews would have been instructed not to communications include a system there are just too many safe guards to prevent such a thing from happening br br true film's like fail safe and strangelove gave some credibility to the concept of us losing control of the system but this film goes too far and fails to suspend my concept of the unbelievable and that makes the experience a waste of the viewer's time this film is a failure
<START> if you want to see a horror film which is horrible and in very bad taste this is definitely the film to view this films starts out with two young teenagers getting wild ideas about going into a chat room and going out on blind dates and quite possibly they will wind up like a little lamb to the slaughter house plenty of blood gore nudity handcuffs and all kinds of blood draining hooks and things you will never dream a person is capable of performing on men and women if you like piercing well this kind of piercing deals with heavy heavy hooks and plenty of besides lots of needles and thread to seal up things on the human body i really hope that this film does not give some sick person in this world the idea to act out these horrors in real life
<START> this film probably would have been good if they didn't use cgi computer generated imagery for the werewolf scenes it made the creatures look fake and the werewolves looked cartoonish cgi is great for certain effects like the in jurassic park or twister but when we see a film where the creature must look completely real cgi is not the way to go look at an american werewolf in london no cgi just makeup and a mechanical creature and what you come up with was more realistic than what was shown in the sequel this film did offer a few gags that was fun to watch and the humor in this movie seemed to have drawn me in but it's nothing more than a film that i thought was o k and that's not good enough in my opinion an american werewolf in paris doesn't hold up to the original
<START> young spinster who doesn't associate with women her own age and is eyed by gentleman from the retirement set invites an apparently mute young man into her apartment on a rainy day nervous and overly polite to hide her own sexual insecurities she is most pleased when the boy makes himself to home in her guest bedroom but not so happy when he begins sneaking out the window at night sandy dennis is not a hapless actress but why she was attracted to these sad sack roles i guess we'll never know based on a book by richard miles and about as far removed from a commercial drama as one could get this lurid material not only attracted dennis but also director robert altman whose work is static at best the narrative seems almost a sex reversal of the collector a tag which may have sold the film rights but which doesn't turn out to be a good idea cinematically even the film's best sequence dennis shopping for a prostitute to satisfy her prisoner doesn't quite come off with sandy acting both ill and indignant whose idea was this plan michael burns is quite good as the kid who uses this frumpy pasty sick woman just for her comfy digs but he's handled too bashfully by altman with lots of strategically placed towels and flesh colored undies altman clearly wasn't ready for a mature picture with adult themes at this point sandy dennis has a handful of very good scenes she doesn't chatter away mindlessly here she thinks before she speaks and she's alarmingly careful in her actions unfortunately the role itself is a bummer with an apparent slide into mental deterioration which seems to happen off screen as such the abrupt finale is maddening and the overall results tepid 1 2 from
<START> while the design and locations and photography are strong assets in this film it is a turgid and melodramatic affair which demonstrates the limits of cinema to convey truth br br the case is the use of the soundtrack music a mix of gustav and andrew lloyd webber that plays constantly and loudly and would have made max steiner grimace at its over use as it instructs the audience how difficult how ecstatic how tortured it is to be an artist and then it really counts the story the details at the end br br this heightened and kitsch exploitation of emotions was once well ridiculed by peter ackroyd about a yukio mishima book this is not writing this is barbara cartland precisely the same critique can be made of this film a deceptive mawkish vanity project
<START> for avid sci fi fans this movie is just what you've been waiting for watching this movie gets you lost into the characters especially riddick the movies bad guy this is the case where you root for the bad guy and want to see him live and win as you watch the survivors struggle to stay alive you long to see who lives and how they survive these unknown creatures that have taken over this planet an excellent movie vin diesel did a wonderful job as convict riddick and the acting and suspense were ravishing a
<START> the plot a group of young people with ridiculous names hutch and october are brought together by the death of their equally ridiculously named friend loomis after the funeral they decide to divide up their late friend's belongings among them is a video game called stay alive the group decides there's no better way to show their grief than to all partake in a little virtual bloodshed but the more they play the more they realize the connection between the game and the death of poor ol' loomis br br the production this film is just another entry into the latest hollywood craze of low budget pg 13 horror aimed at cashing in on the junior high school crowd the direction is sloppy to say the least with quick music video style cuts that make the action difficult to follow the dialog is so bad that it actually kills brain cells the plot itself is so full of holes that we never even learn where the game came from or why those who play it die br br the idea behind this film although not entirely original had some promise but the poor execution on both sides of the camera make this one big dud br br if you've ever got a craving for a killing someone in a video game makes them dead in real life horror film take my advice and skip stay alive for the superior
<START> this sad romance is because the director decides to break its narration and to offer the points of view of each characters so there are a lot of flashbacks of re shooting of the same scene but it would be an extraordinary moment of cinema to put all the fragments in order to see the result br br and it would worth it because it's for me just one the best french movie ever made br br it has everything br br cast first steps of monica bellucci and vincent cassel such a presence and such voices even for a hard of hearing it's symbolic for them to have fallen in love with this movie br br directing his camera is bright alive plays with the sets or can be mysterious with long close up Ã  la david lynch br br cinematography the light is beautiful between gold and rust like their love br br a never seen before paris it's a paris out of time of more accurately a composite of a lot of districts huge search here it's look like gotham city modern and old at the same time br br music not the big orchestra but in perfect tune with the frames and the song of charles made me discover this great singer br br ah Â the story as i said it's a love story but rather tragic saying that love can be for nothing that it doesn't make all people happy or isn't guaranteed for a sweet ending is great because this message isn't often told love is passion which is derivative from the latin pain you can suffer a lot when you are in love because of the why of the endless waiting the lack of courage the indecision br br and when you can ease yourself fate destiny god devil can stab you in the back just because you arrive too soon or too late and above all because love means 2 in a world of billions a lot of things can happen and as much stories can be written so what's love br br personally i lived some moments like this in a car with the dear one her mobile rings and you know it's her special friend whom she kisses goodbye and not you even if we are always together so you want to go out of this car to leave them together to not hear the sweet but cruel words but you can't because an amazing hard rain just started br br i found that this movie depicts those moments of tragedy as no one else
