<START> this is the question that astronauts roy thinnes and ian hendry ask themselves when they discover a parallel world of earth always hidden on the far side of the sun in this 1969 cult science fiction melodrama released here in america as journey to the far side of the sun the plot of the film was devised by british writers gerry and sylvia anderson the creators of such tv shows as ufo the thunderbirds and space 1999 it is exceedingly weird at times betraying the influence of the twilight zone and even stanley kubrick's classic 2001 a space odyssey the visual effects work of derek meddings who would also later work on superman the movie holds up surprisingly well under the last three decades of special effects advancements and while they are not really on the same exalted level of the kubrick film they are very superb if you don't anticipate a star wars type of a film and can overcome the occasionally trite dialogue doppelganger is a good film it was good enough for me to rank it a and consider it an undiscovered sci fi gem
<START> oh wow the character shares my name first name nick this movie as bad as the first one if not worse well at least there's an actual octopus in this movie an actual octopus that makes a better appearance in this film by better i mean longer the acting is pretty dry and it's hard to sit through just to let you know when this ninety minute film ends not only are you freed from your couch but you get your ability to breathe back not only that but you realise how stupid you are and then commit suicide realising how horrible life is after watching this film really it shows how desperate horror movies are today more crap like this is being realised and where the hell have the real masters of horror been lately this film should have been the final straw so we can bring back cinematic geniuses in horror cinema that could make some actually good modern horror films this movie bites
<START> what a waste of talent although it appears that crudup in real life is a lot more like the vapid self absorbed character less character he portrays in this disappointing movie br br in art sometimes the empty spaces reveal more than the painted or created content what this movie reveals is the unconsciousness and the contradictory competing unresolved impulses consciousness of the film's director writer it unintentionally shows the lack of awareness that a truly evolved deeply aware character should have and be tormented about in order to deserve audience empathy or sympathy or the lack of which is used to serve as a cautionary tale to the audience but this film fails on either level in that regard br br the fact that cal the main character very much an antagonist not a protagonist in the true sense of the word has no empathy for anyone especially those most deserving of it which does not include him and that he has such overblown entitled self pitying whiney sympathy only for himself combined with the hallmark lack of remorse and no sense of guilt or awareness of his impact on others all converge in this film to make him the epitome of the self involved arrested narcissistic sociopath somehow this is now the gold standard for males on film and in the world at this point and time br br one of his counterpoints james legros states with a laser true flash i bet you haven't done one good thing in life and i bet you won't it captures the absolute essence of the cal character something the other characters he over in the film seem to realize fairly quickly despite the director having stacked the deck to manipulate sympathy for cal that is a testament to the supporting cast's talent and skills br br cal's eventual has nothing to do with character development transformation or evolution of consciousness it has only to do with the ultimate capitulation that until something better comes along he may as well be back in his comfy cozy status quo of entitled where the living is easy and no one will demand that he grow up something of which he is willfully incapable and uninterested in doing br br the film could have been pointed and intentional about showing the traps and tragedies the devastating effects of this kind of lack of conscience consciousness but it excuses and glorifies it instead in fact it wallows in self pity right along with the arrogant selfish emotionally stunted main character br br and it sure sent chills up my spine when thinking of the recent revelations about convicted murderer scott peterson br br if you want to see crudup at his most nuanced and full of an exciting potential that has never been truly realized in my opinion see the underrated the
<START> i found this movie immensely interesting yet a little jaded it talks of violence and what there doing i still don't see the point in becoming terrorists in order to stop the terrorists we have similar people in the united states and other countries justifying the use of violence and war tactics because they think they are right think of the puritans and the christian crusades against the islamic people during the medieval times lots of blood and death far exceeding the violence of today the western world has had a negative impact on the religion i do not justify their actions but western culture in the past has had a very negative effect on some but still do remember the majority of the islamic people are peaceful people of any nation feel some sort of patriotism but to start a war on the fact that i'm right and your wrong needs to be rethought again i repeat you cannot stop terrorists by becoming like them
<START> i cannot comprehend how this picture was allowed to be made it is mostly if not completely inaccurate so much so that the main character does not even resemble how history has him look physically this movie made me go on the internet and go through my books to make sure i remember nero's personality correctly for god's sake i have a book that lists nero as one of the most evil person's of the world and the movie made me feel bad for him i must say character seemed close to my understanding of her both physically and psychologically although the actors all did a good job the movie was terrible and i'm sure i will not watch any others made by this sorry team
<START> michael writes and directs this fictitious story based on the arrest of edward gein in wisconsin gein was responsible for a rash of gruesome murders that sent a shock wave of terror through his rural hometown in the late 1950's his evil mind and twisted world is suspected to be caused by his domineering zealous mother ed was given the nickname the butcher of he would rob corpses from fresh graves of women who resembled his mother and he would have sex with them before them like a in his garage severed heads with bodies hanging upside down being his personal trademark after his arrest there would be many articles made from human skin found in his home in this movie a young deputy bobby mason shawn hoffman makes the search for gein kane hodder a personal one when his storekeeper mother priscilla barnes goes missing the acting is a whole lot better than the ridiculously liberal telling of the documented events concerning gein also in the cast adrienne timothy john burke michael berryman and amy lyndon
<START> enchanting the best time to see this movie is sometime when unhappy or sad it's all just so cute all even the way that white bear loves the queen in secret and gets her in the end also the achievement the two young actors of gerda and kai gave it's music is also very nice the two of us will always be one combined with sad piano tones in some places gives a very touching result and if one watches both parts at once he'll see the snow queen is not so bad she only tries to surround herself with love in the wrong way the evening this movie was on here first part i only watched it because i was bored but i loved it a lot more after and was very angry when they didn't show the next part because of the funeral yeah that was terribly sad for me but when they said it will be on next week i was so happy that i recorded it and now i'm glad to have done so
<START> having recently seen grindhouse i was browsing in video usa looking for some movies that might have played in real grindhouse theatres in downtown areas during the '70s the hong kong action flick five fingers of death seemed just such a picture the cartoon like sound effects and the quick jump cuts seemed a little distracting at first but after a while i was so involved in the story and the characters i didn't care parts of the music score sounded like the ironside tv theme song that was subsequently used in quentin tarantino's kill bill movies some scenes involving the hero's fiancÃ© seemed to border on parody but they were so brief that they didn't ruin the film the most exciting parts involve the tournament and some revenge segments after that well worth seeing for kung fu fans
<START> people have often been uncomfortable with the merchant of venice due to its anti semitic subject matter fortunately this movie avoids that opting instead to show how anti semitism reigned supreme in 16th century europe the story of course is that antonio jeremy irons needs money so that he can help joseph fiennes ask for lynn collins hand in marriage he gets the money from jewish usurer shylock al pacino who demands a pound of antonio's flesh if the latter doesn't pay back the loan when antonio can't pay back the loan shylock is determined to get what is owed him br br we would expect this cast to do a good job and they don't disappoint it is yet another testament to what a great actor al pacino is
<START> let's see what annoyed me most the extra long dance scene in the beginning watching people twirling around so much i got dizzy without even showing where the music was coming from all part of a college graduation that had nothing to do with the rest of the film or perhaps it was the fact that each scene lasted about fifteen minutes longer than they had to what a drag this film is and the most annoying aspect is the bad guys are so bad so obviously horrible that it seems as if the director were making this film for second graders these people are bad these people are good whenever a movie has its agenda heart on its sleeve i am beside myself there's a scene in a rink that seems totally out of place long drawn out love scenes with the main character and a russian prostitute that seems more like a rock star and his sexy groupie john hurt's character who is part of the overlong beginning scene drinks and disagrees with the overdone villains his death scene could very well be the stupidest in history and i hear everyone even the haters of this film talk about how gorgeous the cinematography is i think it looks washed out watch days of heaven if you want to see gorgeous this movie is even worse than the anti hype it's pointless the epilogue showing the main character in a yacht was almost as dumb as the prologue the battle scenes are tedious and dizzying this movie is really bad avoid it unless you love bad movies because this is the king of them
<START> i bought this movie sight unseen at a sci fi convention and i got what i deserved for doing something so silly simply put this movie is implausible boring and unwatchable br br i was so bored and disgusted with the lack of plot development that i turned it off to watch a repeat of i understand that this was a very low budget move or least it looked like a very low budget move but that does not excuse the horrible acting terrible plot and even worse camera work it looks like something a group of college students did in between classes and getting drunk br br maybe if the villain wasn't so laughable and the plot was something that actually could happen in real life with respect to law enforcement it might become so bad it's funny this movie isn't funny it's just bad
<START> the films use of blue black and vibrant skin tones to create a noir ish feel to this movie unfortunately do not work in fact its quite irritating as it obscures the demon characters and reduces them to one dimensional beings br br at least the original had an hysterical energy and the gore set pieces were quite stunning black gore is hardly frightening nor is the main female demon at all frightening in her attempts to snarl and growl at the screen in her best camp lugosi style br br the narrative is grossly disjointed and if you could imagine 'naked directed by russ meyer you may appreciate the attempt to be william burroughs esque otherwise give this film a wide girth bava and argento fans once again are bitterly disappointed
<START> a must see documentary this movie had so many things to consider while watching it it was a great documentary of a trial of a 15 year old black kid named butler he accused of killing a white tourist in florida it shows how the police took statements from the husband of the dead woman of the description of the man that killed his wife the husband seemed to want to change some things to merge with what the police said the young man was wearing the police little to investigate the crime lawyer patrick is meticulous in getting information to help his client he tells the viewers what he thinks and the strategy he will use on the police to show their incomplete investigation and beatings against his young client to get him to confess the camera goes with to where was questioned also takes pictures of the room and how the audio is monitored he questions a policeman on the stand and ask what the heard say to one of the investigators and he challenges their own words investigates with ann each place the police should have gone and the things they should have done but did not the movie shows the butlers as a loving christian family who have faith in their son's innocence and faith that god will set free they visit him in jail and pray with him there to encourage him there are scenes of group prayer for the lawyers the judge and everyone involved in this case i am a white and i was surprised to see how blacks in high police positions treat other blacks it was very disappointing to see black and white police stick together when they think they got their man police have a hard job and i believe most of them are honorable not like the ones in this movie i think this is a great movie for anyone involved in the judicial system including judges police and lawyers and even potential jurors to watch this movie and learn from it
<START> i absolutely hated this movie i was 9 when i saw it it is the only movie i have ever walked out of in the theater my mom dad and i all looked at each other during the movie and knew we were wasting our time this movie stole approximately 45 minutes of my life everything about it was ridiculous the entire premise was too warped being 9 i was always easily entertained this movie proved that i couldn't subject myself to anything and still be entertained
