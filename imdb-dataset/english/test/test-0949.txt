<START> it's 2005 my friends a time of amazing special effects and an age of technology so why can't we see a movie that's a little more thought out than this cheesy low budget film i've seen a lot of low budget movies that rock my socks off but this one it's almost as if it's trying to be horrible just don't watch it i can look past lack of special effects and computer generated scenes if the acting itself was at least good i feel like a small child produced this entire movie there's not even an original plot line vampire assassins in itself is one big plot hole with an attempt to mock itself can someone tell me if perhaps this was designed as a comedy movie and i just didn't know it it makes me wonder what does the sequel have in store for us who so loved the first installment
<START> a tedious gangster film that leaves you wishing someone had edited it farce more ruthlessly i would have thought that the story of the creation of las vegas would prove interesting but it fails at almost every turn warren beatty's performance as the stupid and unlikeable bugsy seigel leaves you wishing you were watching someone else once or twice he flashes through the fog of his performance to deliver an interesting scene but most of the time you just can't care about him annette benning gives a skilled turn as his untrustworthy lover but even she's only faintly more than he is br br i really wouldn't bother with this turgid drama unless you're a benning devotee
<START> this love story between an american journalist and an eurasian lady doctor does not contain much conflict since she is largely westernized having studied in london nor any fireworks since she behaves rather restrained what little interest the story manages to raise is knocked down further by their wooden dialogs they are supposed to be two cosmopolitan intellectuals but talk as if the words are put in their mouths by a hollywood hack who is not much of one himself the movie also suffers from an amazing lack of realism a completely deserted beach in crowded little hongkong overrun by a million chinese refugees and a presumably accomplished american journalist in his 40s who doesn't know what a is hollywood ideas finally the song after hearing it an estimated twenty times throughout the movie starting right with the credits it tends to loose some of its emotional impact sorry to say
<START> how anyone can praise this crude film version after seeing the marvelous waterloo bridge with vivien leigh and robert taylor is beyond comprehension br br mae clarke's myra is a far cry from the role as played by vivien leigh in the remake she plays a common american girl with a brooklyn accent and the yeah responses are a bit jarring when one is expecting a less coarse character douglass montgomery billed in final credits as kent douglass is wildly improbable as a soldier smitten with her no matter how many times she lets him down bette davis has a nothing role in a bit part br br their melodramatic confrontations during the last twenty minutes of the film are beyond belief extravagant bits of overacting even given the fact that this is a cruder version of the story when sound was only a few years old and silent acting was still the rage br br just awful and it ends abruptly with clarke losing her life during a bombing on the bridge the end br br it has none of the beautifully shaded performances in the mgm remake of 1940 including a sterling supporting cast instead this one is mounted with low budget production values and i mean a shoe string budget with no subtlety at all and there's no pre code braveness in the scene where myra tells the aristocratic lady why she must not marry her son roy she simply says i picked him up on waterloo bridge explanation over nothing bold there br br summing up for once the original is not the best version by any means vivien leigh and robert taylor have never been surpassed as myra and roy in the tender exquisitely acted 1940 film classic
<START> originally filmed in 1999 as a tv pilot mulholland dr was rejected the next year david lynch received money to film new scenes to make the movie suitable to be shown in theaters he did so and created one of the greatest most bizarre and nightmarish films ever made br br the film really doesn't have main characters but if there were main characters they would be betty naomi watts and rita laura elena betty is a perky blonde who's staying in her aunt's apartment while she auditions for parts in movies she finds rita in her aunt's apartment and decides to help her you see rita's lost her memory she has no clue who she is she takes her name rita from a gilda poster in the bathroom so the two set out to discover who rita really is br br david lynch has been known for making some weird movies but this film is the definition of weird it's bizarre nightmarish and absolute indescribable it's like a dream captured on film by the 100 minute point the film has become extremely confusing but if you've been watching closely it will make perfect sense having watched the movie and then read an article on the internet pointing out things in the film i now understand the movie completely br br the acting is very good watts is terrific justin theroux is very good as a hollywood director facing problems with the local mob the music is excellent angelo badalamenti delivers one of his finest scores and the directing hah david lynch is as masterful a filmmaker as ever there was br br is this your type of film well that depends you should probably view more of lynch's work before watching this movie you'll need to be patient with the film and probably watch it a second time to pick up the many clues lynch has left throughout the movie for lynch fans this is a dream come true br br mulholland dr is a masterpiece it's brilliant enigmatic and masterfully filmed i love it
<START> music videos are often completely disregarded in any discussion about film with most people considering them to be a lesser art form while a great majority are merely flashy clips to advertise a popular performer's latest hit single a precious few really do rise above the rest becoming works of art in their own right anything directed by spike or michel gondry is always worth watching while art isn't precisely the word i'd use to describe michael jackson's 'thriller 1983 ' it is an intensely likable hybrid of schlock horror and music and an outrageously campy short film that remains remarkably endearing nearly 25 years later the thirteen minute music video both the longest and most expensive ever at the time of its release was directed by john landis a filmmaker i'm not terribly familiar with though 'the blues brothers 1980 ' is a classic and i hear that 'an american werewolf in london 1981 ' is a stupendously entertaining horror comedy br br whether or not 'thriller' actually qualifies as a music video is certainly up for debate taking into account its extensive length though jackson bettered this effort with 1997's 'ghosts ' at 38 minutes and the fact that the title song comprises less than half of the total running time the video opens with a brief film within a film as michael on a quiet and brightly lit night reveals to his girlfriend ola ray that he is different from other guys transforming into a hideous werewolf as the nighttime clouds part to reveal a full moon as he presumably decapitates the unfortunate heroine we come across michael and his girl in the movie theatre actually watching this drama unfold in a horror picture when the girl becomes frightened they both leave cinema and begin to walk home at which point michael begins to sing the opening lines of his latest song thriller however when a hoard of blood thirsty zombies emerge from the local graveyard their entrance ghoulishly narrated by vincent price the situation begins to get interesting br br it's difficult to quite put my finger on why 'thriller' is considered one of the greatest of all music videos it can't simply be that the song itself is a lot of fun and michael jackson Â though he has since become the butt of all comedians' jokes for his peculiar personality and doings Â there's no doubt that he is an excellent singer and performer perhaps a decent explanation for the film's popularity is the incredible amount of work that must have gone into it nothing like it had ever been seen before and it still remains something of an oddity in the world of music videos the gruesome monster make up effects were engineered by rick baker and are surprisingly graphic for a music clip though it's all carried out with a good sense of fun several moments make for some genuinely exciting suspense successfully capturing the atmosphere of the films which it is parodying though always with a cheesy twist on the usual formula simply put you'll never look at a zombie movie in the same way again
<START> brained stupidity that the cartoon bullwinkle made fun of a quarter century beforehand no dead heroes proves that you can rip off a good movie the manchurian candidate without copying a single sliver of quality from the object of your plunder the acting barely registers on the cable access tv scale the plot is less nuanced than an old sgt rock comic and only boris j style bad guy mustaches are missing from the commies this movie achieves the unusual feat of being too bad too stupid to be enjoyed by anyone with thumbs
<START> there are many mysteries in life for example why did any of the people other than carrot top agree to appear in this movie why did anyone distribute this movie why did anyone pay money to see it i guess none of these questions will ever be answered but one thing i know for sure this movie is one of the worst ever made with a budget this big it would already be bad but the addition of carrot humor makes it even worse the only entertainment one could possibly get from this movie is to burn it smash it or otherwise destroy it in an amusing fashion if you were to rank it against every movie ever made it would be right between problem child and nuff said
<START> for once a barbie movie that is good i'm 18 and a embarrassed to say this but i'm hooked on these movies i hated barbie when i was younger but the movies i love shiver is so cute and i've fallen in love with him he's so cute as the polar bear and totally in love with aiden oh man i'm in love with shiver i love determination not to give up on hope and it works i love this movie and hopefully they will be other good ones barbie swan lake is other brilliant movie i would recommend this movie to children of all ages even boys because the movie is that good and i'm hard to please barbie and the magic of pegasus is a movie that is enchanting and exciting
<START> i remember catching this film on a c4 screening a year ago and i was completely blown away by the whole thing i thought the film managed to represent such a diversity of genres the supernatural a love story the intrigue of crime and so many more br br i was hooked on the whole thing after a minute or so and was really concerned about the characters it made me feel terrified at one second for jimmy and then had me laughing away at the gangsters in the next and all the time i had my fingers crossed that things would work out for jimbo br br heath ledger and rose are superb bryan brown is absolute quality and had me up along with david field who was funny as well as being an evil git br br since i saw this film i managed to order it on dvd and as a result every person i show it to has been hooked in much the same way br br this film is perfect for a sunday afternoon or a lazy evening and it's one that you can really appreciate with your mates around
<START> this is a magnificent and in many ways impressive film i saw it on tv as a little boy with my throat almost strangled with tears and again today on the magnificently restored criterion dvd br br cranes is the very essence of the war weepie imagine umbrellas of cherbourg with no music and no color or waterloo bridge with no class consciousness br br tatiana a cross between vivien leigh and bjork is deeply affecting as a pretty girl whose fiancÃ© enlists and doesn't write or come back br br the fiancÃ© boris dies on the front and his death scene is indescribably romantic very daring too because so close to over the top but that scene will stay with you br br although the soviets were so defined by wwii the movie is quite unspecific and more powerful for it the pre war and post war scenes have a very 1957 feel there is no attempt at period detail the whole film becomes more and more stylized until the siberian scenes which feel like a modern opera set that is a compliment the cathartic final scene is milked to its last drop there again comparable to cherbourg the production feels like a big budget those staircase scenes must have cost a pretty br br go for it don't expect a bitter socialist pill although it is of course very sad the cranes are flying is an impressive slice of world cinema quite advanced considering where and when it was made
<START> just listen to the broadway cast album and to the voices of barbara harris and john cullum who do wonders for the wonderful lerner and lane score then with that beautiful cast recording fresh in mind watch the movie with streisand as streisand and yves montand reading his lines with such a heavy french accent that a chain saw couldn't cut through it the best part for those who need something to look forward to is what montand does to the introductory part of the title song listen as he sings says could anyone among us have an inkling or a clue what magic feats of wizardry and voodoo you can do that one part sums up the problem that results from casting name stars in movie musicals instead of the appropriate talent for the various roles i can just see rex harrison entering that scene and suggesting montand too could learn to do justice to the beauty of the english language br br
<START> i think that this film is one of the funniest films i have ever seen i think debbie reynolds is hilarious and the chemistry between her and glenn ford is perfect there is not a dull moment in the film and debbie looks beautiful as always br br the story is about a showgirl maggie debbie reynolds who meets a penniless soldier joe glenn ford she takes an instant dislike to him but after he accidentally tears her dress he returns it to her on the condition that she goes on one date with him they end up getting married the night they have their date after just one kiss joe and maggie move to spain and find they have nothing in common but physical attraction so maggie proposes that for one month they live but not as man and wife which means that joe is not allowed to kiss or sleep with maggie much to joe's frustration a hilarious plot and a wonderful film not to be missed
<START> okay i had reasonably high expectations for this the controversial subject matter was a good concept as a horror fan i admit i was fascinated and very excited about this br br it turns out they had a great idea but it was terribly executed let's see this movie seems to run in 3 modes happy sex and dark the problem is that the movie never decides what it wants to be the happy parts i believe were meant to contrast with the dark parts but it doesn't work the soundtrack is one of the reasons br br the movie transitions between these 3 modes very badly i can't even begin to say how much the directing and editing suck there's sex in the most unappealing and unerotic way i'm not complaining but even for horror standards they were unnecessary and filler br br the characters are all unlikeable with the exception of paula potente her friend from munich is a slut and possibly one of the most annoying characters in movies i've come across recently br br there's a bit of plot which i won't go into detail it's not stupid and in more talented hands would make a good movie there's even a nice twist and a cool conspiracy going on don't try to understand everything because there are giant plot holes here br br it's all so shoddily done that you don't care for the victims the perpetrators anyone and to think this could have been great i can say one good thing about it which is the movie shed some light on today's unethical medical procedures with genetics and controversial sciences advancing this could have been a great philosophical film that raises and discusses these questions but you won't find that here just a series of scenes loosely pasted together with people and things that you don't care about br br skip this and go watch instead you're welcome br br 3 10
<START> this was the worst wrestlemania in history the only good matches were ricky steamboat vs hercules hernandez and the tag title match between the british and the dream team this one bordered on classic everything else was either poor or awful the idea of having three host cities was unnecessary confusing and messed up the fluidity of the show the celebrity guests were terrible on commentary especially susan saint james br br if you're interested in the mid 80's wwf you're better renting or buying wrestlemania 3 or just about any other ppv for that matter
