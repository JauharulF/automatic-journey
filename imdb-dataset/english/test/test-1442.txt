<START> this is bad movie there is no denying it as much as i'd like to tommy lee jones is about as good as he possible can be with the script they gave him and he had a couple of decent action sequences that felt really out of place due to their acceptable quality br br somewhere along the line someone figured that all of the shortcomings of script could be if they were to hire every single workhorse actor in the business unfortunately even truly deeply talented actors like goodman beatty sarsgaard gammon steenburgen macdonald pruitt taylor vince and lest we forget mr jones himself can't fix the wooden dialogue and plot progression that went absolutely nowhere br br in fact at one point i looked up sure that the movie had been running for the past 2 hours only to find that i was 51 minutes into it br br perhaps the most painful point of the movie was the subplot about the ghost confederate soldiers that seem to be of little to no help to the story other than slightly detracting from the confusing business at the end with the picture if you haven't seen this movie disregard this past statement which may seem tantalizing and know that it is not you will not understand it any better after having watched the movie br br the most interesting thing about this movie may be that it is actually a sequel to the movie heaven's prisoners starring alec baldwin in the same role carried by tommy lee jones in this movie i may have to watch it now first to see if it is as bad as in the electric mist and second because i can't seem to no matter how hard i try break my man crush on alec baldwin
<START> i would say that this film is disturbing the brutality is depicted in a very sick way it's like a psychosis in 40 minutes in the same time it is a cruel introspection in human behavior the scenes are ferocious starting with the butchery of the horse and ending with the brutal sex scene in the kitchen every emotion is exploited to extreme the frustration of the butcher the love for his daughter almost incestuous the rage when he finds out she has been abused every feeling is so natural and so wrong this film delivers the truth about human nature in a very honest and brutal way the message of the film is that one's life can change in a second as a consequence of one's behavior and that the most primitive emotions are the most powerful and can determine one's acting i'd loved the unique manner of filming the simplicity and the brutality accompanied with the silence in which only inner thoughts pierce through
<START> universal studios version of flipper 1996 is a great heartwarming film for the entire family with good values and sentimentality it is the story of sandy a teenager from chicago who reluctantly spends his vacation with his uncle porter in the bahamas this ultimately changes the teenagers life and he grows up in the process he learns to appreciate nature and to have a respect for the environment i grew up in the 1960's and the nbc television show flipper was my favorite childhood show elijah wood is perfectly cast as a 1990's sandy and gives an excellent performance as much as i liked the nbc television show and mgm theatrical feature films with luke halpin as sandy in the 1960's i liked this feature the best i feel elijah wood is the best sandy with respect to luke halpin i feel elijah wood has more of a range of acting talent and emotes more as an actor which makes his performance excellent and more believable i think elijah wood is the best young actor working today in films director alan shapiro also wrote the screenplay and has done an excellent job as both writer and director of this film paul hogan gives a comical and likable performance as sandy's uncle porter mr hogan's performance perfectly offsets role as sandy i am a big fan of underwater films this film was beautifully shot in the bahamas like thunderball 1965 ua was the director of photography was bill butler a s c who lensed the film jaws in 1975 mr butler is a very talented cinematographer the underwater director of photography was pete romano he did a superb job with the underwater cinematography i enjoyed the film score by joel this good film score featured crosby stills and nash among other talented artists this motion picture was shot in panavision like thunderball in the aspect ratio of 2 35 1 if possible try to see this film in a scope version as originally framed and by alan shapiro and bill butler another very nice thing is that mr shapiro gave the original sandy luke halpin a small part in this remake he portrayed bounty fisherman 3 in this film this was a very kind gesture on mr shapiro's part as you can tell i am a real true fan of this film sadly this beautiful film was met with harsh words by the majority of movie critics i originally saw this movie on my birthday may 31st of 1996 in a movie theater it meant a lot to me i have it on numerous video versions the vhs versions are in pan and scan the laserdisc version is letterboxed 2 35 1 i even have a vcd in 2 35 1 from hong kong which is letterboxed but my most prized possession is an original 16mm theatrical feature print which i will treasure for the rest of my life thank you mr shapiro elijah wood paul hogan and everyone involved for making this a memorable movie for me to enjoy br br p s i must add that the quality of the universal dvd is superb it is the best dvd as far as quality i have ever seen the color and resolution is spectacular the soundtrack is great i think universal must have used the same transfer for the dvd that they did for the laserdisc version the 35mm scope print is mint and alan's film really has a wonderful look to it a great tribute to a wonderful film the dvd's resolution is even superior to the laserdisc quality it's just spectacular thank you universal home video for the great quality control and transfer many thank's for doing a superb job on this wonderful family film also many thank's to you alan for all your extreme kindness to me it's a real honor to know you review revised updated june 27 2005
<START> as a geology student this movie depicts the ignorance of hollywood in the scene where the dog grabs the bone from inside of the burning house it is less then a foot from lava which has an average temperature of 1 750 degrees fahrenheit this stupidity is witnessed again when stan goes to save subway 4 his shoes are melting to the floor of the subway while the rest of the team is standing just feet away from the flowing lava and to finish off this monstrosity of a film they come up with the most illogical solution stopping a lava flow with cement k rails earlier in the film a reporters voice can be heard saying that nothing can stop the flow fire fighters have tried cars and cement common sense dictates this film is a preposterous and gross understatement of human knowledge
<START> star rating jodie marsh michelle marsh marsh rodney marsh hackney marsh br br harlan banks steven seagal not quite as bad an actor as kevin costner but you get it is a modern day robin hood listen close you can hear brian adams music playing in the background no not really the kind of guy who steals ill gotten blood money from drug dealers and uses it to keep run down orphanages open but now he's been approached to drive a getaway van in a heist from las vegas in one of those last things before retirement type jobs but of course it all goes wrong and he winds up the patsy for the big guys at the top and in jail here he meets a guy named although you wouldn't know it from paying attention to the movie ice cool who he forms a friendship with and ends up breaking out of jail with once free he's out to prove his innocence locate the missing money and naturally get even with those who framed him br br of all seagal's recent straight to video films today you die has that look about it most of all that it belongs in a cinema even with a rap star as his co star like his previous cinema films half past dead and exit wounds yes it seems when he's not making films about looking after the environment he's pretending to be black and co starring with rappers but is not a cinema film and that's a luxury the great one is never going to be enjoying again until under siege 3 materializes if ever br br the film opens with a slick polished look that commands attention but it all quickly goes down hill from there once seagal hits prison the plot quickly loses it's coherence indeed character just seems to pop up out of nowhere without any introduction as his sidekick and from there you quickly lose interest in it br br that's it i know i've said it before but i think i mean it this time i don't think i'm going to be giving any more of these straight to video seagal films any time i honestly have no enthusiasm to watching shadow man at all in fact i can honestly say that i've not really enjoyed any of his stv films up to this point and today you die is certainly no exception an apathetic boring effort all round best avoided by all
<START> this series continues to frustrate and annoy how are they going to drag this out for another year each episode offers up more and more questions whilst providing the answers to very few to quote another very popular website i believe that this show has now jumped the shark br br will i keep watching it br br probably br br will they manage to keep the show on air till it ends br br probably not br br how did two qualified doctors fail to notice that naomi was still alive how did 30 plus people not notice a corpse wake up and walk off with a knife still in her back how did someone have enough strength to create two trails and climb up a tree to ambush kate br br we've now introduced a ghostbuster br br same time next week yep
<START> having seen and loved this film in australia i was very keen to get me paws on a copy i got one on dvd back in the uk only to find that it's a very different edit br br the domestic edit i saw is the uk and i presume european edits spends a lot longer on the narrator played by jimmy's dead brother and in truth that and few other points to no real benefit br br it is not a serious criticism but the oz edit is just and i think more assured br br i can't say why they felt it needed expansion for the overseas market br br so careful about which one you go for br br i went for both
<START> wow my mom bought me this movie because it was on sale really cheap in some store in my town and she knows i love scary movies first i looked at the cover and sighed thinking that it was some ordinary b movie trying to be scary i was so wrong i made the great big mistake watching it alone my parents and my brother was asleep and it was really late after i seen the movie i was so scared i was shaking i didn't even dare to go up and take the videotape out of the vcr i slept with the lights on br br this movies main story is about some teenagers who drives off the road and have to spend the night in the woods telling scary stories the first story is really scary and it makes you hug a pillow really hard if you watch it alone the second story is scary too but not in the same way as the first one the third story my favorite is really really creepy it scared me most of all stories it is about a guy who is driving around the country on a motorcycle one night when there's a storm outside he goes to the closest house and knocks on the door a girl opens and she is mute don't wanna tell you more but you will get chills when you watch it i might add that my were really abnormal when i watched it campfire tales ' main story has a really interesting and surprising ending i know some guys said it sucked but me my boyfriend and my friends loved it and it was a long time since we got that scared rating 10 10 oh by the way it is not like urban legend at all it is so much scarier
<START> chuck jones's the second in the much beloved hunting trilogy is often considered to be the best of the three while i find it almost impossible to choose between this trio of fantastic cartoons i would have to concede that is the most finely honed script here the emphasis is placed on language as bugs and daffy run through a series of complex dialogues in the grand tradition of abbot and 'who's on routine as a long term daffy fan i have always been delighted by the hunting trilogy because it is consistently daffy who gets all the best lines the famous pronoun trouble being one of the all time classics and does most of the work bugs plays the role of cool manipulator while elmer as always is the befuddled dupe part of what makes the hunting trilogy so much fun is that daffy and elmer pose so little threat to bugs that he is basically just kicking back and having some easy laughs elmer falls into every trap that is laid for him but it is poor old daffy who comes off worst being shot in the face again and again his beak ending up in more and more ridiculous positions it all builds to the inevitable climactic declaration you're despicable as intricate an example of chuck jones's impeccable timing as you'll come across is a true classic
<START> lackawanna blues is a moving story about a boy who is raised in a house by some pretty unusual people br br it's editing and soundtrack really pulls you in to the story and lets you experience the film the way the writer really meant for it to be seen br br the music really tied into the story which made the characters come to life the editing made the story more progressive and captivating br br i was also surprised by some of the performances of the cast most notably s br br i can't wait to see the one man show featuring this films writer ruben santiago hudson
<START> imagine that dragnet episode where friday and gannon go into a typical 1970 den of hippie inequity but instead of giving everyone a lecture they get some that's joe in a nutshell br br this film of a working class bigot and a rich guy who's just killed his girlfriend's drug dealer boyfriend has dated terribly and most of the supporting acting is stilted but it's still interesting to watch peter boyle then about 35 plays joe the bigot and he looks like james gandolfini in her film debut susan sarandon plays the doe eyed daughter and while she doesn't necessarily hint at her future greatness you can't take your eyes off her
<START> a buddy and i went to see this movie when it came out in 1980 it was playing in a huge theater and we were the only two people in the place it lasted two days in the theater before they stopped showing it it was so bad that we laughed all the way through it since that time we rate movies based on kill or be killed as the worst movie of all time like other reviewers have mentioned it is so bad that it is funny it isn't worth a second look that's for sure i just can't bring myself to give it more than a 1 because i don't think the makers of the movie intended for it to be so bad and i can't give credit for an accident sorry
<START> i grew up in the 90s therefore you must understand that i witnessed firsthand the premiers of the greatest i was there when brink appeared zenon johnny tsunami etc these movies constitute my childhood when these movies came on not only myself but whoever i was watching them with would stand completely in awe for 1h30 talk about it for the week to come and catch it again the next weekend i don't think words could express the amount of excitement disney brought br br even when i watch them now the dialog doesn't seem that bad so effective in fact that i actually remember parts of conversations literally word per word from movies i saw over ten years ago the characters are believable funny granted a little stereotypical but that's what makes disney's charm br br i sat my little brother down in front of the disney channel to try and convey and make him understand my feelings for enter stuck in the suburbs my brother looked at me slightly puzzled asking me if i had always been gay i feel more disappointed and betrayed now than what could i compare this to when han solo found out lando sold him out to vader br br half the movie and i'm not exaggerating is flashbacks there is no talent in these young actors some of which are older than i am whatsoever the plot is ridiculous it feels like a bunch of old rotting corporate people over at disney sat around a table and asked themselves how can we seem hip to these youngsters ok maybe all the were like that but they at least made a little effort to not let us realize they think we're complete idiots br br and apparently this type of movie works stuck in the suburbs is rated almost as much as zenon or airborne how is this possible got even cheesier and people prefer them now though apparently the lack of curse words is enough to give it 10 10 for some people christ it's a completely different generation
<START> there are movies that are just a different version of another one not remakes but just similar to others it is not although it talks about mafia it is watched in another way and often it seems just a secondary theme i went to watch that movie for case because the theatre was full and i was satisfied at the end it surprised me because of its black irony or cynicism and there are more and more interesting items to analyze it doesn't follow the classical ways of movies it is just different and i think not to be the only one to like that i am very happy also because it is italian and i was afraid that italian directors and producers were not enough brave to change themes in this movie you can watch new italian style as well but is not blocked into clichÃ©s i hope to be understandable enough i know it is difficult i hope also that this movie can be exported out of our frontiers it is a good product to export i want to point out also the music very good soundtrack the movie needs it because of its long silent pause and they are covered perfectly by that music many compliments to the director and thank you cinema needs these movies
<START> this is an excellent film the aerial scenes were well done it was also the right balance of war and love the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few
