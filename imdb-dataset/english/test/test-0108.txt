<START> this movie is one of the best and moving i have ever seen because of the terrible good performance of the main actress jennifer rubin as jamie harris who really makes you feel with her also the music by mark snow is wonderful
<START> totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way what it is about estrangement i believe probably up to the viewer but i found that this movie tries to say something about the coldness and emptiness behind all the designer furniture and perfect facades don't know if i'm right but this movie really got to me see it i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style and i forgot the casting here i superb with being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesn't understand where he is what he is doing and why the acknowledgment of not understanding the purpose of life in the city is what makes him bothersome all the others do as they are told and pretend to be happy this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006
<START> so much for judge and jury which lives up to its nonsense title what good is there the lighting is terribly foggy another horror movie you ask well that's perfectly explainable david keith actually does pretty good at disguising clowns chefs and other shenanigans while being the killer who escaped death row but overall despite some new twists it's reasonably stupid has been putting out some ludicrous productions recently and this one only means so much we the jury find this film guilty for its indecent exposure to many of us sitting around believing it's a total waste of our time
<START> i thought this movie was awesome and the two guys nick and aaron are hotties i wish i could watch it over and over i loved the plot and whole concept of the movie it is great and i wish i had taped it last night nick i love you
<START> if you wish to see shakespeare's masterpiece in its entirety i suggest you find this bbc version indeed it is overlong at four and a half hours but performance as hamlet and patrick stewart's as claudius are well worth the effort br br it never ceases to amaze me how clear hamlet is when you see it in its length and order as set down by the bard every film version of hamlet has tinkered with its structure olivier concentrated on hamlet's indecision gibson on his passions jacoby is able to pull all of these aspects of hamlet's character together with the aid of shakespeare's full script br br why does hamlet not kill claudius immediately hamlet says i am very proud ambitious hamlet is extremely upset not only for his father's death and suspected murder or his mother's marriage to his uncle but also and mostly because claudius has usurped the throne belonging to hamlet he is furious at his mother for marrying claudius marriages between royal kin is not unknown done for political reasons but that her marriage solidified claudius' claim to the throne before he could return from to claim it for himself he is therefore impotent to do anything about it and this is true even after he hears his father's ghost cry vengeance he cannot simply kill the king or he will lose the throne in doing so he must out the king's secret and here is the tragedy at the moment hamlet is successful in displaying claudius' guilt in public he has opportunity to kill him and does not why he wants it all he wants revenge the throne and the damnation of claudius' soul in hell hamlet himself in classic tragic form his own hubris is his undoing he kills polonius thinking it is claudius and the rest of the play spirals down to the final deaths of rosencrantz guildenstern ophelia laertes gertrude claudius and hamlet himself
<START> i suspect there's some revisionist history going on here but one definitely comes away with the feeling that patrice was a trouble maker who incited his people to violence from the moment the congo declared independence his inability to control his people and his decision to bring in soviet help to get his military back in line was obviously what got the united states involved and led to his assassination however by replacing him with the united states didn't solve anything they made the situation just as bad well acted with excellent cinematography and a rousing score definitely worth seeing
<START> i must admit i didn't expect this to be as good as it was i also didn't expect samuel l jackson to play slide and sing blue either br br of beaver county pa does this frequently they advertise movies in the lobby get you all excited about seeing it and then disappoint you by not showing it br br i expected that with such a great cast of jackson and ricci and even a former n'syncer timberlake that this movie would at least have shown for a week but nay at that time if i remember correctly was showing on 3 screens that or some other type of supposed blockbuster br br like blues brothers and crossroads this movie incorporates the mystic and legend of what blues music is all about passion and hard times religion and sex hell hounds of the past redemption i mean so many elements go into the blues to make it work br br this was just a good all around story of course not many people will see it cause it doesn't have pirates or swinging spiders but it does have samuel l jackson br br think of what happens to jacksons character from pulp fiction after he walks the earth and settles down and that essentially describes him to a t br br great and underrated but aren't all the good ones like that anyway
<START> i really enjoyed watching hell to pay i've been a fan of westerns for as long as i can remember and this one reminded me of a lot of the westerns from the 1960s even though i was too young to have seen them in their first run the one thing that bothered me about the movie was the constant music it was distracting at times one thing i did notice and i wonder how many other fans of gunsmoke noticed was the name of buck taylor's character it was a play on doc adams' name from gunsmoke instead of adams buck taylor used adam galen i wonder if that was his choice or chris mcintyre's anyway i would recommend this movie to fans of westerns don't expect anything too deep just plain old entertainment
<START> after seeing a preview for this film at my local mall where there is a stand for purchasing foreign films i thought it looked very entertaining before watching the movie i went on to imdb to see what ratings and comments it received i was worried when i noticed the low numbers and the negative ratings despite the hype i watched to movie and to my surprise i found it unbelievable br br the story was great just pay attention and the characters and their relationships within the film is astonishing i haven't seen such a good combination of leading characters in long time i really felt for both characters and sensed a strong bond as reading previous posts about this movie not being epic enough or a lack of martial arts i could not disagree more this film is what it is its not braveheart and its not enter the dragon but it is still a wonderful film that does an excellent job combining story both and action br br while sword in the moon isn't perfect what movie is it still is wonderful and moving just wait until the ending scene with the music and cinematography together its breathtaking i only hope more people can see this movie to give it a fair voting
<START> i first saw this docudrama in the uk in the 1980's and found myself intrigued and then astonished at how such good intentions could go so wrong previous commentators who are australian have explained the unfolding plot's detail better than i ever could but i would like to make an observation about what may lie behind the governor generals sovereign power' all modern laws as i understand them need an ethical or philosophical root to exist in the first place and to become a law at all that being the case and if say the mess had been possibly set up just how many businessmen had been served by presumably without complaint then the labour government could have been victims of which would surely have had to have been by the governor general as or until he could see that the budget standoff was a genuine result of and not elaborate entrapment sponsored by or person's unknown' if its the case that kerr in effect didn't have to refer to the law because fiscal circumstances overrides everything then power' borders onto the implications in any commonwealth country is that rules literally and that any person or organisation has carte blanche to break any other rule physical or mental so long as they have the control over the purse strings ultimately
<START> this is a great concert which featured the best songs of the band's 30 year career lee and were animated and fun on stage and delivered a great show that being said i think the audio recording was botched at the mixing console and or through the process this is not the fault of the boys however they even mentioned that the show was setup last minute so the band and their crew obviously did their best they just shouldn't have put the show out for public consumption neil's snare sounds distant and bass has good harmonic content but no bottom end at all they should have held out on this concert and waited for a better occasion only buy this dvd if you are a hardcore the quality is lacking in the audio department
<START> this film is so awful it is funny not quite to troll 2 levels of hilarity but funny nonetheless the acting is awful the music is atrocious and the story does not make a blind bit of sense the story revolves around a man dressed in an awful granny costume killing a bunch of people at a party the death scenes are so badly done they are hilarious one girl is stabbed repeatedly in the chest but does not scream try or defend or self or run away she also manages to remain standing despite being stabbed repeatedly another death scene involving a rope is also extremely hilarious no thought seems to have been put into the plot the granny seems to magically move from one area to another e g be hiding under leaves in a woodland just where the victim just happens to stand appears in front of someone even though it had been behind them ten seconds earlier people kiss at extremely inappropriate moments would you stop and kiss someone if you were being chased by a homicidal maniac and the double twist at the end is utterly ridiculous it seems they just threw it on just to confuse people i would advise people to watch this film if they love awful horror movies like troll 2 the dreaded or blood gnome but do not watch it if you are expecting a scary horror movie you will be disappointed
<START> i first saw this on the big screen with my girlfriend it was a fun romp with some cool music kristine was on the playboy cover and the centerfold as i recall she's really cute and perky and has lots of charm the movie made me want to see more of her and so i kept a look out for her in other stuff she's in steven spielberg's i wanna hold your hand and barbara streisand's the main event and bill murray's meatballs plus lots of tv shows like night court and tv movies me and my friends really enjoy her but her starring role in alice in wonderland puts the focus right where it ought to be right on kristine as the center of attention probably the prettiest hottest girl i've ever seen in movies
<START> i found this flick enjoyable and involving to watch and i'm surprised it's rated so lowly actually i can see why it is i imagine it's the fans of eric roberts and alyssa milano that have been giving most of the 1s and 2s because if you put the tape into the machine expecting to enjoy watching something starring either or both of these two then you could be rather disappointed eric appears for about half an hour towards the end of the movie and alyssa for about 5 scenes in the second half and in those she says little and wears less although never nude if that's what you're looking for stick with embrace of the vampire although they're always a pleasure it's a pity she or eric don't get much screen time yet i still give this an 8 br br
<START> i thought it was an excellent movie gary cole played the role of a military man who feels trapped and unhappy with his wife who fakes his death fabulously over all i thought the movie was great definitely not a boring plot line it's sad to say but i think lots of men might feel this way i think he should have just gotten a divorce and asked to be transferred instead of the extreme he went to but he felt there was no other way out so he faked his death i thought it was neat that cole's real life wife played the wife he was unhappy with in the movie i think what the guy did was alittle extreme but the movie was great nonetheless definitely recommend it
