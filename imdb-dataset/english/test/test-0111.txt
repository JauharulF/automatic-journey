<START> this film has recently been televised by turner classic movies it may have been considered racy in its time and may have made money but even the most die hard jane russell fan will find it hard to sit through this dreck br br there are many movie musicals from the 1950s which can withstand the test of time even though dated by current standards but which can still be enjoyed because of good music or dancing or an amusing plot the french line however fails at all of these aspects br br it doesn't matter that russell was a fine singer when she is given lousy vocal material the entire cast is dragged down by a boring trite plot and dialogue br br it's not even worth recording and skipping through to only the musical numbers they're crummy
<START> i never intended to see venom but i caught it on cable it does have good elements the louisiana swamp atmosphere for one something we will unfortunately not see so much of in movies because of hurricane katrina it is based on an interesting concept a regular man imbued with the spirits of evil his confrontation with his son could have been interesting as could much of the movie but as tends to happen in hollywood an interesting idea goes down a familiar direction br br kill off all the characters save the good girl starting with the black guys i'm a fan of agnes bruckner but the other characters the villain's afore mentioned son who must become a voodoo priestess are more interesting and for the love of god just once i would like to see the virgin get killed we all like the easy girl why can't she live in this case it was bijou phillips and we love her br br the ending made no sense considering what had been established about the villain's invincibility all the carnage and atmosphere and it leads to nothing
<START> it is said that there are some people out there who actually admire movies well and why not monogram studios lived on a kind of cost plus basis cost plus enough to pay the rent and buy a pizza and a bottle of robust every once in a while sure they're cheap but let's face it they're coarse fast philistine vulgar but exhilarating they have no pretensions at all they're designed to divert the audience for an hour or so at the bottom of a double bill so what if john wayne gallops through the wild west along a road lined with telephone poles this isn't art it's entertainment br br take this movie flight to mars at the beginning when we're first meeting the characters a man might introduce his female companion abruptly avoiding any tedious subtlety professor this is my fiancÃ©e and assistant who is a rocket scientist and a beautiful woman she loves me but is growing impatient with me because i'm always wrapped up in my scientific work perhaps you could steal her from me marry her give her the babies and the picket fenced home she yearns for if necessary i will die on this journey to see her dreams realized also she likes it a little rough it saves a lot of writing and shooting time doesn't it that's what people mean when they say a narrative is fast this one was shot in five days why should we have to hint about these things i mean what the hell is this a cheap sci fi movie or henry james actually this is a particularly well funded example of a monogram movie it's in color for one thing to be exact you can tell it's not any other color you'd recognize and look at the cast the female lead is as is usual with monogram but the male leads are definitely up there on the b list cameron mitchell as the reporter yet to hit his stride as a male lead which come to think of it he never really did and arthur franz as the pipe smoking head scientist the pride of perth new jersey and for science fiction fans how about this pair of aces both morris and john litel there's not really much point in describing the plot in detail the five crew members crash land on mars where they find an underground civilization inhabited by organisms whose evolution was with ours right down to their having five digits and willowy babes in short skirts and they picked up english from listening to our broadcasts american broadcasts that is judging from their speech they're led by a sinister cabal who try to hijack the space ship build many imitations of it and colonize earth they do not succeed br br the special effects aren't very special the men walk around a couple of spare sets wearing black costumes with stylized lightning bolts emblazoned on their chests and scarlet capes billowing behind them their names consist exclusively of english the martian who falls for arthur franz is named alita with an indo european diminutive appendage and she already knows what kissing is br br overall i found it as snappy as it was intended to be but dull too the story is that of any buck rogers 1930s serial once the earthlings and the martians meet and it's established that they have a common language and that the martians have a sinister agenda that's it in two hours even an indifferent screenwriter could turn this into a story of nazi spies in world war ii the plot is done by the numbers the dialog has no sparkle the acting is pedestrian br br however dedicated aficionados of monogram productions should enjoy it after all jean luc goddard the french egghead dedicated a bout de soufflÃ© to monogram so they can't have been all that bad
<START> the stars and the planets must've all been in just the proper alignment the day that thriller was conceived michael jackson's album was slaying the charts john landis still had a lot of good will built up from his genre pic an american werewolf in london not to mention his classic comedies animal house and the blues brothers and choreographer michael peters was creating some of the most innovative and influential pieces for music videos of that period br br not before or since has one single piece of film illuminated exploited or underscored mj's incredible talent or the more otherworldly aspects of his persona quite like thriller the world's most successful if not officially the first long form video and the most fondly remembered also the most expensive at the time but every penny and every bit of the talent behind its creation and execution is up there on the screen and how would it not be complete without the rap from the original song provided by the late great vincent price to add even more cache to the chills already there br br the glory days of one of the world's greatest performers have long since passed but no one can ever take away the man's towering achievements of which this is probably the most memorable if you don't think so now remember halloween is coming i won't be one bit surprised when like other before it going back decades this appears on some saturday night creature feature special br br as it will next year and the year after that
<START> i watch a ton of movies and enjoy the occasional b movie but this movie was awful aside from the homemade quality of the film it was very slow and seemed to make no point i'm only commenting b c of another comment i saw here that said it was great wow maybe ok to watch on a rainy day when nothing else is available br br the characters were disjointed and didn't fit any discernible pattern of reality the dialog between characters was forced and at times very confusing br br i guess if you were very into the whole area 51 and understood some of the nuances other comments reference it may be good but for me the average joe i don't get it
<START> although it isn't mentioned very often don't look in the basement is a very interesting film and is definitely worth a watch the story follows a young nurse charlotte beale who is hired at stephen's sanitarium to replace dr stephens after he is murdered by a patient many patients begin to torment miss beale and her boss dr geraldine masters acts as if she's hiding something br br this movie has many appealing characters that you actually end up caring about and have sympathy for during the climax which doesn't happen very often in horror films the musical score is great and is reminiscent of dark shadows the performance from rosie rhea mcadams and bill are all great the story is very intriguing with a great twist ending this movie has a campy atmosphere around it that no other film i have ever seen has been able to capture many horror fans have never seen or even heard of this film which is really unfortunate because it could have been a horror classic don't look in the basement is definitely worth watching for all fans of 1970s drive in films
<START> the movie night crossing captures the feelings experienced by the vast majority of east germans during the period 1961 89 i lived in west berlin during most of 1967 and travelled through the wall into east berlin on a weekly basis why excitement crossing a border into a soviet governed country experiencing the smells and the feel of east germany which is why night crossing is excellent it captures that very feeling and it is exciting i was arrested by the in checkpoint charlie and accosted by a man in his leather coat and dark glasses i am led to believe was stasi when i watch the movie i can smell cheap diesel and cooking oil i can see the outdated vehicles the drab clothing the public wore and the lacklustre produce in shop windows it brings back memories of realising just how lucky i was to live in a free country in 1988 i toured the ddr from east to west north to south east germany had changed little since 1967 the constantly breaking down were still the main mode of private motorised transport the shops still featured nothing much to tempt me uniforms were still commonplace but the people the ordinary people were open and nice once you had gained their trust watch night crossing it's as close to the truth as any movie you will see on divided germany even closer than two other favourites the spy who came in from the cold and funeral in berlin
<START> a formulaic story with all the tired cliches i was shocked that the horrible script became a movie what a waste how many original scripts are scattered around without being produced br br at the climax i could predict what will happen in every single shot br br oh and don't even get me started about the idiotic sexual tension between the gorgeous female cop and the paralyzed cop who can barely move a finger yeah right i can buy that what next fingers porn
<START> a group of young adults open a plain of escape for the spirit of elizabeth when they recite her poem from a video game supposedly representing a sÃ©ance the only one who dies in the game is miller adam goldberg who also is found dead the same way he perished in said video game while the others' characters didn't die in the video game their reciting her poem has instead unleashed the video game into reality with walking cgi characters stalking and killing each of them one by one they must follow certain methods using a mirror and nails to defeat and save their skin br br if this premise sound stupid that's because it is the characters are ho hum rejects from bad wb television shows this time allowed to spout profanity this flick follows the slasher rules but doesn't show much violence or gore it stays pg 13 safe with most of the death taking place off screen there's a scene where the true hero and heroine are running from video game characters pursuing them yes it's that bad nothing at all to recommend good looking cast including sophia bush as the appropriately named october
<START> this film just won the best film award at the cleveland international film festival it's american title apparently is autumn spring the acting is superb the story takes you into the life of an elderly man who takes what life deals him and spikes it up a little bit abetted by his best friend and partner in not so serious crime he puts people on at every opportunity but still often reveals his heart of gold his wife has come to her wits end and makes a life changing decision which is heartbreaking to watch the resolution of the story is beautiful
<START> before the wwf became cartoon with hulk leading the way the events of wwf tv broadcasts of the very early 1980s resembled the wild wild west with all kinds of grudges and vicious acts of violence performed by some of the wrestlers that are known today to be the most beloved stars some of these seemingly very real moments stand out a maniacal sgt slaughter whipped then champion bob with a riding crop after showed him up in a fitness test were all over sarge made the iron shiek look like a daycare provider slaughter also issued a challenge to anyone who could break his dreaded cobra clutch hold this led a legendary and bloody alley match with commentator pat patterson hall of fame member blackjack mulligan with freddie came into the wwf with a claw hold that was censored on television he claimed he was the true giant at and challenged andre long before big john in 1984 adrian adonis used his ominously named good night irene sleeper to take out the competition a new yorker clad in black leather he was an ominous figure george the animal steele was far from a crowd pleaser as well even jimmy snuka was a fearsome sight as he set out opponents until ray the stevens delivered a piledriver onto the cement floor leaving snuka a bloody mess all these encounters took place a decade before hardcore wrestling was ever spoken of
<START> during university our philosophy professor mr r played us roger me in its entirety this was at a time when the obese misfit was still pretty much unknown a charlatan in the making a soon to be household name who was still busy honing his fact bending skills and still learning how to manipulate the easily impressed the pathologically paranoid the mentally ill the sexually frustrated the illiterate the semi literate the clueless and the laughably gullible among ye br br as we finished viewing it i thought yeah it was somewhat entertaining in a totally daft bugs bunny kind of way but what an ultra biased anti capitalist propaganda turkey that has no objectivity whatsoever this is its sole purpose being to take cheap shots at people and ideas which the film's creator has pet peeves for this isn't a documentary by any stretch of the imagination however our beloved marxist professor was absolutely thrilled with r m and we ended up not only not criticizing any aspects of it but mr r actually spent the remainder of class praising its qualities just so we understand each other the words propaganda viewer manipulation left wing extremist or selective fact presentation never exited his perpetually smiling mouth and just to remind you this was supposed to be a philosophy class not indoctrinate your students with your own political b s course br br anyway now i get to the really interesting aspect this professor mr r is now a highly successful screenwriter in hollywood he has written several left wing scripts with a grade stars in them br br the moral of the story those are the kind of people for whom all doors are open in hollywood br br michael moore is a talentless filmmaker which he proved beyond a smidgen of a doubt with canadian bacon but being a marxist liberal opens doors to just about anyone tinseltown is teeming with rabid pro chavez extremists hence why political brainwashing through simplistic portrayals of reality has been part and parcel of the hollywood experience for many decades now br br embrace this demagogue and you've betrayed your own brain forever
<START> nothing will ever top komodo with the lovely jill hennessey as a shrink but ain't quite as bad as i expected for a syfy channel quickie just make sure to watch it while drunk or stoned or while trying to go to sleep the unimaginative title basically says it all a group of mostly unknown actors converge on an island where a government experiment to grow giant vegetables has gone wrong giant creatures that came into contact with the vegetables have taken over the island and eaten everyone so now the government is preparing to blow up the island regardless of the people being there the acting is wonderfully atrocious especially a mustachioed general right out of the incredible hulk tv series but this is typical of this kind of made for cable schlock the cgi creatures are tv level quality which means you know you're watching cartoon monsters however two of the gals in the group are very cute and worth watching as they run here and there in their tight little outfits you just want to eat them up
<START> my qualifications for this review i own all the alien and predator movies i have and have read almost all the books i can find that are related to this series br br i can safely say this movie is a stinker save your money don't waste your time if you like mindless action mindless gore no plot to speak of like being taken by hollywood see the movie br br if you are a serious alien series fan send a message to the over stuffed over paid suits in hollywood 20th century fox don't give them a penny br br this movie has so many plot holes in it you could sieve pasta through it read the other negative reviews to get the big picture it has all be said accurately so i don't have to repeat them br br the characters in this movie are cardboard you want them all dead and the movie doesn't disappoint almost all of them die even the hot bubble headed blond do you feel sorry for her nope no plot no character development who cares the predators are now idiots too they scan everything but their own dead warrior they are suppose to be a high technology society right in the predator movie they scanned the soldiers and the girl to determine who was armed trophy kills in they scanned charles and let him go because he had cancer major plot hole br br also the r rating is because they have kids in the movie that get a face hugger lots of gore and violence and there is one hospital scene where a very large pregnant women is injected with chest she is implanted by the hybrid alien with 4 or 5 eggs in a mouth to mouth love scene orgy and they all hatch in say 30 seconds sensational gore a plenty nothing more these scenes are laughable not serious it is almost like the violence happens and the alien looks at the camera and waits for applause a thumbs up or a nod of some sort br br the aliens in this movie are all on performance enhancing drugs they develop fast and spread quickly all over the town tons of them everywhere in record spawn time pathetic because it does not stick to the series story line and adds nothing to the aliens aliens predator continuity br br i have noticed the positive reviews are written by people who love the gore laughable as a movie as a continuation of the aliens franchise and the development of the aliens vs predator franchise this movie is a cheesecake clichÃ© at best if you have faithfully followed this series all the rules are broken and the aliens and predators are reduced to comic book characters br br there is not one fantastic memorable action scene there are almost no special effects worth remembering there are no brand name actors the plot is as thin as onion paper that ultimately ends with a we have two choices to get out of this mess the hospital or the center of town i just about wet myself the center of town means everyone is going to get nuked by big brother who somehow knows the town has been infested because they have an in the air that can see the infestation on a radar screen in special effects red spots i just about fell out of my chair special effects red spot alien radar on an over middle america i am splitting my gut laughing br br having to get to the helicopter pad made me choke on my popcorn has anyone played a game called zombies you have to get your playing pieces to the helicopter pad to win i almost wet myself laughing br br the ending is enough to make you shake your head in wonderment who did 20th century fox hire to write this script oh oh ask me a grade 5 student there really can't be any other answer oh yes there can be another answer low budget cheesecake sci fi br br the ending col stevens takes the predator pulse rifle to ms francoise yip she tells him that the earth is not ready for the technology it represents col stevens knows doesn't want the technology to use on earth you are kidding me right ms who is ms the corporation she is in the movie exactly 2 seconds and yet in her infinite far east wisdom she says the world is not ready for the technology seriously the brothers dweebs as directors who is responsible for this hemorrhage abortion of a movie they are the doug and bob mckenzie of directors and yet fox entrusted the flailing alien franchise to them they are touted as special effects experts and yet the movie is all low budget special effects hmmm i see a pattern laughable br br this movie is only made to empty your wallet it serves no other purpose it has no plot it has no main characters worth mentioning it is disjointed it does not adhere to any of the character principles established in previous movies it does nothing to advance the franchise the special effects are lame minimal and low budget and it has no ending to speak of it is low budget and strictly designed to take your hard earned money nothing more br br save your money either watch it on tv where it will very quickly end up buy a bootleg or miss this bleeding altogether there is a reason why fox did not preview this movie to the critics the critics would have eaten this mess alive and no one would have gone to the theaters to see it jr giger the original creator is at this very moment leaning over a toilet spilling his lunch br br 20th century fox this movie is a stinker it is as bad or worse than alien 3 you insult us br br flush now
<START> this movie really sucks br br just try to stay awake for 5 minutes while watching this baloney about a nice girl joan woodbury who gets involved with the 'underworld' because she needs money and because she's too lazy to take a job from friends after they offer it to her alan ladd was supposed to be the star of this thing but he's nowhere to be found for the first freaking half hour and when he does show up he stands around like a constipated mannequin a real dud with enough talky scenes and unlikeable as well as stupid characters to make you wish somebody would shoot anybody like really fast br br bring a pillow
