<START> this movie is really bad the hero can't play you see too much that he learned his walking moves by heart and believe me he walks a lot for 45 min nothing happens he only walks to places and gets out like if the story was so short that they had to extend it by adding useless and boring looks like a scenes br br dialogues are very poor i counted around a lots of hello's and few hang on on the 1st part br br blood is orange like the you put on kid's and scenes are not following themselves a bloody neck on a scene a clean neck on the following br br the story could have been improved yeah i mean what the hell is the story br br martial arts where is that martial arts watch how hesitant and slow are the moves if giving a kick and receiving a punch is called martial arts then i am bruce lee br br the only good point i have found is on fight scenes they don't play with zoom and fast switching scenes that gives you headache in most of action movies br br there are plenty of low budget movies that are great that one was just to make money nothing else
<START> jon good's wife simply one of the worst titles for a film ever or the red right hand another absolutely awful sounding title that means nothing has no relevance to the film under which i saw it is set in massachusettes the year i was born which was quite possibly the best thing to happen during those 365 days where five old college friends meet up for a school reunion gay boy roger john is that surname for real just say it out loud martha alden kim rebecca lawson jenna stern her boyfriend jake stabler john doe alan michael kevin walker his wife sandy megan plus john good marc why is the spelling of 'john' different in the title his wife sara abigail morgan from the word go there is an uneasy tension in the air when someone mentions their 'missing' friend jason lots of unpleasant memories come flooding back then comes the phone calls the mysterious nose bleeds hallucinations guilt as the true horror of the events all those years ago finally comes to light br br produced executive produced directed by kurt who also wrote the thing kurt st thomas who gets the art direction credit too if that wasn't enough they both act in the film as well personally i thought jon good's wife was awful i mean she can't cook or anything ha ha ha only joking seriously though i didn't think much of the film overall for a start it's pretty slow going the entire first 30 minutes is solid snooze material of the reunion consisting of lots of catching up with each other dull character building exposition the film never explains itself what's with those weird nose bleeds for god's sake the mysterious phone calls the almost inconsequential death of one of the group that might or might not be natural what the hell was sara all about she comes across as some nosey sex crazed dirty talking shameless bitter blackmailing know it all whore who apparently sleeps with just about every man she meets some of the dialogue she spouts wouldn't be out of place in a porno it just seems totally at odds with the rest of the film which plays out more like a drama than the horror thriller it was supposedly meant to be then there's the ending if there's a worse way to end a film then to just leave literally everything hanging in the air with no closure whatsoever i have yet to see it the whole thing was very predictable as well i mean is anyone watching this not going to know that when they all mention their friend went 'missing' there wouldn't be more to it br br directors thomas make an infuriating film on top of the predictability annoying climax there is a retrospective narration by alan which i simply don't understand as he has no more or less significance than anyone else at what point in time is he narrating from the reasons behind this narration is never made clear or elaborated upon there's no tension because the whole things so by the numbers br br technically the film is ok but nothing special some of the locations clothes didn't look particularly authentic to me this never convinced me it was taking place during the late 70's the acting was alright what about actor john last name i suppose if his wife was standing next to him we could describe them as a couple of right br br i really didn't think much of jon good's wife a blow up doll would have been better ha ha ha i'm not sure who it would appeal to forget about any gore horror violence scares atmosphere or excitement in fact forget about everything that would have made this film watchable because it ain't here not recommended
<START> actually i'm still in doubt if there's anything about this movie i like as for the story unrealistic and very exaggerated the acting was too bad in my opinion not very likely that will get a rutger hauer status some folks will expect it anyway first let him work on his english pronunciation if you watch the 'trip' to paris of these actors dvd extra you will most likely want to up advice to beau stop your acting career you'll never get there to the 2 main 'actors' grow up please being generous i'd give it 4 out of 10 br br
<START> i watched the first few episodes a short while back and felt i couldn't take it anymore the horrible looking fight scenes are the worst i've ever scene in my life about one third of each episode is dedicated to flash gordon and his mighty fight moves i know fight choreography from that era isn't exactly up to par with today's standards but this is ridiculous they don't even try to make it look realistic flash gordon who hardly resembles a fighter uses his drunken slow moves and bare fist to knock out four or five guys with knives guns and other weapons give me a break there's also a scene where he does some similar act while in the water basically every episode has scenes similar to that as for the rest of the episode there's not much else i remember i basically viewed it out of curiosity on what science fiction looked like 70 years ago
<START> the hurried approach that lewis takes with king of the underworld establishes a deeper plot while still maintaining an efficient run time one of the clearest examples of this is the transition between poverty and wealth for the married medical couple the audience is instantly transported from a shanty medical office to a luxurious suite at the city's most prestigious inn this development is critical to understanding the position the doctors have been thrown into the story suggests from the intro that these two people are generally happy with providing medical practice to those who are less fortunate by abruptly cutting from this scenario to the morally conflicting occupation the personal physician the viewer is called upon to experience this sudden turn of events the nelsons kay francis and john are forcibly employed by gurney bogart without objections this stylized notion of organized crime being too influential and powerful to overcome has become a standard component in every gangster picture the one aspect of this film that raised some questions for me ironically dealt with the pacing of the story and that rate at which it was told i think that character development and social identity can suffer when certain aspects of a story are not fully examined this paradox happens to be a result of personal taste in that i think that the movie going experience can be enhanced through rigorous character development however for the purposes of this film i must admit that the rapid action contributes more dynamic flare to the impact of the film br br 1 2 of
<START> as a teenager i watched this movie every time it was on tv and it was on a lot because of its witty appealing to teenager humor it may not be what critics consider 4 star viewing but i love it for what it is a fun comedy meant to please the audience the teen actors are of my generation probably why i love the movie so much and was like a fantasy cast of everyone's favorite tv shows of the early 90's full house family matters fresh prince all of the shows were represented and the result was probably the best teen movie of the 90's though it may not include the high doses of nudity and violence that so many teen movie writers think vital to success among the youth demographic or perhaps because of its absence i highly recommend it to pre teens and teenagers everywhere
<START> i am an indian residing in the united states why india continues like a dumb animal to emulate everything american is beyond me the main problems with the movie aren't so much the inane plot and dumb comedy it is that this movie has a lot of sex touching women dressing like in the streets and a lot of cursing that doesn't belong anywhere on t v br br to the producers and directors of this movie i have this message you continue to weaken our nation's strong family values by making this sort of junk you continue to let young women think it's okay to have a feminist attitude and have no morals you continue to make dance songs that belong in the lowest of adult clubs and bars i am ashamed to be an indian after seeing movies like this br br in 2003 the united states government suggested that the best way to destroy iran is to there there is no need to do that for india we will destroy ourselves with rubbish like this
<START> this movie is great 80's sleazy slasher movie about three kids born during an eclipse so they kill everyone they see the reason they kill makes practically no sense but it just adds to the charm of this movie and dang these kids are crazy especially curtis if you've seen the movie you know who i am talking about that kid's although the movie doesn't have much gore it is entertaining and for some reason you kind of care about the characters it also has some nice nudity has some decent acting as well really a decent 80's slasher movie it's worth a look if you ever get the chance to see it you'll have nightmares about those darn kids though i guarantee you
<START> there are films that are not released in theaters but on video this one should be allowed to age and disintegrate the way old nitrate film stock does no story inept violence over acted badly written and the sorry thing is that the star was not the only bad part in the film and i did like and enjoyed some of siegel's other movies
<START> without a doubt this is the big momma of all music videos unlike most music videos that are either dance videos badly storied and or badly interrupted lyrics this was done right jackson was co writer and by evidence of vh1 heavily choreographed and directed this masterpiece in fact you could say thriller is creepier then most horror movies with that last second sparkling eye to me this music video is what you judge all other music videos on you can easily see the ominous influence m j had on early break dancing with the zombie march number because of the dancing comedy storyline and yes horror i give it a 5 of 5
<START> better than i expected from a film selling itself on the premise of nymphomania and inter racial bondage the music is great and cinematography focuses greatly on turning ricci into a trailer trash betty paige and it works samuel l get's to shout a lot which he's good at as well as play lots of blues guitar which he looks cool doing even justin timberlake was decent as the mentally disturbed boyfriend i get the feeling that this material under anyone else would have been complete s but instead managed to just barley carve out it's own odd little transgressive pulp niche while still being an effective drama
<START> after some quite ok dutch action flicks like lek and van god los gerrard wants to make a movie about the life of a dutch mobster well mobster is a big word for he isn't a real international big guy like george jung blow or pablo he is just an amsterdam lowlife who made some money by selling soft drugs things are often blown up in the netherlands and this movie is just an other example but even then the movie could be very nice if the story was okay told now there are major jumps in time one day is just an ordinary drug boy the next shot he seems to be a big player in the drug scene nobody knows how's that possible except for those who read the book the acting is really bad the non dutch movie watchers get to see one of the worst actresses in the netherlands chantal when you think she finally gets naked then you are watching a stand in model so bad acting bad montage crap story de br br please don't watch it even if other people say it's good because it isn't i've warned you
<START> i saw this movie on tv back in the 60s and it still stands up well even after brilliant performances as a di by r lee ermey lou gossett and even frank sutton in a comic vein on gomer pyle usmc i wasn't in the service but my brother had a recording of a drill instructor in the air force and it was scary others in the family who were marines told me that ermey and even sutton were pretty spot on in their roles the only thing missing in the d i is the language in 1958 they couldn't yet use profanity on film yet jack webb came across pretty damned tough without it i think it's his best role ever in dragnet he was quite stiff i'll admit though not as bad as george raft but he used it only to effect in the d i you never forget the funeral for the dead flea the romantic part was just to stretch the movie but didn't really interfere with the basic plot don was pretty good to but he never surpassed this film in his career as far as patriotism jack webb was tv's john wayne he carried it a bit too far in some dragnet episodes but not in the d i after 40 some years i hoped the film could stand up to the likes full metal jacket and others and it did
<START> i was delighted to see this gem of a film available on dvd despite being a 'tv movie' and shot on 16mm it provided a wonderful insight into the different types of people who wanted to become a 'london along with their foibles and family commitments even the most hapless of candidates 'titanic' with his uncommunicative wife it was possible to see how jack was able to craft an often funny and sometimes tragic snippet of london life into an entertaining 90 minutes br br originally premiered as a vehicle for mick ford pun intended the quality of the acting from an ensemble cast including michael nigel hawthorne jonathan lynn lesley joseph and maureen lipman mrs meant mick may have had top billing but he had to work hard in the face of such competing talents br br even 15 years after its 1991 release it is still as fresh as ever
<START> after wasting 2 hours of my life watching this movie on late night television i went back and reread some of the imdb material to remind myself of why i watched it in the first place in hindsight the only thing that i can think of is that the genre generally appeals to me but this movie was a total waste of effort it fails on every level and to see that it's described on imdb as a comedy really leaves me at a loss i don't recall more than a couple of chuckles there are more laughs in any episode of law and order than in the last man seriously br br too much of the characters' interaction just didn't seem to me to have any foundation and was therefore very unlikely unbelievable br br if it hadn't been for the almost gratuitous bikini shots well what can i say avoid this movie like the plague or tape it and just fast forward to the bikini shots do not spend even 1 to rent it though
