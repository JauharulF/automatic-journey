<START> this show is great for many reasons the father and mother can communicate with their kids this day in age its so great to see a real family instead of some stuffy overacting family i watched this one time and became hooked it so great to see a black family on tv worth watching this show left too soon but on its way out it dealt with pregnancy sexy drugs bad dates death etc the best thing about the show was that it dealt with it in a real humorous sort of way great show for the family i cant tell you how many times i have sat up watched this show late at night sometimes and laughed my head off great pg 13 rated show i loved of this show
<START> for greta garbo's first talking picture mgm wisely chose eugene o'neill's prize winning 1921 play anna christie br br also wisely the producers backed garbo up with not one but two members of the original broadway cast george marion as anna's father chris and james t mack as johnny the priest transmuted to johnny the harp for films so as not to offend br br this little change is interesting like too many films accused by those who want movies to be movies and ignore their origins of being little more than filmed stage plays the problem is not the play but the movie makers who wouldn't be more faithful to the property by diluting a great cinematic stage work so it wouldn't offend anyone or opening it up because they could too many lose the very qualities which made the piece worth filming in the first place br br fortunately the respect the studio had for both o'neill and garbo allowed anna christie to survive the normally destructive process admirably in frances marion's generally sensitive screen adaptation wonder of wonders marion even allows the point of the scene where garbo's anna reveals her past on the farm to the man she badly wants to marry and the father who sent her there in tact what the league of decency must have thought of that br br the source play's greatest problem has always been that chris's friend marthy tends to walk away with the first act and then disappears from the last two so that anna can take stage the two sides of the genuinely good woman men don't always recognize br br the perfectly cast marie dressler who had cut her teeth on the broadway stage as well before going to hollywood is the perfect balance for garbo's anna in this area as well and the fast moving film at only 90 minutes doesn't allow us too much time to miss her one of the few benefits from atmosphere being shown rather than eloquently described in the original and screenwriter marion is wise enough to stray from o'neill to bring dressler back for a touching scene two thirds of the way through the film that will remind many of julie second act appearance in show boat br br anna and early scene together on screen 16 minutes into the film taking each other's measure and setting up all the tension of the rest of the story is among the most affecting scenes in the entire piece not to be missed br br anna christie is great tragic play and a good film drama it's hard to imagine that a latter day remake which would almost certainly lose the grit and atmosphere of this 1930 remake it was first filmed without sound in 1923 also with george marion's original broadway chris could improve on this excellent filming br br the internal scenes hew closest to the play but the exteriors shouldn't be missed by anyone with an eye to atmosphere while the background screen work is not to modern technical standards the backgrounds give a better glimpse than most films of the era of the actual world in which the screen play is set especially in the new york harbor br br nearly all garbo's naturalistic performances of the sound era have held up superbly only the too often parodied death scene from camille 7 years later will occasionally draw snickers because of the heavy handed direction and the parodies but this anna christie together with the variety of her 1932 films mata hari and grand hotel and the sublime lubitsch touch on her 1939 comedy ninotchka garbo laughs surely stand as her best br br o'neill fans who are taken with this play at the edge of his lauded sea plays should track down the fine world war ii shaped film released in the year before the u s entered the conflict the long voyage home 1940 it is almost as skillfully drawn from those sea plays as this one is from anna christie and features a youngish john wayne in one of his rare non westerns supporting a fine cast of veteran actors showing him the way
<START> great movie good acting a wonderful script it's exciting to find out what the people are thinking and how they react on the situation they are in a pity about the ending a of text of how life went on instead of moving images was a poor choice i hope this movie attracts a lot of people it's worth it
<START> ah hitchcock it's hard to find a bad hitchcock movie until he lost it after the birds 1963 and saboteur proves the point having admired most of this director's work for many years i had managed to skip this one perhaps from lack of interest in priscilla lane and robert cummings as lead actors i was of course familiar with the statue of liberty climax from having seen it repeatedly in film retrospectives but i wrongly assumed the story leading up to it might not hold my interest was i wrong the suspenseful plot gets cooking right off the bat through a chance encounter between the bad guy saboteur and the good guy wrongly accused protagonist and continues zooming along through a series of further chance encounters and narrow escapes familiar hitchcockian elements are all there the innocent person wrongly accused of a crime people not being what they seem to be dramatic or unlikely locations that intensify the suspenseful scene being played out within them an airplane hangar a ranch a bridge from which the handcuffed hero hurls himself to escape the police a sumptuous charity ball in a palatial mansion an upper floor of a skyscraper and finally the torch of the statue of liberty br br throughout is humor provided by supporting players generous dollops of early ww2 vintage social comment moments of human warmth where suffering people find it within themselves to lend a hand to help a fellow human getting nothing in return Â in short there was always a basic humanity at the core of hitchcock however grisly the trappings a sensational cast of supporting players chiefly otto kruger as the slickest villain this side of george sanders his broadway credits include the male lead in noel coward's private lives Â and that says it all and weaselly norman lloyd as the titular saboteur not to mention alma kruger Â no relation to otto Â as a prominent society dowager involved in fifth column intrigue her character foreshadows that of claude mother in notorious priscilla lane does a fine job with a difficult role for most of her early scenes we can't tell whether she believes the hero to be innocent or guilty and she seems constantly to shift her opinion not coming over to his side fully until late in the proceedings one cannot ascertain whether her acting is at fault or whether we are meant to be kept in a state of uncertainty but the plot developments are so swift fun and clever that we really don't care what she thinks br br then there are the peculiar hitchcock touches that have nothing to do with the plot twice the lane character pauses to get change for a quarter Â once to reimburse her kidnappers for an ice cream soda and again to make a call from a phone booth why these scenes were inserted are anybody's guess perhaps to make the film seem more realistic and thus heighten the believability and suspense or perhaps to give the audience a moment to catch its breath some of the characters are over the top Â the garrulous truck driver the impossibly kind and trusting blind man living alone in a spotlessly maintained forest cabin the political philosophy spouting human skeleton and other members of the circus caravan who hide the protagonists from their pursuers
<START> a brilliant professor and his sidekick journey to the center of the earth in a huge machine which screws its way to the core there naturally they find all kinds of things that are intent on killing and eating them plus of course a love interest for the young sidekick ho hum does the plot never take a different tack
<START> first i am a big fan of alien and alien ii in my opinion both of these movies created and defined the si fi horror genre as we know it today i noticed lifeforce was often compared to the aliens saga after viewing this movie i would highly disagree there are some okay special effects with the alien vampires and the story line might have been acceptable i just can't get past a naked woman space vampire throughout the whole movie this is absolutely absurd although she does look good add in a bunch of bad british acting and it's pretty much over most of the movie ends up taking place in london or somewhere in england so after the first 20 minutes you lose the outerspace setting and any hope of some real si fi horror action and suspense br br
<START> after the lush inspiring aerial shot in fast motion in the opening of the movie this slipped into utter boredom and a one tone note right till the end br br where to begin well i'll start with the characters i really enjoyed them in the book here they all were types and one dimensional morons that either had victim or asshole written on their foreheads from the get go how any one didn't see through the store owner gaunt in a hammy and out of place performance by is beyond me br br this film lacks in thrills suspense and in some sense yes entertaining values it stretches itself for far too long with not a lot of pay off why introduce too many annoying should die quick type of characters and then forget about half of them half way through in the book practically everyone that went into the store met a grisly fate here besides one of the only decent scenes that translated well from the novel the fight between and nettie was a letdown and didn't have much balls i'm sorry but after one off screen death a boring shoot off and some bickering and then a couple explosions just didn't do it for me the brutality and mean spiritedness from the book was sadly missing the explosion of the church scene was so over the top and badly executed all of sudden the entire city was in a brawl it made no sense and characters that weren't introduced all the way through suddenly are who are these people and why should i care br br the story is all over the place and none of the scenes had momentum i thought ed harris and bonnie were good actors in this but the movie gives them not enough substance for me to give a damn amanda plummer was credible but too pathetic to really be sympathetic in the novel she was a sad and depressing character here it was a too one note j t walsh was entertaining but the role was far from interesting or layered too predictable br br the soundtrack was too classy for the material it was supporting it stood out like sore thumb easy there buddy easy something a little less theatrical i'd assume would have worked br br i will admit some of the gore it did manage to have was good enough i guess the director seemed to hold back a lot of the times though if your going to make a movie that reaches the 2 hr point be sure to have far more going on then this disaster of a adaption of on of kings better novels br br i often found myself laughing at scenes that were suppose to be taken seriously ed harris speech at the end or the character hugh priest in general and was bored and uninterested most of the other time personally the director should have done so much more with this story his approach is too tame and hides behind too much crisp cinematography to ever come off as a decent movie the movie looks good but not the look i think this story deserved i mean this dude helmed alaska not a good sign br br i'd rather just read the book as you should too as if it is far more entertaining layered character development grisly violence and mayhem a nasty sense of humour and far more oomph this is a butchered version that has not much to offer br br out of
<START> for a scientifically engineered super dog that was supposed to be the answer to petit crime chomps was a chump br br all i ever saw chomps do was sit or walk or run or run then walk then sit and then get back up again and stretch and then walk and then jog to k tel dance hits and sometimes it had all the answers to the daily jumbo but mostly it just sat a lot br br all i am saying is in a celebrity death match chomps couldn't take out mr
<START> i remember when the love machine was first released to theaters i was a mere 13 years old too young to see the much ballyhooed motion picture release but not too old to take my mom's paperback copy of the jacqueline susann novel to school and pore over the 'naughty with my schoolmates br br though i'm not sure what my problem was at such an early age but i was very much into the book i bought and wore an ring just like on the paperback cover and i remember the ads for the perfume xanadu that was cross promoted and featured clumsily in the film despite such an interest i didn't actually see the film until several years later i should have left things as they were br br the love machine is hands down the worst of the many bad films adapted from novels which of course makes it the most fun to watch its faults are many from its script that jumps choppily from one incident to another with nary a connecting thread its dated horny brass instruments i mean music score of ersatz bacharach the flat first take performances the boring sexuality i've never seen featured so prominently in a movie before it's like a fetish whenever sex nudity or something sleazy is called for out pops somebody in a blue robe very odd that and most certainly the circus train of awful 70's fashions that are on endless display poor dyan cannon's performance which is no great shakes anyway but heads over the rest of the cast is consistently undermined by the jaw dropping get ups she's called upon to wear however the film's chief liability is the stoic stone like john philip law as appropriately enough robin stone the object of every girl's and one top flaming male photographer's affection br br law is just awful and performs as if he were pulled off the street handed the pages of the script in hurry and told to give a cold reading on the spot just lifeless not only that but he appears in desperate need of a blood transfusion or something he looks wan and sickly throughout and is several pounds smaller than most of his female costars robin stone should be a hunk not a hankie br br for anyone finding the film hard going it's rather slow by today's standards i beg you to stick around for the climactic fight scene here ms cannon balancing 23 pounds of teased hair finally abandons her heretofore starchy acting style and lets loose with that infectiously raucous laugh of hers setting in motion a truly memorable free for all that should have become a cinema clip highlight by now trying to rival valley of the dolls 's infamous wig down the toilet scene the love machine finally does something right br br jacqueline unique brand of trash is sorely missed perhaps someone out there owns the rights to rona the and will revive the genre
<START> i have seen this movie 4 times in 5 months and i never get tired of it just because it is perfect and it has also got the best film music ever and the best supporting roles ever written for a movie i mean you just have to love robert duval marlon brando martin sheen and fishburne in this movie but specially duval i can not believe that kramer vs kramer did win an oscar in stead of this amazing war movie so this is my conclusion if you take the director of the worlds greatest movie the godfather and the best of hollywood actors you can only succeed now i just have to writhe something to get this preview so do not read this except the last line this movie rules
<START> during my childhood time i have seen the first three critters movies and enjoyed 'em they were fun and entertaining horror comedies perfect for adventurous horror loving kids i have never seen critters 4 so i finally decided to check it out my verdict forgettable and pretty bad flick with strikingly low body count the script by joseph lyle and david j is both predictable clichÃ©d the plot rips off alien and star wars and the sets look bland and murky the tone of the film appears to be deadly serious throughout making it slow and dull critters 4 was apparently so low budget that the filmmakers couldn't afford any optical effects the ones taken from android look seriously dated 4 out of 10 one to avoid
<START> this is how i interpreted the movie first things first there was not a single scene in the movie where u see the bad guy taylor torturing or nailing ben's hands to the wall however the same cannot be told of the gals in the end too u see taylor disappear as he walks looks like the message there was there was no taylor and the whole movie was a figment of imagination of ben also there was no scene during the torturing moments wherein any of the gals confront or are in the same frame as ben it was taylor all the time but in real taylor was ben if they were two different people then why was there no scene showing both of them in one frame during the horrific times but of course before that u do see both of them together and that just be ben's imagination at work also when ben was out of jail the text on screen clearly says that ben's story was unrealistic and there was no such place as he had explained read mine cars etc even after liz hunter leaves kristy and comes back to find ben she doesn't find him why because ben taylor was out looking for the gals instead kristy has all the time in the world to check out taylor's ben web cam photos etc br br somehow everything sums up to just one fact that kristy and liz both of them knew that taylor was ben so my conclusion is that ben was schizophrenic and the movie where you see him and taylor in one frame was nothing but figments of his imagination otherwise if there really was a taylor then they should have found him out given all the detailed explanation coming from ben
<START> in this election year where so much idealism is attached to one of the candidates it is poignant to watch a film that warns us not to make an idol out of anyone running for public office br br luke is the writer and director of choose connor there are significant parts of the film that reveal that he is a when it comes to telling stories via the cinema br br go see this movie before the election and then ponder why and for whom you will cast your vote br br let you eyes be opened like those of the young protagonist br br a mix of citizen kane advise and consent and paths of glory by a young director as talented as those who made the films listed above
<START> from br br the dialog is terrible awful drivel acting poor many plot flaws i don't recommend this at all br br from wikipedia br br artistic licenses the working manuscript of the score is attributed to two 1 both of whom were male not female as depicted in the film br br the neither contributed to nor altered the score in fact they were berated by beethoven for any deviation that occurred from the original score br br the movie is set in 1824 during the composition of beethoven's ninth symphony throughout the movie beethoven is shown to be hard of hearing but quite capable of understanding people who speak loudly in reality beethoven had lost much of his hearing seven years earlier beethoven never experienced permanent deafness his condition between total silence and terrible tinnitus the ninth symphony was composed at a time when beethoven's hearing had deteriorated severely at this point in his life most of beethoven's conversations were facilitated by the use of notebooks it can be argued however that he was also able to read people's lips evidenced by his insistence that people face him when they spoke to him br br in the film beethoven makes an allusion to the moonlight sonata this is an anachronism as the sonata no 14 quasi una fantasia was not named moonlight until several years after his death
