<START> i cant believe there are people out there that did not like this movie i thought it was the funniest movie i had ever seen it my have been b c i am mel brooks biggest fan i know almost all the words and get very discouraged when they censor them when it is played on a family channel this is one of my favorite movies so i dont know why any one would disagree thanks kristina
<START> i can barely even remember what decade i saw this film it was when i was a teenager i think i'm 37 now i started watching it as a late night movie sometime in the mid to early 80s and so much of it has stayed with me ever since seeing other comments i had no idea it was shown at theatres or that anyone else even new it existed i don't think i've even mentioned the movie to anyone else br br but half a lifetime later i still remember much of the movie that i watched late at night so long ago i think the innocence of the their situation their mutual affection over a long period of time left a long term imprint for reasons i don't quite understand maybe it is because i was a teenager at the time i saw it and it touched me somehow i really don't know i also really wanted to know what was going to happen when the after the end of the film happened oh the agony br br i've not seen it before or since but i would love to i keep a casual look out for it but i now doubt it will been shown and it seems to have faded into oblivion but i'd miss it in the tv guide even if it did show up br br reading the reviews here has renewed my interest if anyone knows of its availability in australia by all means email me and let me know br br oh and sean bury nice to see you make an appearance on the comments here i've had a look at your movie history and noticed your last appearance in a james bond film what are you up to these day oh and do you have a copy of the film cheers
<START> i just thought i would add another observation here while there are a couple of visual sub references in this episode to the possibility of unexpressed feelings between jim kirk and yeoman janice rand there is a special physically tender moment toward the end when the enterprise is reversing at emergency warp speed in an attempt to outrun a possibly fatal plasma ball janice perhaps fearing that their life is about to come to a dramatic end seeks comfort by placing her head on jim's sympathetic shoulder as they observe the instrument of their impending doom on the main viewer i thought it was sweet and janice of course is gorgeous br br p s goof several times while supposedly firing the film shows photon torpedoes being launched
<START> there no doubt in one mined that this movie is stupid and unfunny joke but tell the truth it is quite entertaining if you re first time viewer and try not to analyzed anything over all the movie have a very good ideas but badly written br br the story of the two losers waking up to find out that they can't remember what happen to them the day before only to find out later that they are after by the angry twin girl friends aliens transsexual stripper aliens nerds and some gangs members br br isn't it like the bourne identity yeah yeah i know how can i compare the two movies but what the hell they both have no memories peoples were after them and so on br br anyway the movie is stupid and is only for the viewer that like stupid movie br br reason to watch Â· loads of young talented actors Â· very stupid after all you know it a stupid movie why not make it extreme br br reason not to Â· if you like to analyzed then forget it Â· talented young actors turn bad Â· good plod turn really bad br br rating 4 10 grade e br br br br 'dude where's my car' wait what do you expected from ashton movie i think almost every people got the same answer for this guy 'a really stupid movie' apart from 'that 70s' shows' this guy really has nothing to offer his fan he should thank the series for his reputation 'dude where's my car' is one of his trademark somehow his film is even worst than adam sandler's movies can you imagine that the movie is really non sense no story line and no nothing mara jennifer garner alison sweeney and s w should not have wasted their talent on this garbage they even came up with dude where's my car' this shows how the movie companies are dying of making money rather than quality br br max 4 10 br br recommendation borrow it from your friends or just forget about it
<START> i saw this movie five times and never get tired of it this features traces of the giallo genre but also with a vivid italian countryside setting where ignorance and superstition are deadlier than any serial killer featuring excellent location reminiscent sometimes of fellini sometimes of the taviani brothers good characterisation and some of the finest genre actors including the great tomas and ida lupino in an unforgettable role this is not euro trash just a masterpiece that should be discovered generation after generation it recently recieved great acclaim at the paris cinematheque at a double feature tribute to lucio fulci
<START> i've always been a fan of chuck norris for what he's accomplished and his movies for while i had been meaning to watch this film but for whatever reason didn't have chance apparently i didn't miss much this has to be one of chuck's worst films so this trucker billy is given the chance to make his delivery but on the way he is and forced into a town where a foolish local corrupt judge trimmings murdock who runs the whole town has him arrested and phony charges brought up on him he denies the charges and makes a run for it the local hick cops beat him and he disappears but now his brother jd john norris another trucker goes looking for him he soon finds that the town is run buy the loser judge and that his brother is nowhere to be found not long after he begins to beat off just about everyone in town in the meantime the female of the film calls on local truckers on a cb radio and they all come rushing into town demolishing it lol with there big rigs eventually norris finds his brother and beats off more thugs br br this movie was pretty bad it actually starts off ok and you feel great when norris starts to smash some of these local corrupt cops because there such losers but there is virtually no story the acting is bad and the ending Â well it doesn't really have one the judge has his house rammed into by a big rig and you never know what happens does he live norris never even gets to trash him in the meantime norris takes on some thug cop at the end who cares norris also manages to take on everyone in town gets his hand broken and shot in the side and goes on to keep fighting come on this movie was apparently made to cash in on the cb craze of the time why there was one is beyond me they barley even use the in the movie adding to this the movie near the end seems to drag on and you wonder why it's not over yet this movie is bad but if you're bored and need something to watch it will pass the time as far as norris he went on to make much better films than this 3 out of 10
<START> some spoilers included br br although many commentators have called this film surreal the term fits poorly here to quote from encyclopedia surreal means br br fantastic or incongruous imagery one needn't explain to the unimaginative how many ways a plucky ten year old boy at large and seeking his fortune in the driver's seat of a red mustang could be fantastic those curious might read james kincaid but if you asked said lad how he were incongruous behind the wheel of a sports car he'd surely protest no way what fantasies and incongruities the film offers mostly appear within the first fifteen minutes thereafter we get more iterations of the same in an ever cruder and more squalid progression that far from incongruous soon proves predictable not that it were on the other hand literally believable but it were unfair to tax in particular with this flaw any plausible suspension of disbelief having fallen precipitously on the typical film maker's and viewer's scale of values ever since raiders of the lost ark became a blockbuster br br hallucinatory how do we know what a hallucination is if part of having one is not knowing that we are having one at any rate some people know that they enjoy hallucinogenic drugs but if typifies the result of doing so then i'm at a loss as to why anyone would take them more than once there is of course the occasional bad trip the movie must be one of those pun and all br br juxtaposition of words that was startling how many times can a ten year old startle you by uttering oh my god when he likes something or damn when he doesn't these two are about par for the course with this script sadly any sense of the surreal in what passes for dialogue could only reveal in direct proportion one's naivete regarding the speech patterns of the rising american generation br br a world completely defined and minutely depicted but that makes no rational sense world indeed makes no sense but it is about as completely defined as a cartoon in an elementary school newspaper the numerous guest stars in the cast all have cameo roles even less intelligent than our little hero who exclaims damn in the blink of an but needs several seconds to concoct the lamest lie and even his character despite appearing in nearly every scene gets no significant development here's scant reward for any viewer who sympathizes as i must enough to wish to know him better and understand 'where he's coming from ' one vaguely senses a far better story and protagonist struggling to get out br br fully recognizable realistically painted images are removed from their normal contexts and reassembled within an ambiguous paradoxical or shocking framework no we see a succession of stereotypical and ever more dilapidated billboards filling stations greasy spoon cheap hotels and their lowlife along country highways exactly where they stereotypically belong br br largely responsible for perpetuating the traditional emphasis on content there is little content moment to moment in br br to sum up picture british millionaires dressed as clowns or pirates on the way to a posh costume party sitting serene and mute as cautious chauffeurs inch their rolls like fragile through a roiling sea of desperate humanity chinese who implore them through the windows and smear the glass with blood or imagine a stadium full of abandoned antiques limousines like those above now rusting and white pianos by ghosts into this detritus wander an exhausted boy and an ailing woman to whom he clings as mother figure becoming girl friend who fall asleep side by side on the grass he is awakened on the feast of the white and day 1945 by a brilliant flash on the horizon that is not the rising sun finding that his consort has become a corpse he first believes that he has witnessed her soul going up to heaven later he explains only a little less innocently 'i learned a new word today atom bomb it's like god taking a photograph ' now there are just two samples of cinematic surrealism surrealism whose ironies ripple out far enough to invade its film's very title empire of the sun if you seek surreal please don't miss it alas however hard he treads on the accelerator to race his chariot through and beyond the desert no scenes so exquisitely strange rich subtle or gorgeous await poor little gus in his quest br br none of the above necessarily constitutes a thumbs down on this film though somewhat disappointed i can't dismiss it in view of the respectability of another genre that it does exemplify one influenced to be sure by surrealism but also by expressionism existentialism and franz kafka's pessimism amidst omnipotent power structures let's try on for size theater of the absurd br br turning to e b 's article on this style i am amazed by how to the extent that theater of the absurd is a valid artistic style the above objections to vanish like a puff of smoke i'm tempted to quote the entire text as support of the identification br br theater of the absurd attempts to show that the human situation is essentially absurd devoid of purpose humankind is left feeling hopeless bewildered and anxious having instantaneously achieved his purpose of getting away from a depressing home life among bickering parents gus finds himself purposeless until he drives past a glittering billboard reading and decides to win the lottery that it promises as others have already revealed this ambition proves illusory although the game never expires the sponsoring corporation has no intention that anyone should ever win and has ways to trick confuse and leave crestfallen any aspirant to the reward he like others is ultimately disappointed in his dream br br absurdist playwrights therefore did away with most of the logical structure of traditional theatre there is little dramatic action as conventionally understood however frantically the characters perform their serves to underscore the fact that nothing happens to change their existence a timeless circular quality emerges language in an absurdist play is full of repetitions repeating the obvious until it sounds like nonsense underneath a sometimes dazzling comic surface we find an underlying message of metaphysical distress obsession with a silly game his inane language the plot device wherein he a bleak future and or returns to an earlier moment and takes a different but still bleak turn so much fits now while an admirer of the surreal would do better with some films anyway of spielberg admirers of as it really is should find fellow travelers not instead but addition in the works of beckett ionesco and br br but one can't quite stop here after his disillusionment with the game gus returns to phil i e love the first attendant he had met and the one person who had treated him decently although he had also scolded him at a service station advertising be full filled under phil's tutelage he learns a life of waiting for cars we might note here that the absurdist playwright beckett had entitled his most famous play waiting for godot and that for godot we should read god god is one of phil's preoccupations too furthermore as the indirect result of his previous encounter with gus phil is badly maimed and goes about in a cast with his arms straight out in the last scene gus now phil's protege says that he wants to hear music we hear none but we see phil wiggling his fingers at the end of his outstretched arm beckoning gus closer and gus responds the end br br finally on to an author whom i happen to be reading currently the anglican theologian william stringfellow if this rebel lawyer is not acknowledged as an architect or of liberation theology which is more a roman catholic than an anglican movement perhaps he should be police brutality and corporate greed are a cliche in cinema and literature including but stringfellow supports and illuminates such sentiments with impressive warrants from scripture tradition and reason br br his most significant work is an expose of the earthly activities of those fallen angels whom the bible refers to as and powers wrote stringfellow are behind all of our popular three i's images institutions and ideologies all of these commend themselves to our worship by making false promises the more deeply involved with an image an institution or an ideology any person becomes the more his own becomes depleted and be becomes a slave to them promising power control and immortality they inexorably deliver helplessness chaos and death as essentially fallen defeated powers they can do no more than that yet they humans with that dominion over the earth promised by god in the book of genesis while in fact no one of us controls an image an institution or an ideology bent inevitably on its own hegemony and self preservation they take on lives of their own dominion happens to be a mistranslation a more accurate rendering of the hebrew would be stewardship but this is a quibble beside a more fundamental problem most of us neglect to notice that god had this power to adam before the fall we have no reason to assume that we his descendents still exercise it now on the contrary it should be obvious that demonic forces have stolen it from us br br one might add two observations of c s lewis first that man's conquest of nature is a mere illusion and a ruse to cover the fact that one is really talking about the conquest of some men by other men with nature as the instrument and secondly contrary to popular belief satan is no kind of good time charlie he may dangle out pleasures at first but he is very with them and will withdraw them from any human firmly in his thrall perhaps leaving his prey sitting in front of the fire feeling miserably sorry for himself and seething with resentment br br now applying these insights to we seem them mirrored remarkably in experience he is if not nice at least a pretty little boy prior to falling victim to the game the first signs advertising it glisten glamorously the longer he continues however and the deeper he journeys towards the sponsoring corporation's headquarters the more shabby they become he's lonely meeting no one else who plays the game the stations giving out the cards have either fallen into ruins or are staffed by zombies the people he does meet along the way are more and more ugly deceitful and hostile the fact that the answer to a common dictator does not mean that they can abide one another humanity is out of him as he becomes not only totally self centered and oblivious to the needs of others but partially blinded disfigured prematurely aged while infantile in the literal sense of linguistically challenged eventually even his precious mustang is taken from him in a crash and he must continue in a dead man's wreck yet at long last having done everything he thought was expected he presents himself to the principality in its proud tower to receive his prize using the biblical power to confuse wielded by those who have built such monuments to their own vanity its agents evade him disappoint insult and finally throw him from the top floor he falls long and hard landing finally in a body of water in other words in classic symbolism he dies he has met the inevitable bad end of anyone who has put his faith in such a deceiver br br but this fate proves to be only a warning look into a mutable future he repents and returns to phil and upon seeing him performs the very first generous selfless act we have seen from him for almost an hour and a half noting that phil is now handicapped and hardly able to insert a hose into a gas tank he asks can i help you with that then seeing the help wanted sign he decides to apply for the job explaining to the motorist with whom he was hitch hiking that he reckons he'll get out here because it doesn't look like too bad a place to work br br this interpretation is conjectural of course and it may surprise or even outrage the film's cult classic aficionados who see quite different points in it br br if isn't quite my cup of tea i'm at least convinced now that it's hardly the worst film ever made
<START> this movie was jerry bruckheimer's idea to sell some records no seriously it was the thinking behind it is that if you made a film full of pop songs you could stick the tracks on a lp sell it and make even more money for the studio you could also release a few tracks as singles and intercut the promo video with clips from the movie so that when mtv play a track you're actually getting free advertising for the movie this is a good business deal but an artistic disaster because many of us still have nightmares about hollywood movies from the 1980s and i rate the mid 1980s as the poorest time in artistic terms for american film making and flashdance opened the door to this let's make a 90 minute pop video instead of a movie type film making br br jennifer beals plays alex owens a dancer who works as a to make ends meet and right away logic disappears with this career choice welding is a fairly sophisticated trade it's not something you walk into and learn in five minutes there's other gaps in logic like ballet dancing and being somehow similar ie if you apply to be a ballet dancer and do some hot dirty the male judges might want to meet you after the audition but you won't get the job it's kind of like saying that screen writing novel writing and play writing are somehow the same when they're not br br but i guess none of this mattered to jerry when he asked director adrian lyne to make the movie actually lyne almost makes a very sexy movie is very sweet and innocent looking fortunately i out why her face is brightly lit in close up while her silhouette is darkly long shots except when the camera cuts to close ups of her heavenly toned body that's because a body double is used most of the time and frequently the body double is a man i bet there's a few naughty boys who are feeling guilty not to mention slightly disgusted to know that
<START> this is an old dark house movie a young couple creep around a weird mansion said to be run by satan where they run from and into one after another of an ill assorted crew a lady in distress an ape an ape man a midget various odd looking people and for some reason two chinese they end up in a throne room where the hero is required to play a price is right sort of contest involving a climb up seven steps with seven illuminated footprints hence the title for my taste it's too much of the same thing the creeping around fun house corridors is amusing for a while then becomes repetitive by comparison with harold lloyd or buster keaton or laurel and hardy doing the same bit in two reels it isn't truly funny it's not frightening either and apparently wasn't intended to be the household is too absurd most films in this genre balance the comedy with a genuine threat and usually two one that the characters are led to believe is real and another for which it's a cover here the cover isn't to be taken seriously and neither is what covered a few moments of fun emerge from the mix but it's rather heavy fun the novel on which the film was based was a straight thriller and i think could have been played straight to better effect and still could be
<START> the soap is an interesting movie and very brilliant at parts you must watch it for its strong characterisation and the risks the plot about two troubled individuals falling in love takes you must know the story through various other reviews so lets speak about what is brilliant about this movie br br firstly the two protagonists are so real and such intriguing personalities the first being a woman who has opted out of a four year relationship and is angry enough to sleep with anyone coming her way the second being a man who has always wanted to be a woman whose pain and loneliness is shown with so much sensitivity and brilliance you hate the former and your heart bleeds for the latter br br the second thing about this movie is the entire concept of loving one for who one is irrespective of gender so would you still love your partner if he she were to change his her sex the movie explores that idea and it is a beautiful one br br but there is one point where the movie fails i wish the relationship between the protagonists had developed in a better way that what they feel is love doesn't come across till the end but watch it and post your thoughts on it here
<START> mean spirited and down right degrading adaptation to the classic children's tale not only lacks the charm of its forefather but lacks any talent what so ever mike myers should not only be ashamed of himself for his horrible performance that is a clear rip off of what jim carrey did but he should give up acting all together he is so annoying that you would want to beat the crap out of him if you were able to jump right in the film the sets are ugly and the cinematography is very poor i have seen a lot of bad film this year but this not only takes the cake but it is with out a doubt one the worse films ever made
<START> very reliable entertainment as las vegas amuses as well as intrigues very light hearted and very much bolstered by josh i like this television show and i think that many people watch it as a form of escapist voyeurism voyeurism in this case is very positive and many females in this series are very nice to look at this show incorporates las vegas legends such as wayne newton as intermittent characters to the las vegas genre there have been copious depictions of sin city this is one of the better efforts the producers and directors are lucky to have james caan in the show as he is very much a totally accomplished actor by and large i like the t v show las vegas and i watch it on fridays i watched it on mondays as well but with monday night football i could see why nbc switched it to fridays nonetheless i like las vegas a lot
<START> for those of you looking for the crazy stunts that typified a harold lloyd silent comedy this is not the film for you what the cat's paw gives us is an interesting and atypical character for lloyd who was trying to establish himself in sound br br for me the closest movie comparison to lloyd's character is that of peter sellers in being there for all the education that lloyd has received in dealing with the world he might as well have been brought up in isolation as sellers was br br but where he was brought up was as a missionary's child in china and i don't know how much christianity he and his family were able to teach the chinese but young harold has learned the wisdom of chinese philosopher lin po whom he quotes constantly like a fortune cookie as it turns out lin po turns out to be one wise dude br br anyway lloyd's father samuel s hinds has decided his son needs some education in the modern world of 20th century america and he sends him back to be the guest of the pastor of the home church which sponsors the mission the pastor there is the perennial candidate of the movement of that town of but no sooner does lloyd arrive and the pastor dies br br now the reform movement is a sham and the pastor a patsy of the political bosses who need a straw man opponent in every election they decide lloyd just might be a better patsy than the guy who just died br br of course as it goes in these type of films the patsy proves to be not so easy a proposition in fact lloyd constantly quoting from lin po the way charlie chan used to dispense wisdom proves quite the adversary for the crooks who run in addition lloyd gains the admiration of una merkel as cynical a dame as jean arthur was in mr deeds and mr smith br br the cat's paw is still a nice political satire though it did not establish harold lloyd as big a comedy name as he was in silent films a nice cast of players was selected by director sam taylor topped by george who plays a political boss who discovers lloyd and actually proves to have a streak of honesty in him
<START> this movie is very violent yet exciting with original dialog and cool characters it has one of the most moving stories and is very true to life the movie start off with action star leo fong as a down and out cop who is approaching the end of his career when he stumbles on to a big case that involves corruption black mail and murder this is where the killings start from start finish fong delivers in this must see action caper this movie also co stars richard roundtree br br i really enjoyed this film as a child but as i got older i realized that this film is pretty cheesy and not very good i would not recommend this film and the action is very very bad
<START> this is the last film of a trilogy by the brilliant turkish director bilge whose last film which was very was shown in prestigious film festivals differing from his previous films the story of is set on istanbul which is one of the most crowded cities of the world however in film we do see only minor traces of that huge crowd rather he choose to focus on two characters one photographer and one of his relatives who comes from his small village to find a job on transatlantic ships the photographer who we understand that has also to the city seems to be inhabited the customs of the city life not only in material sense in his relation to his relative we see him first as caring and tolerant however when he could not find a job our character starts to be disturbed for sharing his private 'space' with someone whose leaving date becomes ambiguous i will not reveal the tactics he develops in order to pull his relative out of his life to prevent any harm on your viewing pleasure but it is enough to say that shows us the tactics that we acquire within the routine of life to keep our own private space in order not to communicate with other people to prevent our relationships from gaining a complex nature since our own experience we believe that is complex enough br br film presents a clear picture of what a human being becomes within the borders of modern or postmodern city by depicting the two characters in different manners but he doesn't condemn any of the two characters for doing this rather he uses the power of cinematic language to underline this difference for example in search of new opportunities we always see the character coming from the village in open spaces even within the house he prefers balcony as his favourite space on the other hand we see the photographer always within the closed spaces and generally at his home although there are more than 10 million people out there and lots of adventures lots of interesting things to discover or are there any he prefers sitting at home watching tv etc his home is like his temple a kind of sacred place br br everyone living in a big city and conscious of the experience he is living through will find something belonging to himself in if you like this film i am sure that you will like other two films the clouds of may and the town go and find them
