<START> i've loved this movie since the first time i saw it lo these many years ago i'm not sure how many times i've seen it perhaps 10 perhaps 20 this last time i watched it i was struck by a detail that i hadn't noticed before br br toward the end of the picture the slain heroes are conveyed back to the town via sled there are a couple of closeups of the dead men the one that struck me most was a shot of the blond youth all you see on the screen is his profile from head to hands his hands are holding a flickering candle the wind is blowing and his thick blond hair is dancing in the wind in tune with the flicker of the candle flame the contrast between death and the life he has lost is incredibly powerful the moving hair and candle flame remind us of the life force that once inhabited his body br br every time i revisit this film i see something new
<START> the problem this film has is the same problem the tv series had and that s the laddish stan and jack there s nothing wrong with laddish characters but stan and jack are played by actors who seem to be in their late 40s early 50s and there s something objectionable not to mention defying as they cop off with girls young enough to be their daughters br br as for the rest of holiday on the buses i found it instantly forgettable it s basically a 30 minute episode spun out to 90 minutes with having all the action take place at a holiday camp instead of a bus station br br amazingly almost a third of voters on this site have given it a 10 come on guys this film doesn t deserve more than a 5
<START> it's amazing what you can do with little money dead silent being a low budget movie delivers its promises br br too bad we don't see rob lowe more often on the silver screen lowe is at its best in this riveting thriller no wonder he went from dead silent straight to the tv mega hit the west wing br br dead silent 8 out of 10 br br toronto
<START> this is a terrible movie don't waste your money on it don't even watch it for free that's all i have to say
<START> my wife and i enjoy bad science fiction movies some movies are so bad they are good mansquito was one of those that one was bad but it had some redeeming qualities it makes you wonder how a self respecting actor approaches lines like hey mansquito br br this one is so bad it has now taken its place as our standard for bad it isn't just a bad movie it really stinks there was the coed strike force the indian that rode around in a black cloak and used a sword for crying out loud he shot down a helicopter with an arrow br br we tried to laugh at this movie but there were no points at which it didn't rise above pitiful we couldn't come up with any redeeming features except for one those were the words the end br br there seemed to be no plot no character development and no point to the movie someone in hollywood needs to be fired
<START> and nothing wrong in that heartily endorse the comments of and snow leopard br br i'm thrilled to find this movie is available on us dvd i've only ever seen it through once i persuaded the goethe institute here in london to show it in their conrad veidt season some years ago and long to see it again br br barrymore is resplendent when engaged as in this movie possibly because of the prick of having a renowned german actor as a foil and veidt is such a wonderful scene stealer doesn't he pick his nose at one point this is one of the seminal films to connect 'dr with century' 'grand hotel' or and 'the cabinet of dr or 'the student of prague' with 'the spy in and 'casablanca' br br see it
<START> 1st watched 12 26 2008 dir eugene levy corny comedy murder mystery with very few laughs the movie appears to be based on an earlier italian movie according to the credits but was re written by two fairly popular american romantic comedy writers but this one by charles shyer nancy meyers does not cut it compared to their other efforts the story is about a couple of down and out traveling americans played by richard lewis and sean young who stumble upon a lost dog and hope to make a fortune in reward money after seeing an ad in the paper for the dachsund's return upon trying to return it they see a hand sticking out of a garage door at the lady's residence that they believe is attached to the rest of the dead body of the woman who is supposed to give them the money they freak out and instead of contacting the police and telling them the truth they make out like runaways from the scene expecting to be framed for the murder the other characters in the film are met on a train prior to this and hang around a monte carlo gambling resort doing various things to be pulled into the story the other cast members include character actors john candy james belushi cybill shepherd george hamilton and others after the police find out about the death they start questioning the main characters and of course they have to work thru their goofy lies to figure out what really happened none of the character actors mentioned earlier can bring this movie out of it's mediocre state despite some funny moments mostly provided by the belushi shepherd couple this isn't a horrible movie it just isn't that good there are plenty of average movies out there and this is just another one for the pile try it maybe you'll like it probably you won't
<START> burt reynold's and star's in this great cop film reynold's play's the of the title who is a tough cop whilst working in undercover a drug bust goes wrong and is to vice br br the machine of the title to the motley crew to bring down a crooked governor who is involved in high class prostitution cocaine and contract murder br br the motley crew is played by brian keith favorite bernie casey richard libertini as alway's quirky as an ace sounds man durning as the chief the beautiful english rose rachael ward play's a 1000 a night hooker whom and eventually for when staking out an apartment used by the governor br br italian actor vittorio gassman play's the high pimp who has a deadly gang of at his disposal and henry desilva play's his psychotic brother hit man who is highly strung on prescription and angel dust br br the action packed finale see's the remaining member's of the engaged in a deadly shootout with desilva which in one the most spectacular ever put to celluloid br br alas hollywood has ran out of idea's and is contemplating a remake of sharky's machine why bother a 25th anniversary special edition dvd would be ideal not a silly ass remake
<START> i bought this rental return for 1 99 at hollywood and overpaid i didn't expect much but thought it would be something to fall asleep by at least i quickly noted the very weak storyline the gross overacting by everyone no one talks like that except in cartoons and the seemingly let's make it up as we go along direction i know that the participants in this mess must be very embarrassed by it and i feel certain that it did not help any careers as for this movie buff of 35 years it has now provided a ready answer for the worst film you've ever seen question br br
<START> when i die someone will bury me and if they don't what's the difference who gives a damn huh thus the philosophy of life or lack there of is summed up once and for all in this less than classic but nevertheless fun spinoff of sergio leone's dollars trilogy br br in the opening scene three obviously evil gunmen ride into a western town and with menacing glares they intimidate all the pathetic normal people hiding in their homes the observant watcher will notice that each of these three bears a striking resemblance to characters from leone's for a few dollars more there is one guy in eastwood's poncho one in lee van cleef's black suit and one seeming to act like gian marie but this movie is not about these guys no sooner do they ride into town when they are gunned down by someone even cooler than they a mysterious bounty hunter known simply as the stranger br br no this is an altogether different story br br in an obvious copying of leone's the good the bad and the ugly three gunmen are again vying for a hidden treasure once again there is the bounty hunter and the mexican bandit the stranger george hilton is a bounty hunter with a penchant for shooting people while dressed up like a priest he is after the reward for the bandit gilbert roland but when gang steals three hundred thousand in gold coins the stranger gets sidetracked from his normal line of work br br to round off the trio there is edd byrne's corrupt bank executive clayton he too wants the money for himself but after the money is hidden away the only man who knows where it is gets shot now the only clue to the hiding place is a medallion that shows a family crest the game is too find the treasure before anyone else does and any gun can play br br with plenty of gunfights fist fights and double crosses the action takes these three to the ultimate showdown ripoff a three way draw for the hidden treasure ala the good the bad and the ugly but with a twist br br this movie is not as good as leone's films of course but in the end who gives a damn huh this movie is fun 60s nihilism spaghetti western style there are no rules no enduring loyalties and no right or wrong just the treasure and whatever it takes to get it and though the movie is not classic the ending surely is hey maybe we all can get along after all for a hundred thousand a piece br br if you like spaghetti westerns check this one out it is fast furious and worth the look
<START> although coming after three star wars krull countless others this movie would look outdated in the 1950s 1 sfx mostly consist of 1970s videogames effects such as bolts etc annoying after a short while you also get a sfx creature that looks like a poor man's version of some tier iv harryhausen monster br br 2 sets are mainly ruins in the countryside with papier mache temples and miniature cities or abodes that makes 1950s japanese monster movies look like flawless perfection br br 3 plot is paper extra thin hercules must find seven golden stolen by conspiring gods zombie tyrants br br 4 action mainly consists in retarded muscled up hercules check the variety of facial expressions wrestling cheap 1970s videogames effects br br 5 acting award goes to milly carlucci third carlucci show biz sister with anna gabriella which says all br br 6 sfx make other tier ii italian salad bowl movies such as star crash look like masterpieces br br well considering that main acting exploit consisted in impersonating a retarded green monster wearing a whig and green we ought to be lenient br br watch it forget about it
<START> the movie although not faithful to the original novels succeeds in creating modern gothic vampire vision somebody tried to insult calling it a 1 music video clip actually it is a complement the everpresent gothic music combined with the music video like shots made the movie so moody and queen of the damned is a mood driven story br br i do not understand the die hard fans who complain on the modifications of the story the plot has been modified to be less confusing for viewers who do not know the novels the number of characters had been lessened and i have no problems with changing maker or skipping character the biggest change the romance of lestat and jesse seemed a very nice addition to me br br actually i think that a faithful adaptation would be a complete failure the slow and gloomy mood that was perfect to century new and louis's angst wouldn't fit rebellion and his music and while the book can be slow descriptive and combining multiple elements yet conveying them well the movie simply cannot do it without turning chaotic vampire lestat and queen of the damned can be split into at least three movies the creators had to choose something br br some of the special effects like the flying or walking out of the flames were the only thing i actually didn't like in this movie but death was very nice the cast was good townsend was convincing as lestat especially on the concert but i preferred banderas as armand i loved jesse and marius though and of course aaliyah was perfect with her quasi ancient egyptian accent br br so if you are into gothic music and vampiric of loneliness and eternity and you don't consider books to be movie scenarios queen of the damned is one of the few movies which show vampires as something more than blood sucking monsters but please do not compare it to the interview movie it has a completely different style precisely as much different as different were louis and lestat personally i find it thrilling first to watch a vampire's existence from louis' bottled hunger point of view and then switching to one devoid of all morals but surprisingly outgoing for a vampire lestat br br i'd give queen 8 of 10 as it had some technical flaws but i decided to give it 9 as it's vastly underrated by people who hate it simply because it didn't match their vision of the books which can be clearly seen by looking at the votes breakdown
<START> i'm a fan of jeff bridges so i snapped this up on dvd without having seen it previously i instantly became a fan of kevin spacey also br br the general plot of alien in human body has in my experience been done to death but i liked the approach taken in k pax which struck me as quite different and much more sensitive than most bridges makes an excellent doctor you want to tell him what's on your mind and spacey's expressions and gestures are perfect in the role br br the interaction between and the entirely human characters in the clinic is delightful particularly the subtle manipulation of their behaviour br br the ending is bittersweet i like choice but the final scenes with bridges made me teary
<START> minor spoilers br br misunderstood classic remains one of henson's finest and most personal films it may seem funny to call a movie as beloved as this one ' but people do seem to remember this one mostly for jerry snappy screenplay and paul williams's knockout songs now while these things are admittedly great as is the movie's formal playfulness screenplay within the screenplay film break etc what distinguishes 'the muppet movie' from the other muppet films is the serious wistful thread that runs through the picture it's a road movie all right but like most road movies the pleasure is in the getting there and the achievement of the characters' goals is tempered by uncertainty and by the knowledge that they can never really go back again throughout the film we are shown the down side of show business even before the muppets have 'made it' piggy abandons kermit without a second thought at a phone call from her agent gonzo expresses the loneliness and regret of a performer's life on the road in his haunting 'i'm going to go back there someday ' and worst of all kermit is continually tortured and tested by doc hopper who wants him to commercialize his art for the of purposes one can only wonder what henson would have made of his family's management of the company after his death kermit himself agonizes over his choices in the desert conversation scene and the final 'magic number questions whether it's all been worth it before concluding that it probably doesn't matter either way all this is punctuated with the expected muppet chaos and satire and deliciously awful jokes and of course the serious stuff wouldn't work if it weren't but 'the muppet movie' isn't just another as the rest of the diminishing return muppet films would become no it's a lovely gentle metaphor about the relationship between art and entertainment and business and it's every bit as effective today as it was 25 years ago 9 5 out of 10
<START> i am not exactly how sure the accuracy is with this movie but i can tell you that i was thoroughly entertained by this movie the character of gust played perfectly by phillip seymour hoffman was one of the most unique yet entertaining characters in recent memory this movie informed yet managed to avoid preaching to the audience it made me laugh made me sad made me feel alive and glad to be spending the time to watch the movie it takes no time to understand what is going on and takes you on a roller coaster ride of genuine human emotion i thought i knew my history apparently i didn't know it at all i give this move 9 out of 10 and recommend it for all adults and young adults and the young at heart just not the young but as soon as they are allowed to see r rated movies make it a priority
