<START> this is one of the better feel good films of 1999 with kate capshaw leading an all star cast about a small town and a love letter first off the scenery is beautiful and anyone who sees this film and doesn't want to move to this location is crazy for the cast capshaw is stunning as the lead actress who captivates the emotional roller coaster role tom everett scott is charming as the author of the note throughout the film and the always delightful ellen degeneres is hilarious blythe danner and the actress who plays the bookstore saleswoman are both terrific too although it was unsuccessful the film is great as it is both short and sweet and well as very romantic 10 10
<START> the director infuses this film with false depth by repeating a gimmick throughout the film every single shot in this movie is 3 times longer than it needs to be you could easily cut out 1 5 hours of this agonizingly long 2 5 hour film without eliminating one word of dialogue one image one event or bit of movement br br this was one of the most gratuitous wastes of film i have ever seen other reviewers have called it pretentious which is an understatement is pseudo intellectual trash designed to be anti hollywood so that the cannes judges could assert their independence from the oscars br br the imdb reviewer states unlike hollywood movies which usually force the audience into overdrive this forces the audience to slow down and look at some of life's tiniest and most mundane features in great detail you would have to be catatonic to stare at some of these images this long and move as slowly at these characters this isn't real life unless you are heavily medicated br br finally i felt that portrayal was a sad rip off of peter sellers' masterful gardner he uses the same facial expressions and postures he even gardens in many respects there are parallels between these two movies the main difference being that being there moves along and doesn't rely on shock and gimmicks to create a meaningful experience while questioning various things we take for granted in life
<START> it's boring br br it's slow br br where are the nasty and brutal murders where is the tension that is supposed to scare us this is like watching sesame street without the funny characters of ernie and bert or grover br br it's really lame br br maybe it was the writing maybe the direction maybe the acting maybe the editing maybe the cinematography maybe the special effects maybe the makeup br br maybe all of the above brought this to something barely able to keep your eyes focused on br br i wanted to get scared not bored br br this didn't scare me it didn't even interest me i had more fun watching the time on the microwave instead of watching this film br br don't bother to buy it and if you see it on television by some freak chance there is no need to tuck the kids asleep
<START> the movie was better than what i expected i was working on the movie set for a short period of time when damien was making this film the gun fire stunt and acting came out pretty good on the editing tip all thou the the music wasn't all that great better music would have top this film some of the music sound like the hippie days damien remember you have gang violence gangster's some oldies or hip hop would have did it it was more realistic than blood in blood out the casting was picked real well did a good job in this film the movie brought back a fill of a life style i use to live but than at the end you do not always win and in my history thats how it was i adapted to the movie the first time i watched it damien on this film
<START> i have seen many japanese and i have to say that some of them are really interesting but they are all pretty much the same this one is no exception the ghost is a black haired girl that scares it's victims by doing nothing else than walk and look dead the difference is just the motive for the haunting the rest is the same as every time black haired girl strange things happening with some media photos creepy acting while watching this flick i constantly found myself asking why i was wasting my time watching stuff that someone else has done so much better before some scenes where quite nice though i'll give it 3 out of 10
<START> the cast for this production of rigoletto is excellent sings gilda magnificently and passionately luciano pavarotti also sings splendidly is a fine fedora is a famous older singer who sings the maid giovanna sings sings both rigoletto and as rigoletto is probably the most convincing acting singer in this hard to beat ensemble of great singers kathleen in the contessa all principals are well known and world renowned br br this is an exciting rigoletto visually as well as musically br br i have it on both laser disc and dvd you should have it too
<START> i was just watching a forensic files marathon on court tv the episode was identical to the plot of this movie right down to the incest secret and the affair with the sister subplot i don't recall any based on a true story disclaimer but the case does have mow written all over it apparently it chronicles the real homicide of ruby morris by her husband earl sentenced to 25 years to life for her murder just goes to show you truth can be stranger than fiction because i thought the lifetime plot was contrived and a more than a stretch insofar as believability goes i'm with the other posters who said the acting was bad i didn't notice it with all of the players though it was really the lead character the daughter whose performance was bad
<START> i was rather disappointed the first tetsuo made me an instant fan from the first 5 mins of the film it was fresh innovative and just different i rather enjoy having a movie be in your face and push all those make you squirm buttons tetsuo did just that where for me few movies can br br for those of us who enjoy getting a breath of fresh air those that appreciate those offbeat styles used that make indie films so worthwhile ii will likely be a if your looking for that visceral hyper kinetic feel of the first movie skip this one as thats all been stripped away tetsuo ii is for some odd reason just a typical hollywood style action flick i was rather confused however it's still worthwhile in my opinion for any die hard fan
<START> after seeing this movie i came to the realization that drew barrymore is a great actress this movie wouldn't have been watchable without drew the fact that somebody as attractive as drew could actually gross me out and she did when she was josie her attempts to transition as the cool girls called it were hilarious especially her trying to dance at the night club br br we also had snl favorite molly shannon playing a great part as anita best friend one of the funniest scenes in the movie was anita trying to teach the class sex ed this was one of mollys funniest performances and best br br leelee sobieski also had a great part and i really felt for her because i know people like her that got tortured like that br br this movie is a must see for drew barrymore fans because drew makes the movie
<START> i can remember reading that darwin had a pivotal experience in the galapagos islands seeing the vast range of animal life there and intern penned his theory of evolution not according to this movie it was inspired by the british countryside ok and as john cleese would say right i also did not think that darwin was a man suffering from deep personal conflict and someone who suffered dark reveries and flights of anguish according to this film he was it is sad that he apparently lost one of his daughters to illness but i don't think him losing a family member would have impacted on the mans scientific abilities very much well not according to you get the picture i think there is nothing worse than when science gets turned into fable and to an extent this film comes off as trying to debunk evolutionary theory by saying it came from a man who was emotionally unstable which to me is just plain gross i think charles darwin was the soul of scientific enquiry cool and calm and always thinking logically this film seeks to dramatize the undramatic and sensationalize clear headed scientific exploration it is like a tale i would not recommend it
<START> my wife is a mental health therapist and we watched it from beginning to end i am the typical man and can not stand chick flicks but this movie is unbelievable if you want to see what it is like for someone who is going through these type of struggles this is the movie for you as i watched it i found myself feeling sorry for him and others like him br br spoiler plus the fact that all the individuals in the movie including the people in the mental institution were the actual people in real life made it that more real br br a must see for someone in the mental health profession
<START> the whole movie made me think of the first circle of dante's inferno where the souls who themselves in believing that they are happy go to they never realize they are actually in an inferno but nothing is enjoyable they just move on without any emotion in that sense dante thought that they the were in the worse part as they would never actively try to change their situation nobody can die in that place but trying to certainly does hurt i am not sure if the writer based his story on this medieval manuscript or not but the resemblance is absolutely striking br br i didn't enjoy the movie when i was watching it as i was expecting a climax which never came nevertheless it made me think afterwards and now i actually think it's a good film it surely does stick
<START> what the heck is this about kelly jennifer seems to drop all moral behavior as soon as she arrives to the island she finds this juan p manuel existing and exotic though she witnessed when he slapped his ex in the face which he also justify later on in the movie right or wrong these two guys are the first to find each other on the island kelly are totally lost in every sense and the great juan p can fish and built a somewhat house mr handyman they seem to have a great time then billy zane jack characters husband shows up and of course two days without knowing what his wife has been doing whit this gorgeous juan p he is a little bit jealous billy z is the stereotype rich guy and maybe not the nicest man in the world he dislikes juan p for hitting his girlfriend at the pier who can blame him hes also is arrogant but he paid loads of money to rent that boat and juan p who is the waiter everything cant even fetch him a beer whit in 20 min wouldn't you be upset yet billy is probably the guy you want to punch in the face if you meet him but at the same time he is not to be blamed for suspicious about the scuba goggles manuel has kelly and billy just lost some dear friends how convenient he just happens to have them no matter what however for some strange reason kelly likes this girl hitting manuel and starts to hate billy for being jealous ok billy is overreacting thats for sure but kelly isn't doing much to convince him either she spends more time with juan p and even wants him to sleep with them since hes been so nice and even though manuel yelled at her and calling her things for asking him some intimate questions but kelly is so forgiving yeah right and then she starts to have sex with this juan p it should be said that kelly and billy seems to have a working relationship before this island incident at least they have intimate sex on the boat and talks like people do when they like each other now you can think that this scenario is possible but for real is it are you cheating your husband after two days on a coconut island just because hes jealous and acts like a drunk in the bar i wouldn't disagree if there relationship was really bad but the director doesn't give much hints if thats the case for christ sake juan p hasn't really shown himself being a good person catching some fish and built a wood house to get into someones panties is that showing a good side not trying to befriend husband in anyway which would be very simple by letting them be alone most of the island time simply be respect he doesn't care about their relationship and kelly cant figure that one out he just want to have sex with kelly character is just not trustworthy if she was stranded with billy and another attractive girl wouldn't she be upset or what or maybe she is billy zane plays a not very nice person and juan p isn't actually much better if you really think about it and poor kelly is so confused and believes having sex with juan p will solve everything because her husband is so strange and so aggressive towards poor juan p so for all of you who reads this what do you think about it if you where the kelly character would you consider cheating on your husband knowing one day you'll be back in real life and all of a sudden billys maybe not that horrible person after all hes just too jealous and if you where billys character what do you say is he totally wrong in his behavior and juan p character what do you guys really think of him one thing is for sure exist ps the voodoo thing is so totally wrong here what the heck was that about seriously anyone tell me
<START> i sat last night to see this film being played in greek television because of the upcoming olympic games hosted by my city knowing that it is an american film i had already expected it to focus more on the american athletes story and i was really ready for it but what i saw was too much i mean when a movie has such a title first olympics athens 1896 even being of american origin you would not expect it to be so propagandizing and on the same time ignorant towards other countries' athletes and efforts the american athletes seem to have all the gifts of nature strength smartness generosity kindness politeness in contrast to their sin athletes in the games who seem being unable even to speak their thoughts or express feelings the number of times the american anthem is played during the film must be an all time record in filmography megalomania at it's best it even uses fictionalized facts which ridicules the greek nation such as greek citizens serving the foreign marathon athletes with wine in order to help the domestic ones win the race so much for the olympic spirit br br think of it being a greek and putting a bad mark to a movie whose title is also greek is something that doesn't make me happy at all but according to what i have seen i cannot give it more than 4 out of 10 being pretty generous actually
