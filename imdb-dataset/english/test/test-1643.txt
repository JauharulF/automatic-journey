<START> i was surfing through imdb one day when i stumbled across the curious adventures of mr noticing how obscure it was i decided to set off looking for it thanks to it didn't take me long so i bought it for a dollar and when i got home i watched it although i must say i was quite impressed br br three of the paintings in a king's apartment a shepherdess a chimney sweep and a self portrait of the king who is just as selfish and sadistic as the actual king himself come to life one night while the king is sleeping the shepherdess and the chimney sweep escape while the painting of the king calls the police in order to capture the couple fortunately for the couple mr comes in to help them often mocking the police and the king br br the back of the dvd case describes this film as a surreal visual delight and an underrated entry in the history of classic animation i couldn't agree more with it considering that much of the backgrounds look rather bizarre and many of the characters are weird which include the depressed citizens of an underground city and hungry lions that are calmed by the music of a blind man who kind of looks like andy warhol not to mention mr himself is somewhat eccentric the film is very creative and mostly fun to watch and its only flaw is that it can be slow moving but overall this film was very good and it comes recommended by yours truly br br grade b awesome
<START> spoiler alert br br you can listen to wong kar wai's movies like a radio play invisible vibrations between the characters the rooms where they stay in the rhythm that presses them ahead attraction and dislike the whole spectrum of the atmosphere is played back by the sound track the dialogue is mostly completely unimportant br br the narration is similar to a childish amorous look at a beautiful woman and a sad man whose sorrows are noticeable but helpless in the mood for love is told from a child perspective but the child never appears as a narrator the aesthetic of the film is developed by an extreme light and color dramaturgy harsh cuts an unattached almost documentary camera and a complex unobtrusive sound br br the genius use of nat king cole's perhaps perhaps perhaps whose mysterious power grows the more often it is repeated and the melancholic waltz helps in the graceful choreography of the two protagonists maggie cheung in her beautiful dresses is brilliant the perfect vis Ã  vis to the handsome stylish tony leung the audience assumes a romance between them but wong just sees sad resignation the two potential lovers are revolving around each other like satellites knowing that they never will share the same orbit you wish that they will find each other they won't and the emotional power of their non love sex relationship makes the movie immensely fascinating br br it is about broken luck and unspoken love in all of wong's films these are the love whether it comes too early or it comes too late to take the one and not the other person the yearning of the characters that is never satisfied their loneliness the mourning and the luck that they experience when it is too late
<START> if you watch this at home on dvd or bluray be sure you have great sound system the musical score through this is what moves you through the movie i have watched the movie several times and thought it was great but after just up grading my home theater sound system what a difference i will be watching this movie many many more times br br if you do not have a great sound system find a friend who does and watch it there br br also watch the extra stories and behind the scenes extras that come with it the br or dvd the interview of in the 1960's talks about his scholarship fund but for those times just boys got it today i hope some of it goes to girls
<START> clearly andreas would like to wear jess franco's crown whilst at least cinematically the old wife lina plays a corrupt salacious masturbating prison warden in this modern ambitious w i p film with some exceptions many of franco's films are ineptly produced and directed in a slipshod hurried manner shots don't always cut together and the sound mixes can be horrific while watching angel of death 2 aka prison island massacre i asked myself if is deliberately trying to replicate franco's patent shoddiness or is he just naturally shoddy like his mentor is this movie deliberately bad which would be self defeating or is it simply bad by neglect after a hitchhiker is forced to give a gunpoint blowjob her rapist fills her mouth then fills her vagina with some drugs minutes later she is hauled into a prison for reasons not explained and subjected to the leers and rough handling of staff and other inmates as this is a wip film there are lesbian scenes galore and plenty of violent behavior the gore is bloody and sadistic too with delights such as teeth pulling and courtesy of olaf ittenbach the acting is pretty awful and the fight scenes are lame but there is a love of sleaze in every frame and an understanding of what trash fans enjoy unfortunately the flat script makes for a flat movie so despite numerous atrocities hardcore sex and a guest appearance from jess franco the experience is an empty one but isn't that what most jess franco movies are
<START> about the spoiler warning it's not may contain it does contain spoilers readers beware br br okay first i need it to be known that i'm not bashing the actors they're just working with what they're given the problem was the script it was horrendous there was nothing believable about it at all sure when you have a movie based on a murderous hitchhiker there's going to be the bad mistake here and there that puts you in the terribly horrific movie worthy situation but these girls just made stupid decision after stupid decision the only girl smart enough to ever try and call the police was the girl added towards the end because he'd already killed one and hit another with a car speaking of hitting her with a car why the hell did she try and outrun a truck rather than run to the side like a normal person also does the one who wrote the script honest to god believe cops are not going to investigate a door covered in blood frankly it wasn't suspenseful either the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were well this rant has gone on way longer than i meant to for such a bad movie so i won't bother to touch on the end besides the fact it's unrealistic and lame
<START> why remake the original assault to my mind assault was carpenter's true masterpiece it had all the elements good carpenter movies contain external threat on a small group of individuals people taking the challenge because they are forced to do so isolation just remember the guns in carpenter's original made no sound being thus a lot more threatening than conventional devices and now this remake concentrating on main character i s psychology and on his relation to main character ii the evil but honorable the anonymous threat in the carpenter movie replaced by a rather conventional conspiracy corruption background the just didn't understand the main plot of the original and thus produced something pretty ordinary
<START> an assassination thriller in the mould of day of the in the line of fire has the added twist that eastwood's old timer bodyguard frank is troubled by past failure on the job the chase becomes personal as john reptilian assassin leary taunts him over this neurosis with the rather clunky exception of the love of a good woman russo's lilly raines nothing's going to set frank's mind at rest than taking leary down personally br br malkovich is a volatile presence not simply combustible on screen but often a changeable actor too this is one of his good films focused and playing director petersen's game eastwood is too old but a the audience don't care cos it's him and b his age is written into the script not only in the narrative but also as a recurring joke pretty much as you'd expect but well handled 7 10
<START> i was very excited when paranormal state first came on a e i thought that it may bring some more interesting ghostly evidence the production value looked good and i really love the logo then after about few episodes in i started to feel that this show may not be looking for evidence but had a strong religious agenda br br it seems like every case they investigate has some big powerful evil demon that can't even make a teacup move on camera yet everyone is terrified then comes some power of christ ritual that saves everyone br br also there is very little focus on other members of the team the entire show focuses on ryan and he feels like one of those people that hands you pamphlets about his church on the street br br has paranormal phenomenon and demons become the new missionaries of christianity scaring people to convert really this should be on a christian network i was very disappointed
<START> this is by far the worst movie i have ever seen its been a few years since i saw it and nothing has come close since then and i doubt that there ever will be a movie produced that is as bad as this it tries to make fun of a variety of different movies for example and instead of funny its just pathetic whatever you do don't rent or by this garbage and if someone throws it at you turn around and run the other way
<START> nurse betty is really an interesting movie i guess we all know someone who is so convinced that the characters in a soap opera are real that you can't explain them with any means that these are just actors and not real persons br br 'nurse betty' isn't a nurse at all in real life she is an ordinary housewife who works at a diner to escape from her awful husband and the problems in her miserable life she has become a very dedicated fan of a soap opera after she witnessed her husband being murdered she goes into some kind of a shock and she loses all grip on reality she thinks she's in love with one of the characters from the soap opera a doctor and decides that she'll visit him and start a family with him the hit men however think that she knows too much and go after her to kill her br br as i already said the subject is quite recognizable if you leave the professional hit men and the murder out of it and the movie was funny the story was well directed and the actors did a fine job it had everything i always want to see when watching a comedy i give it a 7 5 10
<START> this is a typically fast moving entertaining movie of the early 1930s when you have james cagney in the lead these pre code films are even better just fun stuff to watch usually when films are dated it's a negative but not so with films from 1930 1934 yeah with the slang and the attitudes dress hairstyles etc they are dated but that's a big part of the fun these films have an edge to them that almost always are fun to view br br they also have a corniness which is appealing and fascinating you see people like the juvenile delinquents pictured in this film and their goofy parents that you just don't see in any period but this one early '30s early on this movie the kids go before the judge and you sit and just laugh at these crazy characters that appear in court on behalf of their kids one after the other yes we get the stereotypical emotional italian father the jewish dad the anglo saxon mom and a few other moms who all in dramatic form plead theirs is a good boy even though things are predictable in some cases you don't mind because everyone in here is so much fun to watch br br this also teaches you that kids were punks 75 years ago too stealing robbing mugging lying hey that's the human condition this movie debunks the theory that people were nicer back in the old days no people have always been rotten or good the degree was aided by their environment parents financial situation and other things here we get a bunch of dead end kids who wind up in reform school br br the ridiculous and stupidly liberal storyline has kids acting immediately like angels once they run the show at the reform school not punished in the slightest for causing a man to fall to his death and setting the institution on fire the explanation he was a meanie and deserved it so much for real justice and reform and patsy shooting a guy bit never having to even be questioned by police because he's the good guy notice the subtle anti religious dig in which the only guy seen praying is the evil warden that's no coincidence no accident that sort of negative association things has been going on ever since the hays code was canned in the late '60s and was seen as you see hear in the pre code early '30s br br dudley digges by the way is outstanding in his bad guy role of mr thomson i especially his voice was very effective and could picture him playing one of those similarly evil roles as an institution boss in a charles dickens film adaptation cagney played his normal role the take no guff tough guy who gets the pretty girl dorothy griffith played by madge blake frankie darro also was effective as the leader of the boys jimmy smith just the looks on face alone made his character believable some thing he was the real star of the film but i'll still go with cagney the rest of the reform school kids weren't too believable and they were really ethnic stereotypes but they were all fun to watch br br i thought the most interesting part of the film was the first 20 minutes when we saw how bad these kids were and witnessed the good and bad and stereotypical parents in the court after the kids were arrested those scenes are pure 1930s dead end kids stuff they always showed the kids to be bad news at the beginning of the film but by the time the story was over they all looked acting more like wally and beaver cleaver hardly rough delinquents it's very far fetched but it works entertainment wise br br overall a hokey but very entertaining movie typical of cagney films and those of the early '30s almost all of them rate at least eight stars for their entertainment value
<START> five characters in search of an exit clearly has to be one of the more clever and better twilight zone episodes ever made because of it's abstract ideas and thoughtful plan where the characters have to search to discover identity and it ends as a surprise you have a military major a female dancer bag pipe player a clown and hobo who all awake together in the bottom of a wall and none know how they got there and they don't know who they are so the episode starts out with very interesting drama and suspense from the very beginning making it so soul searching for the viewers interest to want to know the characters true identity and backgrounds plus the episode even adds more intrigue for the fact it places different types of characters with different views and lifestyles all with one goal in common to escape and find identity and peace that's very compelling for the viewer only in the end i don't want to spoil for those who haven't seen a surprise fall happens proving that many times you might want to stay where you are away in your little sheltered world and be away from the masses of other people's world as you will see the characters are loved in a different way by people in a much different form really great and cleverly done a real shock twist surprise that makes the viewer see the unexpected and cruel fate that happens sometimes when you search and seek
<START> was excited at the opening to hear part of de but wanted more so i bought said hans zimmer piece possibly the most inspiring and beautiful 4 minutes of music ever written this movie is an exciting thriller masterpiece even w o the religious considerations you get to tour the vatican and parts of rome with excellent cinematography the opening at where the god particle or largest quantity of antimatter is created with stunning visuals is an immediate clue which foretells the excellence of this movie who doesn't love hanks the storyline and twists in this film are just superb and well drawn out until the amazingly twisted climax this film suggests a satisfying compromise between science and religion though plenty of closed heads will persist on both sides science without religion is lame religion without science is blind a einstein
<START> said the continuity announcer as tactical assault was about to be broadcast after seeing the first two minutes i started thinking rutger might want to get a new agent after seeing the next ten minutes i started thinking rutger might want to retire thereby saving a potential audience from any more of his performances br br yup this is a truly terrible movie i wasn't expecting much and why should i if the name hauer appeared in the credits but within seconds of the opening title credits that featured nato with ussr markings bombing bosnia i realised i was going to be force fed inedible turkey three months after christmas br br the attention to detail is non existent nato planes carry ussr markings then were told character spent six years in an iraqi prison which would make the setting 1997 what nato were bombing the serbs in 1997 i guess the producers didn't think the audience would have noticed this ridiculous inaccuracy but i know i did the producers also probably hoped the audience wouldn't notice the lack of continuity such as dogfights with iraqi jets that suddenly turned from migs to f 4 phantoms then back again but i did even stranger characters would take off in f 16s then when they arrive back at base there jet has changed into a soviet built br br oh and if you're expecting a dumb action movie you're only half right because it's dumb but most of the plot centres around a basic instinct revenge plot i'll give the producers some credit maybe credit is too strong a word because after seeing plots featuring from hell policemen from hell flat mates from hell we now have a fighter pilot from hell which means every single occupation of the 20th century has featured in a from hell type plot with perhaps being the worst movie of the lot
<START> for those viewers who thought the 1979 film alien the first to depict a male earthling being impregnated by a malevolent extraterrestrial night of the blood beast made 21 years earlier may come as something of a surprise in this film america's first man in space back on earth and after examination is thought to be dead he later comes to again only with a half dozen or so alien growing in his abdomen the mama alien also pops up to terrify the small band of scientists who are observing our hero and she seems to have the body of a bear and the head of the rock creature from a 1969 star trek episode anyway with its short 62 minute running time small group of scientists and cheap looking monster this film suggests nothing less than a grade z warm up for the outer limits which would premiere four years later but without the fine writing that that show usually boasted despite the lurid title this film is decidedly sci fi not horror and offers no scares no laffs little suspense and little food for thought afterwards it looks as if it cost around 100 to make but probably cost twice as much and its musical score often seems to have no relation to the happenings i won't use the word action on screen by the film's end many questions remain just how was our hero to give birth to these critters why does the alien need to decapitate people to learn our language to justify that title no doubt why can't the space traveling aliens land on our planet rather than needing to hitch rides on our ships how was our hero impregnated to begin with these are all matters that this little cheapie can't be bothered with it really is for 1950s sci fi completists only
