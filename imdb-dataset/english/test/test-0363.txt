<START> that welles said was that he's been in decline his whole career br br there was an interesting story here unfortunately welles seemed completely incapable of telling it instead he was trying to tell a bunch of different stories about about clifford irving about his pompous view of critics and experts oh yeah and trying to jump start his current girlfriend's career by giving her unneeded screen time oja honey when they told you to sleep with the director they didn't mean one washed up like a whale on a beach br br welles was probably trying to cash in with a bunch of footage of clifford irving as irving was becoming a household name with his role in the faked auto biography of howard hughes unfortunately it means the subject of his film didn't get the time he deserved and he was probably the more interesting story br br the great tragedy of orson welles was that he peaked early and then spent the rest of his career sputtering finally doing wine commercials and awful documentaries
<START> accepted is one of the best teenage comedies i have seen in a long time it has an original script talented cast and it delivers an hour and a half of pure unadulterated fun br br it tells the story of a high school graduate bartleby b gains justin long who is not accepted in any of the he applied to so to avoid his parents' disappointment he creates a fictional collage in the attempt to fool his parents completely he creates a fake website and turns an old psychiatric hospital into a school everything goes smoothly until a lot of other accepted students turn up on his doorstep now he and his friend have to figure that collage thing out not only for themselves but for the others too br br justin long as a lead man is absolutely brilliant his character is as natural as he can be and the supporting acts are outstanding jonah hill as sherman schrader columbus short as hands maria thayer as rory adam as glen and lewis black as uncle ben br br the humour is fresh and simple and most importantly funny right from the start to after the credits the plot develops so easy that by the time you stop laughing at the last joke you start giggling at next other along with all the fun the movie brings a very common subject to our attention i e the collage education if usually the students in the movie are united against the school government in this case they are united by the mutual desire to go to school and learn br br yet the movie doesn't brand all other schools as wrong it just shows that there is another way you what they say if there is a will there is a way and may be sometimes the children know better what they need than their parents br br this movie is an unmissable little story about the great opportunities in life wrapped up in the best format possible
<START> first i'm a huge buddy holly fan i grew up knowing who he was and i knew all about that fateful plane ride that extinguished three incredibly bright flames just like that but i had never truly listened to his music i had heard much of it yes but not until i sat down with the intention of getting something out of it did i truly come to see the real buddy holly and let me tell you that my world is a different one now because of him br br because of this adoration for such an incredible man i bought the buddy holly story without ever seeing it previously i'm torn on my views of this film perhaps it's because buddy feels so alive to me that i just couldn't bear seeing gary busey in this role i'll admit that he did a nice job acting but his singing sounded so forced it seemed to me as if he knew he didn't sound a bit like buddy himself and therefore was using far too much energy to make an attempt at a similar sound in some parts of the film he succeeded but others ouch br br the movie spanned a period of several years but i feel that portraying this time span could have been handled much better i had a difficult time distinguishing at what point in buddy's life certain events were happening i also had a serious problem with some of the historical inaccuracies i think the worst one was the portrayal of the crickets i understand how their real names couldn't be used and how for simplification there were only two of them in the movie and maybe this was a good thing because the film's background vocals were cringe worthy and i disliked the way they were portrayed as a hindrance to buddy's career something else that really made no difference to the film but irked me was gary busey's teeth they wore me out buddy holly had much better teeth i don't know why i noticed it but i did br br i'll end this review on what i felt was the best part of the movie buddy's last performance his final phone call to maria the big performance bringing him and richie to the stage followed by the still frame ending it startled even me and i feel that it effectively shows the audience how at one moment buddy holly was so alive and energetic and that his flame was snuffed out in the blink of an eye it was a beautiful way to portray this horrible tragedy i think br br good movie despite the obvious problems 7 10 br br some obvious flaws could use some work but not bad
<START> i've read every adventure of asterix and at least 5 times and i'm also a fan of les and les robins des bois and so i expected a lot from this movie and i finally got satisfied unlike the first adaptation of asterix on the big screen et contre cÃ©sar which wasn't a real success besides the appearance of laetitia this one really captures the spirit of the comic and we get the beautiful monica bellucci in the first movie the director tried to be too realistic about the time where the story is set and it killed the whole spirit that made asterix hilarious in this one all the clothing the way of talking and everything is identical to and work more it really stick to the original story with the downside that we know pretty much everything that's going to happen but alain chabat gave us a few surprises at the end i really enjoyed that movie and everytime that the first sign of boringness starts to appear comes in and makes us laugh like crazy this movie is a big mix of all the kind of humor i really like and even if maybe it's mixing it too much i can't help but to like it so if you like asterix and the humor of all these young talents that started in part a french mix of the tonight show and snl go see this movie
<START> i could never imagine i would start loving movies like this after seeing yimou zhang's 'hero' i decided to check his other movies perhaps looking for something similar the second yimou zhang's movie i watched was 'no one less' after which i realized what kind of cinema i'm now in no wonder why i got 'keep immediately it is a simple touching and brilliant piece of cinema i pay my respect to the director br br this movie shows that it's not the amount of money makes film good it's all about what the director wants to show and how successful he is in doing this the story is very simple a typical extract of a typical daily life moreover shown in a very simple way the movements of camera also strengthen the impression and the feeling of the movie i give a top rating to this film and impatiently waiting to see other yimou zhang's films
<START> who else other than troma can take the classic tragedy and change it around to todays standards no one in my opinion the leonardo dicaprio one sucked juliet is a definite stretch from the original tragedy but it holds up well its sick demented twisted but yet insanely funny and fulfilling for the most part it follows the true romeo and juliet story but many troma elements are added will keenan gives a great performance as tromeo the acting is solid and the story is great many people look past these movies not only the kaufman troma movies but all the ones they distribute sure troma movies are an acquired taste but you need to see some of these it is renegade filmmaking at it's best
<START> i saw this at the london film festival last night apparently the shorter version james summary of the content of the film is very good very deftly blends his investigation of the wine business into wider concerns about globalisation the effect of the mass media the power of capital and the need for diversity br br the film is shot on hand held dv which some might find offputting but which does enable to catch people off guard on a number of occasions which probably would not have been possible using more conventional equipment br br despite the sprawling feel of the film the editing is very sharp not only giving us a parade of the world's dogs but also undercutting a number of comments with somewhat contradictory visual images and giving others sufficient rope to hang themselves to a degree this evoked michael moore's recent work although operates in a more subtle way but probably the roots of the film go back to marcel ophuls' the sorrow and the pity both in the way the film is constructed and in the emergence of of the earth' french peasants as the stars de pere et fils were present at the screening and answered questions afterwards we do indeed all need a little disorder bravo hubert br br overall an excellent film with implications that go way beyond the world of wine into the way we construct ourselves as people and organise our world
<START> i was so looking forward to seeing this film that i can't really understand how i got the impression i would enjoy it i'm afraid it really is a yawn fest every single patron in the cinema i attended yawned and fidgeted frequently during the whole film this is a shame because it is a fantastic story i'm inclined to think that it would make a better read it is not helped by the principle character only showing his teeth once and that was as a result of the camera angle as the story unfolds it becomes easier to understand the main character's dilemmas however the suspense and drama that could have made this a really top rated film have been completely spoilt by the dull treatment dull as a half baked documentary
<START> franco films can be divided into 4 categories the often black and white and inventive the late 1960s early 1970s often involving miranda the of various periods but using full frontal female nudity as plot drive and the rest br br this is part of the rest it is not really a cannibal movie at all it is certainly no gorefest the few women in the picture dont even lose their loin cloths and there is little full frontal stuff at all the picture quality on the german dvd i watched is poor the film peters out insofar as it ever catches fire as a franco fan i would tell others not to bother do something else with your time read a book get a copy of women in 9 anything really
<START> as a reviewer has already commented this made for tv comedy is up there amongst the best football parodies ever but having failed to video it when it was first aired i now find that it isn't around in any format ok so this has only polled 17 votes to date but a 9 average does seem to suggest something special basically i suppose it's a case of tough luck if you missed it 'cos it's no longer available to view
<START> the most impressive thing about cinema' is its title an anagram which is very nearly also a unfortunately it only works in american english since in britain is spelt differently br br i've always found the dilettante man ray and his artistic efforts to be deeply pretentious and i've never understood why his work attracts so much attention apart from his which he invented by accident and which are merely direct contact photo prints his one real contribution to culture seems to be that he was the first photographer to depict female nudity in a manner that was accepted as art rather than as porn but surely this had to happen eventually and there's no real reason why ray deserves the credit the critical reaction to man ray reminds me of the story about the emperor's new clothes br br back in the early 1960s the second season of 'the twilight zone' opened each episode with a shot of revolving concentric circles in black and white there's an image in cinema' which is so similar i wonder if 'twilight zone' borrowed it from this film the main difference is that the revolving image here is a black and white spiral indeed if ever there was any movie that deserves to be described as a spiral this one is it throughout cinema' we're treated to shots of a revolving disc containing words in french moving in a spiral the effect is vertiginous and the texts about incest and eskimos are nearly dada in their meaninglessness i did laugh at one clever sexual pun br br the emperor is naked folks and this movie just barely rates 2 points out of 10 au
<START> i've seen this movie a few times and with each viewing i still feel the excitement of embarking on a journey and the frustration of trying to overcome the barriers that impede the path it's more than a mere desire of finding home it's about the very basic human spirit of finding one's way in the world of overcoming despair of facing the character foibles that deter our goals underlying these human endeavors is the challenge to reconsider the origin of life while this film is imbued with serious ideas it has just enough comedic lines to leave the viewers hopeful it is surprisingly funny the execution of the story line is excellent this is all packaged with visually engaging animation a must see br br
<START> now more than ever we need peace love in this world br br this film really showcases the wonderful music of the broadway show and the fabulous choreography of the legendary i saw it again after many years and it still holds up well br br thank you mgm ua for putting this on dvd i love the option of seeing in widescreen mgm rocks for doing this on many of their dvd releases br br ya gotta love treat williams as berger and john savage as claude they couldn't have picked better actors actresses for this film beverly d'angelo is such a 'hot in this film i had forgotten just how hot wow br br the supporting cast is absolutely great br br with the late great nell carter making a singing cameo in a couple of scenes as well as the kooky charlotte ray mrs garrett on of life' br br the story gets a little weak toward the end but the anti war sentiment of the late 60's still holds up and is relevant today br br it's beautifully filmed quite a bit on location and is so colorful and lovely and really brings the spirit of 1968 back on the big screen br br i saw this movie when it was released in 1979 when i was 15 and was moved by it then and it still moves me now at 40 some other reviews on here say they think it should have been made sooner i don't think hollywood was ready to make such a movie back in the late 60's early 70's br br the vietnam war ended in 1975 and the whole thing hit a little too close to home i think for this story to be filmed before it was like in 1969 70 71 br br bravo to director milos foreman i love this film br br it's nice to see it again this time on dvd it never looked better
<START> it's the 1920s and a man named walt disney was on a mission to satisfy the families and children all over the world with one thing entertainment what did he do he made cartoons whoo and he made a character that is as great as a mouse mickey mouse ha ha oh boy br br two films were drawn out by mr disney himself plane crazy and steamboat willie this review will focus on the 1928 feature steamboat willie br br ever since i learned about this movie as a little boy i've always wanted to see this movie well in 1997 i rented an ancient vhs that had lots of old disney cartoons on them starring the mouse mickey mouse and guess what that short was on there and i loved it shortly after i took the tape back this was playing on the old disney channel note the old disney channel early one saturday morning br br yes this is a great cartoon this paved the way for more great disney stuff from 1928 to 2002 br br 10 stars indeed
<START> flesh feast starts at miami airport ace reporter dan carter harry kerwin he is also credited as production designer phones his mate ed casey phil philbin to let him know that he has just returned from south america where he has been investigating carl doug foster that he was onto a big story but while still talking on the phone he is stabbed in the back killed meets dr elaine frederick veronica lake she also executive produced who has recently been released from a mental institution together they discuss their grisly plans the news of death has reached casey he decides to take the story up himself do some investigating well actually he gets his secretary day to do most of the investigating just report back to him lazy bugger virginia informs casey that they have someone on the inside named kristine heather hughes since dr frederick rents her spare rooms out to nurses kristine reports back to casey about dr grotesque youth restoration experiments involving human flesh specially cultivated maggots br br co written co produced directed by brad f flesh feast is a pretty poor film on all accounts first lets start with the script by thomas casey who was also responsible for the cinematography you get the feeling that most of the cast crew had more than one job basically it's terrible the character's are one dimensional idiots have no personality i didn't like anyone in this film for what it's worth i quite like some of the ideas here the flesh eating maggots the basement laboratory stealing bodies from a hospital that unforgettable 'twist' ending that's almost worth sitting through the rest of the film for on it's own unfortunately the dialogue is so badly written stiff unnatural sounding it's untrue i mean there is one scene in which a nurse says that they won't let us out of the house which is fine except for the fact that she is speaking outside in the garden to someone no thought has been put into the story as no explanation is ever given for why flesh eating maggots are able to restore youth in fact at one point near the end when questioned about this very thing dr frederick claims there is no time to explain at that point which to me sounds like the people who wrote this didn't have a clue either even at an extremely short 68 minutes long flesh feast is very slow dull the poor editing doesn't help with scenes shots lasting for far too long for example there is a scene in which an ambulance pulls up outside a hospital drives up to the doors the guy gets out he walks to the back doors opens them etc etc did we really need to see every single detail there is also another sequence in which dr frederick enters room puts some gloves on then she takes them off walks into the opposite room puts another pair on i personally think that probably didn't shoot enough material so he stretches every scene out as much as he can to make the run time up i do like that bizarre ending though i really do technically flesh feast is complete crap i'm not sure what the budget was on this but it must have been small very small just about the entire film takes place in one house dr laboratory consists of a table some plastic test tubes some ancient looking electronic medical equipment a strange screen with funny colours on it don't ask the cinematography is poor the music sucks the entire film looks dubbed badly dubbed too the exploitation elements are also disappointing there are a few maggot shots but they don't actually do anything other than a bit there is a brief scene where a dead body has it's leg off a ok looking dismembered corpse limbs hanging on hooks the acting is awful from everyone concerned i mean really bad which makes the rubbishy dialogue even worse do yourself a favour avoid flesh feast yes there are one or two unintentionally funny moments that ending is well unique to say the least but for the most part this is real amateur film making that quickly becomes painful to watch i doubt most people will make it through this is one sitting i can tolerate just about anything but even i considered switching it off definitely one to avoid you'll be pleased you did if you really have to see it don't say you weren't warned
