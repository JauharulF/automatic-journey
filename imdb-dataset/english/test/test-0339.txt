<START> stodgy drama starring pat o'brien as a washed up reporter who turns up at his ex boss's house to ask for money to fund his son's operation only to find him dead on the floor since o'brien knows the identity of the culprit he offers to take the rap in return for the money he needs a decent premise is wasted on a film that pretends it has surprises twists and turns even though it really doesn't performances are rotten across the board the movie dresses itself up as a hard boiled american noir but the mix of dodgy accents doesn't work and the story is hardly gripping and it contains possibly the least attractive screen kiss of all time
<START> finally i can connect the dots between return of the jedi and phantom menace we see here where lucas lost touch with what made the original star wars films great and began to descend into the plot less tripe that ruined episodes 1 3 this film is more like one of those cheesy low budget 80s swords and sorcerer films than anything worthy of being associated with the star wars saga as with the jar jar character this seems targeted at children and the toy market the battle scenes are particularly bad it was depressing to see phillips' incredible talent go to such a waste after her classic performance in i claudius
<START> i remember this movie getting a lot of flak from reviewers when it was new letterman and leno themselves had objections letterman called it paraphrasing the biggest waste of film he'd ever seen and leno objected to the simpleton portrayal of himself but letterman had john michael higgins as a guest on his show so it seems he didn't take anything too personally a dvd re release with opinions and such from those involved could be interesting though i suspect the days when late night talkshow wars captivated the nation are gone and not returning soon br br i preferred the letterman impersonation to the leno but could never buy in to either they never rose above caricature and i never simply accepted them as actors for comparison paul sorvino as kissinger in oliver stone's nixon comes to mind as an impersonation which may have seemed laughable in the first few moments but which seemed at least plausible after the first moments of amusement wore off br br the highlight of the show for me was treat williams as michael williams' speech to letterman was not as great as but reminiscent of alec baldwin's entrance and quick exit as blake in glen ross br br they could have done more with johnny's role in all this i know he was mostly uninvolved in the events portrayed in this movie and most audiences will be familiar with his reputation such that johnny carson needs no introduction but more context about why dave and jay and all comedians revere johnny would have given this flick the substance it lacks in being a gossip film br br guess i should read the book br br rich little imitating johnny carson unfortunately came across as nothing more than rich little imitating johnny carson br br i tell you what after watching this movie then watching either the letterman or leno show all i want to do is crack open my johnny carson dvds and see the real thing
<START> my local pbs station philadelphia recently showed the elegant universe after three hours of watching it besides having my brain hurt i learned all about wormholes quantum mechanics and parallel realities and alternate universes br br the last hour of the show was about string theory physics a semi new branch of physics which makes many of the the ideas of science fiction not only possible but probable with the string theory it sounds like wormholes alternate realities and alternate timelines are possible and it could just be a matter of time until we get the knowledge to use them br br although it may not have given new information to someone familiar with the topic i found the show very interesting and informative it was very understandable to anyone who is just being introduced to this subject
<START> wow in my opinion the net is an excellent nail biting edge of your seat techno thriller that will leave you feeling good all over when i first saw it i was feeling good all over for days when angela sandra bullock went to mexico i thought to myself that is a really nice place to vacation from the moment jack northam and ruth wendy gazelle began chasing her i thought to myself don't let anything bad happen to her please i also took quite a few deep breaths to prevent myself from screaming any more than i already had on the bright side if you ask me the house was very luxurious and spacious in conclusion i give this excellent nail biting edge of your seat techno thriller four stars
<START> i've never been a huge fan of almodovar but generally i've always found something to enjoy in his films unfortunately i had more trouble finding something to enjoy in broken embraces then i would normally think i would br br i find the biggest failure in broken embraces to be the characters and the lack of depth they display the film is essentially a love story one that is tragic and one that wants to involve the viewer in their stories i found this problematic from the beginning br br in the opening scene our 'hero' the director screenwriter mateo is having sex with a very attractive young woman whom he just met his agent comes in as the woman bashfully leaves br br in the opening scene our 'hero' the director screenwriter mateo is having sex with a very attractive young woman whom he just met his agent comes in and rolls her eyes as the woman bashfully leaves mateo babbles something about needing to enjoy life as the only thing he has left having been blinded in a tragic car accident that also killed his 'true' love lena played by penelope cruz the viewer might buy into to this notion except the rest of the film really never illustrates why lena was the love of his life or any depth to his character or any other br br cruz plays lena the mistress to an industrialist named ernesto martel from the outset their union is rather a pathetic one as martel clutches jealousy to lena and lena avoids uncertainty of being on her own by staying with the much older martel to skip ahead martel finances a film for mateo so he can keep tabs on the star of the film lena naturally without any back story lena and mateo fall in love and in almodovar's world it really is that simple mateo in the opening scene has sex with a sexy young woman now mateo falls in love with lena later it's revealed he had a son with his agent after their love affair her son responds to this information with a laugh and an oh well again no depth no understanding for any of these characters it all just happens from the beginning of the film to the end i got no depth of emotion from mateo he is flat and doesn't act much different from one scene to the next br br the one scene i did enjoy was when film producer martel is watching video footage his son recorded under the guise of doing a documentary of mateo there are nice a moment of martel watching obsessively as a lip reading confirms his worst fears later lena confronts martel as he's watching the footage and speaks her part out loud matching the video footage of her lips as she talks some quite brilliant moments rather contrived but still really fascinating br br unfortunately for me the rest of the film left me rather bored i couldn't care about these characters or their situations so no amount of cleverness on almodovar's part can make up for this lack of depth i think if you're a fan of his work you'll enjoy this movie but if you're like me in between then you'll find it lacking
<START> this movie just arrived to mexico and since i read very good reviews here about it i decided to go watch it with my friends and girlfriend but i was greatly disappointed i don't understand how people can rate it 10 10 i mean screenplay and directing were beautiful but a great overall movie need a good story which this flick lacked altogether br br i've enjoyed several dramatic asian and european films but they had a good story watch this movie at your own risk unless you are eastern european or orthodox i don't think you will like it br br half the people on the theater left including my 4 friends who waited outside since they were really bored so was i but i always wait till the end of the movie br br regarding the movie it was extremely slow paced with a lot of time wasting scenes the full length of the story could have been shown in no more than 40 minutes but they made it longer by having scenes of the monk getting coal that is like 15 minutes of the whole movie plus panoramic views and so on until they made it a full length movie a really boring one br br i recommend you listen to me if you still watch it come back and rate this comment as useful after wards to help people avoid this waste of money
<START> words can hardly describe what blue planet brought to life in all of its hours of runtime matching up with walking with dinosaurs this documentary stands as one of the best we can only pray that the bbc and discovery channel come up with even more outstanding ideas that could possibly even level with this one
<START> this movie was a poor movie the plot was poor and the comedy they tried to deliver came out poorly the accidents seem contrived and predictable i thought the actors tried to some extent but with this movie it was so lame it can only go so far one of the worst films i have seen and don't recommend it to anyone the only accident to mr accident was it's release
<START> if western union isn't exactly the real story of the construction of the telegraph it certainly does capture the spirit and dedication of the people involved with the project br br dean jagger is the man in charge and one fine day he's thrown from a horse and sustains some fractured ribs an outlaw on the run randolph scott finds jagger and is ready to steal his horse but changes his mind and brings jagger to help later on he's hired by western union and works for jagger br br jagger also hires a young played by robert young who's an engineer young is doing one of his few loan out films away from mgm for 20th century fox both young and scott become friends but rivals for jagger's sister virginia gilmore br br western union has plenty of action enough to satisfy any western fans the telegraph crew has to deal with outlaws indians and your garden variety labor troubles br br slim summerville as the timid cook and victor killian as the frontier character assigned to guard him have some of the funniest scenes they both provide some good comic relief br br fritz lang got good performances from his cast and kept the film moving briskly along western union is solid western entertainment
<START> this is an excellent film no it's not mel gibson in braveheart but then it's not trying to be actually the emperor and the assassin probably has thankfully more in common with a shakespearean production than a hollywood blockbuster br br in the third century bc the king of is attempting to unite in other words conquer the seven kingdoms of china he has already overthrown the kingdom of han now he needs an excuse to invade the kingdom of yan br br this is where the lady zhao comes in she and the king have been friends since childhood they are obviously very much in love but cannot marry for political reasons together they devise a plot she will pretend to have fallen into with the king and escape to yan once there she will convince the prince of yan to send an assassin back to kill the king when the assassination fails the king will have his excuse to invade yan br br once in yan however lady zhao begins to reconsider hearing and seeing more and more examples of her old childhood friend's ruthlessness she begins to wonder if the king may need to be assassinated for real br br one sure sign that you're not watching a hollywood production is the final encounter between the king and the assassin unlike a hollywood movie where the hero and villain are clearly defined and the final outcome already predetermined this is a fight that could truly go either way br br this is a well crafted and well acted story of a tumultuous time in chinese history there is a mixture of both incredible beauty and incredible ugliness most beautiful of all however is gong li as the lady zhao i grow more and more convinced every time i see her that gong li is the most beautiful woman in the world br br i must say however that she does have one unintentionally funny line in this film early on gong li asks one of her servants do i have a beautiful face br br duh
<START> this zany film rivals the ghost and mr chicken as one of don knott's finest film performances knotts is an accountant for a podunk city hall that is good for the citizens they fire the three competent and keep the dumb one knotts of course is the dumb one when his garbage collecting cohort accidentally empties the wrong trash can knotts finds himself wrapped up in a bizarre trap set by the city council for him funny moments in the movie include the bowling alley restroom scene and the cemetery scene is absolutely hilarious typical knotts the nervous act is well used and as usual he is surrounded by lots of crazy character actors from the sixties such actors as frank welker and pitt herbert add to the mayhem as one may expect armed with a big car a pretty girl and no real clue of what he's doing fun for anyone especially nostalgia buffs but just about anyone will love it
<START> eighteen 2004 tells the story of pip anders a depressed and extremely cynical young man who is estranged from his dysfunctional upper middle class family and living on the streets of vancouver on his 18th birthday he receives a cassette tape and player from his recently deceased grandfather relating his memoirs of his own 18th birthday spent serving with the british army in france trying to help a mortally wounded comrade avoid capture by the occupying germans as pip listens to the tape ian mckellen provided the voice of his grandfather we see the scenes he is describing as flashbacks alternating with daily scenes of life as well as more recent flashbacks filling in the dark secret why pip left home and finds it impossible to trust anyone who is nice to him br br an ambitious second film from writer director richard bell two brothers with a polished look excellent photography well developed non stereotypical characters with gay and straight treated equally and commendable efforts in emotionally and physically demanding roles from some talented new actors especially paul anthony as pip and brendan fletcher as his grandfather at 18 there is also a noteworthy turn by alan cummings as a priest who tried to help pip and a small supporting role played by thea gill queer as folk the complex story in the director's own words in his dvd commentary is meant to drive a vortex of emotion pushing pip to his breaking point and it certainly accomplishes that my only criticisms are that the overall effect is too schmaltzy or artificial for an audience to truly identify with much of the supporting dialog and the ending too contrived and predictable and the direction needed to be sharper to curtail sloppy overacting in some scenes i do recommend it 7 stars out of 10 including extra points for a noteworthy effort
<START> the movie takes place during the year 1940 and the french are about to loose the war br br the movie includes all genres comedy romantic murder and history it is probable the historical part may be not as probable as the rest br br it is not however a big laugh movie but the occasional large smile
<START> as a semi film buff i had heard of this infamous movie a long time ago i had heard that it was basically a 15 million dollar film about the tyrannical rule of the roman emperor caligula complete with hard core pornography what struck me was that it was a porno movie yet it had great thespians like peter o'toole john malcolm mcdowell and mirren in it a week ago i saw a documentary about caligula on the history channel and this film came back into my head and finally my curiousity got the best of me i foolishly rented the dvd and even more foolishly watched it br br within the first 30 minutes i was seeing acts of sex and especially violence that would earn an nc 17 even by todays standards was it really necessary to have a scene of a man having his urinary track closed and then have gallons of wine poured into him and then have his stomach cut with a sword all in very graphic detail and a scene where a guy gets his d cut off and fed to dogs again in very graphic detail and this just scratches the surface the argument for this movie from those who like it seems that it is the only film that honestly portrays pagan rome and it's excesses when in fact what this movie really is is sheer exploitation from beginning to end you see nothing but endless torture and decapitations and every kind of violence and crude behavior imaginable sadomasochism rape it just never stopped there is no insight into caligula himself what might have propelled him to go mad the horrible childhood he had that molded him into a sadist as an adult this is not a historic film it is sleaze even the porn in this movie stinks and through much of this when i wasn't gagging i was just incredibly bored by the time it was over i was depressed didn't feel much like eating and this movie does the impossible it actually can turn you off of sex br br what were these great actors thinking when they got into this i did read that the porn segments were filmed after the principal shooting was completed which explains why none of the main actors are in any of these scenes and why the quality of these scenes is so poor but still and all these actors must have known what they were getting into right at the opening credits it says penthouse magazine and bob presents and the scenes that the famous actors actually take part in are completely repulsive in and of themselves apparently director brass wanted his name removed from the completed film entirely as did the screenwriter gore vidal of all people even john and peter o'toole were begging people not to see this when it opened at the cannes film festival br br for the amount of money the producers spent on this the movie's quality is terrible everything is underlit and murky as if the film was dropped in a swamp prior to being developed and that's when you're lucky enough to view a scene that's actually in focus the sound is poorly dubbed much of the music is awkward and the editing is god awful br br anyway i brought this movie on myself my advice don't watch this don't watch this don't watch this as for myself tomorrow night i am going to watch something lighter like dawn of the dead
