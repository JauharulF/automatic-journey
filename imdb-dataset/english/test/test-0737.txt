<START> i haven't been a fan of madonna for quite sometime now however i thought i would comment on this film br br this film mistaken one of them as well as madonna was panned by the critics they were highly mistaken and many potential viewers were turned off by the bad reviews br br first madonna does an excellent job in this movie which was one of her first she plays a ditsy blonde in the film she is far from a ditsy blonde in real life most critics were somewhat prejudiced by her singing fame and didn't give her a fair shake when you view this film i hope that you understand that the accent and the goofiness is just acting she was absolutely hysterical as was the film br br griffen dunne is another person who was not given a fair review in the film if you take a look at his filmography you will see he is quite an accomplished actor br br as far as the movie itself this is something similar to pretty woman but came 3 years before the roberts gere success it's a goof ball comedy with lots of site gags slapstick and one liners some of the comedy is deadpan and takes a comedy aficionado to really appreciate the more subtle humor br br i know this doesn't tell you much about the movie however i hope this helps dispel any belief that this is a poor movie it is absolutely worth renting for an enjoyable night of great fun br br peace br br gary
<START> this is one of my favorite movies ever along with casablanca and cannibal holocaust this is near perfect cinema rex allen narrates this wonderful tale of a cougar who just needs a little loving contains action adventure suspense comedy and chaos see this movie if you have to kill to do it you will not find a better cat picture anywhere with cat from outer space coming in as a not so close second charlie's performance is magnificent even includes animal cruelty and intense logging gotta love disney for all moral failures
<START> at the end it is clear that the murderers planted the murder weapon in mrs columbo's car and it was at the police lab br br but where did the gun under the hood used in the demonstration come from wouldn't the murderers have cleared out the stuff under the hood they had a whole week or did columbo's cops replicate the camera gun under the hood used in the demonstration how did they do that without breaking and entering the car perhaps this is why the murders seemed surprised at the end but how could columbo have replicated their camera gun device and gotten it calibrated to their key fob columbo must have gotten the gun back from and had it re planted under the hood of the car and been very lucky that the rest of the device with camera was still there and transmitting br br this was a 10 10 show until this glaring plot error at the end
<START> it is surprising that a production like this gets made these days especially for television considering the strong sexual themes and explicit lovemaking scenes not to mention lesbianism this has been given superb treatment and direction br br the sets and costumes are flawless the direction is stylish and the characters are likeable there is a fair amount of humor but it has surprisingly dark interludes the protagonist is really a tragic figure but not devoid of happiness also this production avoids the mistake most films shows make when dealing with homosexuality lesbianism the characters are very human it seems that to allow people to be comfortable with watching gays and lesbians on tv and movies most shows fill it full of cliches and make the characters obsessed with being gay not so with this in tipping the velvet the protagonist is hardly aware of what being lesbian means br br the bbc have made some wonderful productions in the past and this adventurous period piece only confirms their standard of excellence on all fronts
<START> this is about some vampires who can run around out in the sunlight that are causing some problems down in south america casper van dien is sent in with his team of commandos to investigate the movie opens with van dien co walking through the jungle and there's this huge black guy who just absolutely positively cannot act he speaks all his lines as if he's reading them off the cue cards for the very first time his voice is also so low that well it's positively hilarious great way to get the movie started anyhow they run into some of our vampires shoot them this causes them to appear to die for about 20 seconds and then of course they come back to life van dien notices that one of them was impaled across a tree limb and yells to his buddies to kill them with wood the stunt work must be seen to be believed the vampires are on wires that pull them up trees which is supposed to make them look like they can climb really easily but it just makes them look like they're bouncing around on cords or something br br yeah anyhow later on the huge black dude is down in south america with some guys van dien not included and they're attacked by more vampires it's really too bad these guys never heard of a crossbow because it would seem to be the perfect weapon to kill the little bloodsuckers with but instead they use big old wooden stakes that they try to impale the vampires with by hand the big black dude ends up getting captured and he eventually becomes some big powerful vampire leader van dien ends up battling him later on it doesn't help that all through the movie everyone forgets that if you shoot a vampire they are knocked out for 20 seconds or so which would enable a person to stick a stake in them fairly easily they just try to stick stakes in them in the middle of hand to hand combat yeah not exactly brilliant tactics br br there's a hot babe remember veronica from the lost world tv show yes it's her who also happens to be walking around in the middle of vampire county on some sort of research mission and she also just happens to be van ex wife hey what are the odds it's a shame she's not in the movie a whole lot more than she is will her and casper get back together in the end will van dien defeat the huge black dude who can't act will the circus performer vampires make you laugh through all the numerous action scenes will we hear the three stooges music when somebody does something funny has even lynda carter forgotten how to act in her small cameo she's more convincing in her sleep number bed commercials these questions and more will will be answered if you make it all the way to the end of the movie br br i don't know it might score some points on the so bad it's good scale but that's about it eh it's a bunch of goofs running around in the jungle i guess it's kind of entertaining
<START> iv been a fan of and ever since i can remember weather its young ones or bottom and i just have to say i have never laughed so much in all my life guest house paradiso is bloody brilliant i know its not going to be everyones cup of tea with the vomiting slapstick comedy violence and foul language but then just don't watch it if it ain't yours its not like no one knows what sick and twisted things and come up with when they're working with one another i think its unfair that this film received such a from critics because and i don't think i'm the only one to think this this film is 10 out of 10
<START> i appeared as an extra and was on location as a journalist covering the curse my involvement was during the segments of this film shot in jim pa jim was also one of the locations of the 1969 film the molly maguires i reported the 'action' in the free press newspaper where i was editor 1978 80 the paper ceased publication int he 1990s i recall the excellent attention to detail of the period costumes automobiles etc the modern streets of jim were covered with gravel to mimic a 1920s rural town of the south at the time i interviewed the producer and spoke briefly with the director during a set change break i did not get to interview james coburn which was always a great disappointment to me as an aside i appear briefly in one of the street scenes wearing a snap brim hat and a tweed jacket the producer asked me to jump in and it was a real thrill i still have a collection of black and white stills i took of the production work for the newspaper someday they may be of interest to film television historians lou
<START> i don't understand the humor in this film i also found it offensive on how koreans were depicted in that film despite how it is actually just a caricature of koreans in those areas first the actors are japanese and they make the most rude expressions of koreans in that film it disgusts me on how these people are expressed i felt anger just watching that one scene and how they were so badly made out in the film the humor lasts just for one laugh and then you don't understand why it's even funny it's crude humor with the most disgusting representation of society there i found it to be an offensive film overall maybe it was just because i never lived in the hood or saw any hood movies but i don't intend to either
<START> like most everyone who views this movie i did it for the stars michael madsen and dennis hopper the two are extremely underrated and sadly because of that have to headline a lot of crap in this film hopper plays a guy who accidentally kills a blackmailer and is offered help from the mysterious madsen br br the film actually isn't as terrible as it could have been i've seen both in much worse both independently and working together lapd horrible film the direction was pretty poor and the script needed a few re writes but both give the best performance possible with the material offered also the ending is pretty strong so you can tell the story had potential but when a glowing review of a film is it could have been much worse it doesn't say much for the film itself br br all in all this is one that can easily be skipped if neither of these actors draw you in but if you're a fan of either or both give it a watch they both give strong performances that outshine the obvious flaws of the film trust me there are much worse options out there
<START> in the mood for love a teasing allegory of loneliness and longing here is a film without sex or even kissing and it is no doubt one of the sexiest and definetly the most thought provoking and psychological romance i have ever seen br br telling the story of two people who coincidentally live in the same apartment and are a door away from each other the film like and unlike random hearts is about how two people come together via the affair of their two lovers only once they receive this news they take the time to think about the consequences of an affair and each other's feelings towards having just broken up and whether or not the two people are willing enough to fall back in love br br what's terrific about the film is the way director wong kar wai presents each character's way of dealing with loneliness with maggie cheung's character he'll show her in a repeated montage leaving work going home watching her neighbors gamble head to the noodle shop leave the noodle shop and bump into her attractive age equal played by tony leung this is a clever if not subtle and knowing technique to present loneliness for it is when you are alone when you find yourself falling into a loop this movie worked for me because i can identify with that feeling
<START> robert cummings laraine day and jean muir star in and one was beautiful a 1940 film also starring billie burke at one hour and 15 minutes this looks to have been a b movie cummings is a playboy ridley crane whom many women desire including two sisters katherine and helen day and muir katherine is the more earthbound of the two who likes to fix cars and helen is the blonde social butterfly with the beautiful gowns ridley arrives back in town and believing he's not going to be at a party helen decides not to attend since the party is given by a family friend their mother burke sends katherine in a pinned up dress ridley is there and the two connect but ridley is into more superficiality and when he sees helen at a dinner party the two pick up where they left off and go to a club he becomes terribly drunk and helen at first refuses to ride in his car because he won't let her drive after walking awhile and breaking the heel of her shoe she gets into car when he drives by he passes out and she takes over the wheel accidentally hitting and killing a br br ridley can't remember anything so helen lets him take the blame for the death the heel of a woman's shoe is found in the car and katherine sees her sister bury her shoes plus something in helen's manner makes her realize that helen isn't telling the truth ridley is convicted and goes to prison and helen marries a man she doesn't love and leaves for south america br br this is a wonderful film even though at the time this wasn't an a list cast cummings is playing a part that robert taylor would have played it's an mgm film he's handsome and very amiable even if he doesn't have the dazzling looks of someone like taylor laraine day is a favorite actress of mine someone mgm loaned out constantly because they didn't know what to do with her why i wonder a wonderful actress with a great face and voice she livened up many a film this one is no different her katherine is determined sympathetic and totally lovely jean muir is a lousy actress br br so who was the beautiful one we all know even if mgm didn't br br highly recommended little gem
<START> surprisingly enjoyable movie br br a group of thieves lead by mark wahlberg rob a gold safe in italy and thankfully for them the heist is successful and they get away with it without any big problems before the group can celebrate however steve played by ed norton decides he want the gold all for himself and pulls a ta on the group and shoots one of the members he and his accomplices leave thinking that the group is dead but luckily the group is not dead a year later we get back into the story where the group has tracked down norton and decide to steal the gold back and spend the rest of the movie coming up with plans to steal back their gold and settle a score br br this was a surprise for me it had all the makings to be a typical forgettable summer movie but it was actually memorable and really fun to watch what i like is how smart and well thought out the plans in the movie are and how the movie feels realistic watching the trailer would make you think it was some mindless action movie but in fact there are only two action scenes in the movie and they are all really well done the latter action scene is a very long 20 min scene that has one of the best car chases ever done i like how real the chase is and how everything is done old school style without the aid of cgi me personally i enjoyed this car chase more than the cgi filled chase in matrix 2 i remember watching music videos by director f gary gray and always noticed how well made they were and thought he'd make a great filmmaker turns out i was right as always and he proves it here can't wait to see what he does with the sequel br br the actors do a decent job too with seth green being my favorite of the group the other thing i loved was the excellent score by john powell ever since i heard his score for robots this year i've been a fan of him and paying close attention to his music and the man is really good he does a great job of avoiding all the typical summer action movie musical clichÃ©'s and provides a very well done score i haven't seen the original that this is based on so i can't really say how well it stacks up to that one br br so yeah this is a great popcorn movie that actually has a brain unlike most of the summer movie crap that comes out has great characters is funny as hell and has a amazing score by john powell if you love heist movies then you'll love this one br br you know if i was in the group they'd call me handsome mike

<START> where do i start the box should have been enough to keep me away from this attempt but i'd been taught early on not to judge a book or movie by its cover so i ignored the disgusting graphic quality of the box and rented it anyway but common sense should tell you that if they can't do a single still image properly then how dismal will the moving ones be later yeah they were pretty awful br br the actors in this flick appeared totally unaware they were being filmed as just any expression seemed to do fine regardless of the situation the characters were in or what they were reacting to br br however a good story can offset the downfalls of low budget productions good dialog can carry a poorly funded attempt at times unfortunately this was not one of those times as the story was as weak and nonexistent as the other required elements of good cinema br br there simply aren't words for how bad this was br br perhaps you can get the idea from my rating of 2 3 10 from br br the fiend
<START> i gave 9 of 10 points i was sitting in tears nearly the whole movie because i had to laugh br br the story of course wasn't excellent but it also wasn't boring stefan are assigned to become bodyguards for the beautiful nina while doing this job they come between the front lines of and cia of course the two are neither born bodyguards nor gentlemen so they run from one disaster into another and they do this in such a funny way that when you watch some scenes you won't be able to stop the tears as actors those two dumbly grinning characters do quite well better than some so called professional br br you think the speech of the two heroes is curios or pseudo foreign well if you hear quite a lot turkish german people in munich speaking exactly like them you will remember stefan and maybe in 10 years it might have become the common speech of the youth god forbid br br so if you like to laugh watch this movie
