<START> okay now this movie is a piece of work it's full of stupid jesus and that would render most human to question whether or not they should be movies at all big names like roddy piper and david carradine draw you in but take it from me this movie sucks the story is incomprehensible and lacking completley in intellegence the sets and costumes come of as a cross five and a bondage flick i'm sure theres porn with better
<START> this was a very funny fast paced movie i watched it more than once and am keeping my rental around to show others i'd just like to take this opportunity to ask anyone in the know how do hk producers choose their subtitle translators i'm most curious please direct me br br again to return to review it is a really rollicking film with plenty of content subtleties reminiscent of the classics though full of slapstick reminiscent say of the mexican comedies of cantinflas br br the film does not disappoint fans of the director who have noticed that he chooses distinctly chinese themes trying to get to characteristics rarely explored the director's entire collection is way of getting a look inside the culture in a disarming way br br and i don't see how his funny girl in chinese feast could be topped
<START> like many others i counted on the appearance of dennis hopper to make this not a complete waste of time i was sadly mistaken everything negative said about this flic is more than true what takes the cake however is the horrible horrible storyline for the main character br br here's why the planet might be destroyed the only way to recover from it for the entire human race to be saved trough it is to get as many smart capable nice competent people into an underground hide out and dennis hopper is the lone seer scientist with vision who was prepared for the worst and who has realized this but what's the main motivation of stevens sonny d'angelo he's angry because dennis has decided who is to be saved or to be doomed while it clearly explained to stevens that dennis' character has done everything to warn people of the danger but that he was laughed at the hopper character was the boy with the finger in the dike and now stevens is blaming him for and and if that isn't enough he wants to stop everybody from entering this hideout because it isn't fair and he's responsible for the death of the one guy who is humanity's saviour oh my god how stupid can you get br br what's also maddening that imdb forces one to write minimal ten lines about this piece of crap i mean two million in budget what could have been done with that think clerks blair witch and lotsa other movies who have been made for under 100 000 dollars and were still better i count myself lucky that i didn't pay one penny to see this crap and to sit through the end of this utter crap is one the most heroic things i've done this year it's no wonder that the writers of this pile of dung had jobs as camera operator and title designer before
<START> i knew it was going to be awful but not this awful as it's one of the most boring movies i have ever seen not a damn thing happens all the characters are dull and the story is stupid and incredibly boring plus the ending is especially lame the only reason i rented this piece of crap because i am a big fan of michael dudikoff however he is wasted here and looks extremely bored and shows no emotion what so ever plus i cheered out loud when the movie was over it's like the movie had no plot and it was all about nothing and ice t is god awful even though he is ok in some stuff plus dudikoff and yvette nipar had no chemistry together at all there's one scene that the director tried to make emotional but he fails miserably as yvette nipar didn't really show all that much emotion however there is a decent car chase scene but that's not enough for me to recommend this god awful film plus the dialog is atrocious avoid this movie like the plague not a damn thing happens please avoid and trust me on this one you may thank me afterwords the direction is horrible fred olen ray does a horrible job here with shoddy camera work laughably cheap looking set pieces terrible angles laughable use of stock footage and keeping the film at an incredibly dull pace the acting is terrible michael dudikoff is nowhere near his usual amazing self he looks extremely bored and shows no emotion what so ever his character is also extremely dull as i can't believe he signed on for this piece of garbage he also had no chemistry with yvette nipar dudikoff still rules ice t has barely anything to do and also looks bored and he didn't convince me one bit is not very good here he had somewhat of a wimpy character i didn't like him yvette nipar is pretty but was really terrible here she didn't show much emotion and had no chemistry with dudikoff and as a result i didn't give a damn about her character art owen marsh kathy katharine marsh and the rest of the cast are bad as well overall please avoid like the plague fred olen ray and steve should be ashamed of themselves bomb out of 5
<START> i can only agree with many observers that is one of the most memorable dramas ever made for television i saw when it was on tv and i have just watched it again i am particularly moved by the haunting original music of tim and especially by the dolorous strains of chamber symphony in c minor the music over the credits and in parts of the film the music intensifies the desperation of the characters as they pursue their sad fate the music is powerfully emotional this arrangement combines two of the movements from the symphony but i recommend listening to the symphony per se
<START> i have just seen this broadcast on channel 4 having seen some of the earlier comments here i think i would like to state firstly that i am not in favour of the death penalty with that out of the way i was expecting great things of this film but it just didn't quite deliver dead man walking is very cleanly done with good performances all round and a good script in fact it's hard to fault it artistically however i felt that although it attempted to confront the issues surrounding capital punishment it seemed to become sidetracked by the religious moral stance hardly surprising given that the main character is a nun although i'm not a heartless individual i didn't really empathise with any of the characters in the story if you don't take religion seriously then you probably won't see much in this film i think that peter medak's let him have it was a much more powerful and moving film and i would strongly recommend anyone considering watching this to go and see that
<START> bounty killer george hilton smooth mexican bandit gilbert roland who's great and bank representative edd byrnes each try to outwit one another while searching for a large amount of gold from one of train robberies that was hidden by a treacherous member of his gang br br though not the greatest that the genre has to offer it's still breezy enough with a lot of light hearted action filled fun and a satisfying finale br br any gun can play is mainly remembered for it's opening gag where george hilton easily guns down three outlaws resembling clint eastwood lee van cleef and django br br the next year hilton and roland were reunited alongside van heflin and klaus kinski in the highly recommended the ruthless four
<START> i was fairly lost throughout most of this film and i am the one who usually understands the works of such enigmatic cinema greats as david lynch twin peaks fire walk with me and darren aronofsky pi not to say that northfork doesn't make sense on some level it just doesn't combine to form a wholly coherent film as time passes from watching the film its themes and intentions become clearer but during my initial viewing i was really confounded and i find that this is the major fault of the film its lack of direction the plot centers on the town of northfork montana in the year 1955 the town has been emptied and will soon be flooded to make way for the creation of a hydro electric dam the major problem is that not all of its inhabitants are willing to be evacuated and relocated a group of men are hired to coerce the remaining residents out of the town before it will be drowned and for the most part they succeed amidst some fairly odd situations and townspeople simultaneously the film tells the story of irwin a very sick young boy or is he a fallen angel whose adopted parents gave him back due to his illness to the northfork orphanage that they adopted him from father harlan nick nolte cares for the dying irwin but irwin imagines or does he that a group of angels including daryl hannah and anthony edwards have arrived in the desolate and empty town looking for a fallen angel irwin has scars on his back and on his head and he tries to convince the angels that his scars are where the humans amputated his wings and halo oh yeah and during all of this there is a strangely surreal walking animal on stilts that roams throughout the backdrop of the landscape there are a lot of other small events that happen in the film but none of them end up amounting to much more than momentary intrigue one can appreciate the artistic quality of the film it's obvious that the filmmakers cared deeply about this film and its rich cinematography but the film still tries too hard to be different and then gives up and whimpers to an end without making much of a statement like i wrote earlier it becomes clearer long after viewing what has possibly taken place in the film irwin is dying and so is northfork and in coping with his own loss and death irwin has most likely created characters from ideas he gets from the objects that surround him at the orphanage to console him as he is abandoned and his life nears its end but then again maybe he really is an angel and he has found his kind and can now return home i must emphasize that there are some truly beautiful moments in the film heartbreaking vivid and full of loneliness and sadness unfortunately the film as a whole just ends up feeling disconnected and somehow incomplete
<START> easily one of my three or four favorite films definitely one for the desert island there is nothing about this film rather it glows warm and welcoming the audience is invited to a party and like any good party the joy comes in the interaction of the guests and what you learn as you progress from one to the next with apologies to joyce the film's title conjures up a number of ideas that keep audiences away the film is not horrifying it is not depressing it is a beautiful look into a time that has past within which people are growing up and others are winding down some are frustrated and others are serene and all around ever present throughout the evening are the people and the parts of people that have been laid to rest the words these exquisite actors are given to speak are perfection and set to the music of the irish brogue are an auditory feast particularly to us flat toned americans about the lack of brilliance i referred to above i take it back there is no other word to describe the final scene between anjelica huston and donal mccann it speaks quiet volumes about Â well everything some lovely snowy evening rent this film and just let it happen before you no gunfights no car chases no dinosaurs Â just film at its most sublime
<START> of course all this nonsense begs the question 'does a genre as self referential as the teen comedy really need another parody movie ' the woeful 'scary movie' i and ii took the formula about as far as it could go 'not another teen movie' really doesn't have anything either intelligent or shockingly excessive to add br br the plot essentially based on 'she's all that' walks a shaky line between parody and homage 'john hughes high school' everything from 'american beauty' to blues' is mined for references the result is ultimately an unfulfilling viewer experience the downside of giving us a carbon copy plot of 'she's all that' is that we all know where its going anyway and if we didn't then the jokes would be meaningless br br there's extremely little to recommend here the token gross out scene an erupting toilet seems badly out of place here amongst all the 'feel good' references there are moments of humour the song is funny enough and the odd good line is send the audiences way it stinks don't watch it
<START> barney is about imagination what you guys do not have if my never wanted to play pretend like they do in that show then i would be worried what 2 or 3 year old actually gets all that anyways its all about the colors and the singing for those of you saying that all they do on barney is eat junk food and recommend sesame street better well what about cookie monster thats all he eats but i haven't seen anyone comment that one i do agree that sesame is a better educational show but barney is just like a show for fun don't be too serious if you didn't like your child watching tv and worried about them understanding things you don't believe then you shouldn't be propping them down in front of the tv in the first place because all of that is fake everything is fake actors are fake so why don't you take your fake brains and put it to use and think if you have a problem with a fake television show for kids then turn it off and play with them yourselves and teach them what you want them to learn not big bird or bert ernie or barney someone who used to watch all those shows and turned out fine
<START> this movie was recommended to me by several people and after reading all the positive comments from this site i went ahead and bought a copy of the film off ebay the acting in the film is average and a bit hammy especially by the family of cannibals one sequence comes to mind when jupiter is ranting and raving to the burnt corpse speaking right into the camera its one of those performances where you just cringe and feel bad for that poor actor its also evidence of some of the worst editing i've seen theres a terrible jump cut right in the middle of his speech there are a few creepy moments though and at times the music works well but overall the film isnt that great and i dont know why people think wes craven is that great of a director thus far he hasn't showed me anything that i believe to be brilliant the only thing that improved with cravens films production to was his budget
<START> an interesting look at the immigrant experience told as a fable with some very weird imagery br br i got drawn to this movie because it tells of immigrants from sicily who traveled to america i imagine much the same as my grandfather did at that time travelling in steerage to provide ballast for the ships i cannot imagine it was very comfortable as shown in this film br br laws restricting immigrants existed i would guess that these laws were more strict on those who came from the mediterranean and africa immigrants had to be free from contagious diseases or hereditary in the film we see physical and mental exams the latter because of the view that low intelligence is single women could not enter the country on the presumption that they would become prostitutes so most married single men already in the country as arranged beforehand at ellis island before entry br br this is the story of a british immigrant charlotte gainsbourg who arranges to marry a poor sicilian vincenzo amato he is trying to get his family through with a son that is mute and a mother aurora that is considered feeble minded she was fantastic in the role by the way br br you will also see character actor vincent schiavelli in his next to the last appearance i don't know if his last film has been released he plays a matchmaker and is also very good br br it was a strange but enjoyable film it's not for everyone as i imagine those who don't have some interest in the immigrant experience would find it rather slow
<START> spoiler alert disjointed and confusing arson drama that has to do with a sinister plan to burn down a major vacation resort before new years day being insured for ten million dollars the man behind valley view estates in the blue mountains in australia julian guy is determined to bring his own project down in flames in order to collect this has to happen by january 1 two weeks hence before the insurance policy on the project runs out br br with his mind totally on his work builder and architect howard anderson tom skerritt has no idea that his boss julian is planning to burn down the resort he's building and possibly set him up as the fall guy anderson gets a bit suspicious when insurance investigator sophie mccann wendy hughes informs him on some very fishy goings on between and the insurance company proud alliance it turns out that proud is actually owned or 60 of it by himself this explains whey is having all these arson fires happen in order to collect the ten million dollars of insurance which is at least twice as much as the entire valley view estates is worth br br we later have sophie mccann murdered in a faked swimming accident to keep her from finding out whats happening with the suspicious fries around and in valley view estates it's when lloyd's of london who's proud alliance insurance investigator george james mason shows up that takes a powder leaving his ace arsonist on his own and out of control to blow entire plan br br meanwhile anderson has gotten wise to both and who unlike wants the valley view estates to go under for reasons which are never made quite clear just watch the last few seconds of the film to realize that by it's writer and director the arsonist is exposed as he's about to do in his girlfriend with anderson coming to her rescue we then have this wild chase scene with the arsonist getting lost in the valley view construction site only to have it set on fire with the help of howard anderson where he ends up burning to a crisps by the time the fire department came to hose him down br br the sudden and unexplained ending never made clear to just what happened to the big cheese in this whole scheme of things the sinister and evil minded julian it's as if got away scot free and only his unstable and deranged henchman the arsonist who was only the instrument of crimes ended up as the only person who payed from them
<START> well i'm an italian horror big fan and i love movies from directors such argento fulci bava sr and bava jr only to quote the most famous la villa delle anime is one of the most unknown movie of this genre shot when this kind of cinema began its crisis that continues still today and director carlo sounds totally new to my ears he directed six movies this is the price italian directors have to pay to not work in rome but the film is not so bad and it's absolutely not correct to talk about trash ok the plot is not so original it reminds me stuff like the series the year is the same of amityville possession by damiano damiani or shock the last work of mario bava but you have to think that this is the movie of a cinematographer like mario bava movies so the most important thing is the atmosphere not the story or the characters atmosphere very well created by the use of light and by the camera movement the rest remain in the background i think the movie works not so good but works it's surely better than a lot of hollywoodian production like the haunting which have a bigger budget but not bigger ideas
