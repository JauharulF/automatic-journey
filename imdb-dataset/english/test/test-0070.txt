<START> hammer house of horror witching time is set in rural england on woodstock farm where stressed musician david winter jon finch lives with his actress wife mary prunella gee is currently composing the music for a horror film one night while looking for his dog billy david finds a mysterious woman in his barn calling herself lucinda patricia quinn she claims to be a witch who has transported herself from 300 years in the past to now obviously rather sceptical david has a hard time believing her so he locks her in a room in his farmhouse calls his doctor charles ian to come examine her however once he arrives they enter the room lucinda has disappeared charles puts it down to david drinking too much but over the next few day strange disturbing things begin to happen to david mary br br witching time was episode 1 from the short lived british anthology horror series produced by hammer studios for tv originally aired here in the uk during september 1980 the first of two hammer house of horror episodes to be directed by don leaver episode 13 the mark of satan being the other i actually rather liked this as a series hammer house of horror dealt with various different themes were all unconnected to each other except in name unsurprisingly watching time is a sinister effective little tale about a witch the script by anthony read benefits from it's slight 50 odd minute duration moves along at a nice pace the character's are pretty good as is the dialogue there are some nice scenes here i liked the way it never quite reveals whether david mary are going crazy or not i think it's a well structured entertaining reasonably creepy horror themed tv show that i enjoyed more than i thought i would br br being made for british tv meant the boys at hammer had a lower budget than usual if that was even possible as such there is no gorgeous period settings here as in their most well know frankenstein dracula films although the contemporary english setting does give it a certain atmosphere that you can relate to a bit more another tv based restriction is that the exploitation levels are lower than you might hope for there's some nudity gore but not much although i didn't mind too much as the story here is pretty good it's well made for what it is hammer's experience on their feature films probably helped make these look pretty good the acting is good as well with genre favourite ian making a bit part appearance br br witching time is a good start to the hammer house of horror series as a 50 minute piece of british tv it's pretty damned good now why don't they make show's like this over here anymore
<START> wow i just have to say this show is super cool i fell in love with the show from the beginning the idea of the show is very original and very soothing it's also a pleasure to watch the performance the two lovely leading ladies give lauren graham and alexis they're simply wonderful i'm especially a big admirer of lauren graham she's not just a pretty face she's a monster of an actress as well i'm not saying that alexis isn't a wonderful actress as well i just happen to like lauren better anyway it's a real delight seeing them on screen sparing with words in the words of the immortal jim carrey b e a
<START> if monte hellman's legendary early 70's road movie masterpiece two lane blacktop had been done more like a stark stripped down fiercely taut and straightforward brooding mood piece embellished upon by that distinctly very raw and ragged macho australian mentality and topped off with a generous sprinkling of dour despairing no hope whatsoever end of the road punk nihilism it would undoubtedly be much similar to this jarringly bleak and atmospheric knockout br br nice guy factory worker mike an appealingly scruffy terry serio runs afoul of sneering shades wearing fascist car race champ fox a perfectly hateful richard when he steals fox's fetching model girlfriend julie the lovely deborah conway away from him mike and fox begin competing in increasingly lethal races in which the stakes become higher and higher with each successive bout finally culminating in an especially pulse pounding all or nothing race with only one true winner allowed mike assisted by his worried but loyal italian mechanic pal tony a splendidly smooth turn by vangelis mourikis and by blind supremely hip 50's style greaser rebel marvelously essayed with maximum coolness by max cullen willingly puts his life on the line for the sake of his reputation the affection of his old lady the money and most importantly for the chance to topple the haughty fox from his gloating thrown directed with utmost gravity and intensity by john clark written to laconically right on perfection by barry with a shivery flesh crawling synthesizer score by peter and spare unadorned cinematography by david this authentically gnarly early 80's item presents the concept of racing cars as not only a funky alternate lifestyle but also an all consuming obsession and reason for living it's the sole thing most of the film's characters are really passionate about with a remarkably astute and unblinking eye complete with a harrowing downbeat ending and grim central message about the bitter price one pays for being top dog this riveting depiction of a dead end existence rates as an extraordinary cinematic achievement
<START> i have seen it a few times and get completely glued to it every time it is very suspenseful and intense to describe it sounds boring but it is amazing it is the kind of movie where you need can't miss a thing but if you soak it in it sticks with you long after it ends now thinking about it i don't even know what stone was trying to make us see just the story of alan green i don't think so it was a look at ignorance stupidity self absorption and a guy just loosing his grip maybe he had more grip than the listeners though i didn't like barry but still seemed worried about him for some reason i was perplexed at why i couldn't get him out of my mind when the movie ended i wish i could see inside olive stone's mind for this one
<START> to start off i love steven seagal the man is a genius but recent movies leave me to wonder is he trying anymore his latest movies show almost no effort on seagal's part in out of reach its too obvious that his lines are dubbed over what seagal does in this movie is not only a slap on the face to his fans but even more to jean claude van damme and his fans in the 2nd scene or so when he prepares to zip line into the drug dealers penthouse to steal the jewels and money it shows him set up the gun and hook it on a neon sign your might be saying to yourself so what does this have to do with van damme ' well that scene was stolen from a jean claude van damme movie called the order rent both watch both compare both and you will lose respect for seagal not only was today you die garbage but it was dare i say an insult seagal's aikido moves are still good but why isn't he doing great movies like marked for death or above the law hes still got the moves and the attitude i'm just left wondering 'why seagal why ' there are such idiotic scenes in his newer movies that have nothing to do with the storyline and such idiotic story lines on top of that i hope the up coming black dawn movie will be another exit wounds or beyond justice because these last chain of movies he made especially today you die really made me wonder if he has the stuff to make more great action movies like double team please don't watch this movie unless you hate seagal if you love his movies don't watch this it will make you question his future in the action film genre
<START> i just saw this movie for the second time with my 8 year old daughter and i remembered why we liked it the first time all these people who say it is bad are too uptight and critical it is simply an entertaining little movie it's not supposed to change the world i thought all the actors did a great job with their characters except for jeremy jordan as guy he was a maggot who looked seriously in need of soap and shampoo if he is supposed to be the hot guy in their school then they've got slim but i digress drew barrymore was delightful as usual and david arquette was even enjoyable and i usually can't stomach him if only because of those stupid at t commercials molly shannon is always entertaining and leelee sobieski did a great job as a tortured brain some parts were actually painful to watch reminding me of high school even though i thankfully didn't get made fun of it made my heart ache for those who do movies like this are actually good for children to see my daughter made several observations about the cruelty of some of the students and how wrong it was this movie is appropriate for anyone and a good way to while away 2 hours if there's ever a time you want to see a lighthearted little movie with a happy ending where you don't have to think very much then this is definitely a consideration
<START> harrison ford plays sergeant dutch van den of the district of columbia police department he tries to get the bad guys but doesn't do a very good job when we meet up with him he's trying to catch a corrupt undercover officer kristin scott thomas plays a new hampshire senator kay chandler trying to get she's running against a candidate who has plenty of money the last thing she needs is the death of her husband she's a politician she can't be bogged down by feelings br br this story moves slowly and painfully i was looking at my watch every five minutes wondering when it would be over the story gets lost in details the director sydney pollack didn't need to put in we don't want to know about police investigations they throw in some insight to politicians and the control' they do for campaigns after seeing the movie i'm still wondering why they got involved romantically doesn't anybody mourn anymore don't you need more than two weeks to even consider going with someone else br br it was good to see actress comedian chicago native and second city alumni bonnie hunt her role isn't necessarily comic relief but she was the only one i wanted to see more of do yourself a favor wait for it on video if you want to see it at all

<START> i really love action adventure films and this is one of the best of course we love the stars of this genre bruce willis sly stallone clint eastwood kurt russell arnold schwarzenegger and the rest but its the story that really counts the best are somewhat feasible but we can tolerate those that are a little over the top as in the comic book style of action the more twists and turns the more dire situations the heroes are involved in and the more shocking moments in the film the more we action adventure fans enjoy them in the line of fire has all the elements required for a rip roaring action thriller it has clint eastwood as a near retirement secret service agent whose one bad moment of failure haunts him it has one of the most evil despicable maniacal villains in john malkovich the type in which you can't wait to see him get his due it has rene russo as the 'love interest ' it has twists and turns an occasional shock and even a touch of warmth and humor it is extremely well paced by director wolfgang petersen and even has a score by the great ennio morricone this one is a real roller coaster ride of a thriller don't miss it
<START> low budget but still creepy enough to hold your interest in another take off on the familiar frankenstein story this movie is also known as lady frankenstein the alluring frankenstein sara bay fresh from medical school arrives at her father's estate to find that he is still up to his old tricks baron frankenstein joseph cotten is murdered by his own creation and now his daughter decides to carry on the family tradition by creating herself a lover this is closer to being an eerie melodrama than horror flick supporting cast features mickey hargitay paul paul muller and herbert a rainy night could amplify the atmosphere still a fun watch
<START> well i've enjoy this movie even though sometimes it turns too much to a stereotypical situation i didnt understood at this time if the punishment park has exist in the past but i think the matter isnt really here br br you have to look at this movie in a different manner it shows how much violence you can find in our world it reminds us that we live in a world who is lead by violence and that nobody can escape from it if anyone refuse to take his then you will be thrown out of our society all our history is made by wars we should never forget this in fact its only when we will finally accept the truth that maybe we will change and understand that our intellectual skills have improve so we could use them to find others ways to resolve our problems br br in 2 words this movie is a must see maybe it will help us to accept the truth
<START> red skelton in his first starring role plays wally benton who plays 'the fox' on a radio show he writes the murder mysteries and as 'the fox' solves them joseph jones conrad veidt is trying to figure out how to perform the perfect murder on someone he kidnaps benton his girlfriend ann rutherford and another girlfriend virginia grey he tells benton to write out the perfect murder or his girlfriends get it br br very funny and enjoyable movie fast moving it's only 77 minutes a good script and perfect casting really puts this across skelton is very good in his first starring role very funny fast handsome and intelligent veidt is excellent as the evil jones rutherford and grey are lots of fun as skelton's girlfriends all three of them play off each other perfectly their verbal sparring is the highlight of this pic also fun to see eve arden in a small role br br well worth your time
<START> this is a film with a lot of potential well done and acted with a rather week and inconsistent script a young woman with two children moves to her mother's cramped apartment because the husbands flat on top of the workshop where he cuts up stolen cars is aggravating their son's asthma husband ends up in jail when an ex pat's stolen car is traced to his shop ex pat ends up being kind generous and naive and rather cardboard and we learn next to nothing of him but ends up with the girl who trades up despite being sexually satisfied only by her husband i expect this film to be successful in czech where it will be welcome due to its obvious premise them ex pats may have money they may even get our women but they're old soft and our women want to be satisfied we may be poor but now if only could keep satisfied so she would not need to play with herself or if he already had an existing family in italy but that would complicate things
<START> i love most movies and i'm a big fan of sean bean so i thought that i would at least like this movie also i'm canadian and this is a mostly canadian movie so i was prepared to cut it some serious slack nothing could have prepared me for the garbage that is airborne steve guttenberg as an action hero give me a break the acting throughout the movie was so bad i am going to have trouble sleeping tonight i now have only two wishes in my life br br 1 i hope that you never have to sit through this movie 2 i wish i could get those 6 hours back oh wait the movie's under 2 hours it only seemed like 6 hours br br don't watch this seriously
<START> for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job we have to support the emerging industry especially coming from up north it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs it's a feel good film and that's how i felt when i came out of the cinema it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents the film has just opened i do hope it does well people should support this little film i think this ' person is very bitter about something and getting too shame i say well done to all those a drink on me i look forward to you next venture
