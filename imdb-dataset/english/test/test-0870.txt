<START> surprisingly good mean streets type crime drama foreshadows elements of goodfellas and casino joe pesci's first big role clever dialog i think the maltin guide gives this a bomb rating i can only guess no one actually bothered to watch it br br saw this at tarantino's film fest and he said scorsese used a number of these actors in raging bull
<START> this movie tries its darndest to capture that classic bad canadian movie feel br br quirky and obnoxious characters a few quirky town with quirky folk a quirky coffee shop or restaurant coffee shop here lots of shots of canadian stuff for postcards ocean stuff here lots of mention of gotta get out of this town downright booooring br br and it succeeds on all counts br br something to note though i couldn't figure out whether this movie was just trying to be post northern exposure quirky comedy or something surreal like a drug induced or psychotic hallucination the editing of this movie jumped around from one unrelated thing to another with zero pacing or motivation not to mention the fact that half the time we didn't even know where we were jumping take for instance the very opening shots of yelling teens in a car who are they and what the h did they have to do with anything and this sub uh plot use that word plot loosely kids that seem to span generations i don't think they actually do but the editing makes it look like they materialize from flashback all of a sudden to current time huh what did i miss br br avoid unless for laughs or you want to try and trip out on the inept editing
<START> high school female track star dies of a blood clot after winning a race with the community in an uproar against coach george michaels christopher george playing him as a major butt head who is very demanding of the athletes under his watch he'll be canned after school lets out providing the flick with his motive as a possible killer some twisted psychopath in sweats much the same as what michaels is often seen wearing using a stop watch to time his executions murders the members of the track team the dead female runner was a part of soon disturbed parents call principal michael pataki wondering why their children didn't come home after a prom party inspector halliday carmen argenziano begins snooping around campus at worried parents' request instantly a beleaguered michaels becomes a prime suspect after the body of a gymnast is found in a locker ensign anne patch mackenzie returned home from her base in to receive her dead track sister's diploma and soon confronts the killer herself in the climactic chase scene kevin badger e danny murphy is the weary boyfriend of the lost track star br br rather leisurely paced slasher spreads out the death sequences quite a bit trying to mix humor within and rather failing miserably low quality kill sequences only increase the laughter such as a sword embedded within a football thrown into the stomach of a football player or a pair of garden shears used to behead a poor soul taking a leak linnea quigley has an amusing role as horny student dolores who sleeps with her music teacher for a higher grade and always chases after a male stud the recipient of the garden shears before he has a chance to bed dolores outside of the prom party white has an early role here as a ditsy blonde who discovers the dead gymnast's body in the locker virgil frye has a silly role as an inept officer
<START> what can i say about this movie that hasn't been said hundreds of times before it's an american classic it has spawned dozens of imitators or none midnight madness is one of kind from the ridiculous opening montage music to the hotel i was hooked leon made us all feel so young and carefree one question though how did he have those two hot hookers with him all the time and how did have the time money to arrange such an event the cast is top notch david naughton is at his best here his tight yellow sweatshirt is disturbing his little brother michael j fox in his first starring role is a real brat there is also naughton's love interest and a dork and the obligatory black dude in a fisherman's hat on the yellow team michael j fox does bad things like try and steal cups of beer at the pabst blue ribbon brewery and runs away to van team gives us the most comedy what exactly is the deal with the blond on that team is she dating flounder or or blade yes the mexican gentleman's name is blade the other guy on the flounder team has the best lines of the movie i won't pomp them here the meat machine team is a bunch of drunks my personal favorite is armpit but the silent black man is great too the other two teams are 4 nerds and 4 lesbians two of which are 450 lb twins br br you know the ending from the start but that doesn't matter this is the 80's me genre at its finest don't rent this one buy it and buy it now
<START> it's quite simple that those who call this movie anything below decent do not know their cinema the doll master creates a sense of dread and suspense rarely seen in movies outside of asia br br think of a mixture of manga and ringu rolled into one and this is what its all about br br first rate acting first rate direction first rate sets and effects br br this is right up there with the best of asian horror cinema ringu dark water and a tale of two sisters br br an absolute must br br take it from a guy who knows his movies
<START> evil ed is a swedish film about a man named ed of course and his collapse into total madness after editing a series of b horror films known as the loose limbs series ed becomes so mad that he thinks he's seeing demons and monsters but in reality they are people he knows and people that are close to him such as his wife and daughter br br i first saw this movie back in 1998 and was baffled by what i had seen to this day this movie i consider to be one of the darkest comedies out there as the movie is almost slapstick funny with its gore scenes there are still a few creepy moments br br this is a cool flick but don't expect anything marvelous it's simply just a fun movie that is good to show some of your friends for some laughs 8 10 stars
<START> when jan svankmajer lets his imagination run wild get ready you're in for dark harrowing films like alice and little or short gems such as down to the cellar and jabberwocky all of those are excellent films that represent disturbing surrealistic film making at its best br br on the other hand when svankmajer attempts to make a political statement of any kind you're advised to leave the room in a hurry films in this vein tend to be both adolescent and preachy presenting straw man caricatures in repetitious fashion to express his pseudo brilliant insights br br lunacy unfortunately is very much this latter type of movie cartoonish ideas and characters are stretched paper thin for an appalling two hours there are a few moments that briefly hold interest but these few are separated by vast deserts of boredom br br if you found dreadful monotonous short film et cetera brilliant and hilarious you'll probably love lunacy if you've never seen a svankmajer film before please start elsewhere
<START> i took my younger niece to an early showing and she loved it i enjoyed it myself as well i don't need to explain the plot since the movie remains completely true to the award winning top selling book by famed author carl the movie takes the popular book and layers it with beautiful cinematography i want to go to florida now humor thanks to funny man luke wilson and some new comers and great music i have to get to get a jimmy buffet cd now i know a movie is good when i get goose bumps in the end overall it was great family film that i felt comfortable taking my younger niece to i'd recommend it to any and everyone
<START> both disney and bill paxton did a fine job in conveying a story that is based in fact you do not have to like the game of golf to appreciate the story of one man's struggle to overcome the odds it could have been based on any sport or simply on any other situation which involves competition though this one just happens to be related to golf the only problem i have with the story is that i would have liked to see a bit deeper into each of the main characters esp mr mr francis is a typical young man of his times turn of the century america where class lines are well delineated and woe be it to anyone who deigns to try to rise above his class standing i did a bit of historical research and my biggest question was indeed answered to my satisfaction although the circumstances are a bit different than those portrayed in the film i came away with a feeling of content i thoroughly enjoyed this movie i believe you will too
<START> this movie is in all likelihood the worst film ever made it is certainly the worst that i've ever seen and i have seen a lot of bad movies br br in this nothing at all interesting happens throughout the movie one could literally start the movie take a short nap and then wake up secure in the knowledge that nothing interesting has happened while you are sleeping and i have seen this movie three times staying awake throughout i feel i should be congratulated br br the movie goes as one might expect according to a formula with no variation hunters capture baby bigfoot get killed by parent and the nearby town goes into a bigfoot killing frenzy this is surprisingly boring for a troma release br br so please do yourself a favor and skip this movie if you have to see it you will understand why
<START> 1996's michael is warm and winning comedy fantasy that features one of my favorite performances from the john travolta library travolta gives one of his and most likable performances as michael an archangel whose quiet existence at the home of a lonely innkeeper named pansy jean stapleton is disrupted when pansy reports michael's presence in her home to a national enquirer like newspaper and the editor bob hoskins sends reporters william hurt andie mcdowell robert pastorelli to the motel to check it out hurt mcdowell and pastorelli are quite good as the jaded news who have a hard time accepting they've met an angel but this is travolta's show and he rules as the pot bellied sugar eating cookie smelling pie loving aretha loving bull chasing michael an angel who just isn't what you think you of when you think of angels and you have to love the scene in the bar when he and the ladies dance to chain of fools i love this movie more and more every time i watch it and it's mainly because of the completely winning performance from john travolta
<START> even if you do not typically enjoy documentaries odds are you will find this one fascinating not only does it have a well mapped out plot that while easy to follow contains its interesting detours it also has a very strong emotional resonance and not one that relies on a simple specific tone instead the emotions here are as profound and turbulent as the seas featured br br that being said if you know nothing of donald and the 1968 single boat race around the world as was the case for me please stop reading and rent view this film br br spoilers follow br br my friend brian recommended this at the same time that my aunt had sent me a clipping linking this film with antonioni's work in 2007 i was mesmerized by several of antonioni's films still am to connect this film to antonioni i think is a bit of a stretch the character most likely to be seen in one of movies is francoise de it's funny on the main imdb page he isn't even listed as playing himself which is probably a function of his lengthy name as opposed to his self realization since sails right out of the race that could be considered is a bit like anna in l'avventura quite a major minor character br br while there are many things to love about this film the actual footage from the time the stoic best friend the sheer power of the roaring forties i walked away with a simple connection a man truly at sea there have been times in my life where i wonder how i got to such a point caught between dreams and reality feeling like a stowaway in my own skin it may be that i'm reading too much into this documentary and that in turn the directors read too much into but i found that sense as spell binding as the other secrets kept in this film br br on the odd chance that wife who seemed a remarkable study in restraint with understandably conflicted overtones and his children so young in the found footage and still young at this late date in the sense of their pain and pride for their father i am certain the comments here and the film itself fail to catch the man that your father was in his death however he has given the world a glimpse of something like a lost myth he is a pre gps odysseus never finding his body adds to the air of frail immortality if not the stature of a cosmic being of which he had writ br br this film sticks with you after the viewing as if you expect another twist to emerge from the deep waters or at the very least you hope for the sequel br br hunger 8 10
<START> used to watch this when i was very little then used to watch my videos now i watch the dvds i love this ray winston is 'the dude' the rest of the cast is all good and even with the changing of robin hood it all works great stories twists and the way it was shot to the untrained eye not that mine is trained can be miss interpreted as being ropey but it adds to the films absorption of the audience with the green hillsides and the contrast of the lush sunny lit forest to the dark corridors and dungeons of the castles its great personally the definitive interpretation of the robin hood legend i cannot stress how much i think you should watch this if you get a chance then you must watch it
<START> it was harrowingly close but the china syndrome received the worst kind of publicity when as it was going into theatrical release the accident at three mile island nuclear power plant happened i still remember the whole country's attention was glued onto hourly bulletins coming out of pennsylvania and wouldn't you know it a scientist in the china syndrome describes the worst case scenario as rendering an area as large as the state of pennsylvania br br less than a decade later in the ukraine at the soviet union in its last days dealt with such a crisis that didn't get righted in the nick of time the china syndrome once again became a relevant movie br br the film is more about cutting corners for safety than it is about being anti nuclear jack lemmon is a man who lived with nuclear power all his life as the captain of an atomic power submarine what angers him and sets him off to create the confrontation that climaxes the film is the stupidity and greed of the power company managers stupidity and greed though are found every day the problem with them is that there are places where it can be tolerated less in human society br br lemmon shares star billing with a couple of famous hollywood offspring jane fonda and michael douglas jane is a tv news reporter who is constantly being assigned to puff feature stories and just happens to be at a nuclear power plant when an accident occurs the cover up by her own station and her later meeting with lemmon set off the chain of events depicted in the china syndrome br br fonda's best scene i thought however was with peter a news executive with her station take a look at her facial expressions as off the importance of the story and tells her that her very beauty demands she stick to puff pieces fonda knows she's got something and sticks with it br br michael douglas plays her iconoclastic cameraman this was a typical part for him back in the day in his tcm tribute to his father kirk douglas michael said he opted for roles showing sensitivity still i could have seen a young kirk douglas in this part br br what to do about energy for industrial and post industrial nations a vexing problem that will our government for a couple of generations to come this film shows what can happen with a dependence on nuclear power our current problems in the world stem in part from a dependence on fossil fuel specifically oil everything we use brings consequence some unforeseen br br the real hero of the film in my opinion is wilford brimley lemmon's colleague at the nuclear power plant in the end brimley really steps up to the plate br br see the china syndrome to know what i'm talking about
<START> herman has made northern drama his own with little voice and brassed off but the formula falters in this ropey flat and contrived tale of two teenage delinquents trying to get season tickets to see newcastle br br underage smoking and drinking underage sex teenage abortion school bullying drug abuse substance abuse depression child violence child sex abuse shoplifting auto theft violent assault and armed robbery all put in an appearance here none of these issues are explored they merely serve to move the story along from one implausible situation to another the film is not as acutely observed as trainspotting as poignant as the full monty or as reflective of the times as wonderland from which it shamelessly steals music in an overly manipulative manner i suspect none of the filmmakers are from newcastle and have certainly never experienced the social problems the film references i am all for entertainment and herman's track record shows he is aware of the need to balance the social message with laughs and tears quite simply he comes up incredibly short here br br the film has a nice ending but there are far too many flat banal moments to sit through to get there nicely shot not very well acted and ultimately fails on three crucial points script script script
