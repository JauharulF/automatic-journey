<START> this is a pretty run of the mill family move that i am sure most children will enjoy but with really no that much to please any adults viewing the movie the premise of the film is that belushi's cop character takes his retirement but gets drawn into a case which results in him becoming a private investigator the movie's plot is so obvious most of the kids will surely pick the ending before it happens but additionally to that there seem to be story arcs and sub plots that are forgotten about as the movie progresses this coupled with a sub plot where the titular k 9 gets pimped out by belushi one to be avoided i am afraid
<START> northanger abbey is not my favorite jane austen novel but it has its charms this movie doesn't it has some of the same character names as the book but the story is drastically altered and the sweetest man in the whole austen canon unless emma's mr knightley gets pride of place is made out to be a heartless and mercenary creep one or two totally extraneous characters are introduced and a palpable air of corseted perversion hangs over it all i was so disappointed when i first saw it on its release in 1986 even today it ranks high on the list of films that disgrace the books on which they're based even robert hardy fans should give this one a wide berth it has nothing and i mean n o t h i n g to recommend it
<START> despite this production having received a number of poor reviews it actually holds up quite well for its age note also that it is not a bbc programme it was simply licensed to them by ventures when the jane austen collection was released on dvd br br so how does it compare with other adaptations of the same novel the most well known version these days is the 1995 film with amanda root as anne elliott and ciaran hinds as captain frederick wentworth that film was of course shorter but a good snapshot of the story the earlier version with ann and bryan marshall in the same roles had four hours to tell the story and moved at a more leisurely pace br br is a good ten years too old for her role but she is very good marshall is excellent as wentworth a man disappointed in love and bitter about interference and hidden in the cast are people who also contribute michael culver later seen in as richard vernon later seen in the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy as admiral croft noel dyson earlier in coronation street as mrs musgrove br br one criticism i do have is that the hairstyles are a bit distracting and that the costumes are awful still this shouldn't detract from a hugely enjoyable austen adaptation
<START> a nurse travels to a rural psychiatric clinic run by doctor stephens she is upset to learn that the doctor has died leaving his assistant doctor masters in charge she is unnerved by the inmates including a crazy judge a shell shocked vietnam vet a catatonic and a creepy nympho but is soon befriended by a hulking black man sam she needs all the friends she can get as people are dying all around her don't look in the basement is my first horror film of s f despite its low budget it manages to provide some genuine chills plus a nice amount of cheap gore including a particularly nasty scene with a desk through an eyeball the climax of inmates taking control over mental asylum is an intense melange of wild camera work gore and piercing screams 8 out of 10
<START> tank girl was i suppose meant to be the buckaroo banzai of the 90's and was marketed as such the comparison is admittedly appropriate both movies have so many things going on in any given frame of film that as impossible as the story is to sort out it certainly isn't boring br br tank girl is a fun enough ride if you turn your brain off before the movie starts otherwise you'll end up with a skull cracking headache like me
<START> tous the big risk is repeatedly recommended every time i look up a jean pierre melville film that i had to give it a watch as soon as possible since i've been discovering melville and seemingly working backwards through his filmography it would be easy for me to mistake this as one of his films but it was made in 1960 by claude sautet before melville would come and stake his claim on french neo noir br br tous has two of the best lead men of the time lino ventura and jean paul belmondo ventura plays abel a gangster exiled in italy with his wife and two kids who wants to come back to paris because the police are closing in on him after a roaring and fast paced opening with a big surprise abel eventually gets hooked up with eric stark belmondo who wants to get into the criminal underworld stark becomes chauffeur and eventual only friend in an underworld that turns it's back on abel after everything he's done and been through the film shows the the duality of the two men the older abel at the end of his time after tragedy strikes him and the younger eric starting off the same way abel did falling in love with a beautiful woman who sticks with her man despite the world they are a part of it never ends pretty for them or their loved ones its one thing to see a individual criminal come to his demise its different when he has loved ones he risks taking down with him br br much like melville's film the seemingly simple story gets more subtlety complicated as it goes along as usual as what i feel with melville's films it left my head spinning in a good way and dying to re watch it again to pick up what i missed the first time tous is a definite keeper
<START> if you enjoyed films like pulp fiction reservoir dogs and lock stock and two smoking barrels you are going to love two hands it has the same type of black humor beat to it and will keep you entertained through the whole film like pulp fiction it has the wacky scenarios that the characters get into and how they deal with them along with gallipoli and picnic at hanging rock this has to be one of the best australian films i've seen it also stars a young heath ledger before he got real big in the states br br this is a terribly underrated movie that i believe is just as good as pulp fiction and those greats you have to see it
<START> functioning as a sort of midpoint between waiting for guffman and a mighty wind best in show portrays a dog show and the various people who bring their canine friends to participate some are weird some crazy and otherwise but they all make the movie good director christopher guest is particularly funny as gay harlan pepper very much trying to promote his dog eugene levy parker posey michael catherine o'hara and bob balaban also do great jobs i can't imagine them not doing great jobs at least not in a christopher guest movie as someone who's never attended a dog show this movie is my main exposure to them they sure look neat
<START> norris plays a chicago cop who stumbles upon a devil's apprentice who wants to well create he eventually kills the creature by get this throwing a solid gold 24 inch spike not very sharp about twenty feet hard enough to penetrate the chest unlikely so is the rest of the movie much of it consists of cn and his sidekick driving cars and talking nonsense the israeli or arab kid is there ostensibly to humanize cn ok doesn't work makes no sense and advances the plot so called not one bit also no cops ever every get invited out of the country to be interviewed by other cops it is ridiculous as a premise the whole thing is bad unfortunately it's not so bad as to be entertainingly bad or campy just plain bad but one can see how norris was trying to find his way to the successful walker texas ranger series
<START> despite its pedigree the most interesting things about this series are not the animatronics or puppetry which while charming are little more than sideshows at least in the story i saw a story short in fact loathe though i am to admit it the chief pleasure lies in that most ancient art storytelling br br john hurt in qc mode grotesque medieval make up relates a story about story telling seated by the fire accompanied by a cynical dog one winter's day starving and poor he spots a fellow beggar thrown out of the royal kitchen by the nasty cook the story teller tricks this latter into giving them an excellent soup furious the cook pleads with the king for permission to boil the villain but pleased with the story wit the monarch offers him a reprieve for 100 nights he must tell the king a new story if he fails to do so he will hand him over to the cook br br the story may be old but it's told with great gusto anthony script is excellently dramatic as befits a playwright witty and with some disturbing concerns beneath the fun such as fears for the self or the culturally self generating power of storytelling linked to the continuation of ideological power for a programme aimed at children it is self reflexive with little nonsense about film being the new oral culture despite the americanised style there is a charming sense of medieval bustle its and arbitrary terror as well as its magic and power
<START> its obvious espn drools whenever knight is in the news but did they have to make a freakin' movie about him this was the worst attempt at a serious dramatic movie i have ever seen it had it all terrible acting terrible dialogue ridiculous casting cheap sets etc etc it looked like it was shot on a 10 budget whats up with the game scenes were they in a middle school gym and the lighting well let me just say it was ridiculous and brian as bob knight give me a break looked like in a red sweater nothing more espn lost a lot of credibility with this flop attempt they poured millions of in advertising then the premier was a huge dissapointment bob knight is not a subject that can be covered in a 2 hour movie espn blew it even knight himself thought it was more stupid than anything else
<START> the setup for nature of the beast is ingeniously simple and fraught with limitless potential for suspense harried salesman jack a very domesticated lance henriksen picks up trouble in the form of hitchhiker adrian eric roberts who seems to be in possession of incriminating information against jack oh and over a million dollars has been stolen from a casino and someone dubbed man' is dismembering people in the desert sounds great right sort of like the hitcher meets psycho one or both of these men has a secret and nothing is as it seems well unfortunately writer director victor salva of jeepers creepers and powder fame doesn't have enough ideas to keep the movie going the scenario arouses no tension or suspense poison for what is supposedly a 'thriller' and the inclusion of an underlying homo erotic tone seems out of place henriksen evokes an unusual not quite earthbound everyman even sporting an ample gut but roberts is about as threatening and scary as an extra in death wish 3 we're never sucked in to the point where we actually care about what's happening and the conclusion slides into improbable territory i kept thinking it was going to be fight club all over again but i was mistaken too bad nature of the beast could have been something else instead of nothing else
<START> for a long time i a fan of the monkees tv series refused to watch head because it was not about the tv show characters who were warm and wonderful head instead was said to be a cynical dark movie finally curiosity caused me to cave in i didn't of course find a new episode to the tv show but a fascinating movie that appeals to my dark side br br i have always been fascinated by dreams and head was very much like watching someone else's dream with incomplete hints of stories and a small detail at the end of one scene causing the film to segue off in a new direction very much in a dreamlike stream of consciousness manner the unfinished stories really make my imagination run wild time and time again br br the film also features very striking beautiful cinematography the epitome being the black on white white on black look of daddy's song the music is haunting especially the lush arrangement of the song the song is the favorite song of my dark side while my bright side prefers zip a dee doo dah br br in the end i think the tv series could have used some of head 's drama intrigue and intensity but head could have used some of the tv show's warmth humor and friendship
<START> caddyshack ii is one of those pictures which makes you ask 'why ' as in 'why was it funded ' 'why was it made ' and 'why was it released into the public domain ' br br to say the least it's a bad film it serves little purpose but to underline how superior its prequel was by setting an almost identical set of characters against each other in a similar storyline as a 'new money' land developer attempts to buy out the golf course sanctuary br br right off the bat making the follow up a whole 8 years after the original is somewhat bizarre i mean if your going to cash in on highly successful picture such as the first one then you have a window of a few years to do so but leaving it 8 years means that the formula is hardly fresh enough to simply do a follow up or poor imitation as this is so your sort of obliged to reward fans of the original by giving them at least reference to if not indeed actual contributions by the actors who made the first one so memorable but there's little if any of this br br instead we get cheap imitations okay the passing of ted knight in the interim years would have made it impossible to bring back the memorable judge but robert stack's inclusion as young' a fellow wasp elitist akin to the character is unimaginative and seriously lacking in the sort of anarchic frustration that made knight's turn so watchable jackie mason's is a feeble attempt at recreating the non stop wisecracks delivered by the al rodney dangerfield character of the first while dangerfield's role was endlessly quotable mason's is completely forgettable br br bill murray's laughably ridiculous groundskeeper and his war of with the pesky local gofer is substituted for his ghostbuster's co star dan ackroyd's role as the militant tom who's high pitched voice just splits your sides with frustration as opposed to the intended laughter br br randy quaid brilliant as cousin ed in the national lampoon's vacation series is quite the opposite here playing unstable lawyer the looks of disbelief shown by the actor's looking on at quaid's character's intended to be hilarious acts of inappropriate violence echo that of the audience your not laughing your just asking 'what the hell is he doing ' br br chevy chase shows up all be it occasionally and wisely rather fleetingly considering the disaster that's perpetrating itself around him as club pro in the films only direct reference to the original not withstanding the golf course itself that is with his deeply tanned skin and loud hawaiian shirts chase looks like he's just got back from a lengthy summer vacation and needs a paycheck he distances himself from the events in the actual picture enough that he takes little of the blame and leaves with some all be it little credibility still intact br br jessica as mason's daughter takes over from the role of the original as teenager struggling against class divides sounds ridiculous doesn't it at least in the first danny an irish catholic from a blue collar family and his laughable attempts to make inroads into the white anglo saxon protestant dominated world of the golf club mover and shakers was played out to some memorable set pieces such as being dismissed by the resident bishop as well as being mocked by the offspring of the local yacht club embarrassment of her father's inability to fit in is hinted at being because of his jewish roots that aside it may also have to do with him being a classless moron but such are swept aside though i stopped caring long before they were resolved at the end of the day noonan was trying to get ahead in life miss biggest problem is getting the hob at the local golf club to like her multi millionaire father so that she can get a date with the club's prodigal white kid or so i gathered br br anyway in summation its poorly written badly scripted with lame set pieces and wastes a lot of talent indeed kudos if you were able to sit through it to it's conclusion it really is a penance there is that question mark though of why did so many of the original actors not return as opposed to being replaced by performers who on paper at least looked their equals maybe they just weren't asked or perhaps i suspect they actually read the script stick to the original
<START> i recently had the idea to make a short film featuring a man who is hit by a car and wakes up thinking that he himself is chuck norris this meant that i would have to do extensive chuck research and find out as much as i could about the man i later find out that he is not in fact a man but an angel sent from heaven with a face like that who could ever doubt it i have watched more chuck norris movies in the last four months than any one person should i am proud to say that bells of innocence ranks pretty close to the top of the all time worst list i spent most of the film wondering if i could return my copy to the local wal mart without the receipt which i had been biting down on to keep myself from swallowing my own tongue the biggest reason why i chose to purchase this film was that it not only had chuck in it but his son mike i was anxious to see if mike was a chip off the old can't act his way out of a wet paper bag block i came to the conclusion a long while ago the chuck norris is one of the worst actors in cinematic history for one simple reason the only character he ever plays is himself chuck norris no matter what movie no matter what situation he is always chuck norris the one thing that he holds over his son is that he is consistent mike doesn't seem to understand how human emotions work in the scene where he is talking to the little girl about his dead daughter he seems to be extremely happy maybe this is because he actually pushed his daughter out into traffic as depicted in one of the oddest flashbacks of all time his actions confused me throughout the film making it very hard for me to focus on what little plot there was the other two lead actors were just as painful to watch as the son of norris the guy who constantly wants to eat or tell a stupid peacock joke was simply one of the most annoying characters that has ever graced the direct to video screen the only thing i remember him being in other than this movie was an episode of walker texas ranger in which he plays an equally annoying character maybe chuck owes this guy something the other guy which is the only name i can think of because he was so forgettable was your average christian fanatic i don't have anything against christians in fact i am one but this guy was just too much for me to round out the story you have a multitude of townspeople who love to call people friend and a couple of villains who don't seem to be able to decide which one of them is in charge not to mention the creepy kids who remind me of the dollar store version of every other group of creepy kids in movies all in all the movie is possibly one of the biggest failures of all time on more levels than chuck norris can kick people's asses despite being one of the worst actors of all time i still can't get enough of chuck maybe he really was sent from heaven
