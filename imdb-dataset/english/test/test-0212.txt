<START> this movie was really bad it has that quality that a lot of indie movies have moments of humor filled with long spaces that are completely boring any die hard bam fan will prolly like this movie but then again thats probably the only person who would see it someone gave me this movie to watch knowing i am a fan of jackass and was a fan of viva la bam before the scripted nature of that show wore thin to explain why this movie doesn't work i should just say the premise itself is played out br br a guy who is with a girl who is horrible to him and pretty much the whole movie you've got this ryan dunn guy whining and bam skipping around like a merry mischief maker performance is strange at best it's a humorous little nonspecific canadian french accent that pretty much is the extent of his performance basically funny for 5 minutes and then its like you're pretending to be foreign enough already br br maybe it would work if they were going for parody but all they succeed in doing is making a movie with an iq of zero i love toilet humor as much as the next guy but this isn't even lowbrow its just stupid its like the only humor to be gotten from this movie is completely inside and the audience even those savvy to and company are left out of the joke br br next time is handed a sack full of money let's hope he doesn't blow it on some lousy pet project
<START> i am not one to like those anime cartoons eg pokemon dragonball z naruto but bell is different in my opinion bell is more exciting has better characters and doesn't focus so much on a sort of weapon or as much as the episodes i've seen such as it the episodes big brother vs bell really focuses on the life of the strange the smart the clueless suzy and the weird bell is probably my fav cartoon for now but i encourage others to watch 1 episode of it you'll most likely will like it br br robbie h aka
<START> it's interesting that someone made a comparison of the fifth missile to the star trek episode it should be pointed out that the original star trek tv episode in which the crew of the enterprise undergoes a space madness while orbiting planet si 2000 is entitled the naked time not the naked now the naked now refers to the first regular star trek the next generation episode in which the enterprise d encounters a science vessel this episode though does refer to and is based on the naked time original series one br br now to the firth missile while the reactions of the crew in the star trek episodes were based on those similar to alcohol intoxication the crew's condition on board the montana was caused by a much more serious situation namely the paint emitted by the faulty bulkhead finish there are few places where such a reaction could have more serious consequences than among a crew who has responsibilities as serious as a crew on a ballistic missile submarine and of course this is what makes the film so suspenseful and such a thriller the plot is very believable at the same time this film along with crimson tide the day after by dawn's early light the hunt for red october ice station zebra and many other similar movies give us much insight into how easily things could go wrong and just how easy it could be for a nuclear holocaust to begin thankfully such an event has not occurred and god willing such an event will not happen
<START> possible spoilers ahead br br whenever fans of bad movies congregate for more than a few minutes a name that invariably comes up is that of larry buchanan this amazing director has given us remakes of other turkeys the thing from venus cheap jack crime dramas like a bullet for pretty boy and tawdry conspiracy flicks like down on us and goodbye norma jean the loch ness horror is a humdinger to say the least overlooking the fact that loch ness is extremely long and narrow larry filmed this howler on a wide and round california lake early on the film boasts some dazzling for the budget underwater photography and creates some atmosphere in spite of itself then it degenerates into windy dialogue uttered by no name actors with lapsing scottish accents not to mention a soundtrack that will do nothing for the much maligned bagpipe at one point campers sing you take the high road i'll take the low road just to throw in one more scottish cliche if scottish people ever decide to jump on the political correctness bandwagon they'll sue larry buchanan over this film his surname notwithstanding the monster looks like a giant papier mache puppet and it makes the dragon in cecil look terrifying by comparison in one unforgettable scene takes to land and to evade some patrolling soldiers the fifty foot long critter tries to hide behind a tree and the soldiers don't see it the loch ness horror is a true mind that must be seen several times to be believed
<START> kathy ireland the body of a goddess the face of an angel the voice of a smurf br br and the acting talent of a shovel full of if you don't believe me check this out alien from l a actually depends on her to act throughout 9 10 of the movie sure she ends up in a nice red bikini top and a wrap around skirt near the end but that's too little so to speak too late br br seems ireland plays the daughter of a renowned scientist who falls down into the center of the earth to find him along the way she falls for a guy named yes like the toilet paper make your own jokes and finds out how mad max rejects live did you know that people that live down deep in the earth have austrailian accents neither did i br br it's bad it was after all and also a golan globus production but after all is said and done ireland just basically looks lost like she's trying to find where the photographers are so she can do a photo shoot instead br br and i don't blame her br br one star and if you insist on watching this do so with the sound turned off save your eardrums
<START> let's describe larry as an interviewer a complete in every way possible he laughs at all his guests jokes he asks the most boring questions and he would never dare contradict them he hits me as the type of person who wants to be liked by everyone friendly boring harry he probably owes his success to being a dream interviewer for celebrities because they don't get bombarded with what we the people want to know and have a right to know let's put it this way he interviews as if he's in a red country 02 10 2 for the guests that come on the show yet it all seems pointless when larry starts asking his mind numbing questions such as what's it like to be a mother followed by the usual answer along the lines of being a mother is the greatest thing that ever happened to me it's wonderful but tiring
<START> this movie was really awful it was not in the least bit frightening or even startling i went to see it with a bunch of friends and by the end of the night we were saying the ruins ruined my night br br i would not recommend seeing this movie in theaters renting it or even watching the movie on television by accident it is an absolute waste of an hour and a half br br the plot was nearly non existent the characters were horribly underdeveloped and they gave no back story whatsoever for anything that was happening and then left it completely open at the end as if preparing for a sequel
<START> of follows the story of helen and the outbreak of the trojan war this is more of a love story between helen and paris who is shipwrecked and falls in love with helen without knowing she is queen the film portrays the couple as lovesick and wanting nothing more than to be together other films and books have different portrayals of the characters but in this one they are simply hopelessly in love the film is pretty slow moving in some places but the battles and the detail to the scenery are done pretty well there are also some good performances i thought that the slave girl did a particularly good job and she was one of the most well liked characters br br overall this is a good adaption if you can look beyond the slow moving story in places and look beyond some of the cheesy romance and dialogue in my opinion a perfect iliad film version has not yet been created but this one is entertaining and does have some good bits
<START> imagine a gilligan's island set in the african desert in modern times add people nowhere near as jaunty as the skipper or marianne and enough angst to fill a german psychiatrist's office throw in a plot that manages to be interesting only and literary parallelism that never delves deeply enough to truly satisfy season with a truly morose topic that's been exploited since the first world travelers found themselves very very lost br br if the king is alive weren't a product of the reigning du jour of dogme 95 would this film be garnering as much attention dogme 95 is to hollywood as danish modern is to a byproduct of digital technology this scandinavian movement seeks quite dogmatically to strip away artificiality in film making by using more natural elements and returning to the essence of storytelling pearl harbor for instance is the dogme antichrist br br director co author saga ponders interpersonal relations and human nature when placed under the fire of a life threatening situation eleven people aboard a bus riding through the sand dunes suddenly find themselves stranded in the remains of an abandoned town an african local who does not speak their language serves as observer and narrator whose insights are among the film's most trenchant as the strongest heads off for a five day walk to the nearest village the others stay behind surviving on canned carrots and their likely future as chow former thespian henry decides that this rather unappealing crew needs a diversion and hand writes king lear from memory he assigns roles and the group passes many days learning lines and rehearsing in an effort to divert their attention from the seemingly inevitable br br gradually the cast begins to lose it and the of their william might say human to surface if you've ever seen lord of the flies you know that these things can get ugly that being in a lifeboat situation can turn even mother teresa into the termagant of calcutta br br the film was shot using an international ensemble of american english french and south african actors who the dogme dogma dictates develop themselves and their roles quite organically the king was also filmed chronologically adding a sense of realism to the ever increasing desperation of its characters after up to three hand held cameras shot in digital results were transferred to 35mm film br br the performance that compels most comes from jennifer jason leigh who plays a pop tart trying to bolster the spirits of the group in any and every way she can henry david bradley is another finely played character whose passion for his life's work ultimately saves the gang from utter despair it's hard to feel too sorry for the wives and their oafish husbands hirsute old sulky french intellectuals wealthy men who have more important places to be than marooned in the desert beckett might hate this question but why is this group riding a bus together through remote africa in the first place life threatening morbidity utter despair rendered in graphic detail a relentlessly tedious pace enjoy
<START> a friend brought me this movie and at first i was hesitating the pace in the movie was so slow that it was admittedly boring at the beginning but the life scenes were attractive it's like observing than watching br br it turned out to be simply stunning throughout the film the way how the director handled the life scenes to reflect the reality was confounding but somehow also overwhelming it's like understanding the real life of a lively person than watching a movie br br mr alejandro and miss gonzales did their roles so well that it's more like telling us their own stories indeed they used their real names in the movie
<START> disney like entertainment with some un disney like moments of graphic violence and sexual references lousy comedy alongside clichÃ© ridden moralizing noah as abraham lot as his wicked buddy laughable special effects overdone acting with bad timing and were destroyed before the flood strange twists and too many sub plots the bible doesn't mention god as a doubting father who just needs to be entertained by whistling before deciding the world has to be saved from disaster br br b movie wannabee director john irvin adds another failure to his worthless list of poorly directed movies that seriously lack plot and direction
<START> iÂ´m only joking this was potentially the worst film i have ever had the misfortune to sit through how anybody in the could have raised a laugh at this innane rubbish is beyond my comprehension i jest not
<START> this film is what happens when people see like in this particular one blair witch project and say hell people running around with cameras acting slash documentary themed no i can do it and start out with a lame idea make up a terrible script and get a bunch of talentless actors and start shooting a film plot is that in africa there a a breed of man like animals who hunt and kill humans the locals think that it's a demon or a evil spirit but our wild bunch are in africa to get some proof of there own no need for more words on the plot this movie get's a 1 out of 10 and i am trying to find something good to say about this movie but after a long time thinking nothing nada zero null
<START> this film fails on many many levels the script is the first failing and as i understand it if the script stinks there's nothing that can fix that the plot is boring after the first 45 minutes i'm looking at the counter on the dvd saying to myself how much longer the cinematography is pretty awful i'm not sure how bad the transfer was to dvd but it looked like a vhs copy also the sound was bad i realize this isn't going to get remixed for 5 1 but yikes it didn't even sound like it was in dolby stereo which had been around for almost a decade when they cut this film br br slipstream was far too similar to both mad max and blade runner for comfort because of the lack of decent special effects and high quality dialog it is extremely disappointing if i recall the pointer scene took place during the last 20 minutes usually it should take place in the first 20 most people will be totally confused as to what the heck is going on until the final 20 minutes br br the film's music was excellent in parts and then completely inappropriate in others elmer did the scoring but it sounds like someone else had a hand in sticking in 'other' stuff elsewhere as it doesn't match the overall good orchestral score with some synthesizer music br br there were great actors cast bob peck mark hamill ben kingsley bill paxton and they did a great job breathing the little available life into their characters well paxton's character was pretty stupid and the whole movie was centered on him i'm not sure a heroic stooge is a good choice for the main character who carries the film again a major flaw with the script br br thank goodness i watched this from a mail order dvd service and not the theater overall a major disappointment for sci fi fans or fans of paxton or hamill 90 minutes of your life you'll never get back
<START> rented this from my local blockbuster under the title speck that may be the way to look for it if you still feel the need to see it after this review br br it's a movie about the serial killer richard speck who killed several nurses in chicago in the sixties watching the movie one gets the feeling that it follows the crimes to the letter unfortunately that doesn't make for a good movie br br another problem i had was the near constant music letting us know that this was a scary movie and some god awful narration letting us know what's motivating speck the acting was average for this type of film to give credit where credit is due the movie is very beautifully photographed for my taste your mileage may vary br br over all if you're interested in the subject matter it may be worth your time
