<START> the last of the sequels not counting abbott and costello meet frankenstein which was more or less a spoof this time count dracula john carridine takes center stage seeking a cure for his vampirism from a kindly doc onslow stevens well good ole larry talbot lon chaney jr shows up also seeking a cure the good doc succeeds in curing larry's but dracula tricks the doc and ends up contaminating his blood and makes the good doc a crazed lunatic oh and all this time big franky glenn strange lies on a table awaiting his electricity fix so he can wreak some havoc this was kind of a short movie around 70 minutes and some change but the action is there and the great actors are there as well lionel atwill turns up as a police inspector heres some trivia lionel atwill appeared in son of frankenstein ghost of frankenstein frankenstein meets the wolf man and house of frankenstein and then this one if there was another in the series they may have added the creature from the black lagoon to the line up i'm giving house of dracula 8 out of 10
<START> the movie 'heart of based on the 1899 book by joseph conrad is one with little to no detail and has an almost schizophrenic like plot line if you have read the book then you know that little to none of the important story making scenes were put into the movie in the book there is so much that is left up to the imagination and i feel that that is one of the part that make the book what is it an example would be when marlow spent timeless hours and days even months waiting for rivets and that entire scene was left out of the movie again if you have read the book then you would know that this scene in the book is one that almost describes the main theme of futility best finally i feel that the movie was too cut and dry not enough though was put in to the original text and how that made the story what it is today br br if you have not read the book 'heart of preferably the norton critical edition then don't waist your time in renting or buying the movie however if you have read the book then i think that you will appreciate the book a lot more if you decide to watch the movie br br eric 2007
<START> ok so it owes pulp fiction but in my opinion has it's own voice and identity mainly because of the music video direction style sketch like narrative and great performances thomas jane delivers great the drug dealer show down is extraordinary aaron likewise james legros has a short and effervescent appearance great humor they got the wong house the interrogation and rape scene is memorable as is mickey rourke's cameo appearance take a peak br br great hollywood popcorn b production with strong performances of a level and rourke br br well take a peak it's worth
<START> imagine this br br whenever two people meet in this movie one of them is shot the plot just does not exist it appears that someone shot some action sequences and then tried to put them together to make a movie out of it if you decide to watch it you will regret it
<START> its such a shame that an important film like this is virtually unknown br br i don't think alan bates has done a better film than this br br its never shown on television the only time i can recall it being shown on british tv was in the summer of 1998 i have it on tape but sadly the quality isn't great due to a dodgy aerial at the time br br i remember wanting to see this film for some time before it appeared on tv it was shown on channel 4 in the early hours of the morning thereby ensuring that it still remained unseen except for a very small audience br br i was living in bristol at the time and it was ironic that when i finally saw the film i realised that i had walked past the very house where it was filmed several times before the film treads a fine line a married couple attempting to make light of their tragic predicament of coping with their severely mentally handicapped daughter by laughing about it and even involving the child in their jokes br br the direction and the acting are so superb that the film is always compassionate and moving and is never in danger of lapsing into bad taste br br a couple of years ago i saw a clip of the filmed theatre production with eddie izzard in the role of bri and victoria hamilton playing sheila br br it showed izzard improvising and larking about and hamilton jokingly telling the audience to ignore him when he's being like this br br i maybe taking this out of context as i only saw a brief clip but having read the play and seen the film this is clearly such a delicate subject that such an approach is both insensitive and disrespectful br br izzard was praised for his performance but i felt uncomfortable with what i saw br br it is perhaps surprising that such a successful play failed to find an audience when it was finally filmed br br this is one of the best british films of the 70s and hopefully it will be released on dvd one day
<START> i have really enjoyed several movies by gÃ©rard depardieu and expected i'd like this movie a lot more than i did the biggest reason was that i just didn't find the movie very interesting or funny so it didn't hold my interest also although he does not sleep with his headstrong daughter the idea that she is lying by telling everyone that he is her much older lover is just plain icky yes i know there is no incest and i know that nobody around them knows he really is her father but i found that any kid passing her dad off as her sexual paramour is too yucky and prevents the movie from truly being funny in addition i really didn't like this little brat very much apart from her lies she seemed very sassy and self involved i would have preferred if somehow she'd gotten her come uppance and somehow been punished as i just didn't like her
<START> there have been many well more than a few in any case attempts over the past 30 years to create film that has an otherworldly appearance supposing that this is a film director's wish to distance himself from other movies or simply to gloss over the low budget and shabby look begotten is on the top echelon of this pile br br apart from the peerless eraserhead anyway br br painstaking process of artificially degrading his film changes it's structure completely imagine what this film would have looked like in glorious standard technicolour it can almost be envisaged as an artifact from another unknown culture some images are so far removed from what we expect to see on the screen they disturb mainly as they are dislocated this is not last house on the left disturbance more like leaving your cave for the first time and seeing the sun disturbance br br watch this fever dream if you get the chance and relish remember they make other more standard films every day they can wait
<START> i first saw this movie as a teenager when it came out in theaters way back when seeing it again nearly 30 years later i was surprised at how well it has held up the gags are still funny the interaction between characters works great and the cameos come off better than ever steve martin's has to be the best one br br my kids 9 11 and 14 all loved it and the music is good enough that they are still humming the tunes many days later br br i would suggest that before seeing the movie you should view at least a half dozen episodes of the muppet show to get a sense of the back story behind the characters otherwise the movie won't make all that much sense
<START> i was truly surprised when i first saw this movie directed by it differs in so much ways from the usual hollywood mass production the plot itself is simple kevin spacey plays a mental patient who claims to be from the planet k pax who arrived to earth by a beam of light while dr powell played by jeff bridges tries to help him to solve his delusions first of all i must admit the cast is perfectly chosen kevin spacey is really brilliant in portraying the intriguing character of always walking in the fine line of convincing us that it is real and then making us wonder whether he is delusional or not some of the gem scenes include the one where innocently eats the whole banana even the peal while in session with dr powell or the observatory scene where he confidently shows his knowledge of the k pax system to the astonished astronomers jeff bridges on the other hand is the subtle rational side of this movie and he delivers it perfectly there is a whole other cast of excellent actors like saul williams' convincing performance as ernie who make this film truly work br br k pax has it all elements of comedy sci fi even psychological thriller concerning the identity but most importantly it can be categorized as a heartwarming drama the main premise of the movie is quite intricate but the director never lets it get loose he always keeps it believable and yet two ways the camera and photography have almost a crucial part here continuing the main idea of light travel there is much focus on light shadow play lightning settings one of the memorable scenes is where dr powell holds a crystal figure in his office which light in a beautiful way while all the time he suspects can the idea be true br br subtle and slow paced intriguing and pleasurable k pax is truly a gem to watch one of the kind movie that may not be for all tastes but those who see it might fall in love with it
<START> mark in a great role a rock star to the extent of knowing all his songs imitating him to perfection and dressing like him when the opportunity comes for him to take over his idol's role in the band he jumps at the opportunity however the role of a rock star may not be what it is cracked up to be and relationships can change this movie certainly struck me as having the theme of what you attain for may not be what you think it is once you get it overall a really good movie with great performances from all the cast as well as the two leads mark and jennifer aniston it did make me feel sad especially when emily jennifer aniston met up with chris in seattle and saw the depths to what he had sunk if anybody ever dreamed of being a rock star or a groupie they should watch this movie to see that the lifestyle although glamourous for a while is very lonely and ultimately not what you may want
<START> this horror movie lacks any horror or even mild suspense even the gore is not good the plot would have some promise if it was done by someone who cared about what they're writing filming but the people who made this movie obviously did not basically the film proceeds in a series of fits and starts thusly br br main character insists she's not crazy br br milo lurks about in his yellow raincoat or rides in front of a car on his bike br br main character insists she's not crazy and rambles on about her passion as a schoolteacher br br someone gets killed in an unsatisfying manner br br main character insists she's not crazy and musters up a few fake sobs br br are we seeing a pattern here if you don't you may enjoy this film otherwise watch something else the budget is low low low and it shows unlike say the evil dead which makes you forget about its crap budget and the acting is bad bad bad with the possible exception of the janitor in general the movie is boring boring boring i can't think of a single scene that's actually done well in fact i disliked the movie so much i actually turned it off ten minutes before the end something i very rarely do heck i watched the non manos the clones and wild wild west all the way through br br 3 10 spare yourself and watch phantasm again
<START> i'm a big fan of h p lovecraft's books and the mythos background spawned some rather good other stories and stuff like that and in the last years there came along some boys who did movies about h p 's work Â for the bigger part low flicks Â and showed them to the public at places like the h p lovecraft film festival now like i said most of them don't have a big but they at least know the heart and soul of work and films like cool air or the call of are what i would think gifts for the fan base and other loonies that like h p 's creation br br and then there are people like ivan who just rip off the name and create a movie which would have been fun to watch if i had directed it myself and filmed with some friends down at the beach that is what mr did as it seems but while blokes like aaron or bryan moore's earlier movies might not have had more they somehow still had more to offer like a story real characters and some connection to lovecraft just blabbering out names like or necronomicon makes a movie not a lovecraft adaption br br anyway this flick will not only make fans of the mythos shudder and hide it will also not appeal to people who 1 like good movies 2 laugh about bad movies 3 like good c grade splatter movies or 4 watch everything that has horror written on the dvd cover i will not go into the of this waste of time as it has already been discussed by others here on this page but like i said unknown beyond is like a movie i would have made up with some geeky friends aside from that it lacks ideas for any storytelling and goes into ridiculous moronic nonsense but he it's art stuff self made flicks of this quality are fun to watch if you know all the blokes in it and ha ha see how xy is coughing out the fake blood we made from old tomato sauce and stuff Â but hey you don't put this in a dvd casing declare it an actual movie and want money for itÂ br br i give it 2 10 because of the i dunno Â effort or something like that
<START> once again we have a movie that packs about 20 minutes of entertainment much of it involving the band's occasionally funny lyrics into a 90 minute package for anyone old enough to remember this is along lines of the first bill and ted without the story line if that doesn't say enough as to how brainless this movie is think about jack black singing for about 20 minutes of the movie and that being its selling point if you actually like listening to tenacious d because of their musical prowess then knock yourself out and buy the soundtrack don't waste your time with this though if your a stoner looking for a good bad movie filled with laughs you're still barking up the wrong tree no matter the potency of your buds you'll still be left wishing you'd popped in grandma's boy again instead
<START> a genius my genius i remember the exact second in 1994 i was sat in a pub in shropshire england i recall the exact seat bill hicks dies of cancer said the headline in the i felt like someone had punched me in the stomach buy this dvd if you don't find something in it one way or the other i'll be astonished br br rip bill i wish so much you were still here
