<START> this is quite possibly one of the worst movies ever made everything about it acting directing script cinematography is dreadful the alien a human in sparkly suit claims to be from a nearby universe one assumes the scriptwriter meant galaxy but didn't bother to get a dictionary to check his terms a better title for the film would be it came from the planet of plot contrivances the plot is excessively silly and nearly nonexistent the humans are all given magical that conform to a tortuous series of unlikely restrictions just to move the bare plot any thought to the passage of time is ignored now it's a couple days after meeting the alien then bam all of a sudden there's only a couple hours left until zero hour do yourself a favor and miss this movie you will make yourself stupider for having watched it the ending is particularly silly and should have been accompanied by someone going ta da as the scriptwriter just pulls something random out of his butt i think the real alien plot is that this movie sucks so bad you'll get cancer watching it if you can watch the last 10 minutes without crapping yourself enemies of freedom honestly laughing you're retarded
<START> why is it that instant noodles aren't instant this was the perplexing problem i placed in the lap of the one legged angry he angrily retorted that noodles weren't his bag equally i replied what bag he looked further perplexed br br some of you will be wondering why has the only one lower appendage br br the who we shall call 5 for data protection reasons injured his toe how i hear you ask i will proceed as we have learnt from the review of donkey punch 2002 irene via sly nudges and dirty winks etc tried in vain to teach the slight peculiarities of to all the angry 5 who is known only for his violent tirades against democratic principals during the post revolutionary years of the now united states of america and it's consequential affect on the mind sets of it's population in the post modern empire that now exists through the invasions of countries smaller than it got carried away in a river of violence due to his lack of comprehension of according to an eye witness he sprung around like a feckless banjo string at mardi gras wielding a stick with nail through it after the struggle that ensued 5 were each found to be missing their left testicles 3 were discovered spooning beneath a bush and 5 had the nail stuck in his big toe br br a lifestyle is as modest as a nuns with only rudimentary health care facilities at ft above sea level when the first aid hut was opened only an for a tin of spam and some knickers were found 5 hopped around like a dark on a noose in agony until irene burst forth like a cock from a hen house and suggested soaked his ailment in llama spit 5 agreed to the procedure to sedate him a bottle of 100 yr old was produced some say it was left by an angry scotsman who is thought to be an ancestor of the angry one under the influence the toe was bathed until dressed with slightly soiled and some blue tack some of you may feel that this procedure wouldn't do the any good and you would be fully vindicated for holding that view only four days later gangrene set it and a week later the leg was removed through the use of even tighter elastic bands
<START> the cinema of the 60s was as much as time of revolution as the politics and the music filmmakers were daring to make avant garde films discussing taboo subjects only permitted before in exploitation films starting with both breathless and underground american cinema such as kenneth anger films became more and more experimental all of this accumulated when hollywood realized they had mass commercial appeal with easy rider one of the best and most surprising outputs of this era was also one of the least successful initially head was made when the monkees career was seriously waning which is what damned one of the best psychedelic films ever made br br the plot well there really isn't one as many have said it involves the monkees going from one surreal scenario to the next one however these sequences are all obviously lsd tinged and basically mock how the monkees were sick of being confined to their light pre fab reputation its a shame that the film found no audience the teeny boppers who loved them had moved onto a new fad as they always do the psychedelic haight crowd to whom the film was garnered would never be caught dead at a monkees movie its all their loss this film may be plot less but it is certainly not without meaning and is very intelligently put together the crew later made both easy rider and five easy pieces the film was later revived at a 1973 retrospective and it gained a very positive response which granted it the cult following it had deserved for a long time ironically the monkees would fall victim to the same commercialism they protested in this film with their later 80s reunion 10 10
<START> following the release of white and the seven dwarfs 1937 ' walt disney productions has continued to produce quality animated feature length children's film many of which i still haven't had the pleasure of seeing 'the aristocats 1970 ' directed by wolfgang was the twentieth film in disney's official canon and is a romantic musical comedy revolving around a family of aristocratic cats living in paris france in 1910 in the mansion of the elderly madame adelaide voiced by hermione baddeley her loving feline pets Â including duchess eva gabor and her three young kittens Â are the most important residents when the bumbling butler edgar roddy maude learns that the cats stand to inherit the old lady's entire fortune he sets about disposing of the pets dumping them in the countryside far from the big city lost and confused duchess and her children strike up an acquaintance with a sweet talking alley cat thomas phil harris who agrees to show them the way home br br animation wise 'the isn't anything particularly notable with much earlier disney films such as and 1940 ' demonstrating a similar or even superior visual style however the story is interesting and exciting Â particularly for younger audiences i'll wager Â and the musical numbers which i wish were more numerous are terrific for the sake of trivia i'll name my two favourite songs as thomas cat and wants to be a cat the latter of which is a psychedelic throwback to the late 60s with a swinging jazz band and delirious flashing colours led by a trendy feline called the scat cat scatman crothers the family's journey back to paris is eventful and adventurous and we meet such friendly characters as amelia and abigail gabble two talkative geese uncle waldo the pair's drunken relative georges madam ancient but sprightly lawyer and napoleon and lafayette two dim witted hound dogs with a hunger for the butler's rump
<START> this movie is not just good its amazing besides providing us with good performances original plot fantastic special effects thoughtful messages and a lot more it was an until then completely unseen world to the public this is the first sci fi movie that takes us out into the unknown space of our galaxy with such splendid effects and mind bursting reality that the audience is left without words i am only 16 years old and therefore i was raised into a world of modern effects and 3d animations in the movies but nonetheless i was really and i mean completely blown away by the quality of these effects even after almost 40 years the visual effects was just one of the merits of this movie the camera was in true kubrick style amazing and enchanting it feels like you are consumed by the screen and sucked into this surreal world especially in the round control room or whatever you call it the effects the camera and the sheer size of this movie caught me of my guards even though i had seen the rating before i bought it but this movie has more to it than this the meaning of this movie can also be interpreted as you wish yourself even though i think there are some clear points concerning humanity also true kubrick style how humanity on top of its evolution is just maintenance on board and therefore not needed by the computer one of humanities tools how we in space appear like babies learning to walk once more losing control of our tools in zero gravity breathing through equipment as fish out of water on the peak of evolution we set out into the never ending adventure as simple primates many might think that the length and slow pace of this movie is boring ridicules or just a waste of time but before you can jump to those conclusions think about why kubrick spends time with calm music and a spaceship in the middle of space for several minutes this is to illustrate the beauty of it beauty beauty is in many cases not granted the rightful respect by viewers kubrick wants to show us beauty and if we do not succumb to it and relax we can not enjoy this film as it was intended this is not an ordinary movie we can not just sit and watch as we can with some other movies this requires time thoughts and above all commitment and feelings to watch all of this together makes this one of the greatest achievements in the world of moving pictures 10 10 let me know if you agree with me
<START> goes to town was the second and last full length animated feature made by max and dave fleischer who created a parallel universe to disney while disney's films are well remembered today both of the fleischer films gulliver's travels and this one are forgotten br br is a spellbinding original not an adaptation like the first picture that is a major plus one would think no the critics rarely on the sides to begin with tore into them for this yes the story is not as tight as gulliver but how can you hate a film that flaunts itself so joyfully br br it is filled with great musical numbers and a very involving story which would be a crime to reveal the characters are lovable and charming and there is heart in this film br br the really outdid themselves here and never quite did so again most of their time would be devoted to one reelers after this tanked at the box office it's a shame they didn't continue making features who knows their next attempt may have become the masterpiece they were aiming for br br out of 4 stars
<START> alexander nevsky marked director sergei eisenstein's return to film making after a period of exile and what he produced is a bald faced propaganda film proclaiming russia's superiority over germany br br there's very little plot russians unite to battle germans russia wins the film is really an extended montage of mostly battle scenes mixed in with some moments of german brutality like a rather shocking scene that shows german soldiers throwing russian children onto a raging fire this was eisenstein's first sound film and it's clear that he had no idea what to do with the medium indeed this film really looks more like a silent film with some sound added there are some dialogue scenes but they sit rather lifelessly on the screen and the pacing is all off as if the actors weren't actually on the set together at the same time when they were filming them eisenstein mostly uses sound as an excuse to overlay a rousing score over the proceedings and indeed that's one of the film's biggest assets br br say what you will about eisenstein's ability or lack of to direct actors or tell his film in a more narrative format he certainly knows how to edit images and music together for maximum effect and alexander nevsky over all shines through its deficiencies br br grade a
<START> i felt compelled to write about this movie after i joined imdb because i thought it was the worst script writing i have seen in a while br br the acting direction other areas of the movie are fantastic i love brad pitt with george clooney it works the witty banter was still there too from the first movie my question is how in the world did they let this script out of the drafting process i thought that not only did the plot develop like a slug racing to the end of the sidewalk but that twist can i call it that was so incredibly stupid that i wanted to go demand a refund from the ticket booth i have never felt so played and used from a movie in my entire life here i was expecting something similar to the first movie good chemistry good acting good direction amazing plot only to find that they had taking my 8 dollars and made a mockery out of it br br the part that gets me still is that this movie has now grossed more than 125 million dollars br br in summary i felt that this movie insulted my intelligence i still feel like the only part the writers concentrated on was that little bit with julia roberts acting like julia roberts this movie made me sad and angry
<START> i thought this movie was going to be a disgrace to the series after all part 3 didn't measure up to part 2 and this one doesn't have daniel miyagi's humour wasn't quite as witty in this one as in part 3 but it was funny enough to make the movie worth watching br br the girl's part was pretty good she's a lost teenager who needs direction i find the plot a little hard to believe that the aunt would simply agree to leave her home and her niece under the care of mr miyagi a man she just met of course he was a friend of her brother br br i did appreciate the monastery one might think from some of my other reviews that i wouldn't have liked the dancing monks but i thought it was amusing it showed that they know how to have some fun now if these were monks in ancient china dancing to pop music that would have been another matter br br probably the most intelligent part of the movie was when the girl thought it was stupid that the monks wouldn't kill a bug miyagi told her that street gangs killing each other is stupid nations trying to destroy each other is stupid but having respect for all life is not stupid miyagi has expressed such wisdom in the other films as well br br i give this movie a 4 out of 10 sure there were some things i liked about it it wasn't as funny as part three and no character could ever live up to sato in part 2 this movie has no re watch value i can't imagine watching it again but it is worth seeing once
<START> ugh bad bad bad but i have seen worse which is why i gave it a 2 instead of a 1 just got finished watching this movie and i thought it was about as rotten as the flesh on dr face the worst line of the movie had to be i like to introduce you to someone meet my inner b tch which consisted of the lone survivor of the fantastic 5 group throwing a trash can at dr chopper and then falling on the stage second worst line i'm the park ranger that's gonna f ck you up what this freak ain't even a cop did anyone else notice how everyone instantly dies from the magic gut stab no one dies that quick from a gut stab i know this cause i see them frequently in the operating room except super park ranger dude had like a bucket of blood poor out of that wound writhes around on the floor some and then comes in for the finale to take a parting shot at dr chopper while inner b tch lies cowering on the floor and if that don't beat all he doesn't even have the decency to die then like everyone else inner b tch helps him limp outside and proceeds to tell him not to die while she runs for help cause he's like her only friend left alive now since when did these two become friends i don't think a frantic meeting in the woods where he tells you to head for the city qualifies as getting to know you time but whatever br br only watch this movie if there's nothing else own and you have nothing else to do with your time
<START> sorry to disagree with you but i found the series to be quite engaging so much so that i invested in the system and my own copies of the games this is mind you almost ten years after the initial release of 1 the graphics were ground breaking for their time the first graphics games for home systems the music and characters are all memorable and the games brought myself and my girlfriend dozens of hours of entertainment true the second game was better than the first and the third was perhaps lacking the of the second installment but all three offered different play and i enjoy them to this day by the way i'm old enough to remember when there were no video games whatsoever and tvs were black and white
<START> i've watched many short films in my day often i find them either too compressed throwing too much information at the viewer in the short amount of time they have to run too artsy or lacking a clear cut vision i can say none of these things about in this review i'll do my best to avoid any dramatic spoilers but i'll also assume that the reader understands that the theme of this film is brotherly incest br br as with any short film the story is fairly simple straightforward and easy to digest it's clear that the film attempts to shine a light one one of modern society's most deeply held taboos this film succeeds in every respect in the fifteen minutes of running time i found myself feeling a gamut of emotions with only a little dialog the viewer is rapidly pulled into the most personal moments and thoughts of these star crossed brothers br br from the opening scene set in their early childhood one can see the very close relationship the brothers have when the film progresses to the present day in the next scene the excellent acting and honest heartfelt performances remind the viewer that love can come in the most unexpected and harsh way as the relationship progresses any disgust the viewer may initially feel is quickly replaced by sympathy and emotional distress as the viewer suddenly realizes that there can be only one possible resolution and the aftermath of that resolution is heart rending br br anyone with an open mind would do well to watch this film and absorb its message if nothing else it boldly and honestly challenges the viewer to some of our deepest beliefs on the shame filled and secretive taboo of incest though the film is only fifteen minutes long it resonates in the viewer long after the credits roll this is perhaps my favorite short film i've ever seen i can't recommend it highly enough
<START> i love this movie i watched it over and over when i rented it from netflix it had a lot of substance and meaning for me i think many people will enjoy it i have read and seen quite a few lesbian stories over the years and am happy to say they are getting better and better in how they are presented they tend to have a more positive feel for the life style and feeling's of gay women its nice to see two women find themselves and be as happy as others in this society i think it is apparent that more and more movies with this theme will grace our theaters and tv screens many producers and directors are realizing that lesbians live very full and wholesome lives and that we have wonderful stories that should and can be seen by individuals as well as families without hesitation
