<START> i am really surprised that this film only has a rating of 6 4 as of the time i did this review while not exactly a great film i do think it's one of the best films dietrich did and it's a shame it isn't more highly regarded i think a lot of the reason i liked the film so much is that the usual silly dietrich persona as the Ã¼ber vamp isn't present and her role required her to actually act i just hate seeing film after film after film in the early days of her career where she seemed more like a caricature or clichÃ© than a real woman i don't necessarily blame dietrich for the silly vampish films she made in the 1930s audiences loved them and they did make her famous but here she showed she really could act after all just looking at her in films like morocco blonde venus and the blue angel who would have guessed that she was well cast to play a gypsy i was quite prepared to hate the film because of this casting decision but it worked she was pretty believable and a lot of fun to watch as well the film is essentially a vehicle just for ray milland and marlene dietrich the other supporting characters are very much secondary to the movie milland is a wanted spy in pre wwii germany and in his efforts to escape he stumbles upon a rather frisky lone gypsy dietrich who instantly takes him to be a fulfillment of prophecy in other words her new lover milland is quite stuffy but reluctantly agrees to travel in her wagon even putting on body paint and piercing his ears to make him look like a gypsy hence the title to the movie over time he slowly starts to realize that underneath her very uncouth exterior is quite a woman and romance slowly blossoms br br the film in a word is charming a nice romance with a good dose of comedy and fun just the sort of picture you wish hollywood still made also please note the performance of murvyn vye as zoltan he was very magnetic in the short time he was on film and i just loved his deep and beautiful voice br br finally a sad note to consider while the film is set in germany no mention is made of the upcoming gypsy holocaust during the war throughout german territory the nazis exterminated a huge percentage of gypsies and so the final nice ending to the film is a tad far fetched
<START> this wonderful film has never failed to move me the colour convincing cast and stunning scenery all make big contributions this production unlike the later remake by carlton is more impressionistic and presented more from the children's own perspective it on certain episodes from e charming story rather than trying to make a somewhat more documentary warts and all style that carlton adopts above all the superb musical score of the late johnny douglas underpins the story throughout adding extra emotional depth the net result is a truly formidable combination of sensory experiences that cumulatively present the poignant story of the railway children br br one uncomfortable factor for the viewer to ponder throughout this film is how things have changed since those times and in many ways for the worse yes maybe many of us no longer have to use outside toilets and travel in horse drawn carts but what about the quality of life in general consider the foul mouthed celebrities who now grace our tv screens their language is now apparently considered perfectly acceptable consider too the fragile here today gone tomorrow aspects of so many of today's plus all the single mothers whatever happened to that institution called marriage when people accepted each others' flaws but still remained together loving their children these details add extra when watching this marvellous film br br i hope that as generations pass children will still be able to enjoy this film not to mention certain adults
<START> i enjoy b movies i think bruce campbell is a very watchable actor i love how he delivers his lines 'evil dead 2 and of were great movies i liked time' however i don't know if i'll ever watch this movie again and i bought it now after saying that i bet the commentary tracks and special features will be worth watching this movie just has far too many holes for me to actually enjoy even as a cheapo movie first off ted raimi was annoying just flat out annoying there was nothing to his badly acted written character that hasn't been done better a thousand times before the directing sadly was sub par and the choice of some shots yikes i don't expect woody allen or james cameron here but campbell did not deliver br br i did not purchase this thinking it was going to be an oscar movie like hall' but still i'm disappointed i would have been happy with or 'the rhino brothers' i got much less by the end of the movie there were no scenes that popped out to me no dialogue that resonated within me even 'hostel' had a classic line for sake i do not recommend this movie
<START> this is by far the most awful movie i have ever watched i have never before rated a movie 1 out of 10 my advice is don't watch it this doesn't even classify as a movie br br you'd be better off sitting on the couch bored rather than watching this movie acting was terrible but what was worst by far was the storyline highly unlikely sequence of events which aren't even funny they are actually very lame and stupid very foolish choice by ashton kutcher and tara reid to act in this movie might even upset their careers a little br br when i walked into blockbuster the main focus was on this movie so i decided rent it i sincerely regret it br br once you're 10 or 20 minutes into the movie you could basically predict what was going to happen i was hoping it would get better but instead it got worse br br i am not exaggerating this the movie is terrible don't watch it hope this helps
<START> i've avoided seeing this film for some time but finally picked up a copy having been born too late to see 'hair' in its contemporary setting i have just been familiar with the uk and broadway cast recordings for many years and saw it on stage in the late 1980s where it looked a little creaky but still great fun br br the film it drops some of the songs the bed my conviction frank mills and cuts others walking in space however what is left is presented very well indeed all the singers and dancers are excellent and the key performers especially treat williams as berger beverley d'angelo as sheila john savage as claude are memorable br br as a hippy celebration and anthem 'hair' manages to be remain potent even in a film made ten years too late it was no longer the era of peace love and but the time of punk rock although watching this film now in the time of iraqi problems gives a new resonance to the vietnam issues of the 1960s br br milos forman who also made 'amadeus' did a good job on directing in its scope and feel it reminds me of norman 'jesus christ especially with the joy of the scene and the intimacy of to be hard' br br i really enjoyed this film and consider it a good representation of a musical born out of the first truly hedonistic era
<START> i have loved the book a little princess for most of my life and was very excited that there was a movie but i was appalled at this adaptation not only is the acting wooden and the plot a convoluted mish mash of various incidents in the book but the theme is all wrong the real theme of the story should be that a girl can be a princess only when she behaves like one as sara does when she gives 5 of her 6 buns to a beggar child even when she herself is very hungry the theme of the movie seems to be that all girls are princesses which cheapens sara's actions considerably and seems more like it should be written on a hallmark card than applied to this story br br there are many other things wrong with this movie too many to list but here are just a few of the larger ones this story should be set in britian in the mid 1800s not america during the first world war miss is harsh to sara from the start making her actions when sara is left penniless much less startling than they would be if she was syrupy sweet at the beginning as she is supposed to be nowhere is it mentioned that becky is black sara's father does not come back he is dead it is his closest friend and collaborator in the diamond mines who finds sara and restores her to her proper place in fact the diamond mines are not even mentioned at all though they are the source of sara's wealth br br all through everything that sara has faced she always acts like a princess giving what she can and forgiving those who hurt her she would never have called a snotty two faced bully such a thing is completely out of character for her and undermines the entire philosophy that she is to be well behaved no matter what br br this is by far the worst adaptation of a book to the screen that i have ever seen with the notable exceptions of ella enchanted and anne of green gables the continuing story the plot of the book is wonderful and skillfully written so i do not understand why the director felt that it needed to be changed to make it interesting i would suggest that anyone wishing to know this story should watch the 1987 version which is far superior or better still read the book it will be more worth your time than the hour and a half wasted on this version on the movie
<START> as i recall my family made a point to stay home on the night nichols was on mondays tuesdays nbc it was a superb vehicle for james garner very well written great ensemble cast his character very much like the support your local films retired gambler with mysterious past settles into town and has adventures every week in fact it seemed fairly obvious that it was the same character it was just a charmer of a tv show a sleeper like my world and welcome to it which may have been its contemporary i forget i dearly wish these shows would be made available on dvd it was just good tv perhaps county jr come close but only by a mile
<START> with pep squad receiving an average of 4 7 on imdb com no wonder steve this website so but the fact is that pep squad is a poorly crafted black comedy both words in quotation marks for a reason it's a movie full of over acting cherry beth's mother coupled with a couple of lethargic performances beth and julie's boyfriend a movie where you can follow cars from twenty feet away in a gaudy red jeep and never be noticed a movie chock full of not so appetizing cleavage and nudity shots that make you wonder does the director think this is funny or clever most of all the characters are so paper thin and poorly developed that the film becomes quite unpredictable but probably not on purpose pep squad can't decide whether to be a comedy or a drama or a satire patriotic music i get it the movie fails at being serious because the idea of killing for any school position this being prom queen crosses the line into insanity not to mention shots of flag burning and drive by shootings a poor attempt at being controversial and edgy and fails at being a comedy for all the forced and awkwardly placed jokes big butt mama funky black principal and excessive cussing delivered poorly by the principal cast watching the documentary making movies anywhere only made this film more cringe worthy with praise lauded towards it by the director and the director's father hmmmmmm not a black comedy or anything for that matter i guess kansas will have to wait
<START> spoiler alert don't read on unless you're prepared for some spoilers br br i think this film had a lot beneath its shell besides the apparent connections with oldboy and park other films an incestuous relation in this one really disturbed me and also the subtle erotic theme that hung around all the vampiric physical action br br the main actor kang ho song is terrific in the of the priest sang coincidentally sang means blood in some languages who truly loved tae ju played by ok bin kim their relationship reminds me a lot of that between martin sheen and sissy spacek in badlands where the girl appears psychopathic and the man is basically wrapped around her finger br br their relationship is one thing but the girl's mother is entirely different while moving she is stiff one dimensional and taut but paralysed she says all through not moving or through the wink of an eye br br park wook has really really mastered his cinematography in this film and owes a lot to stanley kubrick there are a whole lot of beautiful shots strewn throughout the film some for simple effects and some that require several glances and probably repeated views to fully catch br br the music is quite stock using mostly strings to accompany the main it's a very good thing that the character is as withdrawn as he is while he does very little and loses at that he seems to instead be a person who thinks a lot while his love interest says and does a lot her actions display very little thought behind it in my humble opinion br br all in all a very disturbing film that is not made for action which isn't even in the same dimension as most things that are about vampires these days it's magnificent and repellant at the same time
<START> think of it as an extreme form of detention without trial without commenting and taking a side on the us foreign policy the process of extraordinary rendition involves taking persons suspected of terrorist activities to a foreign country an opposite to an if you wish to a place where torture is not a crime but a means to illicit information instead of staining your soil with blood of potentially innocent parties you do so on foreign land where such tactics are accepted interrogation techniques br br naturally given the severity of the tactics and attempts at breaking down a person sometimes you would get what you want once you pass the resistance or get nothing or worst of all get a confession just because the mind has been broken to the point that the subject will agree to whatever you say it's an ugly process and what better way to do it when you're the champion human rights giving the nod to use whatever means necessary in the name of protecting more lives in an age where information is key to the battle against terror and doing so in a country where probably the rights record is questionable br br rendition is this year's syriana though in the run up to the new year we do have a number of political thriller contenders to take that crown with rendition first of all followed by the robert redford movie lions for lambs starring tom cruise and meryl streep again though now on the other side of the fence and the kingdom with jamie foxx and jennifer garner though this one would probably turn out to be more action driven directed by gavin hood who did and will be helming the new wolverine spin off rendition is a decent thriller with a top notch cast in a narrative that has been proved quite popular these days the split which provides for some ample differential perspectives to be presented through an ensemble cast br br anwar el omar a chemical engineer gets en route to going home under the orders of cia top brass corrine whitman meryl streep at a detention facility outside the us jake gyllenhaal's cia analyst douglas freeman oh so prophetic embarks on his very first interrogation session no doubt being thrust into a position that he didn't sign up for back home a very pregnant reese searches frantically for answers to her husband's disappearance and sought after an ex flame alan smith's peter sarsgaard assistance since he's working for senator hawkins alan arkin throw in j k a terrorist plot investigation and a budding forbidden love story between and you have quite a bit going on in a busy picture br br given a number of casts locations timelines and the likes rendition wasn't confusing at all and it plays out with deft handling of the material never quick to judge presenting ideas and thoughts from both sides of the equation every character has their own agenda and the unveiling of this agenda engages enough not to bore nor to confuse you and the best part of it all is how very truly they bow down to self preservation in different forms and ultimately in various lose lose situations unfortunately it kept you guessing as well did he or didn't he and constantly played with your mind as to whether anwar deserved what he's getting it utilized one extremely smart of hand which i didn't see coming until it's too late so there goes the credit though it did succumb to the usual stereotyping of terrorist militants and without spending much time in depth to explore their motivations br br perhaps it didn't find a need to given so many movies out there already touching base on this issue paradise now day night day night syriana even while it turned out to be rather one dimensional personal tragedy to strapping of bombs to become a suicide bomber i felt rendition did right in not providing any saccharine sweet ending that this fight against negative destructive ideology isn't something that can be addressed in a two hour movie and i'm glad it steered clear such fairy tale implausibilities br br what we have instead is a well crafted tale that sets its gun sights on the issue of rendition and probably capable enough to spark discussion once the lights come on on which camp you belong to do you support inflicting severe pain in interrogation yes or no this is the quintessential question of our time yes or no ok i'm already geared for lions for lambs
<START> tim robbins makes a wonderful film his wife susan sarandon gives a wonderful performance as the sister helen who wants to help sean penn who is of murder and who also will die of an injection 120 minutes of acting and touching scenes is what you get great acting and it is a film that gives something to think about br br susan sarandon deserves the oscar of 1995 best actress it is probably one of her greatest films ever br br i didn't see 'the will rock but i sure have to see more films of robbins br br rating 9 10 or 1 2 out of 4 go and see
<START> that pretty much sums it up corny macdowell's inability to act is at times painful and hurt must need money to take such muted roles but i still enjoyed it br br why in a single word travolta he is great in this movie still i can't give the movie too high a score but it certainly deserves better than it seems to be getting
<START> spoiler or two not that is matters br br two things stand out about this movie first is it's been titled both bruno and the dress code and if you've seen this movie you'll catch the irony in that br br second is it's addressing issues completely off the wall the adventures of a grade school cross dresser isn't something that there was a crying need for a movie about nor a topic that i think most people would be interested in shirley maclaine manages to walk around the issues of gender by tying bruno's desire to wear a dress to religion which probably opens up an even can of worms what was she thinking br br yes there's some humor and it's not directly offensive but the kind of unsettling feeling in the beginning just keeps on growing it doesn't do much except repeat the liberal mantra that different people should be accepted or maybe excepted no matter what br br which is fine but in order for people to live in a society everyone has to give a little to get along bruno doesn't just want to wear a dress he wants to show up looking like a miniature gladys knight on awards night and his final costume makes him resemble a cabbage patch cowgirl doll yet all the other kids dress and behave well like regular kids so what gives if it came down to it we all could declare ourselves special or different and behave any way we felt like and the result would be total chaos br br this accepting of people who are different is also pretty narrowly defined i doubt we will ever see a movie about a kid finding his true self and wanting to wear overalls hunt geese and go to tractor pulls and demanding everyone else just accept him as he is bruno is one stupid movie and a complete waste of time
<START> one comment said it wasn't a comedy mistake it was a delightful comedy of a period of history that doesn't lend itself easily to that genre very busy and active film from beginning to end often the shots out the window of the train or car were just beautiful an enjoyable way to spend a couple of hours in a theater all the french historical figures like charles de and and the some of the people involved in the french resistance were included in the script which might send those who are unfamiliar with the collapse of france under the german invasion might want to research the characters were engaging and the actors portraying them were excellent recommend it 9 out of 10
<START> low budget junk about bloodthirsty cultists in greece headed by peter cushing its up to priest donald pleasance to stop them crown international released this crap in 1978 and it was dog of the week on one of the episodes of sneak previews with gene siskel and roger ebert i forget which of the two dogged it but i see the point crappy movie has the worst peter cushing and donald pleasance performances i've ever seen there is a monster on the video box no such beast exists in the movie instead you get a statue but at least its correct woo hoo br br the cultists look like the klux klowns if a group could exist skip it
