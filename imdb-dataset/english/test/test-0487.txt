<START> the first movie at the fangoria festival in vegas and the most challenging it's not a movie for everyone a number of the films that followed used predictable classic horror formulas to tell predictable stories this picture seemed determined to do its own thing br br tom savini showed some comic chops as the over the top villain he dominated every scene he was in flipping his cape about like leslie neilson playing dracula it was great to hear his explanation after the film he had such a good sense of humor about the role br br i was glad i didn't have too many preconceptions going in because the movie offered a lot of surprises the story was funny and profane and unusual there was a lot of love lavished on the look most important it had a weird edge to it unlike many of the movies that followed and tried to use a similar classic horror style this was a movie that used its look for a purpose br br there were a lot of movies at the fangoria festival with bigger budgets but none that dared to be this different
<START> one of the last films directed by lionel barrymore ten cents a dance stars barbara stanwyck as the dance hall girl barbara in her sixth role stanwyck looks quite plain jane in this one and opens with her getting chewed out by the dance hall manager then along comes rich guy bradley carlton ricardo cortez who wants to sweep her off her feet cortez and stanwyck had made three films together in the 1930s then she meets eddie who's very different from the dashing carlton the writer jo swerling had worked on some biggies its a wonderful life guys and dolls and gone with the wind so i was surprised that the characters and script in this were so ordinary the story starts getting more interesting about halfway thru and is very similar to the bride walks out from 1936 also starring stanwyck t b w o is much more clever but also more tame due to on of the hays code
<START> most of other reactions by subscribers to this service were very apt although that some found it slow or ambiguous puzzled me rather than ambiguous it was complex and multi layered in its meanings one can see it as anti war because of the opening and closing scenes and the folly of pretended grandeur as how wonderful the cavalry men looked as they prepared for the great charge at contrasted with its so horrible and disturbing conclusion when we see the bloody uniforms the boyish dead etc but chiefly i see the film as about a moral man in an immoral society at the end chabert chooses retreat from the corrupt post napoleonic french world and opts for the simple pleasures provided by who himself is saved by his recognition of chabert's basic decency and the morality of his choice of white bread cheese some wine and tobacco over the riches he leaves to his wife and her and society's dishonor in her case we can see the film as also feminist in the position of women at that time in which the only weapons mme chabert has are her charm beauty wiles and ultimately money
<START> alfred hitchcock's more assured telling of a film he made twenty one years earlier is infinitely superior to the original hitchcock said himself that his first version was the work of an amateur and although it certainly isn't a bad film he does appear to be right that being said this remake although definitely better still isn't among hitchcock's best work that's certainly not to say that it isn't good it's just more than a little overindulgent and that drags it down hitchcock seems all too keen to drag certain elements out and these are parts of the film that aren't entirely relevant to the plot which can become annoying some of these dragged out sequences such as the one that sees james stewart and doris day eating in a moroccan restaurant are good because it helps establish the different culture that our american protagonists have found themselves in but for every restaurant scene there's an opera sequence and it's the latter that make the film worse br br the plot follows a middle aged doctor and his wife that go to morocco for a holiday with their young son while there they meet a french man on the bus and another middle aged couple in a restaurant however things go awry when the french man dies from a knife in the back shortly after whispering something to the doctor the holiday then turns into a full blown nightmare when the couple's son is kidnapped which causes them to cut it short and go to london in order to try and find him the film has a very potent degree of paranoia about it and it manages to hold this all the way through in fact i would even go as far as to say that this is the most paranoid film that hitchcock ever made like most of hitchcock's films this one is very thrilling and keeps you on the edge of your seat for almost the entire duration with only the aforementioned opera sequence standing out as a moment in which the tension is diffused there is also more than a little humour in the movie which gives lighthearted relief to the morbid goings on and actually works quite well br br the original version of this story was lent excellent support by the fantastic peter lorre this film doesn't benefit from his presence unfortunately but that is made up for by performances from the amazing james stewart and doris day james stewart is a man that is always going to be a contender for the actor of all time' crown his collaborations with hitchcock all feature mesmerising performances from him and this one is no different although his best performance remains the one in mr smith goes to washington stewart conveys all the courage conviction and heartbreak of a man that has lost his child and would do anything to get him back brilliantly in fact that's one of the best things about this film you are really able to feel for the couple's loss throughout and that serves in making it all the more thrilling doris day on the other hand is a rather strange casting choice for this movie she's definitely a good actress but she's more associated with musicals and seeing her in a thriller is rather odd even if she does get to flex her vocal chords a little br br as i've mentioned this is not hitchcock's best film but there's much to enjoy about it and although i'd recommend many hitchcock films before recommending this one i'll definitely give it two thumbs up as well
<START> you just need to see this as a poorly executed anti abortion propaganda and you will realize just how bad it really is the main message of this movie is that even the sickest of persons can't commit an abortion if you ask that's not a long way away from blowing up abortion so this guy wants to kill some poor girl but he has to convince her to do an abortion first what a load of crap and the worst part is that he has an convincing argument bringing a child into a loveless environment but that is supposed to be dismissed because he's a freak anyway and the part with the bible pushers first they throw this girl out just because she explains someone stole her money that rule must be in the bible somewhere and then on the end they are some sort of angel like deus ex machina delivering the killer from evil by harassing him on his front yard come on other include a very confusing scenario and i don't mean in a good way so this guy is just some psycho why because his mother fed his some liver once and i don't know about the rest of you but he seemed like the nicest person in the world throughout the whole move even though he was a wearing girlie clothes stealing money and taping girls in his car if you forget the idiot story this movie has a really great cinematography and bob hoskins was really great and it has one of those funny little english cars in it if it was actually about some psycho killer i'd give it a 7 at least
<START> totally brain dead actioner made in the philippines this belongs to the mode of filipino movies which tried to pass themselves as american films on the international market after a rather dull beginning the movie takes off and never disappoints again it is actually a rip off of the worst movies chuck norris ever made an american prisoner in vietnam is brainwashed by the soviets who implant a in his brain so he is programmed to kill the pope then the president of the usa one of his old buddies played by b movie stalwart max thayer is sent to stop him utterly ridiculous action scenes putrid acting nick nicholson's performance as the evil soviet commander is a must see and implausible plot make up for one of the cheesiest action pictures ever bestowed in the general public
<START> ok finally a horror film that's done well as soon as i heard the music i knew that some effort had been made in creating what i consider to be an almost masterpiece of good zombies whores booze grave snatching and a lot more a great cast well acted well directed well written there was hardly a flaw even the american actors with irish english accents really pulled it off i thought that the actor larry fessenden looked familiar to me it was that missing tooth finally i realized that this guy was the lead in habit a film about vampires in nyc i thought he was excellent in that role now i'm wondering if he's an american or not his accent was so convincing in i sell that i thought he had to have grown up in the emerald isle not in the us well apparently he's a born and raised new yorker a great actor really made the role his own in this movie nothing beats a horror flick set in early 19th century europe like the old hammer flicks i encourage anyone that wants to have a great time to watch this well crafted movie
<START> the 1973 day of the directed by fred zinnemann from the frederick forsyth novel while not a masterpiece in the general scheme of things was nevertheless quite an above average thriller written and carried out with considerable panache wit and style it remains a pleasure to rent and watch now and then br br in adapting that for the 1997 the it seems that at every turn the writers and director made the worst possible choice making it all quite leaden overdone unsurprising unsexy and if we put together a catalog of all the specifics that went into this movie big and small i could give you a mini essay for each topic on how the 1997 adaptation ed up br br item the weapon br br in the original there is considerable intrigue over how the assassin is going to smuggle it onto the scene how he intends to disguise it and why it needs custom work from his underground craftsmen in the remake they apparently thought that today's action flick raised audiences wouldn't tolerate a small rifle whose point is precision and would demand the lugubrious off the black market shelf machine gun which needs a to transport it and whose point is to shout macho the whole involved and interesting business about disguising its components has been reduced to showing us repeatedly like this is a difficult point to follow that the joystick for his absurdly high tech remote control system has been in his pocket as a pen br br item the conspirators and motive br br without resorting to dry lecture the original still manages to give us a good understanding of the historical situation of the noirs the french algerian who could not accept that the century was moving away from colonialism and formed the view that de had betrayed them this gives the whole plot some historical weight the remake seems to leave it as a gangland shootout revenge story minimally spicing it up by making them russian gangsters note please that i'm not opposed to updating they could have done this intelligently and come up with something more current but non trivial certainly russia and the rest of ex ussr have been through huge changes of late and an updated story could have been situated there in a way that would make us feel that it matters br br item the relationship of the assassin on the run and the police hunting him down and the complex steering of the viewer's sympathies from the bad guy to the good guy br br above i hesitated somewhat at calling the original a masterpiece overall but in this aspect it really was one we follow along with the assassin for much of the first portions of the film and having seen his cleverness and resourcefulness we begin to admire him and not want to see his plan thwarted or see him caught at least not too soon then we meet the policeman who gets pushed into heading up the investigation protection efforts and bit by bit we take to him and see he is not the sad sack his domestic troubles may have suggested by the time it matters we have been won over to his side br br in the remake perhaps poitier could have handled that sort of development but gere sure can't and the absurd 48 hours derived gimmick of the con brought out to help the police should have been left in those comedies where it came from br br the remake has the assassin and the assassin hunter talk about how they 're like players above a chessboard communicating indirectly via their moves and only able to infer what the other is like that was achieved superbly in the original but in the remake in fact they're brought into face to face confrontation way too soon so they can grimace at each other bloody the place up and go through some fairly standard chase scenes br br item photography and scenery br br the remake does have some nice images particularly in snowy finland in the opening section but the washington d c metro cannot really compete with the streets of paris for interesting perspectives and bystander faces Â  Â 
<START> i don't cry easily over movies but i have to admit this one brought me to tears although i am not a ms streep fan her performance was excellent the title defines in a sentence what a mother's love is for the first hour i didn't like any of the characters but that changed as the movie went on the movie also explained why certain marriages last even though there are obstacles a must see film
<START> i know what you're saying oh man is not scary but this movie goes beyond alot more than a maniacal behind it tells the story of a mother and her daughter who is oddly attached to her doll pinnochio who seems to talk to her the only weird thing is that noone else can hear the doll except her in the end is shocking revelation that as did i will shock you watch it give it a try
<START> this has become one of my favorite movies and certainly one of the best westerns i have ever seen having a soft spot for the genre westerns are Â or were since they are no longer made very often Â morality plays that too often have been denigrated by critics with intellectual pretensions i purchased the dvd sight unseen because i had read enough about william s hart's work much of which he wrote and directed to pique my interest and thought i should have at least one of his films in my video collection br br i must admit that i approached the actual viewing with some trepidation my previous experiences with silent cinema classics had left me feeling let down chaney's the phantom of the opera griffith's birth of a nation and fairbanks' the mark of zorro were fine but not nearly as good as their reputations would lead one to expect they were either too long or too theatrical or both br br the toll gate however emerged as a pleasant surprise br br it is a story told in a simple and straightforward manner black played by hart leader of a notoriously successful outlaw gang thinks the time has come for group to disband before its luck runs out he is however opposed by his chief lieutenant jordan who them all into one last holdup by promising great wealth but leads them into a trap in which he is complicit everyone is killed except who is taken prisoner when his captors recognize him as the man who once saved a number of soldiers and settlers by warning an outpost of an impending indian attack they allow him to escape free he tries to find honest work but is snubbed and ridiculed and ultimately must rob again to survive soon he is pursued not only by the sheriff's posse but also by jordan now prospering from the reward money he has collected and his henchmen his flight leads him to a remote cabin inhabited by a single mother and her little son after some initial misgivings they take him into their hearts sees a chance for a new life but with the posse and jordan closing in realizes that this may not be possible br br hart was the first great western star and the first to inject realism into the genre as one of the pioneers of movie making he created many of the characters and situations that have become clichÃ© in westerns for more than ninety years what keeps his movies interesting however was his ability to go beyond the clichÃ© perhaps his imitators did not go far enough so that the material appears fresh and innovative even now three such instances in the toll gate illustrate this br br 1 in one scene his character shoots into a crowd in an attempt to kill jordan and kills a bystander instead a subsequent close up shows that he is clearly frustrated the frustration however comes not from the fact that he has gunned down a man who had hitherto caused him no harm but that he missed his intended target br br 2 in another as he flees from the posse his borrowed horse steps into a gopher hole and breaks a leg hart pulls out his gun to put the animal out of its misery but before pulling the trigger gives his head a sad loving pat as if to say farewell to an old friend br br 3 and finally after he has strangled jordan and thrown his body over a cliff he returns to retrieve his guns and spots his pistol lying on the ground nearby he steps forward and gives it a swift kick before mounting his horse it is a simple gesture but it underscores the deep loathing he feels for the man who betrayed him and his comrades br br and i love the title the toll gate it is allegorical in its implication that a man cannot begin a new life until he has paid for the sins of his old one payment comes in the form of sacrifice today's more sophisticated audiences may not buy into that sentiment entirely but it can still work on you if you let it br br viewers who like their videos in pristine condition will undoubtedly object to the dvd's picture quality especially the badly deteriorated final reel i don't mind at all that a copy of this 1920 movie even exists at all is a miracle since prints of so many other silent movies have been lost if you bear that in mind and look upon the film as a piece of history its visual flaws are not that difficult to accept br br william s hart was born in 1870 in new york but grew up in the minnesota and wisconsin where he learned to speak sioux and indian sign language he counted wyatt earp and bat masterson among his friends and collected remington paintings so his knowledge of the west was first hand if his vision seems overly romanticized by today's standards it is nevertheless rooted far closer to reality than the spaghetti westerns of the '60s and '70s and the revisionist works that followed both the star and his films are overdue for re evaluation
<START> let me first off say that i am a believer of ghosts and i do indeed know they exist i have had enough experiences with them to know they are there br br what i hate is the people who bring the bible and religion into all of this people forget there is more than one bible thousands of religions and beliefs and different ways to interpret what is said in the bible not everyone believes in god and not everyone believes in stereo typical religion br br religion does not make everything fact one of the things i should mention in the bible that many do not know is that even the most rampant bible thumper is breaking the very rules written within you are supposed to never wear more than one fabric at one time slavery is ok and you may murder your neighbor under certain circumstances none of this oh that was the old testament and now we have the new testament if the bible is the word of god and cannot be changed there should be no changes or versions religion is full of misinterpretations mixed facts and people who so blindly follow it that there is no other way the excuses these said blind followers use are either pathetic or they themselves cannot explain the discrepancies properly and instead use excuses handed down to them from either their pastor or teacher br br but anyhow onto the review i am a decent fan of ghost hunters and when i heard this show was coming soon i was pretty excited and thought it had some potential as much as i like watching ghost hunters i do not like some of their members and i do not like the way they can dismiss a place as being haunted yet cannot explain anything that is going on just because your investigation equipment does not pick it up does not mean the camera filming the show did not i am glad they are skeptical but it's like they do not understand that just because you did not get anything on your recorder and film does not make the place haunted or not if ghosts were that easy to capture it would be known as a fact not a belief it's more of a right place at the right time kind of thing as well as if there is something there what makes you think it's going to perform for you this show is kind of silly it's usually boring and there is lots of talk lots of psychics yet hardly anything happens the main guy's filtered narration is usually either boring to listen to or is basically not needed br br also the reliance on psychics is too abundant as i believe very few of them are actually gifted silvia brown is one i definitely believe in but most are sometimes hard to believe br br i really wanted to like this show but of the few i have seen i have yet to be terribly impressed
<START> first of all ed wood jr is not the worst director ever plan 9 from outer space not withstanding coleman francis deserves that title i present exhibit b glen or glenda br br the first half of the movie consists of a surprisingly thoughtful exploration of especially since it was made in 1953 the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well br br this is not to say the movie doesn't have problems bela lugosi was totally extraneous odd lines poor bela looked like even he wasn't sure what was happening at times the acting was wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie the long dream sequence that makes up the middle of the film was totally bizarre more like a vaguely menacing stag film than a dream sequence the alan ann story the supposed original focus of the film has a tacked on quality about it br br no ed wood jr is not the worst director ever he was able at least for part of this movie to make an earnest social statement when coleman francis tried to do that in night train to mundo fine aka red zone cuba it just ended in chaos glen or glenda is at least watchable without robot help
<START> nothing but the director's juvenile fantasy come to life this 'movie' is nothing more than an excuse for the director actor to play kissy face with an attractive young woman who would otherwise never give him the time of day br br the plot is simple the direction is nonexistent and the movie drags while the actor director writer narrator narrates don't be fooled by the 'x' rating there is no nudity and minimal gore
<START> to qualify my use of realistic in the summary not many old folks i know go around pretending to be famous blind people etc nor have i ever been elderly those minor issues out of the way the relationships between the characters in this film and the emotions expressed therein were completely realistic and genuine in fact though we're not yet 30 i could see many characteristics of my relationship with my wife in the interactions between the main character and his wife for those that don't die young there's a great line in the movie about this when the two best friends are talking about dying young and one of them says and i'm paraphrasing we missed our chance we'll just have to stick it out we'll all be where these characters are some day i know many movie goers would prefer to be swept away from reality as opposed to being faced with it but even they might enjoy the sweet reminder of our mortality and the importance of living life to the fullest that this film is
