<START> i can just picture how this movie came to be br br so how else can we screw up our careers br br i know let's take a film that was wildly successful and make a sequel out of it br br perfect we'll get b grade actors who have half the charisma and want only 10 of carrey's original salary we'll save millions and rake in a massive profit never mind the fact nobody wants to see a second rate sequel with none of the original actors that made it popular in the first place we as executives still honestly believe a movie was popular based on the name and story not the actors who made it so in the first place br br brilliant let's put a massive budget and get the cheapest actors we can find br br and really that's what son of the mask can be described as just a simple b grade movie that attempts to suck the life out of it's original classic br br nevertheless if the movie didn't contain the words the mask or anything to do with the mask it would be a nice kids movie for all it's massive flaws and horrible acting this really will appeal to kids it's a good natured flick that really wants to scream out like me but only those 8 and younger will truly enjoy it br br jamie kennedy is the only worthwhile mention in this movie he clearly is trying to make the material work playing the desperate dad but the script is so poor the only thing that spews out that is worthwhile was my drink after seeing this the character of loki also deserves a mention as he was the most enjoyable character and really one of the only reasons for older adults to see this film it's too bad the character is wasted on this film i would have really liked to have seen the character take on the true mask instead we are reduced to fart jokes and toilet humor near the end br br the plot is so much by the books i won't bother to mention it here it's all so clearly obvious that even a disney exec would be green with envy br br save your money this one is heading to dvd in three months from the looks of it shame on the studios for once again smearing a decent film with a horrible sequel didn't dumb and dumberer teach them anything
<START> one of the worst movies i've ever seen absolutely awful poor acting poor story there isn't one redeeming quality about this movie to recommend amistad is much better avoid this movie like the plague
<START> a girl begins to notice that people in her small town are becoming fascinated by anything that is shaped like a spiral soon the fascination turns to obsession and things get deadly while i won't say that was an excellent film i will say that it was unlike anything i've seen before throughout my viewing i felt like i was watching a cartoon there are funny segues between scenes and characters with digitally enhanced eyes later i found out the film is an adaptation of a manga comic so this makes sense however just when you think you are watching something that could be a kid's movie you are bombarded with nasty and gory visuals the story often lags and the ending is somewhat abrupt and seemed anti climactic at the time but in retrospect i appreciate it more for its originality my rating 7 10
<START> superb and charming justin henry is beautiful as a out and mischievous howard lead singer for the top ten hit making band the turtles the real magic is the titular sequence with an academy award worthy turn by royale a performance that completely captures the mystical and yet down to earth jimi hendrix not many films unbelievably so can find the essence of a special moment in a life and times i'd like to see this available at any home video retail outlet without any hassle uh what's the deal br br thanks eddie a worthy addition to the history of the psychedelic sixties a definite twinkle in the mind's eye
<START> some will say this movie is a guilty pleasure i loved this flick but i don't feel guilty about it you can tell the whole cast and crew had fun making this movie but jack frost 2 won't go over well with some people right from the beginning you can tell this movie will be cheesy and it definitely has an amateurish look to it well if you get the privilege to watch this movie after watching it remember that jack frost 2 revenge of the mutant killer snowman is a pleasure not a guilty pleasure now because i can't fill up ten lines heres some great scenes br br spoilers br br the three women on the beach had great deaths the first one had jack in a tree trying to drop icicles on one of them he kept missing so he dropped an anvil on her the next woman fell on a bed of icicles the last one was stabbed in the eyes with tongs br br the other great one was where two surfers stoners are hanging out near a frozen pole one of them gets their tongue stuck on it of course jack frost pulls him back a rips his tongue off while saying tongue a dude well you have to see it for yourself br br and of course the snowball children kicked ass br br end spoilers br br infinity stars
<START> after slightly over 50 years of avid film watching i've come up with some simple rules for making good movies br br 1 introduce your main characters early certainly within the first half hour 2 keep your characters to a minimum if adapting a novel combine characteristics and actions of minor characters br br into one person 3 make sure your characters actions have credibility if necessary create additional scenes to establish motivation 4 keep the action clear violence does not have to be explicit but it must not be confusing either 5 get the best music money can buy frequently it matters more than acting photography etc 6 usually if a movie isn't very good within the first 10 minutes it's not going to get any better br br cannon for is a textbook example of what happens when these simple rules are not followed elmer bernstein's score is one of the worst i've ever heard in a modestly budgeted movie this is altogether surprising considering bernstein's credentials man with the golden arm ' the magnificent seven ' the great escape ' sons of katie elder' paul direction is lackluster and confusing performances vary from very good don gordon peter duel to terrible raf giovanna ralli gabriele with the usually reliable george peppard falling somewhere in the middle this should not be surprising considering the mediocre direction and amateurish script which breaks rules 1 2 and 3 br br don't waste your time i give cannon for a 3'
<START> to think this film was made the year i was born to think people are still having their constitutional rights taken away now in the name of homeland security to think this movie was intentionally banned from the american public punishment park addresses the political divide in the united states better than any movie i've ever seen had it been more widely seen would it have changed anything a movie like this is so polarizing it has the potential to cause riots it shakes you up and forces you to take sides it makes you face the issue are you for the people's right of dissent in a time of war or for the constitution being compromised in the name of national security the protagonists are forced by the government to race to the american flag in a game that undermines the very ideals the flag stands for the acting is totally convincing so much so i can't see any acting going on here at all if this is a scripted documentary it's more convincing than any reality show on television today punishment park is possibly the most important film ever made it really makes you think
<START> let me start of by saying that i never wanted to see this movie in the first place i had to watch it one day and i figured that i guess i can lighten up and enjoy it for what it is and it might turn out to be entertaining what i got going in with that expectation was one of the worst movies i have ever seen bar none first of all there was nothing humorous in the least bit the creators expected humor to be laughable passable if they include sarcasm in every line that comes out of mouth and use scene after scene of bland played out aspects to charm the audiences light hearted side while still making them ooh and ah for more with boring action scenes and insipid lackluster performances that made me want to yell at everyone in the audience that was enjoying it the acting was dull the humor was tedious and the characters plot felt like they spent about 10 minutes creating their entire personalities which gave the uninspiring actors actresses no range on how to portray their characters with the least bit of depth this movie is plain and simply awful in every field and really only kids under the age of 10 will be able to enjoy it which even though that's what age range it was aimed at that does not excuse it for being so poorly daft and causing me to feel so parents spend your money on up wall e the chronicles the water horse or hotel for dogs for the best recent family kids flicks or even alvin and the chipmunks is better than this filth
<START> wow even american idol and so you think you can dance have more adult stuff now than wwe at least the auditions has a number of people abusing the judges and here is wwe plodding with one of the worst moves in tv history by changing itself into pg now when i switch sometimes to see what's going on this is what i get br br 1 the ugly midget sharing his space with the main for apparently no reason except for thrilling the young fans and of course beating chavo guerrero a capable wrestler in every match br br 2 a guest host every week to spoil the of fun which was otherwise present all these host are cheap b grade celebs trying to catapult to fame again by cracking horrendous 5 year old jokes and making silly references br br 3 time and a female wrestler forgot her name most probably eve giving lessons on various street words sob which are neither street nor cool they were fun before stealing stuff and being loud mouths br br 4 the divas are clad in unwatchable outfits tying their best to look sexy smart and powerful by the way i hate this catchphrase remember when torrie trish and sable were there those were the times plus these divas are bad wrestlers which adds to the misery i have seen some old matches of wwe in vintage collection and the divas over there were professional not amateur br br 5 pg move restricts so many things almost no blood during matches dx being terribly irritating john cena doing even more of his patriotism act crowd containing many children who are so annoying almost no heels etc br br 6 and yeah why keep so often one in every month have they lost it no actual feud or rivalry is ever created and the ones that are done look fake and just till the ppv gets over ones br br 7 vintage michael cole and a few of his quotes br br ladies and gentlemen you are watching the longest running television show in history every week br br the brutal and vicious assault by he doesn't use it for anyone else randy orton legacy br br a vicious attack on stephanie triple h's husband br br wwe is now almost towards its demise hope vince gets up from his slumber and does something bring back the tv 14 or attitude era 2 out of 10 for the current state of wwe
<START> i mostly rented this movie to see shannon elizabeth she played well in this movie but the plot sucked the movie wasn't really about anything just about trying to stay single after making a pact when one of jerry o' connell's friends gets married the other friends put together this money and who's ever last to get married get's the money 10 000 from all his friends anyway the movie just try to follow through by making no since and trying to make it more funny then making since i'm glad i only paid 50 for this movie it really wasn't good at all i rated it out of 10 stars
<START> curse of the forty doesn't really deserve a long and detailed review so i'll just make some random observations about it br br cool opening credits br br no plot br br is there anyone who's ever seen a horror film before and can't guess within the first 20 minutes who will survive and who will not among this group of walking stereotypes br br hey that newcomer alexandra ford is pretty hot br br richard lynch made up to look about 100 years old and john phillip law have fun tongue in cheek cameos br br karen black has a bigger role but she's not fun she's rather embarrassing br br martin kove is on screen for about 40 seconds but still got his name on the video cover did they pay him for this appearance or was it the other way around br br i hate cheap computer generated effects in horror films br br 1 2 out of 4
<START> i got a chance to talk with the co creator rebecca at the 2002 high falls film festival in rochester ny she said that her style is to be completely open and uninhibited in filmmaking but was very happy to be so severely constrained in the tight quarters of the group home the narrow hallways and small rooms were expertly shot with a realism that would have been lost with more controlled and deliberate camera work br br sister helen herself is a remarkable character coming from tragedy in her own life to being an unusual combination of caring tough and street smart the way the film introduces us to her past is excellent spending only a few carefully selected minutes sprinkled throughout br br in all i can't begin to correctly heap on praise for this film it really is a treasure of cinema and the subject a treasure of humanity
<START> this film's premise seems to be that the passing of the world war 2 generation in america with its apple pie phoniness and hypocritical morality was a terrible tragedy those awful hippies ruined everything apparently br br what holds the film together are the excellent performances particularly lemmon's which is truly remarkable otherwise we have a boring slice of life drama just over 24 hours of jack's life with pretensions br br i found it a chore to sit through
<START> the plot is somewhat original and all the actors did their job pretty well there is a plenty of comic relief too some things do not make a lot of sense e g the first chase scene why would the heroine not just hide somewhere and wait until the baddies leave the russians actually speak russian without accent but the cars are extremely strange with models spanning like 50 years and so the place seems weirdly out of time overall if you like thrillers you will probably like this one as well
<START> here on earth is a surprising beautiful romantic tale about samantha who has both boy problems and health problems as her love for her current boyfriend jasper fades away her love for kelley blooms like a new spring flower br br i found this movie very touching very warm very romantic and touching i enjoyed every bit of this movie and that's pretty rare i highly do recommend this movie to all movie lovers this is one film you don't want to miss d br br by the way if you're a very sentimental person who easily cries while watching movies bring tissues on the other hand it was a really really good movie very romantic and surprisingly good d br br
