<START> it is a risky business to film such a lavish production of the merchant of venice it could be a stodgy wooden period piece or it could be laughable for its excesses this version is neither while i am not completely sold by al very restrained shylock he does give a competent and honorable performance jeremy antonio is as always with his tortured self roles riveting some of the lesser roles seemed to be a little to much in the spirit of boisterous fun a boy's own adventure story but the central plot is efficiently and sympathetically moved forward through the film br br it goes without saying that the location shots costumes and interiors were breathtaking almost to the point of distraction br br one thing on which i do not wish to comment on is the anti content of the play the film is as sympathetic to the predicament of the jews as possible while still portraying shylock as the instrument of his own self destruction it is a sad comment that four centuries later the director of this film found it necessary to comment on his nuanced view before the premiere screening at the toronto film fest br br this is a beautiful film and i look forward to several viewings
<START> a bumbling error at the ministry of education results in boys school having to share with st school for girls this the respective head teachers of each school and leads to all manner of chaotic goings on however the two are forced to come to an uneasy alliance in the hope of major trouble br br the happiest days of your life is based on the john dighton play from 1948 with dighton writing the part of headmistress specifically for margaret rutherford replacing george howe from the play in the role of headmaster pond is alastair sim and here in lies the crowning glory of this filmic adaptation sim rutherford are perfectly wonderful bouncing off each other to keep what is basically a one joke movie highly entertaining directed by the gifted frank and produced by the equally adroit sidney the happiest days of your life is a quintessentially british movie obviously a precursor to the st trinians franchise the film entertains the children with it's high jinks clash of the sexes heart whilst tickling the watching adults with its very saucy undercurrent thankfully the chaotic ending cements all that has gone before it to leave this particular viewer with a grin as wide as rail station great fun 8 10
<START> i was a bit surprised to see all of the hate comments on here sure it's not the best kid's show but don't people stop despising barney this much after the fifth grade br br okay everyone hates barney okay i think his voice and songs are annoying okay he's kinda creepy and strange i'm fourteen years old so i know well enough but here's the thing kids they love this show br br when i was a little kiddie of two or three my parents spent more time chasing me around the house than they did anything else nothing could hold my attention for more than ten minutes face it that's how toddlers are even the most patient ones can't sit still long enough to give their parents a break there's too much to do and see and explore too much trouble to get into br br and then came barney i don't know exactly what it is about the purple dinosaur that's so amusing to children but they sure do love it i know i did i was hooked on the show and wanted to watch it over and over yes the songs kind of drove my parents nuts but to be able to watch their kids learning and being excited over something that can really hold their attention span it's worth it i learned my and the magic words and brushing your teeth i'd grown out of it by five or six of course but by that point at least i was a little more patient and gave my parents a break br br my nieces and nephew all went through the barney stage growing up much to their mother's delight i know what keeps barney on the air he entertains of course there's big bird ernie and oscar and they're great too but at the toddler stage it seems that more kids prefer the big singing dinosaur and that's enough for me
<START> i found super troopers only mildly amusing at best seemed like a glorified police academy ripoff to me and i rented this movie in hopes of it being better it wasn't br br the writing is absolutely horrible and the pacing of this film is even worse it doesn't feel like a whole lot happens in this film or that it really gives us a reason to give a damn about any of the characters br br the actor who plays felix is totally uninspired though possibly due in part to the dialogue he had to work with in short this movie just went wrong in so many places br br i get the impression that since films like clerks independent filmmakers seem to think that they can make movies like this with long rambling scenes of dialogue where characters are trying to be funny but where dialogue in clerks pushes the story forward in this movie it hopelessly weighs it down films are supposed to have a decent balance of action and dialogue and as tempting as it is for filmmakers to try to have tons of snappy funny dialogue it just doesn't always work especially if they're not that good at writing dialogue i hate to say it but even extreme heist was more interesting than this movie and that movie was so low budget it was shot on video
<START> i go to the movies to be entertained i was very entertained by the first film in this series the davinci code it had plenty of twists and turns throughout to keep me very interested angels and demons is no different if you enjoyed the davinci code then you will undoubtedly enjoy this movie as well angels and demons is made pretty much with the exact same style as the previous film but faster paced which i liked ron howard kept me glued to my seat for the full two hours without boring me one bit br br what i really liked about this movie was that even though it is obviously fictitious they leave enough real history to make it seem very believable if there is one thing that i didn't like about this movie it is that the plot itself is very unbelievable don't want to give any spoilers but hey it's a movie i was entertained throughout the whole thing and was very satisfied with what i saw
<START> cheers to all the wonderful fans of this film that have not only seen and appreciate it but based on the many literate comments actually get it i for one have always considered paul tempest a on the shakespeare play of the same name as has been noted in a few of the other reviews here on the other hand if you're looking for a more straightforward adaptation of the play you should look elsewhere as an experiment however it succeeds just spectacularly charming moving funny sad dramatic it's all of that and much more cast locations script music are just fantastic cassavetes and rowland were never better susan sarandon's turn more than hinted at the great work to come from her in the future molly ringwald makes her film debut memorable and you just have to love raul julia's performance he steals the show in several scenes what's more the always great cassavetes was confident and assured enough a performer to have let him a study on what the thematic elements of shakespeare's classic might be life if updated into more modern times tempest burns brilliantly
<START> this movie changed the art of film making telling a complex story in a powerful new way the film mixes brutal realism with fantasy intercutting a modern war with strange scenes full of technicolour smoke the film uses music not as a score laid in later but as a practical part of the scene playing from speakers radios etc coppola uses a classic piece of literature as inspiration taking scenes and characters and putting them into entirely different surroundings that is a tricky and brave thing to do then he takes a superstar brando pays him a fortune and films him so that you can barely see his face the pure guts that such a move requires is astounding and it works beautifully this movie belongs in the top ten
<START> tales from the crapper is gory disgusting tasteless offensive lowbrow and scatological but that's ok i was prepared for all that from my previous troma experiences what i wasn't prepared for is that it's also witless unfunny and boring very little of the genuine anarchic spirit of films like class of high has remained intact in its place we get endless fart jokes to the point where you start wondering if lloyd kaufman is going senile thinking that adults find loud farting so darn hilarious and a cynical shameless exploitation of the viewer who is essentially investing time and money to see a film that even kaufman himself seems to know should never have been released in the first place oh yes there is plenty of female nudity on display but let's face it the average porn film probably offers a better storyline higher production values funnier humor and above all more respect for its intended viewer than this atrocity br br p s kelly powers aka lorraine the blonde lesbian student in the how to make your own movie segment is one of the most beautiful women i have ever seen
<START> i fail to see how anyone who has actually read the m falco mysteries could make such a mockery of them an aussie has no business in ancient rome nothing of the books is in this film except the setting and characters and they are wasted on a plot thin enough through which to read the silly script kevin connor and lee have a lot of nerve displaying their names in the credits
<START> if you don't like bad acting poor editing ridiculous dialog and unbelievable characters you will hate this movie if you like all of the above that is to say if you are a lynch fan then you will love mulholland drive this is quite possibly the worst film to be rated above an 7 0 on imdb br br outside of naomi watts work you will be hard pressed to find any competent acting in mulholland dr the other female lead went to the hide your face with your hands when you don't have the chops school of acting given the script they had to work with it's a wonder all of the actors weren't holding their heads in their hands br br characters wander in and out of the film that do nothing to advance the storyline you have a hitman a mysterious cowboy an adulterous wife and her cliche'd poolman lover a mafioso type figure sitting in a darkened room who speaks through an external voice box and a host of others too numerous and tedious to mention suffice it to say that they manage to do little more than fill up screen time br br this isn't so bad however in that it distracts the viewer from the fact that the movie has no discernable plot you will wait and wait for for all of the loose threads to come together and in the end you will be abysmally disappointed the hardest thing for a writer to do is to bring everything together in a believable fashion at the end of a movie in a way that leaves everyone feeling fulfilled the easiest thing for a writer to do is to create a lot of odd characters and put them in scenes that are not connected to the movie as a whole and then to take what few coherent threads there are and jumble them up at the end for the sake of surprise guess which way lynch goes surprise br br you know you have a bad script when you have to resort to dream sequences to make any sense out of it after all a dream sequence covers all sins dreams don't have to make sense anything can happen in a dream br br the editing is similarly disjointed let's just say good editing does not call attention to itself much of the way this film is edited seems to be done for the sole purpose of calling attention to the editing look at me you can see my editing aren't i a genius uh well no this movie has all of the earmarks of the worst and most self indulgent french films br br so why is this movie so popular my theory is that it is just another sign of the decay of our culture melodies are hard to compose so let's listen to rap plots are hard to follow so let's dispense with them pictures are difficult to paint so let's pee in a cup and stick a crucifix in it these are the symptoms of our times and mulholland drive is just another part of the affliction
<START> decoteau has to be one of the worst directors working today in any genre and it has nothing to do with his movies usually containing and having guys run around in their matching boxer briefs remember anyone in tight black underwear is satanic and evil and want to suck out your blood soul such deep symbolism here i just sat through the sisterhood to give him his fair shakes i try to watch every horror movie i can and this one had barbara from beyond re animator crampton in it i had previously been sucked in to the world of decoteau thanks to linnea quigley adrienne barbeau and several other actresses i like br br lemme tell you what about the sisterhood like the other reviewer pointed out the supposed plot involves lesbian vampires on a college campus but never has a parade of hot young babes actresses if you want running around dressed in bras panties and bikinis been so boring the movie has no plot no gore no nudity and the dialog is ridiculous and seems like they made it up as they go along parts are put in slow motion and repeated many times to push the running time up about ten minutes of this one consists of characters just walking around on campus oh the excitement that looks more like a hotel resort than any college i've ever been to and the acting is the absolute worst the only thing these girls do well is lean forward and bend over to show off their bodies the cast were so devoid of talent that i'd be shocked to see any of them get a one day walk on role on passions in the future ditto for the guys yeah decoteau squeezed more hot guys in underwear in this one too guys who should be in some k mart brochure instead of trying to act do these people actually have to audition or just show up in dave's office and take their clothes off i think the answer is obvious br br i am willing to give any movie a chance if 1 it's intelligently written well directed original and competently acted or hell even ambitious and stylish or 2 it is chock full of gore nudity assorted trashiness and or it's unintentionally hilarious david decoteau's movies deliver none of that and they do it on better than usual production values for direct to video flicks what a waste so what is the appeal especially with the advent of porn of the soft and hard core variety that's easily accessible to anyone with a computer i simply cannot answer that br br decoteau is a gay horror director and could use his resources to put a unique spin on the genre instead he produces mind numbing drivel without an ounce of talent or intelligence shining through ironically when you think about it his films are anything but pro gay they actually make homosexuality seem seedy secretive and sinister the obviously gay characters in his films are always trying to corrupt seduce and or kill off the innocent sexually confused leads there's no shading here to make things interesting the protagonists are naive and seldom prove themselves to be strong assertive or confident in who they are i would understand this plotting if jerry falwell fred phelps or dr laura starting making direct to video horror films but from a gay director it just goes to show that he puts almost no thought into these beefcake cheese fests
<START> i'm a next generation person i've never saw the original doctor who but i have heard about the series that sparked a great fan base in the past and still making its mark in the century the new doctor who started in 2005 but for those that live here in the states like myself we pretty much see it as new episodes on sci fi channel or bbc america from season one we are introduce to a new player rose tyler billie piper and a pretty cool new doctor played by christopher misspelled last name sorry these two go on some many amazing and very extremely dangerous missions to save the world every now and then they have companions from rose's ex boyfriend mickey to the now ever present jack harkness who can now be seen on the spin off torchwood from season one to season two the pace is just about right the stories can be from the outlandishly weird to the most action packed paced driven but either way its one ride from the start of the theme song which is very catchy br br in season two he becomes different and changes and now the new doctor david tennant continues the fight to save the world with rose and from this point there can be some that say some of the season wasn't as good but i have to disagree and it was sad to see rose and the doctor part ways but it leaves the opening companion role to martha played by the very sexy who helps continue the fight to save mankind season three now is more on the action adventure level and sometimes on the emotional but not as much as the first two seasons here the relationship between the doctor and martha is fitting but the attractiveness can be rushed into at times and the obviousness comes into play that she's not rose tyler being that you experienced her company in the first two seasons and not in the third season it can be a bit awkward it was for me cause you get use to rose and her ways and now to see someone who at times don't really question the doctor on an emotional level but all the same makes the pace very exciting for viewers which keeps you at the edge of your seat br br all in all this is one thrill ride of a television show i would give it more but there are some flaws to this show as well that i can't mention cause its sometimes hard to pick up but just one does which is the doctor and martha's relationship is rushed and not leveled on the get to know you base i've seen good shows on british tv but this is by far one of the coolest sci fi adventures for the old and new generation to experience but you don't have to take my world for it step into the tardis and join the adventure
<START> my teacher did this movie it's a new beginning watch it and you won't notice that it is a romanian movie the old boring style has gone now it's something else a post revolutionary movie it is using the latest imaging technology and mostly unknown artists they are unique you won't even know that you're watching you will be simply transferred beyond the screen and you'll feel every frame don't miss it pay attention to the plot but don't ignore the details they make the difference between this movie and the others romanian movies you will hear some music at some point it's representative for a part of us but it does not represent us please just keep your head straight and leave your body free
<START> this movie was terrible john wayne is a brutal actor at times the lead female playing the role of maura did a good job and tried her best to make scenes believable despite wayne's inept one dimensional over acting seriously did you see him when he was supposed to be talking in his sleep ridiculous and his character became such an awful person in the second half of the movie and then did nothing to atone for his behavior and is still forgiven by everyone including his arch nemesis without even so much as a 'sorry' the story was completely implausible we were supposed to believe that two grown men both tremendous successes in their respected fields would sabotage a job and risk the lives of innocent men simply because they disliked one another you can pretty much randomly select any scene and it will probably leave you shaking your head in disbelief that someone paid money to have this film made its too bad because the only other wayne films i've seen are the shootist and rio bravo which were both great movies unless you're being paid don't bother watching this one
<START> do not watch this movie or if you are really mad at anyone you can give this as a this is the worst movies i have ever seen do not watch this if you do remember that would be a self destructive action it is a shame that this is not voted lower
