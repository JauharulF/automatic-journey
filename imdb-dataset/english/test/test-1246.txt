<START> in the book of life martin donovan plays jesus who shows up at jfk airport on december 31 to usher in the new millennium by battling with thomas jay ryan satan and deciding the fate of the world there is also david kurt the accountant from amateur as a compulsive homeless gambler br br as usual hartley creates a surreal world in which the beauty of the ordinary made strange and otherworldly flows through artfully framed scenes and urban industrial landscapes filled with dazzling light and shadow as usual he introduces seemingly incidental details early then brings them back later in hilarious and unexpected contexts the humor is simple but giddy and irrepressible hartley has an amazing ability to build toward small and rapturous moments of the simultaneously mundane and outrageous as usual he creates a tone that is jaded and world weary but at the same time vulnerable open and honest he moves within minutes from uproarious humor into language that is metaphysical and poetic the kind of writing that is so dead on and perfect that it's difficult to hold back tears despite the lack of obvious emotion another awesome and highly entertaining film the book of life is shot a digital camera with a blurry effect a sense of the celestial hand in hand with impending doom and a hyper awareness of the present as fragile and fleeting in it's last moments all of hartley's films have a way of the present but this unique effect compounds it as the images wash across the screen in a way that is at first jarring but becomes increasingly beautiful as you settle into it the final shot is spectacular all this may sound precious but the film is a comedy and it makes fun of itself even as it makes fun of the concept of armageddon judgment day and ' although it is actually quite profound moving and life affirming it is for the most part lighthearted and playful the acting is flawless in terms of the kind of the subdued tone that hartley has developed in his films a tone that some people don't get and that prompts them to judge such acting as hollow the same people who have a negative response to peter greenaway as always there are bound to be people who respond to this film with cynicism and scorn people put off by hartley's abrupt shifts and what they see to be pretentious or techniques but who has time to consider the opinions of such dull and callous fools anyone who is a hartley fan will love this film if they can get a chance to see it that is it's hard to say what it would be like on video
<START> love and human remains directed by denys arcand is an abysmally pathetic film as it is completely different from the kind of films he has been making all through his career making a different film is not an objectionable matter what is troublesome is the fact that if a film from a master is complete out of tune then it is a really bad event the film begins on a good note as there is some suspense created however as the film progresses what is shown is just a futile attempt at creating something meaningful as arcand shows us half a dozen oddball whimsical characters whose lives are intertwined with each other homosexuality and lesbianism are not of any consequences here what is even more bothersome is the feeling of guilt related to the characters who are rather in a fix regarding their feelings towards each other and sexuality such a film would be of interest to some who wants to see a different denys arcand film all in all there would surely not be many takers for this film
<START> i have nothing but praise for this movie and cast especially ann margaret but more importantly i have praise for my in laws who were are the adoptive parents of warren and frank in real life i met most of the children at warren's wedding in 1989 this is an amazing story and is even more incredible to me knowing the family and what everyone went through it is also enjoyable for me to see how my in laws were portrayed in the movie it was pretty accurate my wife even enjoys seeing some little details such as a toaster that she remembered from her childhood yes it is a hard movie to watch but so amazing and heartfelt br br the beauty of this story for me is how many of the children passed through my in laws lives and as a result of marrying their daughter and having warren as a brother in law how many i have met in mine for the past 20 years this story has been a part of my life because of what my mother in law has shared with me that and knowing warren for what it is worth warren lives in california with his family he married his high school sweetheart who he with at his 20 year high school reunion br br there was a show in the 1980's called that's incredible they had a reunion of the family who also got to meet the cast of the show br br for anyone's interest the dvd is available in great britain and australia it is a tough video to come by here in the united states and i have not been able to find a dvd here yet
<START> it's hard and i didn't expect it but it's really the worst film me and my wife saw awful dialogs that extend incomprehensibly through time without any apparent reason except to fill time the storytelling doesn't follow a comprehensive wayÂ everything is a mess the action and the dialogs appear at jumps the thing that disappointed me most was to see dominique one of my french favorite actors involved in i don't even know how to describe it without being the rest of the actors where at the most poor susan made a terrible interpretation of her character making a flat inexpressive performance poor special effects i don't think that it was a complete waste of film but it's close if i'm to say i would advise everyone not to see this movie i think it would be a complete waste of time sincerely i never though i would say something like that about a movie there's always a first time
<START> you know those films that are blatantly awful but you can't help but love them well that's what evil ed is possibly the best awful film in the world the sound is rubbish the dubbing is crap the screenplay is nonsense and the special effects are pap however i can't help but love this film dearly and i have recommended it to at least 50 people over the years sam campbell or the guy who plays him should be featured on the actor's studio series as he is that memorable possibly the greatest movie villain not named tony montana seriously if you don't expect a lot then you won't be disappointed keep a light hearted approach to watching this film and you'll soon rate it a ten afterwards
<START> being a middle aged mom myself i very much appreciated seeing a romance between grown up people that weaves in the many issues that effect us br br diane lane beautifully portrays adrienne and the sacrifice and conflict that a mother goes through wanting to do what is right for her children but still have a happy life herself br br i am not a big richard gere fan but he always does a good job with the guy who is sort of jerk but learns something about himself br br criticism of their romance as unrealistic is hardly justified when compared to most other romantic movies when nicole kidman and hugh jackman fall in love riding across australia with barely a conversation between them its considered high romance we get so much more here with she redeems him he sets her free its beautiful br br the intimacy they create by sharing their deepest insecurity fans into a flame of passion how long it takes is irrelevant perhaps the movie was a bit too subtle in the point that it was the letters they shared over the following year that deepened their relationship again another real life time honored way to get to know a person br br as much as i enjoyed the plot and themes the dialogue was not consistent in quality some lines rang so true and other lines were embarrassingly trite and flat br br i also enjoyed the relationships with adrienne's teenage daughter and her best friend reminding us that there are many types of love not just romantic love br br this is not a lighthearted romantic comedy more a romantic drama it does have a very relaxed pace that some might consider too slow br br the beach house is a work of art fabulous look for the driftwood bench on the porch in the first pan over the house very beautiful i also enjoyed the music and scenery which combined to create the effect of the location as being the third main character it was this place away from their regular lives that allowed them to see themselves and each other in a different light br br if you are old enough to appreciate these themes and are in the mood for a good cry get out the kleenex and enjoy this movie
<START> couple having financial trouble gets a box delivered to their door if they push the button they get a million dollars but someone they don't know will die do they push the button br br this is an odd film based on a richard matheson short story has a few chills but mostly is a messy affair the trouble is that there is so much going on it feels as though writer director richard kelly didn't know what sort of movie he was making is this a straight out horror film with supernatural overtones at times it seems like it with talk of moral choices damnation and the afterlife is it a science fiction film possibly there are lots of questions about that mars project and what are the strange looks that people seem to have as if in some grand conspiracy is this invasion of the body snatchers or a demonic take over film don't know maybe and that's the problem there are lots of questions most of them intriguing but there are too many little seems to have been explained and when we get to the end of the film things seem more to stop then to conclude even in an open ended way i'm all for making a film rich with themes and points but writer kelly fills his script with simply too many that director kelly can't handle or does so in such away that each theme or plot thread gets its ten minutes of screen time and for those minutes it hold court before its cast off the next bit it made me crazy i won't get into the two leads cameron diaz and james marsden who aren't very good or more likely don't know what to make of the material which is so ever shifting br br it's a heady mix that doesn't work there are ultimately too many holes i got to the end and suddenly realized i had no idea what i just saw i really didn't like it but its more in a this isn't good because it just misses sort of a way rather i'd take a pass or wait for cable where its not going to cost you anything
<START> i was shocked there were 18 pages of good reviews this has to be one of the worst movies especially considering it was recommended must admit that comedies are not my favorite genre but this movie made it worst in that it tried so hard to be clever that it made me squirm to watch it br br the concept of the movie is comparable to audition week on american idol you watch because people are so blind to their shortcomings but we knew this movie didn't have bad actors so how funny would it be to have good singers try to convince they shouldn't get anywhere near an american idol tryout it would be pointless as this movie was br br the use of improv is over rated we've all been in that setting where a group of friends get on a roll and everyone is cracking up with tears in the their eyes i feel that is improv improv can't be turned on just because the camera is rolling as this film proves if you like that drew carey hosted show of improv you'll probably like this film br br overall the jokes were poor the improv was sophomoric and the over acting by guest and company was campy and those are my compliments of this drivel if a guy playing a trumpet and the kettle drum at the same time is funny to you fine for me i prefer more heady stuff like i love lucy or hee haw br br but remember i think snl lost its humor in the 1980's so maybe you'll like this g rated humor i kept waiting for a person to identify himself as the zoo keeper and then tell us there was no zoo in town that's the humor you can expect br br my only wish was that i could give this a minus rating
<START> i have officially vomited in my own mouth thanks to this movie br br i expected the absolute worst with this movie but i expected a heartwarming and pleasurable absolute worst this is just terrible absolutely terrible terrible like nazis spreading the black plague let me explain ewoks are speaking english it's horrible br br the villain girl looks like she travelled from the future set of power rangers i really really want her to rise up from the ground and say at last after ten thousand years i'm free it's time to conquer earth the er i mean the big bad whatever the heck they are they growl a lot many of them look like an even lamer version of the cryptkeeper the cryptkeeper was pretty cool but these guys were not br br the only merit to this movie was paul gleason this movie might have been better if he'd went to the bad guys and said if i have to come in here again i'm skulls it would have been even better if one of the ewoks was played by judd nelson who mouthed his words as he said this br br also that speedy little creature is pretty badass word to that br br no word to the movie though i want to give this movie a two i want to so badly there's a passage i have memorized the path of this movie is beset on all sides by the inequities of terribleness and the tyranny of spin off awfulness blessed is nothing for this movie blows
<START> when i checked out the review for this film after i'd watched it i was surprised that there were people giving it good ratings br br this is a film of bad camera work everything happens off screen usually accompanied with a closeup of someone yelling did you see hear that well no we didn't see that we can't and when there weren't any close ups the camera was doing something weird like rotating upside down or shaking back and forth really really quickly to either convey action or to make us physically sick br br the characters were unlikeable because every two minutes they started screaming the same thing over and over again i don't care if that's what it would 'really' be like i did not rent a scary movie to see reasonable things i expect unreasonable things like aliens demons or good acting they were stupid too let's go have intimate relations in a cave with all of our clothes on speaking of which the ending somewhat contradicts what domingo said immediately before he died this bugged me a bit though not nearly as much as the fact that the ending resulted in a serious invasion of one girl's privacy br br no plot no climax no good acting terrible camera work what's left oh right the ending may have had a 'twist' but generally with horror movies the twist at the end actually has understandable relevance to what occurred during the film sixth sense does it explains a lot hide and seek did too but the cavern had a lame twist that served as an if you could call it that as it doesn't explain anything br br don't see it please
<START> here's why this movie fell very short of its potential i don't read much so i don't care what the novel was like 1 i think brendan frasier copied his encino man from lambert's tarzan it was stiff and while his tarzan call was a little more realistic he had no humanity 2 they screwed with the story maybe that's how the book goes but for as long as i can remember the first utterances of tarzan were me tarzan you jane jane is the first human tarzan encounters i did like the natives a bit more than the midget in weismuller's version but those bows and arrows were a bit cheesy 3 tarzan is primarily a love story i'm sorry but the love interest enters over an hour into the picture that qualifies her for a supporting role at best supporting roles and leads don't fall for each other not enough screen time sorry not only was andie mcdowell's over pathetic most likely because her strong southern accent couldn't be masked the chemistry scale between tarzan and jane was a whopping 0 i never believed they loved each other which made the belgian dudes closing voice over quite frankly silly when tarzan sees jane for the first time in the jungle he feels an urge if you will a feeling he's never felt before jane brings out the humanity in him and he brings out the untamed side of her its this chemistry that the story of tarzan not that lord dying wish is to keep his land whole and that johnny boy is going to do it for him even a good face lift couldn't help this movie it needs massive internal reconstruction oh and could we possibly shoot more in the jungle or at least use camera angles that don't show off the sound stage like qualities of the place final judgement 4 out of 10 sorry tin man and by the way if you want to see real acting drop lambert and check out leonardo dicaprio
<START> pathetic nri crap appeal to all who are not this is the worst of indian cinema made by the worst piece of nri trash the story is boring and clichÃ©d the way nris and westerners view india go for it if u want to be bored to death br br the movie deals with the plight of widows in india before independence a lot of it is true even now in remote rural areas but not to the extent as depicted maybe because its a period movie br br there are plenty of other indian movies directed by extremely talented directors that are worth savoring this one is a definite miss watch a documentary instead or look up information on the net if you are genuinely interested in the plight of the downtrodden in india br br i wasted my time
<START> this is a very very very bad movie br br the plot is weak the acting is bad and the science is worse br br the special effects are unconvincing the dramatic scenes are a joke every step of the way you can see coming a mile away the end is disappointing and there is no suspense the best aspect of the film is the soundtrack br br the only reason not to give this a lower vote is because it is a tv movie and i believe the budget was low to start of with br br i do believe that the young female fans of luke parry will still see this movie however he has done better work again this is terrible very very very terrible if you have a choice look at something else
<START> one of the best western movies ever made unfortunately it never got the recognition it deserved the storyline the action and the music was in my mind one of the best i give it a double a randolph scott gave a terrific performance along with the other members of the cast the ending was one of the best of any western made
<START> take a bad script some lousy acting and throw in a politically incorrect morality tale and what do you get something that is supposed to pass for quality family viewing br br seven alone is the story of a family in the 19th century who travel across america in a wagon train hoping for a new life in oregon there are seven children three boys three girls and a baby whose sex i'm not quite sure of hence the title of the film br br the story opens up with the family living a seemingly normal 19th century life on a farm in the middle of nowhere eldest son john is a precocious teenager and good for nothing' as his father constantly reminds him we see right off the bat that he has a penchant for practical jokes when he ties string to the hair of his sleeping sisters and connects it to a nearby mule when the mule is moved of course the poor girls are jolted out of bed john is caught by his father and is immediately punished with a strap br br that same day a wagon train passes through pa is tempted to join up as it promises a new life in the wild wild west so the family hitches up their belongings and head off br br from the very beginning the film seems weak and amateurish the acting is below grade as if from one of those films shown in school about the pioneers i can't blame the actors however because the lines in this film are silly and just too sickeningly sweet and optimistic br br i must tell you that i caught this film while flipping channels one boring saturday afternoon on a christian television station not of a religious mind myself i watched in horror as seven alone offered up moral statements that were not only outdated but downright offensive if i were a good christian i would hope that i would have had the good sense to complain to the television station for airing such trash however because i am a cynical non believer with a wicked sense of humor i chose to sit back and laugh myself silly br br in one of the opening scenes the role of the father as the stern ruler of the house is established when he proposes the idea of heading off for oregon to his wife her response is a heated over my dead body we are expected to laugh i suppose as the film cuts to the next scene with pa and ma smiling as he steers the wagon along through the prairies oh i suppose even the most staunch feminist would have to admit that this 'father knows best' attitude was the norm in those days and one could argue the need for such dictatorial rule when living conditions were difficult but i somehow got the feeling that this film supported that notion even for today lovely message coming from a christian television station br br anyway things get worse for the family and the films moral integrity is further diminished an indian or native american robs john as he lay sleeping in a field like a common savage the indian takes johns clothes and belongings thankfully pa with the help of kit carson is able to kill the indian as well as a couple of his delinquent friends kit carson tells john that his father is a true hero br br the family is accompanied by the wagon train's resident doctor dr dutch played by aldo ray he shares sentiments about john stating that he is a useless brat perhaps so but he also the best thing about this film aldo ray's doctor is buffoon who seems unable to tie his own shoes let alone treat one of the girls for a broken leg thankfully the young child didn't cry when the wagon ran over and snapped her leg in two because dr dutch didn't seem to have the appropriate bedside manner we know the drawbacks of constantly belittling a child here's a film that promotes that behavior br br later on pa develops food poisoning or something i wasn't paying much attention and he dies his death bed scene is the stuff great acting is made of frankly the man didn't even look sick br br soon after ma dies too the children are left to fend for themselves and that's when the real adventure begins slugging it through the rapids encountering more indians these ones are nice though and venturing through snowy terrain these children do it all and i was left thinking what a bunch of garbage br br sorry but there was nothing redeeming about this film this low budget little house on the prairie is a shameful waste of time and an insult to everywhere i'm surprised that in 1975 at the tail end of the feminist movement and at a time when treatment of native americans was coming into focus that something like this could actually be made br br
