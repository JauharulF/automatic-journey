<START> oh man this movie was toe cringing bad bad look awful story the list of good things is shorter than the list of bad things about this movie br br yes sure it's supposed to be a comedy and all but something tells me that this movie was supposed to be the real deal the movie most certainly does not start of as a comedy but more as an adventurous movie with fun elements put in it you can especially tells they were serious with this by the acting that was in a serious and non comical way with the exception of a couple of over the top sequences obviously it seemed to be me that at first they tried to make a real and serious adventurous science fiction movie perhaps even a franchise but soon began to noticed how bad it all was and simply decided to insert some more and deliberately overdone comical sequence to make the movie seem more like a comedy and prevent it from turning into a complete disastrous mess br br the movie is a weird attempt to mix adventurous swashbuckling pirate movies with serious science fiction action the movie was obviously inspired by the star wars movies and its success the movie isn't even too ashamed to copy entire sequences and even the way the story progresses sets characters and robots show similarities they tried to hide this by putting in some obviously spoofing sequences but i'm not falling for it so the movie is not even original on its own despite its original concept you can say that this movie is a poor man's spaceballs without even really being fully a spoof br br the movie is bad looking with some video games special effects in some sequences even literally awful looking costumes coat of mail and swords in outer space the sound is at times even laughable seems like they shot some sequences without sound and then forgot to add all of the required sounds later again in post production the mixing is also really bad they tried to conceal this by putting the sound down to a minimum at times and by tuning up the bruce broughton musical score br br at times the movie is so busy trying to make the movie look humorous that it totally forgets to tell the story it makes the story of the movie seems extremely messy and poorly written with an almost completely undeveloped main plot it also doesn't help to make the movie really ever flow lots of thing don't get explained and some are even dropped after a while the movie begins as a movie who constantly are looking and steal water since its scarcely and there is only one planet in the entire galaxy remaining with water on it yeah right however this plot line gets soon abandoned especially in the middle part of the movie in which the movie seems to become a totally different one with different motivations it's just like the one weird and bad silly sequence after the other without really making a click it also keeps the characters way too shallow and uninteresting to care about br br sad to see that actors like john carradine anjelica huston and a still young and unknown ron perlman were attached to this disastrous movie br br ok i admit that i liked some of the moments especially the ending when they go through the time warp was original and fun but really non of this all was enough to save the movie br br i didn't even liked the movie in a campy kind of way br br 2 10
<START> i don't really mind the creative ideas interjected in these movies but seriously there isn't one coherent part of the game in this movie that seems to be the trend buy the rights and then just make a movie that has zero to do with what the fans want this butchering is almost entertaining because you know you are getting away with hiding behind a lack of skill and control of money not yours that allows you to do this play a game or hire someone to and please make a real movie or stand in the boxing ring and have your butt handed to you as you so claim won't happen br br wow 9 lines of text and i was done had to add blah to bug you sorry
<START> i just got back from seeing comedian it was alright it kept me looking at the screen its just not the type of thing i like to go pay 7 to see br br now don't get me wrong it'd make a great hbo feature if this were something i was watching on tv i'd be hooked right in it gives an amazing look at what comics go through before and after getting on stage it will interest anyone who likes watching comics br br but when i go to the movies i like to be entertained i'm not there to be educated now i know what its like for jerry seinfeld before he goes out on stage great but truthfully i'd rather just laugh at his jokes than worry about any of that br br one more thing with the bad attitude adams has i'd expect to see him taking my order from burger king before i see his hbo special he wasn't funny he's the kind of person that you love to hate
<START> well i watched this film expecting to be rolling in the aisles how wrong i was the film was moderately amusing at best and irritating at worst the slapstick comedy styling of building an ark with archaic tools laugh no i didn't i'm very disappointed given steve carrel was the lead i've watch the office us religiously cracks me up immensely i thought 40 year old virgin was good but evan us why on earth did he accept this script and as for morgan freeman he's old enough to know better br br so the idea seemed reasonable the actors i had every faith in but the execution was nothing to write home about and the ending well it seemed as if they had run out of money or ideas this for me was one of the most contrived endings i could have imagined they took a biblical story and dumbed it down to a cautionary tale on localized environmental issues not even global issues but a local bill yawn br br in summary reasonable start got gradually worse and for me it was all washed out by the time the credit's rolled
<START> leslie nielsen is usually someone whose movies i really like even critically panned flicks like dracula dead and loving it and wrongfully accused so the fact that i'm slamming mr magoo should show that it's a piece of junk it casts nielsen as the myopic title character something gets planted on him and he makes a mess of everything it seems like the combo of nielsen and director stanley tong behind two of jackie chan's movies would make this one hilarious movie but it doesn't it seems like they just have people to do anything and there's no real humor here br br so the original cartoon with jim backus providing the voice was worth seeing so avoid this movie leslie nielsen has also done much better so there's no reason to waste your time on this also starring kelly lynch stephen ernie hudson malcolm mcdowell and miguel ferrer they probably don't wish to emphasize this hunk of junk in their careers
<START> andy mcdermott tom everett scott is a shy american teenager spending vacation in paris with his friends brad and chris andy saves the gorgeous julie delpy from committing suicide in eiffel tour and has a crush on her he does not know that she is a werewolf they go to an underground party and are attacked by werewolves andy is wounded and becomes a werewolf he is advised that the only way to become normal again is killing the werewolf that attacked him and eating its heart this movie is a violent black humor movie the special effects and the soundtrack are excellent highlighting the song of the band bush i do not know why some readers compares this movie with the masterpiece 'an american werewolf in london' the stories have nothing in common only an american teenager werewolves and a city in europe highly indicated for fans of werewolf and black humor movies my vote is seven br br title brazil um em paris an american werewolf in paris
<START> i saw this mini series when i was in high school i remember it as being absolutely brilliant and compelling at the time i knew none of the british actors in the series but have since learned that some of today's stars performed in it including sean connery the original james bond among many other roles judi dench queen elizabeth in shakespeare in love among many other roles and atkins probably best known for creating upstairs downstairs but also superb in many acting roles like the other commentator i would like to see it again i'm certain the production remains timeless and i would hope that it has been or will be released on vhs or dvd if you get a chance to see it do not miss it
<START> in the mid 1970s my nyc apt building was finally wired for cable tv and since showtime instead of hbo was the only premium channel offered showing recent movies i signed up for it being a writer and night owl by nature i soon discovered the channel was showing movies late at night and until the wee hours of the morning i'd never even heard of most of them american independent films and foreign films that had never been given a u s theatrical release many of them had recognizable star casts and respectable directors and thanks to showtime i discovered many first rate films i and other showtime subscribers would never else have had the opportunity to see most of these cinematic were indeed dogs but often so bad they were unintentionally hilarious one night showtime unveiled a little italian made gem called redneck filmed in 1972 given a limited european release in 1973 even though the movie had never been released in the u s the mpaa rating was listed as an 'r' since the director was one sylvio the director who made his name with the glorious georgy girl and the three leads were mark oliver lester fabio testi and telly savalas i decided to give it a try and found myself nailed to my tv screen in disbelief for 89 minutes as i recall savalas and testi played two criminals the former a raging maniac who in one stomach churning scene casually sent a german family to their deaths by nudging their trailer off a cliff thereby plunging to the wilderness depths below so far so bad then out of nowhere testi as the nice psycho and lester all of 14 when the movie was made are seen both nude in a men's room testi sneaking peeks at the kid's body while shaving and poor confused lester fixated on close ups of naked butt as a not yet jaded member of the movie industry and a card carrying liberal i was as much against censorship then as i am today the entire movie made me queasy and being the early '70s when i seen everything in the anything goes movies of that liberated era including the uncut version of altman's that cold day in the park a real jaw until it was trimmed for an 'r' rating and would have spelled the end for altman's career had he not next come up with something called m a s h i still wonder if anyone else except me ever saw redneck and was appalled as i was trashing the actors and movie going audiences is joy maladjusted filmmakers have been merrily indulging in since the beginning of time but leeringly exploiting a highly respected and talented child actor mr lester at a time when he was beginning to make the difficult transaction from child to adult actor and i'm sure his film offers had thereby dwindled to meretricious junk like redneck mr you should be hanging your head in shame incidentally i was soon to make friends with actors who had appeared in future undistinguished efforts they both despised him surprise
<START> i found this movie to be a simple yet wonderful comedy this movie is purely entertaining i can watch it time and time again and still enjoy the dialog and chemistry between the characters i truly hope for a dvd release
<START> john ford paid the wagons his tribute of a special picture made after two big indian cavalry epics it is a lovely poetic movie full of romanticized reincarnation of the pioneer spirit it didn't have to top the big ones that had preceded it br br it is extremely simple the camera moves only once or twice in the entire film and never when a director would have made it move to underline a shot ford even resists the temptation to track his camera in the breathtaking twilight shots of the women wearily marching along in the dust behind their wagons they come and go while the camera remains immobile and the audience stays a spectator to the march of history not a participant in it of course when ford wants to involve his audience emotionally or dramatically as in ' he knows just how to do it but wagon master is a tender nostalgic look backward br br filled with traditional western songs rendered by the sons of the pioneers it tells of the trek west to utah in of a mormon wagon train led by ward bond in the role of elder and two young horse traders ben johnson and harry carey jr and in a series of beautiful images as the wagon train fights outlaws indians and nature in its struggle to reach the land ' the modest manages to capture the history and legend of the west br br ford himself has said that of which he wrote the original story was among the three films of his which 'came closest to being what i had wanted to achieve ' br br ford's career as a western director was astonishing more than anyone else he was able to use the genre to protect his feelings about the family society and the american way of life ford saw the frontier as a land to be subdued by a special class of settlers and lawmen whose great sacrifices make the land safe from those who come after these early westerners were giants who deserved the legendary status they earned and the civilized townsfolk who followed must always hold them in fear and respect ford's westerns often employ flashbacks that emphasize the historical authenticity of his approach br br in master ' for example folk songs on the sound track tell us of the hardships of the pioneers of a century ago and ford shows them to us in almost documentary fashion in one sequence the train is camped in a circle and the settlers decide to hold a square dance to fashion a dance floor they have to lay boards over the desert sand and with this ritual celebration ford shows the defeat of the wilderness through the metaphor of boarding over the land br br it's a lovely to look at film full of a marvelous lighthearted optimism and it is easy to understand why ford found it so it never breaks faith with the mood and style set in the first few but one is left wondering whether the ultra romantic best suits the chosen themeÂ br br the wagon train experience must have been one of the most physically demanding and nerve wracking ordeals that man with his ever set it must have been riddled with i wrong to sell up everything and come how can we hope to survive how will we contend the other end every other aching step of the wayÂ br br yet none of this feeling really comes through in wagon master the is the general not strike one as particularly it could be of course that the mormons were so 'high' on religious spirit that this tended to act as an in other words their reactions weren't those of normal human weakness if so ford was right and the doubters were wrongÂ br br what is beyond doubt is the right and proper especially at first meeting of ben johnson and harry carey jr this is the essence of light hearted adventurous youth particularly one feels of western youth of those extraordinary it's a remarkable relationship and it remains lodged in the
<START> a few of my fellow writers have covered this movie's plot elements so i will stick to some of the cuff remarks br br 1 this is entertaining but not for the reasons you'd think it's cheesy but somehow still watchable br br 2 daniel's love interest has to be about thirty the christian girl that dan ignores is way cuter br br 3 muriel stole his shirt from mr spock also if my guardian angel looks like muriel i'm going to have to apply for a transfer br br 4 okay so apparently dan is responsible for his parents' divorce what kind of horrible guilt trip is that muriel says that it was dan's prayers that kept his parents together i just thought that was absolutely ridiculous listen i can pray for my parents as much as i want but the only way they'll stay together is if they decide they're going to do it br br 5 i'll echo the comments on how this movie portrays non christians apparently they're all slovenly bullies br br 6 for something positive david white is a decent actor he gives the movie a little bit of credibility even if he is the only one he pretty much holds this film together on his own
<START> this movie made me want to bang my head against the wall it is hard to compare such badness as this to anything but some say that watching this movie is similar to bleeding from under your fingernails and that comment comes from the writer's cousin this movie was so flipping bad it made hulk the second worst movie ever look like the departed one of the greatest movies in cinematic history if you like boring family movies with predictable plot lines then you will absolutely love this movie if you have a brain then you definitely will not when i rented this movie i actually fell asleep while watching it the next day i finished it from where i left off and it was the worst decision of my life
<START> enough talent and sincerity went into making this film that i wish it turned out better everyone is clearly doing their best to be true to an intriguing premise but it's too deep a vision too involved attempt at disentangling mental delusion to survive a transition to the screen it is an attempt to capture the dimensionality of gossamer patterns on celluloid the result is muddled and slow i give it a 10 for effort but a 5 overall
<START> thank god you're here is painful positively painful the title is apt in a sense if aimed at the large studio audience paid to laugh like they were watching the second coming of the marx brothers and trust me they are paid br br as creatively barren as the entertainment industry has become i refuse to believe that nbc brass really have faith in this turkey rather i think thank god you're here is what all of you get who didn't watch or didn't appreciate studio 60 which previously graced the peacock network's monday night lineup you want to turn your nose up at caviar fine here's some lovely alpo direct from menu foods for you to slop around in
<START> let's face it there is no perfect production of hamlet it's simply far too long and varied and cerebral to get completely perfect across the board especially what with the challenges of elizabethan english and shakespeare's dialogue in any staging of it there are bound to be certain moments scenes or intonations that one disagrees with i've seen a lot of filmed hamlet productions olivier gibson branagh scott and now this bbc film with jacobi in terms of faithful full length productions this one ranks up there with the very best br br most hamlet productions are drastically cut because to perform the entire play takes a stage time of four to five hours this production appears to be complete that is all of the original shakespeare dialogue is intact and so it's essential for scholars and shakespeare lovers and though the lines seemed rushed on rare occasion for those less completely familiar with the text for the most part the script is well acted well spoken and well performed subtitles are available and very helpful although upon occasion they lag slightly behind br br jacobi does a quite admirable job with theatre's longest and most impossible role i actually cried when hamlet dies and i don't think i've done that before patrick stewart as claudius and claire bloom as gertrude are excellent as are ward ophelia and david laertes and the rest of the very on point cast sets are minimal so we can thankfully concentrate on the play without distraction or attention paid to non essentials br br at 3 hours and 45 minutes this full length hamlet is a long haul to sit through but again if you want the real deal it's 100 worth it even if one needs to take an intermission for oneself i highly recommend this production to all shakespeare lovers and scholars
