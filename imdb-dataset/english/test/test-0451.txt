<START> certainly when i saw this movie at hbo i was bit erratic in following the plot but it catches my attention when seeing dustin hoffman in it honestly i'm not enthralled watching old movies but then in the long run it changes my point of view seeing this stirring film made me experience once again at my seat not noticing my tears suddenly roll down my cheek and then after let loose a heavy sigh in realizing the impact of what i've just witness kramer vs kramer was indeed one of the best classical drama movies i've witnessed for a long time that even i myself couldn't imagine how it touched me the story was strongly emotional but is not saturated with such the characters weren't unrealistic for their roles they possess qualities that make viewers like them whatever position they have in the film like the role of meryl streep she was a mother who honestly concede her mistakes at the past but then she's confident to stand up her emotional motives to get what she desires in a fair and square battle dustin hoffman was way too outstanding i can't even fathom how this guy could play seriously difficult roles and suddenly jump into another role which is completely different then performed it well even though i have already seen the movies a lot of times when i seat back and lounge at my home scanning worth movies to peer and buy a time for it catching a glimpse for kramer vs kramer will make my experience another worthwhile moment
<START> although i have definitely read this particular agatha christie book at some point i didn't remember anything about it except the name which is a good thing because seeing this story unfold without knowing how it will play out allowed me to appreciate once more the sheer genius of agatha christie the way she misleads you and then pulls the rug out from under your feet is the main reason for her success and timelessness in addition to her stories the excellent production values beautiful locations wonderful music top notch acting elegant directing etc are the reasons for this series' success and timelessness and all those virtues are present in after the funeral a word of advice be alert right from the start there are clues dropped all over the place even in the opening sequence there are some quite unnerving moments as well in contrast to the peaceful looking english countryside locations and some small touches of humor a must see for mystery buffs and just a very good film in general
<START> the film quickly gets to a major chase scene with ever increasing destruction the first really bad thing is the guy hijacking steven seagal would have been beaten to pulp by seagal's driving but that probably would have ended the whole premise for the movie br br it seems like they decided to make all kinds of changes in the movie plot so just plan to enjoy the action and do not expect a coherent plot turn any sense of logic you may have it will reduce your chance of getting a headache br br i does give me some hope that steven seagal is trying to move back towards the type of characters he portrayed in his more popular movies
<START> with this movie i was really hoping that the idea was to make up for the hashed together ineptitude of the first and yet to my horror requiem is far worse than i could have imagined br br my hopes were up in the opening moments of the film inside the predator ship and i almost breathed a sigh of relief when we finally saw the predator home world a throwaway digital matte painting but still nice to finally see it and then of course the humans if such poorly written characters can be referred to as such are introduced br br one must wonder why it seems to be impossible for fox to make a good film out of aliens and predators at the very least the supposed filmmakers could have done their homework br br characters are set up in the same manner in which we would expect from the worst friday the 13th sequel the pizza delivery scene was cringe inducing as was every other scene of character interaction that followed it bimbos and teen non actors do not make for a real film they make for a cheap flick and alien 1 3 and the predator movies were good because they were produced above the concept remember that the 1st alien is a b movie done as an a movie the brothers really missed an opportunity that could have been rectified by simply knowing their alien predator roots in both the alien and predator films we are introduced to characters that are part of a larger group alien refinery workers aliens marines alien 3 convicts and in the predator films we generally follow a main hero part of a unit predator arnold special forces predator 2 danny glover police and it's easy to see where the filmmakers of both franchises started to go wrong in alien we have pirates or something we have explorers with guns and of course in r we have teen slasher clichÃ©s what is there to identify with here in concept the idea of a convict returning to a small town and a war vet returning seemed a set up for a first blood type of action hero but like many things it was never paid off br br the film making is equally devoid of rhyme of reason there is no sense of forward momentum to the action just small sequences that build the most minuscule levels of tension or interest only to cut away just when they're getting interesting taking the audience out of the movie at every turn the action scenes themselves though much ballyhooed in the trailers are so darkly lit it is literally impossible to tell what is going on during the fight scenes when they finally occur basically the movie is hindered from many levels bad actors combined with poor direction and an atrocious screenplay which as a screenwriter myself i noticed seemed to hit every wrong note and clichÃ© that only the most untalented writer devoid of ideas could have hashed together the writing if it can be called that is not even direct to video quality nor does it demonstrate a shred of respect for the established lore of the previous entries in the series why does the all the sudden have the ability to shoot alien embryos down a pregnant woman's throat to use her as an incubator for more than likely because the brain dead screenwriter needed a way to have more aliens for the predator to fight and given the accelerated growth time even more so than the first as quickly as possible why must meaningless small talk between cardboard cutouts on sticks meaning the supposed characters substitute for real character development remember a character is defined by what they do not say why is the sheriff leading civilians to a cache of guns isn't he an officer of the law how does the bimbo of all people know where they are why does the wait for the predator to very slowly remove his mask before it attacks why are the aliens still falling into that nasty series post alien 3 habit of hissing all the time to let their prey know to run how on earth did this series devolve to a character saying people are dying we need guns how this writer even works is beyond me and reflects badly on fox's already destroyed artistic reputation it's like everyone involved in the making of this film suffered from a mental impairment or really are that inept at every level of the film making process br br the effects are pretty lousy this time around the aliens look like men in suits and adi is just getting lazy with their creature design the aliens look like modified leftovers from alien resurrection with that same bulky musculature around the arms as if they did not learn from that movie that it was not a good design nor a good one to recycle again everything is shrouded in such a state of darkness not to create mystery or atmosphere but simply to hide how bad the creatures look and just like in stan winston is sorely missed when the fake looking predator face is revealed br br there are too many faults to list so i will just say this do not waste your money on this movie fox is beyond caring about the fans as this cheap and trashy film is clearly evidence of i felt bad having taken my girlfriend to see it though it was free and apologized to her profusely after this is one die hard fan who is done with the franchise br br note to fox what we really wanted wasn't a mindless slasher flick it was a film adaptation of the original which was better than anything you've produced for this franchise post 1993 br br signing off
<START> spoiler alert this was my son's review of the movie which he wanted me to post he wrote this i swear br br with malcolm in the frankie and amanda bynes they get to go to show business they team up on the actor paul giamatti he stole jason shepherd's essay on big fat liar and makes it in to a movie jason frankie and amanda bynes have to go to l a to get it back jason's dad does not believe that he wrote that essay so every time they see each other jason asks wolf paul giamatti to give jason's dad a call because he wants his essay back wolf does not make the movie but the president of the company makes it at the end the family and see the movie made by wolf pictures and based on a real story written by jason shepherd
<START> why oh why is this trash considered a classic i've seen higher body counts on episodes of the simpsons virtually nothing happens in this film and much of it's running time is filled with nearly unbearable melodrama straight out of a low rent soap opera br br the trenton family are going through tough times and when dad is away mommy and little boy go to get the car fixed but when they get to the ranch they discover that the guard dog has gone mad the rest of the film is just them sitting in the car while the slobbering st bernard circles them over and over br br regarding the kid i have never ever seen a more annoying child in a film in my life and obviously he's completely aryan since blonde haired and blue eyed kids such as the one prominently featured on of kinder chocolate are apparently more sympathetic than people with brown eyes and dark hair like me all he does is cry and whine same goes for mommy she gets out the car she gets in the car she gets out the car she gets in the car br br i know this was made in 1983 but i just sick to death of horror films where the characters make stupid illogical decisions if mommy just used some common sense she'd be able to get away from the icky dog br br it's very poorly written and there's zero tension if you want to see a good bad dog movie then check out john man's best friend it's funny inventive has a better dog a higher body count and a more involving story leave this garbage be
<START> it seems ever since 1982 about every two or three years we get a movie that claims to be the next officer and a gentleman there has yet to be one movie that has lived up to this claim and this movie is no different br br we get the usual ripped off scenes from i want you dor the instructor gives the richard gere character his overdose of drills in hopes he'll quit the gere character comes back for the girl the gere character realizes the instructor is great etc and this movie is as predictable as the sun rising in the east and is horribly miscast on top costner plays his usual wise teacher character the only character he can play and you really get a sense of his limited acting abilities here kutcher is terrible in the richard gere character just miscast with acting skills barely a notch above keanu reeves br br the main problem with this wannabe is the two main characters are so amazingly one dimensional you never care for either in the least and when character finally turns around just like gere did in you just go so what the movie leaves no plot point unturned and seems to never end as if to say oh wait we forgot to close out the girlfriend story or the what happens after he graduates story or the other six plot points in the movie what's more baffling is the great reviews i see here the general public's opinions never cease to amaze me
<START> whilst this is most definitely a well crafted piece of film making it's thoroughly without any entertainment value whatsoever br br if you're depressed already this film will send you over the edge br br if you're feeling somewhat depressed this film will be just one more thing in your life to feel bitter about you'll feel that it's just your luck to have chosen to watch a movie that turns out to be a complete waste of time br br otherwise you might be able to make it through this film unscathed i didn't btw safe in the knowledge that your life is so much better than jim's then again you might consider that you have been fooling yourself and that are in fact in a much worse situation than you'd previously realized you might feel a bit annoyed at jim for bringing this to your attention you may want to slap him around a bit with a wet fish br br the sad truth is much as i wanted to like this movie i hated it it took rather a long miserable road down the path of oblivion and then suddenly for no reason whatsoever looked back at itself and then stopped br br jim does not have an epiphany at least not one that is conveyed on screen jim has a miserable life and a miserable set of options he discovers nothing that one can relate to and fails to make any significant progress on his journey of self discovery br br of course no one alive could write a happy ending to this movie as others have said it's no hollywood tale it's gritty and it's real it's well made life is quite a struggle at times if anyone were to know the answer they do well to shout it from the rooftops br br still i feel cheated because this movie pretends to have something to say you feel that it's going to say something that if you just suffer through a little more of it it'll have something to say it'll make you stop and think br br it doesn't br br again i do submit that this is a well crafted film and therefore may be of value to a film student with a penchant for e g lighting techniques of the use of colour palettes br br for the rest of us it's utterly miss able
<START> as an asian horror a tale of two sisters is actually a complex character driven psychological drama that engulfs the viewer into the problems of a seemingly normal family i was really surprised at the depth of this movie director ji kim's decision to focus more on telling a story rather than providing cheap scares has proved a correct one creating one of the most ingenious new horror movies br br a tale of two sisters tels the story as it's name suggest of two sisters su mi and the younger su yeon who after spending time in a mental institution return home to their father and apparently abusive stepmother from then on we witness how the sisters deal with their stepmother's gradually rising aggression and erratic behavior to say what would happen next would be to be spoil the entire experience so i'll just leave it at that br br the plot is very tightly written with the characters nicely fleshed out ji kim's focus on a small cast offers a much more detailed view on them and their relations to one another furthermore each of the four main cast has a vastly different role and type of character from the protective su mi the weaker su yeon the visibly uninterested father to the stepmother's frantic and later deadly behavior there is great sense of mystery with a lot of the plot not revealed up into the end and even after that the movie still leaves a great room for interpretation even after watching it once the viewer will be compelled to see it at least once more so that he can gain a better understanding to it br br the actors superbly fit their roles it is especially hard to create strong emotional scenes in psychological movies but it is a great joy when one succeeds in creating them and this is a prime example of such a feat ji kim's direction is slow paced and gripping building up tension for the film's horroresque scenes while few in number those moments are strong and quite frankly terrifying the cinematography and score are top notch further helping to establish an atmosphere fitting that of a psychological film br br a tale of two sisters is a demonstration how the horror genre is in fact so much more than a simple thrill ride with it's strong focus on character and mystery this is one complex movie that could easily seduce you in watching it again and again just so that you can understand it better
<START> the only reason this show did not get a 0 is because one is not available this show has gone from informative news to sensationalized claptrap i tried to support this show in its decline because i like human interest stories and primetime used to have some very good ones unfortunately april 21st has forever changed my mind about this show and the unethical newscasters that participate in it abc actually recorded a brutal case of child abuse and then refused to show it until the statute of limitations had run out and the parents could not be arrested on the charges they should have faced what made it worse was how abc swept the whole incident under the rug instead of taking charge and seeking true professional help for these disturbed individuals they had some pop psychologists send stern warnings to the audience about how they shouldn't judge these poor angels too harshly i was truly sickened i hope this review stops one person from watching this investigative trash in the future if it does i will be happy these days all you can expect from diane sawyer and the good folks from primetime live are butt kissing sessions with a list celebrities and criminal acts covered up and praised to the stars don't waste the hour of your life you'd be better off watching an old sitcom on nick at nite
<START> claire booth the women shows relationships with men through a woman's point of view in a play and 1939 film that also has joan crawford playing a bitch a character who might have been amanda farrow 20 years before that has no male characters here we see the male characters and what a bunch they are they use women like toys and throw them away leaving the women to suffer ironically the women in the women perhaps because they are all we see are shown in a less than favorable light alternately silly and scheming with the only nice one norma shearer growing claws by the end in the best of everything we see the men for the cads they are while the women are largely innocent and vulnerable br br this is a film about women leaping from things diane baker leaps from a car in perhaps the most absurd scene in cinema history which is not in the book suzy parker falls from a fire escape the women in the film are leaping into the workplace looking for success and love at the same time women would leap into the future and leave this type of soap opera behind in the next decade but they would come back to it in the 80's and 90's through the novels of people like sidney sheldon and judith krantz although their works aren't as good as this br br the best thing about this film is the way it looks i love the glossy cinemascope films of the 50's and 60's they look so much better than the challenged home movies we've been making since especially in the letterboxed version we see on tv and the dvd with the picture so clear you could walk into it the look of the bevy of young beauties in it is also memorable this film probably has more beautiful women in it than any other it has a supermodel suzy parker a beauty queen myrna hansen who was not miss america 1954 as rona jaffe says in the dvd commentary but rather miss usa 1953 per the imdb but so what and a playboy playmate june blair from january 1957 my vote goes to suzy one of the astonishing beauties of all time her acting here isn't as awful as people pretend they are just reacting as people did then to the sight of a supermodel the first really trying to act nobody seemed to care how well she did her role that of an apparently worldly woman who turns out to be the most vulnerable is the most complex in the bunch and she does just fine br br the most touching thing about the film now is the age of the female leads at the time hope lange was 27 when they filmed this in the spring of 1959 diane baker was 20 suzy parker was 26 hope who looked to be grace kelly's heir never made it really big and wound up being mrs muir on television and per the imdb wound up living in a home with crates for coffee tables because she spent her money on causes she believed in before dying at age 72 in 2003 this film must have seemed a very distant and irrelevant memory to her by then baker always a welcome face in 60's tv especially to richard kimble and still active as an actress and acting coach just turned 67 parker found the best of everything with bradford dillman for 40 years before dying at age 70 the same year lange did but here they are young beautiful and ambitious for success and love just like their characters
<START> oh my god the beeb hit a new low with this gutless act of political correctness a mixed race family living in birmingham with a disabled kid thrown in for good measure whoever commissioned this tripe should be hunted down and thrown to the dogs the usually funny jasper carrott is about as funny as piles in this show and don't get me started about the others they have the timing and subtly of a nuclear bomb i only hope comedy will get better but with the likes of little britain and catherine tate about i severely doubt this i think you'd be better off getting the box set for a decent comedy from yesteryear such as fawlty towers or bottom if you want a laugh br br ban this squeaky clean rubbish
<START> there is no doubt that alfred hitchcock was a seriously talented director many of his films are undeniable classics that have stood the test of time and are highly watchable to this day this list could include the 39 steps rear window north by northwest dial m for murder vertigo the birds shadow of a doubt and a few other films br br however suspicion is not aging well at all and is really so unwatchable that it seems to me that it was probably a bad film even by 1941 standards the list of scenes that work well could be listed on a with a crayon the script is loose and ridiculous most of the time but the acting seems so forced and wooden and borderline amateurish throughout that it is almost unbelievable joan fontaine tries to shore things up but she is on a slippery slope and cary grant doesn't provide much assistance his acting is so bad at times that i have seen better performances in high school plays or college theatre experience classes where a chemical engineer is acting for the first time with no formal training br br after about 30 minutes of watching this film you may find yourself reaching for the dvd sleeve in the dark to see if you accidentally picked up some kind of special edition version that was cobbled together without any editing br br the subject matter is serious yet the film has a silly and trite feel to it that just seems so out of place you become numb with perplexity br br suspicion is basically unwatchable and another very very very overrated bad movie
<START> the brief existence of the sex pistols and the making of this film after the controversial groundbreaking english punk band's break up both happened before i was born however i started listening to their only album never mind the b s here's the sex pistols in 2003 when i was a teenager and quickly became a big fan i didn't see the great rock 'n' roll swindle until 2006 but saw it a couple times that year and thought it was pretty good certainly not great but pretty good even if i could only remember bits of it and didn't see how it all connected seeing it a third time nearly three years after the second i didn't care much for it at all i'm not even sure what i found so good about most of it in the first place can't remember now br br this film is a mockumentary in which sex pistols manager malcolm mclaren tells his side of the story of the band and its members guitarist steve jones credited here as the crook drummer paul cook credited as the tea maker bassist sid vicious credited as the gimmick and john lydon a k a johnny rotten credited as the collaborator mclaren claims that he created the band and even the genre of punk rock as a scam to make money he tells much of the story to helen wellington lloyd a k a helen of troy in various places where they go together it's basically a hodgepodge of mclaren talking pistols songs live footage of the band fictional scenes often silly strange ones several cartoon sequences etc all put together in one film to tell the pistols manager's side of the story in a bizarre way br br it has been well proved that mclaren is a liar i know many have already pointed this out including band members themselves he was not the driving force of the band he didn't create them nor did he invent punk rock and the sex pistols weren't even the first punk band though they were unique the band members were the ones who made the band what it was the filth and the fury a much more believable film about the band from julien temple who made this film is told from the point of view of the band members who contradict mclaren's claims however the dishonesty of the great rock 'n' roll swindle is not my biggest problem with it if it were actually entertaining which i used to think it was to a certain extent i would be able to overlook that like i obviously used to be able to do during my third viewing apart from sex pistols songs some live footage and at least one mildly amusing cartoon sequence it was pretty dull i found the who killed bambi song mildly amusing at first but it got tiring very quickly br br is this mockumentary worth watching for sex pistols fans it seems a good number of fans would say it is not to learn about the true story of the short lived but groundbreaking 70's punk band but for entertainment that was once my opinion on the great rock 'n' roll swindle after the first time i watched it i couldn't remember a thing mclaren said and by the time i saw it the second time i was aware of what the pistols manager was using this film to imply but could still barely remember anything i heard him say obviously other aspects of the film were what i found impressive now after my third viewing i can definitely remember some of the things mclaren says but it still wasn't 100 clear like most of the film i guess his words are not that memorable probably because of the way they're presented if you're a pistols fan i guess it wouldn't hurt to give swindle a try but to me for the most part it's just an incoherent boring mess that tries to be funny but fails
<START> a milestone in cinematic history is one of the handful of great films out there that richly deserves to be called a classic it was the picture that made sergei m eisenstein a figurehead of film making at the time and today it is still remembered as the wonderful piece of cinema it always has been br br is a film that needs to be seen as one entity not to be picked at don't just watch those clip shows where they only present the sequence and then move on to 'citizen kane' or 'the godfather' see it all in it's glorious 75 minute running time to really understand and enjoy it don't expect every infinitesimal detail to be perfect though i mean the acting of the '20s silent era makes 'scooby doo' look like a master of understated realism certain plot points may seem illogical and some of the battle sequences look dated but it is still an immensely enjoyable movie br br the most memorable moments in the film are the mutiny on the battleship body falling off the ship the sailor under the tent at the end of the pier the mother holding her dead child the baby carriage on the odessa steps and the lion rising up to roar as further carnage ensues for each new pair of eyes that look upon it 'the battleship comes alive once again
