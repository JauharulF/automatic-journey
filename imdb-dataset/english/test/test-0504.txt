<START> such pain pain in the shape that it had promise in its central idea but it never fully recognised it and goes on to blow a lot sand in your face i wouldn't say this straight to video south african canadian uk horror flick is awful but its just too bland predictable and there's just very little memorable about it it's a guarantee you'll forget it not too long after watching it i tried watching it last night but had to finish it during the morning as i couldn't keep my eyes open even then i couldn't remember where i got up to which left me watching it from the beginning again the only thing that hit a chord was andreas sharp cinematography of the vast harsh and eerie desert locations a nice glossy chic creates a striking visual sense which can't save the film from that overall empty feeling everything else is below par and almost comes off grating like the head scratching revelation of the beast huh the computer generated special effects of the ominous monster are tolerable and there are some grisly flashes of stripped flesh and bones but there's too little as there's no hiding the fact that the clichÃ©d script wants to ponder on the generic character conflict to build tension and uncertainty that would be fine if the wilted script was more than just basic shallow fluff because it never generated any strong lasting suspense but makes it labour on the lead characters are superficial and the token support fall in the dispensable basket it's your stereotypical bunch scott and warrick grier's performances are colourless and the beautiful rachel shelley tries but looks rather weary
<START> nice way to relax i am packing my suitcase now so i can go and be with caroline munroe phony monsters and scenery make for 89 minutes of harmless fun something you can enjoy with your family and not be offended
<START> this movie is a bizarre fantasy tale that i'm sure doesn't appeal to anyone over 10 but is too strange for children the plot is stupid and the acting is some of the worst i've ever seen br br 25 year old kathy ireland plays a teenage girl who acts like a 9 year old she seems to have gotten her character's voice by listening to alvin and the chipmunks her high pitched screechy baby voice gets annoying the second she starts talking all of the other acting is bad but really kathy ireland is by far the worst the plot is also terrible and is kind of a mix between alice in wonderland and mad max wanda saknussemm ireland gets a letter saying her father who left her a long time ago fell down a bottomless pit in africa and when she goes to find him she falls into an underground world full of strange australian accented people it's one of the corniest movie you'll ever see with terrible lines throughout br br it's annoying the effects this movie uses for character development kathy ireland is a nerd who won't do anything or go anywhere she flies to africa wow what development she drops her glasses and then doesn't need them why does dropping one's glasses represent them not becoming a nerd it should represent her descent into blindness it's just stupid the only positive i can think is there are semi good special effects and camera work and the musical score sounds ok br br overall this a ridiculous family fantasy that will only appeal to those who expect nothing from a movie br br my rating 1 2 out of 84 mins pg for violence
<START> i really liked two coyotes one of my friends rented it the other night and we were really impressed with how good it was and how cool the main guys were i wonder if they are thinking of making a sequel because that would be excellent br br two coyotes rocks
<START> a depressed creepy teenager does many bad things to a socially active older lady who does not like to use shades or drapes in her windows he steels assorted things from her peeps at her does prank calls and plays assorted unpleasant tricks on her oddly he keeps none of this a secret from her at first she does not seem to care one way or the other that he is bothering her then later she seems to begin to respect him for his cruel fevered activities br br there are some illogical items to note one is that the guy peeps into the night through a pane of glass from the more brightly lit side in real life such a thing would not happen the more brightly lit side of a pane of glass acts as a mirror he would be able to see exactly nothing also everyone out in the night would be able to look inside at him sitting in his well lit room br br one other illogical item is that the creepy teen takes a job as a milkman and his one and only customer each morning seems to be the lady he is picking on easy work if you can get it br br i saw a short film about love at a public showing by the end there was not a single open eye in the house a short film about love is the foreign language movie for those who do not like reading subtitles not only are there very few words spoken in the film but much of the movie is silent a certain rest in peace
<START> not a terrible movie but there are monster scenes where you will be rolling on the floor laughing not a good thing for a action thriller the acting is generally pretty decent for a scifi channel movie barry corbin plays a credible us senator and lou diamond phillips again gives us a decent military police sheriff agent marshal figure the special effects are well special for example the external train shots are very obviously a model train br br goofs a meteor strikes a stationary car in the opening scene the car bursts into flames but does not budge an inch after the impact the meteor is lodged in the top of the car's hood impossible from the low angle that the meteor came in at br br spoilers br br a good portion of the movie's events are predictable from the helicopter crash pull up pull up to the fact that the annoying people get it in the end to the classic blown bridge over a 1000 foot gorge awaiting the train to the sequel set up at the end br br the scenes showing the aliens attacking are hilarious they are vicious cute puppets and move at lightening speed remember the monty python rabbit spoiler goof in one scene four people shooting clip after clip cannot hit a single creature because they move at lightning speed later in the movie todd bridges rigs up a mini flame thrower which he uses to dispatch a number of creatures at close range on several occasions lou diamond phillips is able to easily grab creatures with his bare hands
<START> i also saw this at the cinema in the 80s and have never forgotten it even though i have never seen it again anywhere br br i don't know whether if i did see it now it would seem dated but remembering the storyline and comparing it to some of the terrible modern films i've seen on zone horror i should think it would stand up very well br br i can still remember his coffin sliding out and opening up and all the dead bodies becoming reanimated and the blue lightning having seen hundreds of horror movies and still remembering this one it must be good
<START> i caught this as part of the cartoon noir package at the clinton street theater in portland and it was simply brilliant the saving grace of what was an other wise forgettable to just plain bad grouping of films br br a perfect use of deep black and pure white with excellent yet simple animation this is simply a story of a cat chasing the moon funny charming and touching a small piece of heaven for cat lovers romantics and any one else who appreciates how beautiful simplicity can be if it's in your town see it this one short is worth the price of admission
<START> hi to read the entire plot around oz just look at imdb here to find it br br warning spoilers inside this review oz is the a series that has not only moved me but also shows a small bit of the american prison system but i have to say judging on discovery channels program over jail it is not really realistic br br although i got to say there not shy rapes stabbing happens allot still it is television so for you ppl out there that think this is realistic wrong br br there is a good degree of violence in it and some here and there overdone scenes plot over plot over plot that can get pretty boring but remember the series is almost ancient by now so times do change as well i believe i should judge this in the time line as it came out br br as the season prolonged up to season 5 it was pretty good until one of the cons wins a lottery ticket of 2 million dollars because he talked to god it struck me as ok this is getting to the point i do not want to see this series no more still i proceeded and now i just seen the episode 3 of season 6 this is were cereal gets his brain zapped and then his mom hold him after while he is drooling then you see o reilly cry as well seeing his bro like that rl brothers as well now thats by far the best scene out of the entire oz series that was real to me still do not read this wrong that i'm trying to crash and burn it it is a really good series and even now 2010 well worth a watch i give it a 7 because of the storyline that weakens with the season but still a golden glove
<START> having grown up on westerns and considering the present dearth of westerns on tv and at the theater i was really looking forward to moon br br after watching two nights and not another it appears to be have been shot on a tight budget robert duvall and tommy lee jones level stars are conspicuously absent there is val kilmer but what the heck is going on with him four or five buildings on either side of the street plus the scull mansion make up the entire town of austin the capitol is never seen only the inside of the governor's office br br the dialog is often times hokey meaningless rambling the plot line disjointed altogether completely forgettable
<START> this film tackles the subjects of loss personal struggle and transformation in such a smart artful sensitive and visually stunning way that i was completely transported it is a rare gem of a film in the way it honors beauty and women you'll have to see for yourself weber jane masterfully portrays the subtleties of a remarkable if not somewhat broken personality in a way that every woman will relate to i found the honesty of the emotional interactions among characters to be very refreshing and profoundly engaging there was nothing in this film that said to me low budget as far as quality is concerned nothing the fact that it is a low budget film is a tribute to the film's creators the final sequence during the credits will also knock your socks off it is a brilliant celebration of jane's choice unexpected and inspiring
<START> over the years i've come to be a fan of director writer barry levinson and he didn't let me down with this very funny look at politics popular tv comedian tom dobbs robin williams has enlightened the nation with his scathing jokes about the state of the country and elected politicians responsible night after night he has his fans rolling in the isles then the question is proposed that dobbs run for president himself his manager jack christopher walken says go for it flippant truisms flames a grass root movement that puts him on the ballot comedian to president elect meanwhile a young woman laura linney finds a flaw in the computer system that will count the coast to coast my favorite sequence is linney's meltdown in the coffee shop williams is absolutely hysterical with his rapid quips others of note in the cast jeff goldblum lewis black and rick roberts
<START> man this movies sucked it appeared to have like seven different plots going on at once and they all made little to no sense the special effects costumes and all that stuff were beyond awful the acting was particullary bad everything seemed so forced especially the lines from the woman with the huge eyes and the little kid his noooooo as he gets is so unenthusiastic it's laughable a good portion of this movie is rather funny anyway the one woman's death where she shoves a knife into a toaster gets electrocuted and magically turns into the skeleton dummy in the world had my friends and i laughing for a good ten minutes br br bottom line if you're into watching really horrible movies seek this one out if not run for your life
<START> comedy what's so funny about watching an ugly deadbeat alcoholic attending 6 sessions by the time i turned it off of anonymous set off by a woeful script of grunts and mumbles and drunken served up with lashings of hollywood's religious god will save you redemption drivel another reviewer mentioned the sassy dialogue of tea leone well i managed to watch nearly an hour of this boring film and i still haven't seen any sassy yet in fact my 80 year old grandmother has more amusing comebacks than tea's character in this rubbish tea is more stony faced and shows less emotion than keanu in fact one wonders if she too isn't addicted to something maybe botox her face is so wooden save yourself from being killed with boredom from this film
<START> if this is what's best in the finnish cinema at the moment i'd say those big tax euros spent at supporting culture have gone to waste here in a horrible way maa is the worst kind of example of trying to make a finnish european film for big audiences i'm sure they wanted it to be all state of the art smart and touching at the same time the result is crap br br to make it short the story is pretentious naÃ¯ve and not credible the same goes for the characters i can imagine them about making a film where everything would like turn to t and people would be hurt and feel you know really bad inside because finnish people are so notoriously depressed too and their self esteem is so bad which brings us to the fact that br br the film is loaded with clichÃ©s mostly about the finnish mentality the way the it deals with people's problems and their causes could be straight out of a regular women's magazine or a cheap bull psychology self help book we feel so bad inside i'm sure they watched some too to find out what it is about his films that people like misunderstood him completely and came up with a boring depressing story about people going through all kinds of s t for no other artistic purpose than perhaps social pornography it's a crying shame they threw in tolstoy here it's just a sign of trying to be smart and of not being br br i think the worst fault however is the complete lack of vision and depth the film is highly unoriginal it is also frustrating to watch endless sulking and suffering without any real revelation brought to it i can go through this kind of mind ck if the film is funny or ends up being an elaborate joke or better yet something sublime like in e g von trier's breaking the waves there was none these in maa actually though i did start laughing at some point because the turn of events was again just too predictable over the top and incredible br br who does this crap and who likes it i hope they're pretending
