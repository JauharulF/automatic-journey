<START> how i spend my vacation puts closure to the television series that aired from 1990 to 1992 i've always enjoyed the series for what it is i've never compared the series to the looney tunes of the old days the video release was split up in four or five episodes i can't remember as i'm writing this for television and it's included in the episode list of the series what's good about this series is that all the main characters of the show have a major role in the story we see what they all do during their summer vacation in different parts of the world is with his parents in a safari plucky and hampton crossing the country with hampton's parents fifi is in some beach etc the climax is very good and at the end all tiny toon characters reunite for the start of a new year in the thus practically ending the good run of this tv show
<START> i very much enjoyed this movie and i think most fans of lauren ambrose will too her character is much softer than her role in six feet under and all of the performances are strong i especially enjoyed the way the role of emily a mentally challenged savant was handled despite some other user reviews the role was performed accurately and without clichÃ© by the actress taylor roberts also a standout was fran whose natural ease well complemented the more season veteran actors although the direction hit a snag here or there it seemed the only problems were with an underdeveloped script what maybe worked well as a stage play didn't hold out quite so well on screen however the lovely cinematography by paul ryan definitely makes up for that as well as the pace of the film which is surprisingly not slow i recommend this movie to fans of six feet under and also fans of plain good acting and cinematography
<START> it was amazing as a librarian and an at the new york library vitality fund event on thursday night october 18 i was privileged to see a pre release screening of the new movie the kite runner the release of the movie has been delayed because of concerns about the welfare of the child actors involved i am grateful that the event was allowed to go on as planned br br regarding the movie i feel it was masterfully done it had as much impact on me i think as stanley a clockwork orange even though it is much less graphic much less there is no comparison between the horrendous shocking violence and rape shown in a clockwork orange and the small amount of violence actually shown in kite runner only the subject matter and the implications for the human psyche are comparable i have written more details about the violence and child rape and how it was handled on my myspace blog my overall impression was that this film was fantastic one of the best made films i have seen the depiction of the afghani boys flying their kites captured some of the beauty and grace of an art form unknown to most of the world the subject matter is intensely serious and the movie carries the emotions of the audience into that subject matter without many jarring hollywood touches which have ruined other movies although the overturned cart of was an obvious bit of symbolism to me br br finally i must mention the excellence of the sound track the recitation by the boy of poetry by as two main characters are fleeing the country during the russian invasion under terrifying circumstances truly showed the power of those poems i urge anyone watching to disregard the subtitles in that scene to the extent that you can and just listen to the beauty of the language i don't even know what language amir is quoting whether his normal dari persian dialect is the same as original persian dialect also please note the sound heard every time a kite line is cut i found it a profound distinctive sound though the librarians who were with me did not notice it at all i can't help but wonder if kites actually make a sound like that when they are cut or if it gives a sense of the vibration sound experienced by the kite flyer during competition
<START> i don't see why everyone loves this film so much true it does have good intentions and meaning but you cannot compensate for such a poor script woody allen is a brilliant filmaker but i'm afraid this is just a piece of garbage it's extremely predictable and the subject matter is all too visible i happen to be a huge woody allan fan and love most of his work but this i cannot recomend
<START> i had neither read any of the books nor seen the first movie so after receiving passes to a preview show i had no expectations br br and was a muddled convoluted film lacking direction or any believability there was very little character development and i never found myself caring about the plight of the protagonists the reverse was true i was more interested in seeing how the antagonists would succeed as the first half of the film was almost exclusively focused on why the are who they are br br the film jumps from location to location with little explanation or reason and expects the viewer to believe that everybody in the movie is an ally when they first meet any analytical mind will realize this is highly improbable br br the climax is extremely clichÃ© and leaves you asking what happened and wondering why nobody considered some of these points it feels very tacked on and unnecessary br br the actors are not particularly believable in their roles mostly because i found it difficult to believe that scientists professors and men of the church would act in the manner that they do without regard to the consequences of their actions events that happen are not plausible in the slightest and the pace of the movie is questionable with the characters jumping around while on a tight schedule and i had to question how the protagonists manage to get from location to location on time every time br br the most pleasing part of the film is the cinematography i found it a beautiful film to watch but it was such a mess that i found it would not be worth paying to view in theatres
<START> i got this movie from the library and saw it had a lot of actors i like in it john cleese ian holm ralph richardson etc so i got it and watched it i expected cleese to have a large role since he had first billing i was surprised to find out that he had about five minutes of screen time along with everyone else i liked this movie is amazingly pointless the characters are nobodies the plot is non existent and the ending is one of the worst endings i have ever seen there were a few funny parts but that's about it stay away from this movie if you want to prevent going what and huh a lot and if you don't want to waste your time ignore the people who say this is a very funny movie it isn't just stay away from it at all costs please
<START> i remember going to drive inn with my parent and sister i was in grade 5 and still a kid and the drive closed down 4 years later but the film still lingers in my memory an adult movie which a kid finds entertaining that is a mark of excellence hoffman is one of hollywoods better actors and this film proves it i like the billy put down the ice cream scene and i remember the sctv version in there film i factory myself remember joe crying please email me if you like the sctv skit not a bad film at all it is a story about a father and his son touching and i love the part where hoffman talks about and how the streets change worth a second watch 7 10
<START> if you are very sensitive when it comes to extreme racial stereotypes this cartoon is not for you but if you are strongly interested in seeing a rare piece of wartime animation come on in br br in this cartoon popeye is patrolling the seas and discovers what looks like a japanese fishing boat the two japanese fishermen trick popeye into thinking that they want a peace treaty signed but looks can be deceiving the fishing boat turns out to be a japanese navy ship what follows is considered today to be morale boosting propaganda br br be forewarned the representations of the japanese in the film are done in a mean spirited fashion keep in mind though that there was a war going on at the time but i strongly recommend this cartoon to those who are interested in the wwii era
<START> this is another classic seagal movie he walks no cruises through the patriot just all the other mega seagal movies nothing even comes close to challenging seagal in this movie except maybe the part where he has to find a cure for this so called 'plague' and he starts throwing things about the lab but it all works out i mean lets face it its master seagal he's got to win what about his outfit in the film masterpiece he must have picked it himself its great that everyone in the film is dying after being exposed to the virus but seagal doesn't even get a cough the incident at the end when he kills the fat guy with the broken glass genius i bet seagal thought of that one as well this film is class pure and simple great plot great characters and seagal
<START> confirmed dead is an important episode in the series as it introduces four new characters the rescue team that naomi contacted before getting a knife in her back by locke however as the quote in my one line summary says their true purpose for being on the island may be something else entirely all the new characters appear intriguing especially miles some sort of psychic exorcist but at this point it's still too early to make solid judgments i felt that this episode was a slight step down from the beginning of the end no flash forwards this time short term flashbacks instead but it still has its stunning moments and picks up steam near the end out of 4
<START> keys to the vip is just another one of the horrible t v shows that you can and will see on this station the show is terrible with guys claiming to be real players competing against each other there are two of them competing in each episode in stupid games where they try to get girls at a bar to talk to them get girls numbers and so on the judges are four other guys who also claim to be expert pick up artists but they also seem like just huge d bags just like the contestants the show is not funny at all and not even interesting it is just boring watching these guys desperately try to convince us what awesome players they are talking even more about the four judges than i am about the contestants nothing funny has even happened in the shows i have watched and the shows are obviously rigged do you really think they have invited all these people to the club got them to sign releases and get them on tape while these guys carry out the same stupid games with them it's not reality at all it is just stupid it probably even tapes in the day time somebody else on here wrote how they knew somebody on the show and it was all fake well yeah that is obvious it's a fake show and even with actors it's still not funny one of the worst shows i have ever seen
<START> talk radio is of course probably not the most well known of stone's films but don't let that put you off this film is ripe for discovery i defy anyone not to be entranced by it along with the best performance of 80's cinema by eric bogosian for me along with jfk this remains stone's finest moment stone doesn't seem to comment much on it these days and didn't do a director's commentary on dvd like all his other films stone has nothing to be ashamed of most directors would kill to get a shot a film like this br br the claustrophobia of the studio is intense and the opinions of are still very crucial arguments for today the all drugs speech is powerful and you might find yourself agreeing with him in my opinion the film is about freedom of speech and how sometimes people don't like hearing things they don't agree with the speeches and conversations with the listeners are very compelling even disturbing a chill ran down my spine when a crazed man calls saying he has to rape again because the city drives him crazy is totally shocking the tension is sometimes unbearable with a scene when heavy metaller kent becomes unhinged of course does himself no favours by ridiculing him or should i say bogosian is fearless in film and performance totally mesmerising a shame th other big role was the villain in under siege 2 dear god one scene th didn't ring true was when barry's boss dan alec baldwin gets him to calm down barry doesn't seem to be the kind of person who shuts up and does as he's told it seemed a bit contrived and clichÃ©d the scenes outside the studio are criticised for being too formulaic it's true because stone is trying to make the film more cinematic and allow the viewer to see beginnings but it doesn't entirely work br br it is a brilliantly cinematic film with extreme close ups deep focus extremely fast cuts a fantastic 360 set which is used for the final breathtaking monologue must see cinema it makes it rare because it was ignored the time but is now receiving attention again which it so richly deserves a classic th should be studied by generations of film students br br 10 out of 10 for inventive use of bad to the bone before t2 brilliant supporting cast including john c mcginley dr cox from scrubs as the sleazy stu leslie hope 24 as girlfriend john and alec baldwin as the suits and micheal wincott who plays three roles a very underrated actor the tension between the listeners and which is very heart racing times and of course kudos to the stars bogosian and stone for such a fantastic piece of cinema enjoy
<START> you know i've been in some towns where the girls weren't all that pretty in fact i've been in some towns where they're downright ugly but it's the first time i've been in a town where there are no girls at all i am sure the fans of great classic remember this phrase that belongs to vin one of the truly magnificent seven from the first movie br br now i'd want to re phrase him here you know i've seen some movies where the plot isn't all that good in fact i've seen some movies where the plot is terrible but that's first time in my life that i saw the film where there isn't any plot at all br br ok maybe my above statement is little bit over the top but honestly how one can call the plot a crap that is going on in this movie the bad guy oh don't ask me to give you his name because i don't remember and his not even somehow close to who's name and character is unforgettable is trying to build the church in the name of his late sons that were killed in some battle and this bad guy is kidnapping poor villagers to force them to build the church br br first of all how big must be church to have to force hundreds of villagers to build it is it some egyptian pyramid or something but ok let's stop here about the plot and absolutely forgettable character of a bad guy and let's say few words about the seven itself br br yul good old chris always calm always silent talking less but talking wise is gone unfortunately oh no he's as calm as he was but now he's calmness are so fake that you just don't buy it imagine he meets a good old friend chico who he must rescue after so many years and there is just a few hi hello and not even handshake as far as i remember honestly it looks more like meeting of two strangers in some internet chat rather then meeting of chris and chico that makes new chris more look like robocop or terminator rather then our beloved wise br br i won't stop here talking about other characters there simply aren't any imagine if strong actor like yul brynner is so much fake forgettable then what will be other characters look like br br there still are some attempts to give us a background story for each one of them for example one is women favorite guy second is a man with dark past who's wife was raped and killed by indians and he since then is killing everyone and everything that is moving but non of these characters are making any sense or non of them can take your heart br br i remember i was a little child and when o'reilly charles bronson's character died in the first movie i was crying here i just didn't care about each one of them even if whole of them with all the crew of the film would die it seems i wouldn't care more br br so please go and see this movie i recommend it because you won't have the other chance to see something worse then it
<START> the concorde airport '79 starts in washington where a man named carl parker macon contacts high profile tv news reporter maggie whelan susan blakely in order to hand secret documents over that prove his boss kevin robert wagner owner president of harrison industries that develop weapons for the military has been illegally selling said weapons to foreign countries however maggie sees carl assassinated she barely escapes with her life maggie is to catch the concorde to moscow via paris the next morning intends to blow the whistle on harrison who also happens to be her boyfriend which would ruin him determined to save himself he his hi tech homing missile to intercept destroy the concorde during a test run killing all those on board destroying the documented evidence br br renamed airport '80 the concorde for it's cinema initial home video releases because it was released here in well 1980 rather than 1979 this last entry in the airport franchise was directed by david lowell rich is a notoriously bad film that was apparently laughed at during press test screenings prompting universal to promote the film as an action comedy the first thing to say is that the concorde airport '79 is a really silly downright daft film but on a purely entertainment basis i can think of a lot worse films to spend 108 minutes watching i really can i quite liked the absurd plot about a wealthy industrialist wanting to kill his girlfriend tv reporter before she can expose him as an illegal arms dealer but this guy doesn't do subtle decides the best way to do it is to blow concorde up with his own guided missile then gets a fighter pilot to try shoot it down before finally sabotaging it so really there's three mini disaster flicks in one here as each time super pilot joe patroni manages to save the day you know joe patroni played by george kennedy appears in all four airport films goes from mechanic in the first to concorde pilot in this also i reckon he's a bit of a jinx since in the space of nine years he has been involved with four major aviation disasters i think the real reason why the airport series stopped here was because patroni retired after this the jinx was lifted some of the things that happen here are just silly patroni does barrel rolls flies upside down out a guided missile in a huge concorde not to mention he crash lands it fires flare guns out of his window to destroy the missile all while keeping a calm head this guy is good very good then there's the character's there's a saxophone playing black dude who smokes weed in the toilets an old woman with a bladder problem a team of russian gymnasts with bad accents also despite being almost shot down with a missile then attacked by a jet fighter the passengers of concorde don't seem that bothered happily get back aboard the following day i don't know about you but after that i would probably find a safer way to travel why do the police or authorities not question anyone why is the concorde captain patroni allowed to just go off sleep with a french prostitute the concorde airport '79 certainly isn't boring is full of memorable moments i was entertained in a way although it's far from a good film modern audiences may not have the patience with it hell i liked it for what it was in a daft way but it's no sort of classic br br even though concorde no longer flies it's still quite a cool looking air plane there's plenty of footage of it here the one used in the concorde airport '79 was the seventh one built this concorde was also the same aircraft which crashed after a tire bust caused a fuel tank to rupture and the leaking fuel catch fire on july 25th 2000 while taking off in paris sadly resulting in the death of 109 passengers and crew on board and 4 people on the ground when this aired on tv in the us in 1982 almost twenty minutes of new footage was included with most if not all of it being newly shot over two years after the original production had finished i know the effects here take a bashing from most but i don't reckon they are too bad when you consider this was made in the late 70's i think they come across quite well the camera moves during effects shots real footage of real planes is used rather than toy models which in my opinion would have looked a lot worse i could certainly see what the makers were trying to do with limited funds limited technology in a strange way they are quite impressive actually without ever looking that good if you know what i mean probably the most action packed of all the airport films there's missiles exploding planes daring crash landings assassinations a guy named robert palmer no not the singer giving head a woman in a jacuzzi br br the imdb says this had a budget of about 14 000 000 which is actually more than i thought maybe those special effects aren't so impressive after all shot in utah washington los angeles france the acting isn't great here people don't look worried enough that they are about to die goerge kennedy gets some bad one liners while robert wagner plays the bad guy br br the concorde airport '79 is fun for bad film enthusiasts everywhere to be brutally honest i rather watch this entertaining mess of a film than some two hour oscar nominated bore
<START> i went straight to the big screen to view this kicker this is the only flick that i know of that singh has directed but boy was it intense this movie was a total mind and one of the best special effects flick of this kind br br the characters were vibrant and and nothing short of beings created in your own mind or nightmare this movie is scary and interesting and totally bombs the senses with fear and exhilaration this movie compares to no other i have seen except for the level of being beautifully odd in that respect it is a fairly large step above a clockwork orange ' definitely see this movie on the big screen and don't wait for it to come out on tape it won't be half as good on tape br br this movie is not for the easily freaked out it will mess with your mind and leave you with images that take a while to forget but for those who like to be freaked out enjoy
