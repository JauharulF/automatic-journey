<START> if you'd like a great april fool's joke then please by all means show this film to someone however it is important that you in no way criticize the film but instead talk about what an artistic triumph it is and how they just don't make great films like this any more as your victim watches many disconnected and nonsensical scenes such as a cute dog getting punted for no apparent reason a cow standing on the bed a woman licking a statue's feet or jesus apparently raping a woman make lots of comments using words like brilliance juxtaposed or transcendent all the while acting as if the film actually makes perfect sense and isn't a complete waste of an hour of your life also be sure to keep a straight face and feign shock when and if they say that they either didn't understand it or thought it had all the artistry of a cow patty then to further mess with them show them all the comments on imdb as nearly all except for a few trouble makers like and talk about what genius and artistry this film is by the time you are done with this little charade they'll most likely think they are idiots and will make an appointment with a psychologist br br this to me is the only possible reason to watch this horrid mess of a film that or you could show it to the prisoners at guantanamo in order to get them to talk br br if you ask me the famous painting of dogs playing poker or a velvet elvis painting are superior artistically
<START> okay make no mistake this is a pretty awful film but i actually thought it had a couple of creepy scenes and overcame its pathetic budget every now and then at the very least it's unintentionally funny in spots and has a definite air of creepiness and discomfort a face burning scene the part with the disfigured bride br br this baby falls into the so bad it's entertaining category to me and for that alone i would give it a star the effects are terrible the acting is abysmal and the whole thing looks like it was shot in a day you gotta love that toy ship at the beginning too it brought back childhood memories of seeing this on late night tv many years ago while the alpha dvd print looks weak and as though it was recorded directly off an old television broadcast or something i actually liked that in this case
<START> his music especially what we hear of it here is very slow from around the time of bach's death composers had been working out ways of making music progress at a slower and slower pace over a century later wagner and then wrote pieces that are about as slow as it is possible for music to get of course one can cheat by writing a 4 4 march and then a tempo of say 1 but that tempo wouldn't be the correct tempo wagner and wrote music that is properly played at a snail's pace given that the slowness in no sense sounds too slow snail's pace is the wrong expression a critic wrote of a famous wagner conductor he doesn't beat time he beats eternity for all i know this was meant as a compliment br br i get the feeling that around the early 1970s directors worked out how to make the slowest possible films there's death in venice and there's solyaris i much prefer the former for one thing solyaris steps over the line or some line and becomes soporific death in venice is gripping from beginning to end not much happens but it all happens in the right sequence at the right pace with photography you can get lost in br br another way of cheating with music by the way is to write something that doesn't really have a tempo at all such music sounds slow but is really just just as many films feel slow because they lack rhythm and form death in venice isn't one of them beautiful in every respect it will remind you of the timelessness and of quality you need no theoretical knowledge to respond to visconti's mastery as you do to respond to a lesser director's incompetence it's a great work
<START> i admit it now this is one of the lamest films ever made but in mr defense the not really scene wasn't all bad br br and you gotta love the effort of going all the way to sweden just to find a sweet swedish 15 year old blonde have her speak swedish posing as the jewish mother of henry dennis hopper br br what makes this scene so perfect is that father answers the blonde swedish speaking jewish girl in german br br the best actor actress of all in the film must be the nun who takes care of mother this is a woman who has had no experience whatsoever of acting but still puts in the most convincing performance of all br br all and all this flick is nostalgia for me personally it is after all what gave me a posting on imdb s database d br br like a movie star
<START> i watched this movie tonight and i do need to say that it is horrible i expected it to be great because you know usually we don't have many movies about asian vampires mixed with asian culture but already in the beginning it started in a bad way the introduction of the movie seemed not to have an end the plot is so weak and if you take the fights and the soundtrack off you really don't have anything useful at all the director of this film doesn't look to have some important notions about how much time to spend in introduction and flashbacks for example not to mention some other things br br for people like me who wants to watch a great vampire movie i really recommend to watch or ''the interview with the
<START> out of the 600 or so spaghetti westerns made this has got to be in the top twenty somewhere can not believe this hasn't received any reviews gemma is excellent in this van johnson is good too though his dubbed voice is a little off but that's the charm of the italian style beautiful photography and some excellently staged action all the supporting characters are well played the severity of the racist streak in the bad guys is pretty tough even by todays standards which creates an emotional depth to character in some of the situations that take place absolutely fantastic score by luis see this is in the wonderful wide screen dvd from japan a spaghetti must have
<START> this movie was unbelievably bad it's gory but the violence is just too much to the point where it looks extremely fake and predictable since everything is shown to you there is nothing left to the imagination and the plot what plot there really isn't any the pacing is unbelievably slow despite the random acts of violence and the screenplay must have been written by a deranged 12 year old kid who kills kittens for fun so this movie was banned in 31 countries i could see why not because of the gore boring and trite but because it was a terrible movie it should have been banned from existence avoid this one like the plague 1 out of 10
<START> a great movie with a rather unclear political message itÂ´s shot in a theatrical style i c most of the action takes place inside mayor and diana ashcroft seem equally suspicious of each other emotions run high since the western tourists and business people seem unwilling and unable to yield to the eastern russian charm of the mayor although he makes every effort to understand their point of view the two opposite world views are made pointedly clear but the movie also shows that human emotions cannot be controlled by politics its powerfully acted and has a high emotional impact for a 50s movie
<START> this little picture succeeds where many a big picture fails because it was a little picture john ford was not harassed by the studio big wigs he was happier with this film than any other because he was able to do it his way he was also able to use his repertoire of gifted character actors that had played such an important role in his past successes some of them such as ben johnson had been discovered by ford and given opportunity to show their talents johnson was recruited by ford because he was an authentic cowboy from oklahoma who usually did his own stunt work years later he would win the coveted academy award for his brilliant performance in the last picture show ward bond even outshines ben johnson in this movie he is not the wagon master that role is played by johnson but because of this movie he was later given the role of wagon master in the classic television series wagon train ironically one of the bad guys in wagon master james arness would star in the hit television series gunsmoke on a rival network to wagon train ward bond plays the leader of the mormons heading west who often to his days by cussing only to be called down by fellow mormon adam perkins russell simpson when any bothersome situation arises elder ward bond yells blow your horn sister the mormon sister played to perfection by jane darwell then blows so hard and loud that even the devil must have been shaken by the sound darwell and simpson were famous for playing ma and pa in ford's classic version of the john novel the grapes of wrath br br another of the great character actors in ford's company was hank worden who plays one of uncle shiloh notoriously mean but not too bright outlaw sons worden would become famous a few years later for playing in ford's the searchers worden lived to be 91 he was still making movies when he died br br the wagon master travis blue ben johnson and his partner sandy harry carey jr are horse traders who never take their job seriously having a lot of fun along the way especially with the local sheriff they get mixed up with a mormon wagon train heading west ford's beloved monument valley is the setting for most of the film the main reason for the teaming is a redheaded mormon beauty prudence perkins kathleen who catches sandy's eye along the way the train picks up a hoochie show which includes a charlatan doctor alan mowbray and two soiled angels joanne dru and ruth clifford also joining up along the way is the clegg family wanted for murder and armed robbery ford shows how arduous a journey west by wagon was in those days br br the songs in the film were written by stan jones of the legendary sons of the pioneers jones' writing was almost as good as that of bob nolan who had previously done much of the writing for the group jones' most famous song not in this film is the much recorded ghost riders in the sky the sons of the pioneers do the background singing in wagon master this adds to the overall impact of wagons rolling west br br it should also be noted that the acclaimed native american athlete jim from oklahoma plays the role of a navajo leader this was his last film appearance he died not long after wagon master was released
<START> i cannot believe i sat through this utter waste of time i was just too fascinated by how unspeakably bad it was that i couldn't move it reminded me of the feeling when you can't take your eyes away from a horrible car crash or the rotting carcass of a cow you can't help but look but you feel sick and nauseated afterward br br let me elaborate plan 9 from outer space for instance is not a bad movie not even star wars holiday special is a bad movie they both are awful to watch for sure but they both have some qualities and at least they leave you the strength to reach for the off button br br this remake in name only of the sci fi classic left me weeping on my couch desperately trying to come to terms with why such scripts get filmed why anyone would soil the memory of the original classic and whether or not i could resume my normal life without my suddenly acquired longing for the quiet and peace of death br br although death i realized would offer no rest from the horrid memories of this pile of crap as the poor souls in hell are probably forced to watch it over and over again for eternity
<START> may i never have to go to this hospital or hospice if i want to be politically correct which ass coined this asinine phrase anyway for anything other than directions on how to get out of town george c did a masterful job playing the burned out over worked cynic who has come to the conclusion that his life has been a waste but is helpless to change his environment or conditions even when given a golden opportunity which probably wasn't so golden anyway i got several laughs out of this brutally black comedy however at the same time was and often chilled to the marrow because i fear this very atmosphere pervades most houses of healing even as i write
<START> i had very high hopes walking into this movie after all ocean's 11 was a truly great hollywood product its rapid fire jokes incredible star power and tight script made it one of the most fun caper films i have ever seen of course with all the money it made a sequel was on the way and i for one was excited br br needless to say i was absolutely blown away by this movie blown away by how horribly wrong things can go this movie had everything going for it the return of the entire original cast the same director news stories of crazy on and off set antics how could it possibly have gone so wrong br br it starts immediately with one of the most awkward and unnecessary opening sequences ever and goes downhill from there after reasonably goofy short scenes between pitt zeta jones and clooney roberts the film spends several minutes watching andy garcia waltz from scene to scene telling each individual member of danny ocean's original eleven that he wants his money back believe me when i say that these scenes are only here to pad andy garcia's running time because without these ridiculously awkward shots his screen time would be well under five minutes br br this leads me to another major qualm i had with this film the pacing is so uneven that characters are dropped completely from the story and only sometimes brought back later bernie mac's character is dropped from the script early on and never comes back except for 2 short scenes with no dialogue garcia appears for the first few minutes and returns for an exceptionally brief scene at the end roberts shows up for about 5 minutes at the beginning and isn't even mentioned again until there's about 20 25 minutes left even clooney himself spends a large chunk of the film in prison br br this would all be excusable if the film was funny at all 90 of the jokes fall completely flat and the ones that do work are worth a chuckle at best the plot is undeniably worthless and left me feeling cheated at one point in the film the team takes on a job worth 2 5 million of the nearly 100 million they need to raise before garcia's two week deadline several characters even acknowledge how absurd wasting the time to do this job is but they do it anyway over 30 minutes of the film revolve around this job that they shouldn't even be doing and one gets the feeling that this part of the plot was simply added to pad the running time furthermore the equipment they use to pull this job off clearly cost millions upon millions to fund just wait until you see what they do to pull this job and realize it would cost far more than 2 5 million to pull off obviously because of this they have to pull off several jobs to make the money the beauty of the first film was the one big con and how ingeniously and intricately it was pulled off here they pull so many jobs in so many different ways that they rush through all of them because to explain them would make the film several hours long br br we all know walking into this film that there will be a big twist at the end thus is the nature of the caper film the twist at the end of ocean's twelve made me laugh not because it was funny but because i couldn't believe how cheated i felt i won't give it away because i know most of you will be foolish enough to throw down the money to see this movie anyway br br what i will say is that it makes most of the 2 hours you have sat through already completely irrelevant br br i was excited to see this film after absolutely adoring ocean's 11 i left the theater feeling like i had been the victim of a truly great con pulled by the cast and crew of this movie in tricking me into thinking that this movie would actually be worth watching i have never given a 1 to a movie on imdb com but there's a first time for everything consider yourselves warned 1 10
<START> oh my god where to begin terror is one of the worst b horror movies ever made this crap makes demon slayer look like the exorcist special note a horror b movie needs to have at least one sex scene don't expect even a hot girl in this one with that inexcusable mistake i should begin with the complete bash br br first of all if you're going to make a horror monster movie you should spend big part of the budget in creating a cool monster outfit the monster in this movie looks like a 10 halloween costume there is no way the yes this is how it is spelled looks menacing in the movie it's an actor in a halloween outfit please it looks so cheap it makes me mad br br second the gore effects are the spinal cord of any direct to video monster horror movie again the producers decided not to spend for decent gore effects the blood looks damn fake please take a close look at the guy that gets chopped in two that's probably the best scene in the movie and it lasts for about ten seconds the ending is a very poor scene that won't leave you satisfied br br the acting is the last thing you should expect to have quality in these kind of movies but in this movie it's beyond terrible a cast of nobodies with no acting experience make the fool out of themselves for about 85 minutes special mention deserves a blonde guy with curly hair that tries to convince swat members that he is sick the coughing he fakes is beyond laughable he's probably the worst actor ever in a b horror movie no kidding also captain peÃ±a delivers a terrible performance in the first ten minutes of the flick br br the true story behind the is not even told all you get to know is that the monster sucks goat's blood why bother with this piece of crap do not even watch it even if you have the chance not even if it airs on cable br br i usually support low budget horror movies because the people involved in them at least try to do something different than hollywood but that doesn't means that horror fans like me should accept this kind of garbage
<START> i put this film in the queue on a whim after a recent trip to nyc and i couldn't believe i'd never heard of it anywhere it has all the makings of a cult classic starting with the characters they are archetypal roles we recognize from every stretch of daily life but were so nuanced and fully realized by the actors playing them peter stormare and bai ling's performances were particularly strong their interactions are poignant and grounded while at the same time brimming with a subtle quirky humor that is sadly all too rare in american films these days writer director ramin does a beautiful job of weaving these scenes together into a funny and moving portrait of a city of the past highly recommended
<START> perhaps we are too much attached to great spectacles when we hear of antiquity brought to screen perhaps we expect too much from these films however if we as viewers are offered far too little what happens then br br that is what i thought after seeing by paul marcus a part of the production series on the roman empire augustus by roger young the first movie included at least peter o'toole but what does this movie include br br hardly anything accurate the historical errors are so serious that the movie changes facts and constitutes rather a distorted image of the roman empire than the true history throughout the movie we see nero young young man during the allegedly long reign of caligula young man during the reign of claudius and finally during his own historically 14 year long reign and he dies the same according to the movie nero born during the reign of lives for more than 40 years but looks to be in his late twenties when he dies continuity combined with made up history is the biggest problem of the movie which makes it hardly logical not to say reliable nero loses his father is raised by slaves at that time his mother is exiled by caligula later however she suddenly marries emperor claudius who already has big children with freshly married to him at these moments of the movie we see schmid nero's mistress all right it is historically accurate yet no source proves that she played such a decisive role in the rise of christianity in rome in the film she is not only a devoted christian but even a witness of st paul's miracle he brings a young girl marzia back to life besides there was historically nothing like nero seen on the court of caligula since nero was born in caligula's 4 year long reign a d 37 41 i understand that movies may change something but such an error makes the script absolutely unreliable and many many other shortcomings concerning content that are hard to but after 30 minutes of watching this film i doubted whether i was watching a historical movie or a total fantasy br br as for its artistic features which supply us with entertainment they are equally lame as the history here is the performances are artificial the cast simply have beautiful faces but weak acting abilities perhaps i am too much attached to peter ustinov or charles laughton in the lead but hans matheson does not fit as nero at all he could have some of the good moments as an actor but never as the infamous roman emperor is he an artist who burns rome for a song is he a cynic who disguises the love to his relatives is he a cruel ruler who sacrifices the lives of thousands of innocent people for the sake of alleged justice none of these he is just a young man who does not know how to rule and in the long run begins to release the fire burning within himself john is out of place in this film as caligula and absolutely inferior to other portrayals of the character elisa is only sexy as yet she could have been much much better the costumes are inaccurate and the sets do not amaze low budget results in low effects and consequently low entertainment br br but what made me most angry in this movie and as a result i give it 1 10 are some moments that are absolutely unacceptable br br the death of and st paul's talk with nero at her dead body br br claudius' mention of the current conquest of britannia on the feast and soon his death he conquered britannia while was his wife much before his death br br killing laura morante nero's mother br br nero's arguments in the speech to the senators br br finally nero's death a calm day at the lake and an indifferent suicide that leads to a moral said by let us forgive him br br all in all this film is a waste of time and is absolutely unneeded as yet another production concerning the roman empire it's better to make one good film in 30 years than ten minor little ones in 5 years 1 10 should not have been made at all
