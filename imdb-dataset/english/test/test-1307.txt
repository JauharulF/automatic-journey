<START> a trite fish out of water story about two friends from the midwest who move to the big city to seek their fortune they become playboy bunnies and nothing particularly surprising happens after that the final 15 minutes are especially cheesy but at least the bunnies looked good
<START> what is about mathematical geniuses that get the critics juices flowing a beautiful mind wasn t up to much in my opinion fellowship of the ring deserved the oscar that year while good will hunting had several awards lavished on it undeservedly br br first off is the script when i attended film school i was told good will hunting is a very good example on how not to start a script and the tutor was right this movie lacks any type of opening hook and for the most part it s very very slow if you wrote an unsolicited script like this the script reader would have given up on it by page 15 br br structure aside the idea of a member of the american underclass being some sort of intellectual god doesn t really ring true ask yourself this if he s the character in the movie how come he s gone through his short life without anyone noticing his abilities not one single teacher from his childhood noticed his gift highly unlikely as is the fact he s read so much mind expanding and if will s so clever how come he s so of what happens to young good looking boys in american prisons br br but it s the casting that let much of the film down you want to get a couple of actors to play rough tough irish gang members let s get matt damon and ben affleck which is like getting russell crowe to play a pacifist or charles bronson to play a liberal do gooder i failed to be convinced by the foul mouthed damon and affleck as they about smacking people in the chops and couldn t help thinking that even though they wrote the script the parts should have been awarded to different actors after all billy bob thornton has written screenplays for films he hasn t been cast in and the same criteria should have been applied here br br there are some good points to the movie robin williams is excellent as the man who tries to show will his potential and also very good is stellan who is quite simply one of the greatest character actors to stepped foot outside of europe and despite my previous criticism of the script there is quite a moving piece of dialogue at the park as williams character explains to will what he has seen in life br br but i ve got to repeat that there s less plus points than negatives to this movie and i ve got to agree with the people who ve said good will hunting is boring and unconvincing
<START> it is unsettling seeing so many people giving outrageously high ratings to this film some of the praise uses such twisted reasoning and transparent agendas that betray a simple love of anything that is in any way critical of the u s that it approaches hysteria br br heaven's gate is a bad movie it is fundamentally awful endless scenes using elaborate shots that serve no purpose muddy dialogue murky no sense of any theme aside from excess br br the high rating of this disaster is a product of revisionist history and temporary shifts in perception br br for some perspective watch lawrence of arabia before watching heaven's gate you will see just how aimless and lost this film truly is the issues it may have been trying to deal with are lost in a miasma br br i have no problem with films that are critical of the u s per se but when a terrible film gets such undeserved praise purely because of that element that's worth challenging br br the film is worth seeing for two reasons curiosity and as a cautionary tale for young filmmakers br br i saw this at home for free imagine the torture of being in a theater and sitting through it for 4 meandering hours
<START> this movie wasn't the best but it did have some good actors in it washington was pretty good as a homeless guy guy was good as his handicapped brother ice t was humorous as the landlord and surprisingly the actress tami roman was good as the judge in the movie i didn't even know it was her and i am a die hard real world fan she was totally believable hopefully this movie won't hinder these actors development i know that has left this movie far behind with the success of grey's anatomy ice t with his regular role on nypd special unit and tami roman has landed a recurring role on sex love and secrets new soap opera i wish the same for the other actors because one bad movie doesn't a bad actor make
<START> hi guys this is my first review and i would had to have picked the worst movie to review as i only watched 5 minutes of it but trust me you could see this movie was going nowhere the acting was deplorable the camera work and lighting looked as though it was shot and run by a pack of 10 year old's no offence to 10 year olds i just couldn't take anymore i got off my couch took the the house of adam dvd out of the dvd player and threw it in the garbage maybe if you are a colin farrell fan this movie may interest you because the character in the movie anthony is a colin farrell look a like but that is as far as it goes he certainly will never have acting abilities i gave this movie a rating of 1 awful only because there were no minuses in the drop down list cheers
<START> for the most part i considered this movie unworthy of a comment but the last 10 minutes prompted me to write one you see right then we learn spoilers if they can be called that that the devil's emissary has no chance of properly preparing the domination of the world by his master because he is not skilled at martial arts has been lying in a hole for centuries waiting for human greed to release him only to be defeated in a simple one on one match against 54 year old former karate champion chuck norris imagine what would have happened to him if he had taken on jackie chan 1 2
<START> eaten alive plays out like a bad rehearsal for the following year's cannibal ferox the characters are universally bland the locations are criminally under utilized there's no attempt to create tension or suspense the physical effects are either laughably bad or shamelessly stolen from other movies and the ubiquitous tribal rape scenes are barely worthy of a pg 13 even the scenes of animal are more tedious than usual the only mildly shocking scene involves crazy jonas going a bit goldfinger wielding a blood soaked dildo a scene that is just plain bizarre rather than graphic my beloved wife she of the 'romeo and juliet collector's watched this movie without so much as a wince of disgust and it calls itself a cannibal movie all in all a pretty lame effort that thoroughly betrays the cannibal tradition cannibal ferox follow up is a far superior example of the genre
<START> i am a christian and thought this movie was pretty good while the acting wasn't academy award caliber i thought it was good considering the cast has had limited acting experience at the time this movie was made br br the gospel message and the transforming power of jesus christ was explained wonderfully the message that the director was trying to get across which is the important thing not how the characters dressed definitely got through the theme of having the main characters involved in illegal drag racing was a good idea too cool muscle cars btw i think this movie will definitely reach out to a lot of young people br br i would definitely recommend this movie it is a great witnessing tool
<START> ok this may contain spoilers but who really cares do not if you value the seconds in your life waste your time on this pile of garbage there is not one redeeming quality in this movie and i say that as a full fan of the vacation series of movies i loved the cousin eddie character from the other vacation movies but he only works well as a supporting character do i blame randy quaid for the failure of this movie not at all i think he's a great actor but this film lacks any cohesion the pacing is off it's just plain unfunny and the actor who plays the third jake thomas was just awful more than likely due to a real lack of direction i don't know why but his whole character creeped me out br br some people say that this is a horrible movie because chevy chase and beverly d'angelo aren't in it that has nothing to do with it the script directing acting special effects everything is a train wreck with orphans and kittens oh and the train ran over some old people too br br please whatever you do stay away from this filth i call it filth because it dirties the name of the vacation franchise
<START> may contain spoilers br br an innocent trailer park or maybe la white kid witnesses a terrible childhood tragedy relating to drugs and violence an unprofessional but dedicated police partners try to take down a high end club drug ring only to be fired and chewed out by the the drug lords high priced attorneys the plot thickens as more people come back to seek vengeance and justice with a predictable ending the only memorable part was a walk on by ron jeremy br br if i was in a movie theater i would have asked for a refund i feel sorry for the poor actors in this movie it was just awful and painful to watch the worst part was the cinematography were the director kept flashing back within the same scene so the sound would not quite match and no it was not a codec nor dvd problem but an intentional technique two stars
<START> ok here's the short of it this movie is full of corny dialogue over the top acting and a threadbare script br br there are moments that intended to be very dramatic but simply come off humorous because of the over the top acting and poorly written lines i couldn't help laughing at moments that were meant to be very serious the bright spot in this movie is the circus seeing the circus in its heyday was certainly a treat br br there are moments that come through as good but then it right back into b movie territory i was tempted to stop watching it several times br br i certainly don't know how it won best picture however it must have been a slow year
<START> i gave it a rating of 3 out of 10 br br and what's sad is i made a point of looking up the movie schedule for that channel so i wouldn't miss seeing it i wanted to watch this film because it is based on a book by one of my favorite authors barbara wilson as a lesbian i expected to love this film br br i don't know how ms wilson felt about the film but i found it a major disappointment br br it should have been intriguing it was a mystery set in spain and the main character cassandra is a language translator who gets contacted by a mysterious beautiful woman who offers cassandra a great deal of money to locate her ex husband ben br br there are secrets galore revealed but for some reason it just didn't matter it was like oh so what i could not get involved with these characters or come to care about them or feel for them i couldn't even identify with these characters br br i think a large part of the film's failure was the actress playing the main character she looked old tired worn out and as dull as dishwater her hair was a perpetual mess her baggy clothes were boring and she just was not appealing or interesting br br the best part of the film was getting to hear a dean martin recording but even that was ruined by the weird make up worn by the man who was dancing and lip synching to the song believe me it was nothing like getting to see the suavely handsome mr martin performing it br br the ending is so syrupy you'll wish you had some pancakes to go with the syrup br br
<START> this is a truly awful film lou diamond phillips simply calls this one in the use of miniature models of the train are laughable the plot seems to develop on the run there is an alien on board oh and an eco terrorist is on board too oh and the conductor is dead and the train is out of control oh and the train is going to run into another train one hour ahead oh and that train has nuclear waste on it i mean come on really the alien monsters are not scary although there are a lot of them and the acting is abysmal check out the guy playing the next president do you really think he could be president for goodness sake he has spent his whole acting career playing bad guys
<START> i have not seen a van damme flick for a while pleasantly surprised he still has it looking older but tougher kind of like sly becomes more rugged with age this is a good flick and has prompted me to take a look at all the van damme movies i have missed over the last ten years i would like to see a good director put van damme on the big screen with a good plot van damme still has the moves to amaze the audiences the last movie viewed with van damme was legionnaire that was a good flick as well in addition i looked in to van damme's early fighting history i too my amazement i realized he is the real deal very accomplished martial artist in his younger years
<START> why did they change the cute rugrats television show we all know and love into a lame attempt to target teens they don't have to do that all ages watch the regular rugrats when i heard about this i thought hey they made a tv series about the movie except they're really grown up as a teenager this is going to be better when i saw it it was just as if i was watching as told by ginger except they made it suck great job br br when in the rugrats series has tommy been a director never basically all the episodes in this attempted series is about tommy's love of directing i don't like that i rather watch plots that change every episode not the same thing over and over also when did in the old series have each character have their own sides of the story never this series did that i didn't like that everyone separated i don't want to see angelica's side of the story i hate her br br i do not recommend this show if you like as told by ginger and the rugrats
