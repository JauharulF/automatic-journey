<START> horrible horrible movie i still can't believe my friend talked me into seeing this no plot bad acting unfunny scenes and very very stupid dialogue all i have to say is that this movie is the worst movie i have seen and it's worse than halloween iii which i gave 0 stars too so i give it 0 stars and a 0 out of 10 well on here a 1 but you get the point
<START> this movie is not only about feelings and human emotions it is also about everything that could be but it's not poetry in movies can be awfully boring and annoying but this movie is delightful to be watched not to mention the amazing irÃ¨ne jacob a great actress in france one of the best actually when the movie ends you can only feel sorry after all when something is truly great we want more well for another great movie by k with irÃ¨ne jacob we can always watch la double vie de
<START> your time and brains will be much better spent reading or listening to charlie wilson's war phillip seymour hoffman plays the most enjoyable character in the movie gust the greek and he plays him as a eunuch gust in the book is hard core and completely free to speak his mind in the movie he's not even shown as being equally important to charlie and poor charlie is never shown donating blood which he did every time he visited the camps in pakistan in short the movie is too bland and the history is too old for our modern time we don't really care about the end of the cold war and the defeat of the soviet union which happened in spite of reagan not as a result of by a well financed group of people who were extremely willing to fight not quite the lesson we need to be hearing and seeing considering how well the wars in iraq and afghanistan are going as i read the book i kept getting that deja vu feeling except it was present day
<START> wrestlemania 6 is an entertaining wrestlemania if not an entirely successful one the ultimate challenge is of course worth the price of admission alone but once again as with a lot of the early there's too much filler in between the crowd pops for almost everything and as always giving us the reliable announcing team of gorilla the body having a face vs face match as the main event for a wrestlemania was absolutely unheard of at this time it only made things that much more tense br br matches br br koko b ware w frankie vs the model rick martel for a 3 or so minute match this is as good as it gets i wish it was a tad longer but what i got was pretty damn good martel wins with the boston crab br br 2 1 2 5 br br wwf tag team championship demolition vs colossal connection c w bobby huge pop for demolition match itself is pretty dull i often had trouble paying attention andre really didn't do much so in a way it was more like a 2 on 1 there is solid talent involved here and it's a shame they couldn't produce better demolition wins that titles with there maneuver off the top crowd blows the roof of for the finish br br 1 1 2 5 br br earthquake w jimmy hart vs hercules i got what i expected here a standard boring filler match with earthquake doing his thing i'm not really a fan of either so it didn't perk my interest much quake wins with his sit down splash br br 1 5 br br brutus beefcake vs mr w the genius deafening pop for really good match up with sadly not enough time given to develop even further it really kept my interest and remains one of my favorites on the card beefcake wins with a slingshot to the post much to the crowd's approval br br 3 5 br br roddy piper vs bad news brown huge pop for piper nothing more than a boring brawl that does not know what it wants to be some entertaining antics from the hot rod but nothing else noteworthy for roddy painting himself half black and calling himself hot scott br br 1 5 br br the hart foundation vs the bolsheviks record breaking but other than that nothing to see here harts win with the hart attack br br 0 5 br br the barbarian w bobby vs tito santana average for the time it got but watchable nonetheless crowd was rather dead for it except for interference jessie's hilarious cracks about tito's food is more entertaining then the match itself barbarian wins with a nasty looking flying clothesline off the top br br 2 5 br br mixed tag match dusty sapphire w elizabeth vs macho king sherri big pop for dusty and an even bigger one for elizabeth who looks absolutely stunning might i add i thought it was ok it was lively at least if nothing that great i'm not a fan of so dusty and sapphire win when she rolls up sherri br br 2 5 br br the orient express w fuji vs the rockers crowd is rather anemic for this surprisingly decent no doubt but with these guys involved it should have been better the constant focus with fuji kinda detracts from the match express wins by count out when janetty gets nailed with salt br br 2 1 2 5 br br jim duggan vs dino bravo w earthquake jimmy hart duggan like an idiot brings out the american flag in canada duggan gets some solid for it too but that also may be due to bravo's canadian heritage crappy match all around i don't care for duggan but that's not why it sucked too short in the end to really matter duggan wins when he whacks bravo in the back with the two by four duggan gets splashed for his troubles br br 0 5 br br million dollar championship ted dibiase c w virgil vs jake robers w damien some slow spots but when all was said and done i had a good time two solid wrestlers giving it there all resulted in an entertaining match up crowd noticeably gets during parts of it though by doing the wave dibiase wins by count out jake has the last laugh by giving away some of his money much to the crowd's delight br br 3 5 br br big bossman vs akeem w slick nice pop for the bossman too routine and too short to really mean anything in the end akeem was a gimmick i was never too fond of bossman wins with his slam br br 0 5 br br the rhythm blues segment was pretty much a failure crowd wasn't into it br br rick rude w bobby vs jimmy snuka for a filler match before the main event this wasn't too bad if it had time to get going more it would have been excellent for sure rude wins with the rude awakening br br 2 5 br br title for title ultimate warrior ic champ vs hulk hogan wwf champ this one is all about the atmosphere from the crowd and the split crowd reaction for the most part warrior got a pretty decent pop but in my opinion it was a little underwhelming hogan dwarfs it completely with his it's one of wrestlemania's best matches in history with two people who aren't really known for there wrestling they managed to create an amazing match up that was talked about for ages i have seen this many times and my respect level grows higher for each one for their effort considering i'm not a fan of either even die hard fanatics who crave pure wrestling can't bitch about this one warrior wins with his splash br br 5 5 br br bottom line wrestlemania 6 is an entertaining entry if nothing overly special it's memorable for the main event the location and the crowd but it's not one of the best if you ask me that being said i do enjoy it and i give it my recommendation to fellow wrestling fans br br 7 10
<START> an interesting comedy taking place on a train from stockholm to berlin december 1945 one can't help to feel sorry for the poor writer critic who quits his job and jumps on the train to berlin his ambition is to make a difference and to participate in building the new unified europe after the war has ended br br i like the black and white format of the movie as well as the closed scenery of a train in motion br br robert makes a classic role in this movie if you're a fan of him this movie is for you br br the philosopher wittgenstein through his saying one can never assume that anything is what it seems to be is referenced several times in the movie
<START> i caught on the run at the screening room in new york and was immediately seduced by its true independent spirit starring michael imperioli and john ventimiglia from the sopranos cast on the run sets us up in a 24 hour wild ride in the city that never sleeps as we follow the meanderings of an introspective sales agent who is suddenly dragged by his long gone school companion just out of jail in fact he has escaped from it and is on the run looking for some action and a glimpse of life amidst the great metropolis powered by great performances this movie gives us back the old feeling of 70's pics with both characters rediscovering themselves as they blaze across town bumping into wild events and locals an to a certain side of new york that seems to be disappearing on the run displays great sensitivity and humour i predict it to be a cult classic that urges to be discovered future viewers should definitely surrender to this nocturnal trip
<START> the monkees surprisingly are a big favorite of mine yes they might have been the original manufactured rock band a gimmick that certainly has reached overkill in the 21st century however their music holds up as some of the best the 1960's had to offer last train to daydream believer i'm a believer i'm not your stepping stone and pleasant valley sunday are great songs written by good songwriters such as boyce hart neil diamond king and john stewart while they weren't great musicians or songwriters they had a likable screen presence and plenty of appeal and some of their own stuff was actually decent their t v show is dated stuff in 2007 but i still watch the show on occasion as a time capsule to life in 1966 1968 that magical and dangerous time in u s history br br however as we all know as a portent of things to come for the likes of kelly clarkson the monkees didn't want to be considered manufactured and just puppets for their recording company despite their average talents they wanted to write their own songs produce their own albums and call the shots when it came to tours sadly this turned out to be a disaster especially when peter choice of jimi hendrix as an opening act was nixed due to his stealing of the show and heavy sexual suggestions in his music compared to the monkees g rated content br br however the final nail in the coffin for the monkees until 1986 was the infamous motion picture head head was written by bob and jack nicholson while they were allegedly high on the mary jane the film received poor reviews and only made 16 000 in the box office today the film is a cult classic ahead of its time and delivers a message of what was on the minds of the youth in 1968 the summer of anger br br head really has no plot basically one to four of the monkees lurch from scene to scene without any rhyme or reason they go from eating in a diner to seeing davy jones getting bashed by sonny to a western to being sucked into a vacuum to performing at a concert and so forth the film basically offers up oblique opinions of what was wrong with american society the monkees bash commercialism the war in vietnam american policy censorship the establishment and greed you have to read between the lines to see what the targets of derision were br br the monkees spend a lot of time boxed up at certain junctions of the film symbolizing how they felt their record company saw them as nothing but toys for them to play with when it was time to record another hit album a scene where they are outnumbered 16 4 in the western scene could be a symbol of them against the session musicians songwriters record producers and whatnot who controlled their careers and the cannon they fire at them is their way of saying br br the film is truly a psychedelic trip to behold the flashy tie dye colors the hypnotic concert and belly dancing scenes and the druggy imagery is everywhere the acting is actually very good but that's being biased as i like the monkees t v show a small soundtrack features the song and three songs written by the monkees themselves br br the film actually has some hilarious scenes on occasion although maybe they weren't supposed to be mickey dolenz beating up a coke machine that didn't give him a soda or his violent punch ups in the boxing scene i mean he was a guy who probably weighed no more than 135 had me laughing it up br br all in all this movie is an absolute must see for any monkees fan i think a lot of people will feel this movie is indeed over their head but for those obsessed with the 60's and society at the time will find it a great time capsule
<START> 1st watched 8 31 1996 dir tim robbins very thought provoking and very well done movie on the subject of the death penalty deserved more recognition and publicity than it received
<START> this review contains mild spoilers but not enough to spoil the story br br watched sinking of japan or japan sinks depending on where you live recently a remake of the 1970's movie of the same name which itself was based on best selling novel this movie is a gem of japanese film making it appears that japan is sinking due to a of a plate to the west the americans predict that it would happen in the period of 40 years but according to dr a seemingly scientist it will happen in less than a year the japanese government isn't that convinced but sets up a disaster evacuation plan as well as form a new d1 team to handle the crisis while on a trip to china to negotiate evacuation plans the japanese prime minister was killed and sends the cabinet into a state of panic the d1 team is left to handle most matters and led by the newly elected minister of crisis management dr ex wife she turns instead to dr for advice and he has plans to blow astronomically huge holes under japan to avert the process of sinking br br japan would soon have to negotiate with various countries and persuade them to adopt japanese refugees soon it seems that a lot of countries are reluctant to accept any more due to the sudden influx of japanese in their country and the chaos that follows if this ever happens touch wood i hope ito misaki will be safe she can always stay at my place hee hee the scenes of are really well done showing the havoc suffering and desperation civilians have to face in such disastrous times and the many faces of human beings surface arrogance selfishness bribery bravery br br this is a really well made film the storytelling is solid with an engaging storyline and wonderful acting dr played by was done really well portraying a divorced and often mad scientist who kicks and bashes up stuff his frustration and concerns were very visible and that's a really good thing reiko played by gorgeous shibasaki kou was also played rather well and has the most memorable line in the entire movie go watch it to find out and i fancy that she has a nice acting voice she plays the love interest of toshio played by of smap oh i almost forgot she has really really long hair and there's also a subtle but background love story which is well written and if there's something the japanese do really well it's love stories br br one thing that makes this movie interesting is the technical explanations of the events that occur and if you're interested in geography you'll have a really good time i know i did hehe i can see that they went to great lengths to make this movie's theory believable and the first few graphical displays and explanation were done rather well although you'll have to excuse the famous engrish br br ok now about the effects it's all about the effects isn't it after watching the movie with pure awe i must say that this movie has special effects that are on par or even better with some hollywood productions the volcanic eruptions the massive earthquakes destruction explosions all done splendidly the opening scene is so cool the 1st earthquake catches you by surprise mountains fall the destruction due to volcanic eruptions makes you cringe to actually watch mount fuji heat up is a marvel then you see fall to the ground it's so sad however what i felt was one of the best scenes was the giant tsunami scene which sees rescue operations fail and people left with nowhere to run and no hope to hold on to the ending scene also deserves a mention wonderful stuff if you like effects you'll love this movie br br oh ya every good movie has a great song behind it the seriously addictive keep holding u sung by the super cute and adorable is a duet with and it's simply lovely i feel it suits the movie really well and it shows that no matter what disasters hit us our love and strength would keep us holding on the disaster scenes are handled with orchestra music and at times silence a japanese specialty and really gives a sense of chaos to the destruction on screen oh and did i mention it's a really really really wide screen been going on and on about this movie yeah i loved it and hoping to watch again it does have plot holes but it's all excusable because it was just a wonderful popcorn movie not perfect but really well made i'd give it a 9 out of 10 i'm glad to say that the most expensive movie in japanese history is also one of their best if you haven't watched it you really should today it is a must watch
<START> that maybe someday people will wake up to people who can resist the urge to separate each and everything and who see the 60s for what they were people who can see that it was the individuals who made those times not the other way around br br the forrest gump comparison is a good one both films look at the 60s but four friends is about human beings as opposed to caricatures ff delves deeply into the very thing that quite successfully tries to condense and classify as nothing more than a backdrop but while gump files the 60s away in an attic like old toys in a box four friends picks up and embraces each toy thus blurring the lines between what you hold dearly and what you are br br if you associate romance with shoe polish you'll hate this film
<START> this is a great movie for all corey feldman fans this movie has a great cast of young actors a group of teens decide to rob a bank to get some quick cash but all goes wrong when a security gets shot and they take hostages
<START> this movie is an amazing comedy the script is too funny if u watch it more than once you will enjoy it more though the comedy at times is silly but it really makes u laugh salman khan and aamir khan have given justice to their roles after 1994 i have not come across any hindi movie which was as funny as this
<START> do not waste your money or time terrible movie bad acting plot all over the place really really bad acting man this movie is just plain bad i shut it off at 7 minutes the script is bad the directing is bad it seems to me that a high school group got together to do a project for their drama class yes it's that bad the acting is not convincing at all mind you i saw only 7 minutes of it how this movie made it to dvd is beyond me br br it should have been left in the editing storage room i saw the cover and thought it was pretty cool i heck won't do that next time
<START> as is often the case when you attempt to take a 400 plus page book and cram it into a two hour film a lot is lost here director john madden shakespeare in love takes on an extremely ambitious project and almost pulls it off what we get is a charming and emotionally compelling film that seems somehow incomplete br br there is much about this film that is wonderful and fantastic the cinematography by john toll cinematographer for braveheart and legends of the fall winning oscars for both is splendid working with madden the choices for locations on the greek island of are superb and the visual images that come from photographing these majestic locations in varying light are lush and beautiful madden also uses numerous greek actors as the townspeople giving the town an authentic feel the soundtrack is also terrific and the mandolin passages and vocals by the italian soldiers are marvelous br br madden does an excellent job of bringing us the italian occupation and the romance which take up the greater part of the film there are numerous sweet and funny moments throughout this segment however by the time the serious battle drama is ready to unfold there isn't much film left in the reel and this component is extremely rushed and abbreviated while the battle scenes are well done subsequent to the battle it is obvious that increasingly greater compromises are being made to keep the film from running too long by the time we reach the post war scenes the treatment is merely skeletal another negative is that the dvd is particularly sparse on features br br nicholas cage is charming in the romantic lead as the sentimental captain who seems to have joined the army to sing rather than fight when fight he must cage switches gears seamlessly into a man of fierce principle and resolve and somehow remains believable in both personas br br penelope cruz whom the camera loves gives an uninspired performance as in part this is because cage so dominates the screen but cruz just seems too placid in a part that should be emotionally torrential and dynamic she allows the character to be objectified as love interest rather than establishing her as a powerful character in her own right br br john hurt gives a fantastic performance as the wise old doctor who knows as much about human nature as medicine however christian bale seems a bit overwrought and stiff as fiancÃ© br br i rated this film an 8 10 despite some drawbacks this is a touching film that is well worth seeing the photography alone is worth the price of admission
<START> after world war ii the crime in city alabama encouraged by the money from an army base just across the river in georgia got even worse gambling prostitution loan sharking and the like helped an organized crime apparatus in the city soon it was too bad and violent to even tolerate anymore this movie is based on the real story of that fight br br by the standards of the 1950's it was shockingly explicit although low budget that same small budget helped with the realism requiring location shooting a very gritty film richard kiley was marvelous as always and john mcintire stolid br br why this good movie isn't on video is a real puzzle
