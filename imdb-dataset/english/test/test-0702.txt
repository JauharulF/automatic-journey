<START> roeg's take on conrad's heart of darkness was not quite what i had expected although based on one of history's most studied and interesting texts the film just became sort of dull the story just never manages to grasp the viewer it just comes across as indifferent in a way br br the traces of the text are easily spotted but still this is not really conrad's heart of darkness benedict fitzgerald's who also wrote the passion of the christ script just uses conrad as an inspiration and thus becomes fitzgerald's heart of darkness the film is just not worth it unless you are particularly interested in conrad or perhaps john malkovich
<START> rock star is a nice movie everyone is nice even the guys who aren't supposed to be nice really are nice chris is a nice guy who learns a lesson in life he goes back to his girlfriend emily who is also nice br br it's a good movie despite all the niceness maybe i'm just used to all the angst of the x gen music in some ways the film was a caricature of rock stars and not hard edged enough to be believable br br mark wahlberg's acting is quite good jennifer aniston played her role well but it was uncomplicated she was a nice girl br br go see it if you have ever been to a rock concert or seen spinal tap go see it
<START> why do i hate this let me list the ways br br i have nothing against mary pickford but a 32 year old woman playing a 12 year old is just stupid br br there's a fight scene in which kids are throwing bricks at each other and it's considered funny and it goes on for 15 minutes br br strange how none of the kids are even remotely hurt br br the title cards contain plenty of racial and ethnic slurs br br for a family film the fights were way too violent loved it when pickford was punching it out with a little boy and the humor was just stupid br br seriously 40 minutes in i gave up and turned it off the slurs racism and little kids throwing bricks at each other got to me also there was no plot that i could see the only thing worth seeing in this film was william haines who was a top leading man in the silent era br br just painful avoid
<START> a really funny british comedy from the mid 1950's about a school for girls the girls are all involved in mischief and mayhem making bathtub gin smoking and gambling alastair sim plays headmistress in a glorious drag role as well as playing brother a female police officer goes to the school undercover to see what is going on this film is funny having great sight gags and alastair sim is great just a classic britsh comedy lots of fun and not too cruse joan sims ans sid james stars of many carry on films play small roles but this film is about the girls it spawned 3 sequels and a recent re make watch and enjoy where it all began
<START> no let's just say the samurai is somewhere between horrifically boring and mind bogglingly painful to watch as an historical epic it could have had so many more chances to be a rich saga but it's really no more than just another cheap '70s action flick with a based on real events story and an eyepatch sporting sonny chiba before this movie's halfway point i was even tempted to commit seppuku the music is like a thousand dogs in heat wailing in your ears to a tune composed by ennio morricone that's not an insult towards morricone the use of zoom lens cinematography is more nauseating than fascinating and in terms of action it's really nothing more than a series of brutal attacks and oh no they didn't shocks what a terrible movie
<START> this episode is not incoherent like another person said the source agreed to help because he was not going to keep his word if you pay attention he says after she phoebe agrees to stay down there in hell get rid of her and so i don't have to worry about them in the future and also he didn't let cole warn the sisters like phoebe asked in exchange of accepting the deal that's why died because she got hit harder than piper and on the head and there was no phoebe to call for leo this time and in the past leo said that she almost got herself killed pay more attention next time and there is not a to be continued after this episode it is the ending of season 3 and on season 4 they can't show anything from because she owns the rights of it so the producers would have to pay her for whatever they show this is the last episode she is in
<START> i can't honestly believe that this is a sequel or follow up of john landis classic comedy horror movie from 1981 i suppose you can't really describe it as an original werewolf movie either since the bare bones of the story steal elements from the one set in london an american tourist visits a famous european capital he narrowly survives a werewolf attack that kills a colleague he embarks pardon the pun on a sexual relationship with someone in the medical profession he turns into a werewolf he's visited by apparitions of his dead victims etc etc and reading the previous line i've just discovered how much the storyline has in common with the original that it seems very similar indeed the difference lies in how enjoyable and entertaining the landis movie is br br with this paris based movie there's no scenes that really stand out there's no naked man waking up in a zoo wondering how he's going to get back home with no money or clothes there's no bizarre dream sequence of and there's no spectacular climax does try to be funny but is there anything more embarrassing than failed humour i'm thinking of the scene where andy mcdermott has to convince someone he's got chewing gum in his pocket and not condoms perhaps the biggest difference between the two movies is that there's no poignancy involved with this dubious follow up you really do feel sorry for the protagonist's fate and dilemma in the london movie here you just feel andy is nothing more than a cypher going through the literary motions of a script there's also a large number of plot holes visible is this the first time the lunar club have carried out a massacre if not then aren't large numbers of corpses with their hearts torn out been reported in the world's press why haven't the police got leads br br everyone else has mentioned it and so will i the visuals are poor look at the jumping scene at the tower it's painfully obvious that it's achieved via some blue screen projection while the werewolf transformation is done by some very cartoonish cgi i won't put anthony waller in the same bracket as stephen sommers as a director who totally ruins a movie because of an over reliance on cgi the major problem with is the screenplay coupled with a high degree of expectation from those who saw the 1981 movie classic but i would have preferred the rick baker type special effects used for the transformation to be fair it's reasonable to speculate that perhaps the budget didn't stretch that far but at the end of the day this is a fairly poor horror movie that didn't need to be made and dog soldiers is much better entertainment
<START> it's fun and fast paced as one falsehood leads to another and another toward an inevitable surprising conclusion the suspense separates this holiday flick from all others one wonders how the pieces are going to fit both during the movie and in the future br br the character actors laid the foundation and entertained us in the process frank jenks shows us what manipulation can get and ultimately what manipulation can cost uncle felix s z sizes up each person for us while trying to protect barbara stanwyck and this helps us decide who we are going to root for in the end br br if we could ever achieve a perfect world imperfect people would likely have to undergo a series of events such as these br br a glaring weakness is that fake baby cry after it allegedly swallowed uncle felix's watch i've heard more authentic crying from a doll in a toy store br br watch it and you'll really feel like you've been somewhere
<START> this episode of charmed changed everything the show is about to end it's third season and all hell is breaking loose in this episode the charmed ones bring an innocent named dr griffiths to the manor the protect him from the sources assassin when attacks he blasts in as a tornado and then into his demon skin he blasts threw a wall which totally knocks her out and practically kills her then blasts piper threw what is left of the wall phoebe comes from the attic and says the vanquishing spell before came kill the doctor but being the power of one it just wounds him leo comes to heal the other sisters and wants to find and destroy him for real phoebe meanwhile is in the underworld trying to find cole when and piper go out into the street to find the demon the demon finds them after their battle the witches realize that a camera caught everything when they get back to manor trying to battle the media and after they vanquished a a witch gone kookoo shoots piper uses her telekinesis to move people out of the way so she can get to the hospital but they get their to late and piper dies and just when is about to get shot time is rewound to where they bring dr griffiths to the manor blows in and blasts and piper but phoebe is still in the underworld so kills the doctor and blasts out of the manor when leo finally comes he can't heal is dead and so is the power of three for now personally this episode was sad was the of all of them i would love to have her power of telekinesis i really don't think phoebe should of went to the underworld because if she didn't wouldn't have killed but paige brings the power of three together again and i'm happy with the show's progress
<START> what a waste of a great cast figured i'd check it out because it looked like a good stoner comedy with a lot of fairly well known actors what it turned out to be was a pointless collection of boring intertwining stories about several characters with minimal connections with each other characters who start off looking like decent people but end up with not a single likable or interesting characteristic among them calling it a comedy was a stretch as well the only thing that made me chuckle was jack black's song which was basically tenacious d i waited for something big to happen but ended up with nothing more than 97 minutes of my life wasted
<START> even disney are guilty of the cash cow disease after the roaring success of the love bug in 1968 the house of mouse cashed in with herbie rides again herbie goes to monte carlo and herbie goes bananas neither sequel capturing the charm and inoffensive appeal of the love bug back in 68 in this one we find race driver jim douglas and his sidekick applegate entering herbie in the monte carlo rally naturally things outside of the race start to take over priorities they get mixed up in a diamond robbery and herbie falls in love with another car the car stunts are of course pleasant and easy on the eye and it would be churlish of me to really vent venom on such a friendly piece of fluff it's just that the film goes nowhere fast and personally now i can see it for the coin motivated piece of work it is still you get to see herbie take a bath foil the baddies and of course dance for the lady in his life so something there for everyone i think 4 10
<START> k pax is a very intriguing film is kevin spacey really an alien or is he a mentally deranged human who just thinks he is an alien that is the question that dr powell jeff bridges must answer before the self proclaimed deadline that sets for his departure from earth br br as the film unfolds and more evidence is uncovered both theories grow in credibility his ability to map from memory the area of the galaxy where his home planet is located indicates a knowledge that no human could possibly possess yet the hypnosis sessions lead us to a real person with a very real and traumatic life filled with devastating events that could have caused such a personality aberration the ending seems to give the answer but is just ambiguous enough to make you wonder if you really know normally i don't like lady or tiger endings but this one is tantalizing i have my own theory that fits all the clues but i don't know that my theory is any more correct than anyone else's br br director wings of the spins the tale delicately with great skill this is a rare example of the director staying in the shadows and inducing outstanding acting performances out of talented actors to let the story dominate this is not to say that the directing is technically inferior because it is excellent however remains unobtrusive delivering great power through the use of subtlety a pleasant change from today's vanguard directors who visually grab and shake the viewer as if to scream look how brilliant i am ' br br kevin spacey once again delivers a marvelous performance as this is a part that is extraordinarily demanding requiring spacey to render the cool and logical one minute and then switch gears to conjure his tormented alter ego under hypnosis the next spacey is so believable as both alien and human it makes the viewer's task that much more difficult jeff bridges is also terrific as the relentless psychologist who becomes obsessed with learning the truth about br br this is inspired storytelling for the thoughtful viewer i rated it a 9 10 if you must have closure at the end of a film this movie will be very frustrating however if you like a fascinating mystery that keeps you thinking long after the credits you won't be disappointed
<START> i was impressed by the story it had the typical predatory gay male and the typical mormon missionary but they each also had friends and family who balanced their lives well there are a number of characters some nice and some not so nice each with their own personality nuances and most reminded me of people in my own life br br the story starts out with several humorous moments and slowly evolves into a heartwarming relationship film the story progresses without obvious plot turns and never talks down to you it makes you think a bit while waiting to see what happens even when i thought i could foresee something coming i was surprised by how it actually came about br br not many movies make me laugh knowingly at real gay dialogue and then bring a tear to my eye when i feel the characters' pain i watched the film on dvd and couldn't bring myself to stop watching until it was over usually i watch a film in pieces over a couple of days it's nice to see a film with gay characters that is uplifting but not preachy i highly recommend this film and not just for gay audiences the relationships transcend sexuality
<START> i've watched this movie on a fairly regular basis for most of my life and it never gets old for all the snide remarks and insults mostly from david spade tommy boy has a giant heart and that's what keeps this movie funny after all these years br br tommy callahan chris farley is the son of big tom callahan brian dennehy master car parts salesman and has ridden on that all his life but after his died dies on his wedding day tommy learns that the company is in debt and about to be bought by ray dan akroyd the owner of a huge car parts company so in order to save the company tommy has to go on the road to sell the company's new brake pads along for the ride though not by choice is richard hayden david spade a former classmate of tommy's who was big tom's right hand man br br the movie rides on the chemistry between the two snl stars and real life best friends chris farley and david spade the duo has enough comic energy going between them to power the world it's the big dumb guy versus the smart little guy it works and some of their scenes are unforgettably funny farley and spade are actually decent dramatic actors as well although the film is primarily a comedy it has its fair share of drama but spade and especially farley are just as good there as when they're making the audience laugh br br forgive me but i have to talk about chris farley a little more i read his biography the chris farley show a biography in three acts for anyone who cares and understanding who chris was in real life made this movie more special to me chris farley was a genuinely good person who struggled and ultimately failed to conquer his addictions although this was the first movie he had a major role in it is his best film it really showed who he was and just how much talent he had knowing chris's story adds another layer to this movie although it doesn't make it any less funny br br farley and spade are matched with a good on screen cast rob lowe is suitably slimy as tommy's new brother and bo derek is solid as his step mother brian dennehy is great as big tom dennehy makes it easy to believe that they're father in son big tom is just as crazy as his son although he's smarter and more mature dan akroyd gives one of his best performances as giving tommy the hard truth behind advertising julie warner is also good as tommy's love interest michelle br br for me peter segal is one of the great comedy directors he keeps the pace quick and energetic but most importantly he knows how to make comedy funny he doesn't belabor the jokes and he understands that funny actors know what they're doing and he allows them to do it but segal goes a step further he gives tommy boy a friendly almost nostalgic tone that both tugs the heartstrings genuinely and tickles the br br critics didn't like tommy boy shame on them a movie doesn't have to be super sophisticated or intellectual to be funny god forbid farley and spade were forced to do muted comedy a la the office this is a great movie and one of my all time favorites
<START> it took me a while to find this movie since they don't have it yet on dvd and my vcr is not worth hooking up again i guess all the referencing to drug use is too much for some folks but i found a decent bootleg on ebay and i must say that anyone who takes this movie too seriously is just retarded it is a slap stick spoof in the vein of airplane i must say that when i watched it on showtime or spotlight growing up in the 80s i enjoyed the humor a whole lot more then than i do now but it's definitely worth watching just to see what they i e movie makers were able to get away with before the just say no hypocrites unleashed their propaganda sing we are all on drugs hahaha it's a silly film and worth the 10 i paid off of ebay to get it on dvd just don't even think about comparing it to the original that's just plain stupid what are you high
