<START> even if you're a fan of jean rollin's idiosyncratic body of work you will be caught off guard by this exceptional foray into science fiction territory for once there's not a single vampire girl in sight true to tradition the budget proved way too tight to realize the director's vision entirely yet this is largely compensated by his obvious love of genre cinema dedication to his craft and sheer ingenuity jean claude atmospheric cinematography makes the most of the foreboding locations and philippe a k a gary contributes a startling soundtrack that fortunately doesn't resemble any of the sappy stuff he composed for hardcore br br shot in and around a paris office block before and after working hours the film was largely cast with porn regulars rollin was already quite familiar with from his michel gentil cash gathering xxx efforts most notably french f ck film royalty brigitte in the demanding lead playing elisabeth rather well i might add she's picked up wandering a nearby highway one night by robert vincent driving home at the end of a long work day barely able to piece together the string of events that got her there elisabeth seems to lose her memories mere moments after events occur even forgetting robert's name and heroic savior role before their night flight comes to an end at his apartment prior to making love she rightfully describes herself as a virgin further credit to thespian skills that she can handle the line so convincingly being after all one of the more active adult actresses of the '70s because she cannot recall a single touch preceding his because of this nifty bit of context the relatively long sex scene that follows totally eschews the gratuity of other commercial interludes rollin has had to include in other works to assure funding br br when robert leaves for work he's inevitably erased from elisabeth's feeble mind a mysterious doctor comedian bernard effectively cast against type and his menacing assistant solange striking porn starlet rachel move in on her during her absence and take her back to the place she turns out to have escaped from here we get one of the movie's strongest scenes as she's re introduced to her roommate catherine the late a k a hardcore performer cathy stewart in a quietly devastating turn both girls desperately supplying fictitious shared memories for one another in a bid to outrun their inevitable fate that deterioration is not solely limited to the mind becomes painfully clear when they are served lunch and catherine's unable to control her movements in trying to eat a spoonful of soup it's also catherine who gets to voice the filmmaker's compromise with the demands of commerce as she urges elisabeth to get naked and hold her because sex is all they have left now that both mind and physical faculties have deserted them br br several rather explicit if not quite hardcore sex scenes make up the movie's mid section and french porn aficionados should recognize the likes of alain a k a cyril val jacques and along with a blink and miss bit from future porno princess marilyn jess whose rape at the hands mouth and member of was only present in the film's rarely screened xxx version the pivotal part of a girl elisabeth almost seems to remember and whom she seeks to escape anew with is beautifully handled by the exquisite dominique in her unforgettable debut who would go on to play a sizable supporting role in franco zeffirelli's la traviata the six feet under ending reveals the deteriorating condition to be the result of a nuclear spill the quarantined patients ultimately leaving a barely breathing empty shell unceremoniously disposed off in a fiery furnace the final shot offers a particularly heartbreaking variation on that of chaplin's modern times as elisabeth approaching complete meltdown by now and a wounded robert stumble along the railroad bridge clumsily clasping each other's outstretched hands
<START> the fact that after 50 years it is still a highly watchable movie says a lot about it it is more intelligent and interesting than almost all recent movies of the same genre you can find and has a certain endearing feeling of innocence to it i am not a big fan of this type of movies but i could watch the whole thing without being bored which makes it a good movie to watch with someone who does not necessarily share your taste in films i liked the black and white palette the excellent casting the clever heist scene that keeps you guessing about what trick they will pull next and the ending like everyone else watching the heist sequence makes one realize the power of silence which is unfortunately so underused in today's cinema
<START> i received this movie in a pack called 50 all star movies for 18 45 cents each many are good this one was terrible it was a hackneyed retread done 1000 times before and each time better a crippled ex jock is dared to coach a team made up of juvenile delinquents they learn from him that they can make it if they play by the rules i'm sure the kids and the locals were thrilled to be included in a real tv movie but i can't imagine what the folks that launched and produced this project figured they could bring to this already over beaten subject i kept waiting to see that 'new twist' or 'new but honest it doesn't come avoid this movie forget about the 45 cents i want the 96 minutes of my life back
<START> most american remakes of european films are pretty poor but this is in a league of its own in fact this might even be the worst sandra bullock movie ever made i daresay i might have passed it off as just another innocuously bad hollywood thriller had i not seen the dutch original spoorloos the altered ending here is stupid enough and executed with particular ineptitude but a far worse crime than that is removing all the intelligence and depth of character that marked out the original as a classic the real horror to be found here is in the fact that the same man who directed spoorloos is responsible for this atrocity will the real george sluizer please stand up
<START> about 20 minutes into this lame excuse for a movie i realized it reminded me of one of those annoying people at work who're always telling really lame jokes or doing extremely unfunny things because they think it's funny and are trying to entertain everyone br br this film is billed as starring traci lords she's not that bad of an actress but her lines aren't funny and she's not the star br br the acting is some of the most god awful i've ever seen except for lords the girl who plays casey and maybe the colonel who seems oddly out of place i can't imagine why a retired military colonel would want to start a academy do those even exist br br the budget would've been better spent coaxing these women into doing a full length porn feature br br freddy got fingered currently has a 3 5 score frostbite has a 2 7 i'm baffled these two movies are within a 1 0 to each other is the godfather compared to this garbage br br 1 10 stars
<START> this movie wasn't too funny it wasn't too horrible either just a fun ride aboard the soul plane it's a black owned flight service with a kick ass disco beautiful bar and pumping stewards the plot takes you through the whole idea of a black not race or color but 'style' owned plane with the same style of black humor at times there are some great rare scenes like when the main character uses the 'normal' lavatory in the 'normal' plane check that out there are lulls however and i find it most in the character who played the soul pilot watch to find out who it is all in all it's a fun movie tom arnold adds to the fun with his attitude this is one movie to watch when playing poker when you're drunk or just
<START> my mom and i went to the ft worth premiere mainly to see george strait but ended up getting the chance to see the movie premier at bass hall what a wonderful beautiful film which not only depicts the beautiful texas landscape but also had a great feel good storyline it was well written directed and produced and my mom and i loved it from start to finish thank you jay for giving us the opportunity to be a part of the premiere of this wonderful movie it was a night we will never forget as if seeing the movie was not enough we also were fortunate enough to be sitting 4 rows in front of my favorite singer george strait thank you thank you thank you keep up the great work and again thank you br br debbie maureen ft worth tx
<START> so far i disliked every single jean rollin movie i've seen and that always bothered me because he's an acclaimed euro trash monument and extremely popular amongst many regular reviewers on this lovely website people whose opinions i always value and usually concur with apparently everybody always appears to pinpoint some sort of gloomy and stylistic filming trademarks in his work that are completely lost on me rollin's movies are unimaginably boring they all feature the same basic concept lesbian vampires in various settings the dialogs are incredibly absurd the marvelous gothic setting are always underused and the production values are cheaper than the price of a bus ticket i had actually given up on rollin's repertoire already especially after enduring the iron rose until i found out about night of the hunted allegedly this movie doesn't feature any lame lesbian vampires and stands as a bona fide horror movie with gruesome killings and macabre plot twists and the verdict is Â yes and no on one hand this is undeniably the most compelling and inventive rollin film i had the pleasure of seeing thus far and also the only one that i watching without dozing offÂ on the other hand it still remains a moronic movie with a nonsensical plot and emotionless sex sequences to compensate for the dullness jean rollin heavily attempts to generate an atmosphere of secrecy and suspense mostly through a lack of information and vaguely introduced characters but barely manages to hide the fact he actually hasn't got a story to tell at all the unearthly beautiful lead actress brigitte and the beautifully ominous musical guidance are the only elements that keep you hooked on the screen during a nightly drive back home to paris a young man abruptly has to stop for a confused and scarcely dressed girl who comes running from the woods her name is elisabeth but furthermore she can't remember anything about herself and from what or whom she was running away her case of amnesia is so bad she even continuously forgets who picked her up the next day she's kidnapped again by an old guy and taken to a sinister apartment complex where multiple people in the same bizarre mental state are held captive elisabeth knows nothing but she does sense she needs to escape from here obviously i won't reveal the denouement but i can assure you it is quite dumb illogical and far fetched apparently rollin realized this as well because the explanation is kept very brief and quick there's a large number of overly weird and senseless sequences the sex footage is dire and filmed without passion the nasty make up effects look cheap and randomly thrown without actual purpose as said the score is mesmerizing and brigitte perfect body is addictive to at
<START> up until around 1970 lucille ball was one great comedienne she was such a perfect clown i only wish more people could have seen her with bob hope in the facts of life because she could do dry deadpan too as well as slapstick br br yep lucille ball was wonderful until mame br br trying to see lucille ball in mame is physically impossible because there is so much vaseline on the already filtered lenses that you'd need windex to see lucille ball in some scenes so even if you see lucille ball in mame you can't really see lucille ball in mame which is a blessing br br that's about the nicest thing i can say about mame the movie of the musical of the movie of the play this could go on but it started with a perfectly funny book called auntie mame giving this a bad rap is like beating a sponge so it does not matter that the music is rather than sung most of the songs weren't much anyway there isn't any difference in the first three it's today open a new window and we need a little christmas are all the same song dion should do an album with them they're so big and dull the killer ballad if he walked into my life today needs a confident gorgeous voice won a grammy for doing it in 1967 that poor lucille ball did not possess when she made this movie true elaine can't carry a tune in a bucket either but at least can put over a song br br if you still feel your life is not going to be complete unless you see the movie musical mame notice how there is dancing in it but whenever lucy mame starts to do anything beyond a palsied shuffle the camera cuts away returning right when the number is over and the star poses with the dancers again it's just as well jane got to reprise the role of pathetic agnes after lucille ball had madeline kahn fired to ensure no comic originality would upstage the star is a stage performer who like carol channing and merman can't scale down her performances for films so she joins lucille ball in being embarrassing though for different reasons br br the lavish gowns are by van van wrinkle and they provide the color missing in all but one of the cast br br bea arthur as the actress vera charles best friend ignores everyone and does her own fun thing if only she was in more scenes she's too old for her role too but at least she didn't it
<START> what can i say about this movie it really is one of the worst gay themed movies ever to come out of the uk i can only imagine the likes of diana quick and georgina hale needed the money what story there is is such a rambling mess that you loose interest pretty quickly it's supposed to be based on real life events well all i can say to that one is that it's an insult to the real life characters the dvd is out at the moment in the uk it's available in either the split screen format which must make it even worse that the full screen version i watch gay cinema can be so much better than this and we deserve more
<START> i thought this movie was going to be good it absolutely wasn't despite the oscar winning lead actors i may have laughed once and i never heard anybody else in the theater laughing renee pancake make up was very unbecoming everybody seems to be trying so hard in this movie running around in imitation of slapstick but not pulling it off i think perhaps the movie must've sounded good in development but something got lost in translation were the roaring 20's really like this i think not everything seems a tad artificial randy newman's score was annoying the film is in sepia tones just like every other movie that takes place in the 20's or 30's there's just not that much originality here
<START> balance of terror is still one of the best star trek episodes ever made it was inspired by the film enemy below starring robert mitchum a movie that deals with a cat and mouse game between two captains during world war ii in this episode captain kirk and his crew play similar game with a vessel this is the program that famously introduces the war hungry romulans who are distant relatives of the vulcans it is an incredibly suspenseful episode tightly constructed for maximum effect it is also interesting to see how the episode contains a series of subplots that add extra layers of meaning to the story mark makes his star trek debut as the captain he will later play spock's father ambassador a must see episode
<START> the story of ed gein is a disturbing and terrifying story ed was truly a messed up character and his legacy went on to inspire such as the tooth fairy norman bates and leatherface how is it then that such a fascinating man has inspired such a boring melodramatic piece of drivel ed gein made belts out of nipples bowls out of skulls lamps out of skin danced around under the moon in suits of human skin none of this made it into the movie because they needed to give us a fictitious story of a ridiculously awful deputy and his rather homely sex starved girlfriend this movie seemed to go out of its way to history what baffles me is that most movies stray from the path of truth to exaggerate history this one seems to do it to minimize it i just don't get it
<START> i'm sorry but this really does feel like a modern day apollo 13 knock off totally implausible at least armageddon felt like a comic book this felt like a bad high school film project acting was about as clichÃ© as one can get and landing a space shuttle on an la freeway come on seriously jerry what were you thinking and all the clichÃ©s the pregnant astronaut's wife the nosy reporter who gets in everyone's way the stalwart manager with go fever and it's one thing to twist the laws of physics or politics or whatever to make an entertaining story but at least make it good fact and science were totally butchered for this the space shuttle doesn't have fuel tanks in it's wings and even if it did it couldn't steer by shifting fuel between them and neither could a dc 10 br br if you like bad acting bad storytelling low realism and cheesy clichÃ©s this one can't be beat
<START> thank god for the internet movie database when i first got this movie i watched it every night just before before bed and was getting something different out of it every time but no matter how i sliced it it came up disturbing the black and white and all the twitching really freaked me you stare at the screen unsure of what you are looking at and just when you think you got it it becomes clear and it's something completely different the imagery is very disturbing twitching and straight razors do not sit well with me in any movie still everytime i watched it i was interpreting it somewhat differently there is no dialogue ya know so i decided to check the imdb for the plot summary boy that throws me for a loop i had no idea that was supposed to be god now i'm going to watch it with this in mind and see what happens
