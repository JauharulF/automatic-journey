<START> don't let the rating of 5 9 as of this writing on 12 8 02 fool you this is one excellent film br br i cannot fathom how this got such a rating considering being so solid at all levels the direction acting cinematography all good the story is interesting and original and my only inkling as far as understanding why the rating is such sits in the fact that it is probably the type of movie that people rating might not normally see br br i equate it to playing modern rock for an 80 year old you might be young brought up on it and love it but he or she has not been and as a product of a different time and taste doesn't care for it br br if you like films and can handle movies based more on real people versus those comprised of mindless action enormous flashy budgets and mediocre talent give this one a try next time you see it on br br
<START> this film is a powerful commentary on family life in north america today the story is so well constructed it almost feels like its happening across the street right now if you are connected with your family and community in any way this film will grab you and transport you to the home and not allow you to leave until the credits are done br br our imaginary heroes through a myriad of innocent circumstances often unwittingly lead us down a path of sorrow confusion and isolation the travis family after a terrible tragedy invite each of us father mother brother and sister into their respective lives to share their experience in a dynamic set of circumstances that just doesn't quit we see all of the above and eventually the joy in powerful performances by the major players and the rest of the cast making this film a movie goers absolute treasure br br in a film so well done as this it is usually difficult to to find something special but sigourney weaver's portrayal of sandy travis was outstanding i would be surprised if others didn't recognize it as such br br clearly a 10 well done
<START> i watched death machines as part of bci eclipse' drive in cult classics featuring crown international pictures releases on dvd as i work my way through the multiple dvd sets i am growing to love many of crown movies especially the creepy erotic psychological thrillers br br death machines is not one of them br br after seeing movies like malibu beach the creeping terror and the pink angels it is hard to say that this is the worst film ever made but it doesn't have much going for it br br no plot really no story to speak of br br the acting isn't evident Â only the actor responsible for the terribly played tony with the thick fake italian accent made any attempt to get into character br br the score is annoying and pedantic br br the only thing about this movie is why what compelled the film makers to make this film br br did they think the story of 1 three ninjas 2 two competing crime bosses 3 an ancillary bartender karate school student character and 4 his pitiful love interest nurse was so compelling that the world would not be complete without this movie being made br br this is a complete waste of time and money for you me the producers writers actors and the director
<START> michael jackson is amazing this short film displays the absolute highest standard in music video and no one will ever be able to out beat this 'king of pop' masterpiece it shows michael turning into a zombie and dancing in the street with some spectacular choreography the story is great the scenes are marvelous the music is fantastic and overall the clip is fun eye popping spooky and is a real spectacle today everybody is still doing the same thing in music video with dancing and film based story lines which he innovated this ground breaking video is the toast of mtv and will forever be remembered for what is the greatest music video of all time
<START> i rented this obscure aussie relic a few years ago to show at a friend s place and it was an instant success the classic tale of the wizard of oz with a decidedly cornball 70 s australian twist the acting isn t exactly shakespeare society stuff here but later mad max star bruce spence is a beautifully understated scarecrow and there are some wonderfull comic turns by gary and robin ramsay as a deliciously 70 s camp fairy godmother father character also note the musical contribution from ex daddy cool frontman ross wilson on the title song in a similar vein to later day aussie comedies such as priscilla queen of the desert good fun
<START> this movie was amazing never before have i seen such a film that brought me to the harsh reality of drug use quite like this one there is no glamorizing sugar coating or glorifying heroine this movie shows the true struggles pain and loss people go through when dealing with this drug good film decent emotionally packed acting and a great storyline a much watch br br
<START> this movie was to me a fairly enjoyable watch i mean it wasn't great but it was one of the better horror movies of late it seems to have been low almost state benefit budget size but it has it's charms like the lovely ladies in it the atmosphere was good also which is what is missing hell of a lot of horror movies these days the acting was your typical 80's low budget affair that being in case you don't know is that it is dud acting but that is what lucio fulci's movies were full of they like this movie had atmosphere what they were lacking in storyline and money etc they more than made up for in the horror gore atmosphere for the movie it's self br br it is just a typical low budget horror movie that is watchable i watched it all the way and i love horror movies i've seen movies where i just turn off within 10 to 20 minutes or sit and fast forward it if it's on video or skip scene's on the dvd this movie didn't make me want to do that i sat and watched it all the way to the end without wanting to skip parts br br i would have liked it however if the zombie type folk in this were a little more scarier as they were about as scary as having freddy kreuger as your babysitter not but seriously though if they were a little better it would have been low budget perfection maybe br br the music in this movie was top notch stuff ideal horror music so it was i've seen horror movies where the music is good or average but it could have been better thank goodness though this movie didn't have nay of the metal music in it br br i've been a die hard metal fan since 1990 but in horror movies metal music spoils it the movie looses atmosphere a lot when any type of music other than a score is playing so i'm glad there was no music in this movie other than just your typical score which was rather creepy well done br br it could have use profane grace epitaph of shattered dreams on it though as it is keyboard music no guitars no nothing except really creepy keyboard tracks like track one forever sleep you hear the wind blowing all the way through it and some goose bump inducing keyboard music that follows it ever track on that cd is the same ideal horror music at it's best it would have suited this movie perfectly br br the only unattractive chick in the movie to me was the one who got killed or so we are led to believe and hung up as a scarecrow only to get free and try to escape later every other woman in the movie was lovely indeed a big 9 out of 10 for them all except the one i mentioned above br br i wish that hollywood mainstream side of things would give money to romero and the guy who made this movie as giving it to them for movies is way better a decision made than giving it to a goon muppet called paul anderson of the resident evil mince br br well done guys it is not bad not bad at all i loved the part at the end credits when they kept showing you clips of them making the movie behind the scene's not many movies do this kind of thing which i thought added a little to the movie as it also showed you some outtakes of sorts and that's always a good thing if you ask me br br rating for this movie 8 10 rating for the lovely ladies in the movie 9 10 rating for the atmosphere in the movie 9 10 rating for the score for the film 9 5 10
<START> it's hard to know exactly what to say about this ever so bland and dull little film the story is predictable when not completely laughable it's all a matter of dutiful gestures which as presented here carry absolutely no conviction yes the mgm production values are gorgeous and yes ms lamarr was exquisitely beautiful but she and the great spencer tracy have absolutely no chemistry together and that's the only thing that would have made this parade of cliches at all effective it's my understanding that this movie received poor reviews when it was originally released the passage of time has not improved it
<START> to summarize my group of friends and i spent about 45 minutes outside the theater sharing our favorites gaffes plot inconsistencies untied loose ends and other ridiculous aspects of this movie i found the story trite to the point of inconsequential and the plot lines as underdeveloped as the dino embryos still locked in the shaving cream canister from jurassic park 1 the editing was poor and none of the characters engendered any sort of sympathy or feeling in short this movie lacked any of the suspense and thrill that the first movie provided from a story standpoint br br even the new dinosaurs were few and far between although i really enjoyed the pterodactyls we got several brief shots of the new species and only 2 really were involved in the action br br as a scientist and former childhood paleontologist the lack of any real scientific content not that it had to be realistic but logically formed i e how they built the dinos in 1 and chaos ramblings was disappointing as well br br in short the movie seemed to be nothing more than an excuse to trot dinos back on the scene to make some money i hope that movie goers don't fall for this trap again although i did apparently
<START> tous the big risk is a french gangster movie that doesn't try for style that's why it has style because the movie is so underplayed and so matter of fact it becomes more and more involving and because abel is played by lino ventura we wind up emotionally invested in this taciturn tough killer who loves his wife and kids has an encounter with customs agents on the shore near nice at night that neither he nor we expect and who proves just as willing to shoot a cop or a betrayer with as little emotion as flicking off a bit of lint we first meet in italy with his wife and their two small boys one about 9 and one 4 br br this man was abel sentenced to death in we're told on the run for years he had watched his resources dwindle even as his anxiety kept him on the move with the italian police closing in each day france was again his best bet maybe he'd been forgotten br br was a top gangster in paris who took care of his friends that was several years ago a heist to give him money to return to france goes very wrong now he's hiding out with his two kids he calls his friends in paris to help him out he and his kids need to get from nice to paris but the police are hunting him and they've set up for two best friends time has passed and they've moved on they don't want to put themselves at risk and for what obligation gives may to caution so they hire a young thief eric stark jean paul belmondo to pick up and the children in an ambulance then to drive to paris with heavily bandaged and the children hidden we're on a journey where options are increasingly limited where he must find ways to have his children cared for where he realizes there are no more ties of friendship where betrayal seems likely and where quite possibly his only friend left is eric stark br br this somewhat cynical movie works so well because it does its job without about there are no trench coats with pulled up collars no toying with the melodrama of the gangster code so many french directors have loved tous gives us abel a man who once was somebody who now is sliding down to be nobody and who reacts with violence and resignation br br lino ventura dominates the movie yet when he is paired with jean paul belmondo a curious chemistry happens ventura as is grim and worried about caring for his sons he is humiliated by his situation he is a tough man who sees killing someone if needed as just part of the business he's in belmondo as the young thief who initially is sent to be an expendable driver and winds up being a friend to count on provides the brightness that keeps the movie from being just one more ride down the elevator belmondo was 27 and looks younger his unlikely star power as a lead actor broken nose under jaw shines right off the screen he makes erik a match for ventura when they share a scene and belmondo's scenes with sandra milo the young woman who becomes his girl friend radiate charm and good natured sex appeal the ending is bittersweet fate and without a stylistic posture in sight we hear say gone there's nothing left it would be well worth watching tous to learn what he means br br there are many fine french gangster films i'd place this one right there with pas au and bob le to see one of lino ventura's finest performances watch army of shadows
<START> spoilers in this review despite a few highly improbable scenes including the boys in pe measuring their penises in a contest and the few obligatory teens trying to get laid vignettes this movie captures the painful essence of high school in ways that few teen films have ever done it achieves this by not only showing the trio of friends gary dave rick as smoking drinking ever on the prowl teens but also dwells on the nature of friendship itself as these three friends have their loyalties tested this film is a snapshot of the time when childhood ends for the shy romantic gary when he sees the lovely karen for the first time he falls instantly in love the awakening emotion in gary is writ large on the screen and he proves his love for her by taking her in when she is jilted by her lover this love for karen signals the end of gary's innocence as the bonds with his two best friends will be tested and broken over the course of the story the confident ladies man rick is the person in high school we all secretly wish we were handsome cool and always has the impossibly beautiful girls in a swoon rick turns out to be a cad but you have to bear in mind that his character is only 17 years old he panics and makes a bad decision from rick's perspective the story is also about finding the one girl of his dreams a bad breakup and then at the end reconciling the look on rick's face as gary walks in and sees karen kissing rick shows that he at last understands that his best friend and he love the same woman as in real life you don't bow out because your friend has an unrequited love this is the tragedy of the film rick is no villain and constantly through the film he reminds gary and dave that they're his best friends the soulful quality of gary's performance however is the heart of the story lawrence is a beautiful loser he does everything right his heart's in the right place and he's consumed by love for karen yet karen in the end is not moved by gary's devotion and kindness karen represents all the people in the world who take in without giving back who exist in a vacuum of their own ego and never stop to realize the emotional damage and trauma they inflict on others this film is brutal in its statements on love and friendship but that's what makes it unique among teen films it ceases being a comedy and becomes a hopelessly romantic film albeit one doomed to a tragic conclusion anyone who has ever found the girl of his dreams and did not win her will understand the heartrending crushes of high school are every bit as real as the emotional strains of adulthood and this film will remind you of that in bold strokes gary's final reversal as he drives away with the inscribed is as poignant a moment as any in cinema one feels after watching this that it's really made of two movies the first part is a silly teen sexploitation film and once the story begins it's a strongly affecting drama a terrific movie it should also be noted that the soundtrack was prescient in its selection of many rising stars including the police the cars devo oingo boingo the the waitresses gleaming spires and phil seymour
<START> poor action films are the graveyards for aging martial art stars in such films they struggle to maintain that dangerous demeanor that made their early work successful but they all end in failure seagal is too old for this type of role but he wont let go no matter how silly he looks some hope his current work will somehow bring back the magic but there is no magic left the late '80s and early '90s belonged to steven seagal and his work made me a fan i could see him fit nicely in a slot on the sopranos where his overweight body features and sullen attitude could have found a home i wonder what the return is on his run of direct to video films since he produces them i'm assuming the is more than satisfactory if this is the deal we will be subjected to poorly done seagal action films well into his late 60s and 70s
<START> so real and surreal all in one i remember feeling like tessa heck i remember being tessa this was a beautiful vignette of a relationship ending i especially liked the protesters tangent it is nice to see symbolism in a movie without being smacked over the head with it if you get the chance to see this take it it is well worth the 30 minutes
<START> i am coming out fighting here because this film was so well shot and so well cast that i am twice as angry about its de evolution than i would have been with a lesser work without revealing too much of the plot i can only say that part one of my 2 vhs set was an unnerving unfolding delight of bizarre but plausible plot developments the lead character was suitably naif like but also intelligent and very very open the events that he is rapidly forced to come to terms with are the separation of his parents the culture shock when his pakistani roots collide with a complete breakdown of english society in the sixties his father's dubious transformation into the revered buddha of suburbia and the turning of his cousin into a feminist militant as his best friend suddenly becomes an icon of the burgeoning punk movement in the seventies among other things br br what made me so angry was the amount of detailed work each actor put into creating and establishing their characters in the first part only to have the whole thing devolve into very bad porn episodes in the second part far too many to justify plot development and far too explicit to even seem erotic my biggest pet peeve is when directors let their private fetishes interfere with the truth of their movie and this to me was a supreme example br br i felt a bit like i'd been invited to a party of very clever funny strangers only to have the doors locked and the guests not allowed to interact and all of us forced to watch bad seventies sexploitation films instead what an insult to the hard work of these amazing actors why not just make a cheeseball flick to begin with and why cast a great lead character who can actually act and then cut away from him whenever he is building up to a great performance i almost felt as if he too was growing tired of the endless sex scenes where all he did was lie there pumping his for yet another breathy naked actress br br bottom line part one is minor genius part two is second tier soap opera perversion i know the book is quite explicit but i felt that these fine actors were as exploited in real life as their characters were in the movie and it made me quite angry and very uncomfortable only john waters can pull off such a dubious degrading of actors and plot and have it seem artistic my suggestion is to only watch the first part toss the second in the proverbial rubbish heap and you will love the buddha forever score a f 0
<START> this was pretty inevitable this movie borrows from the core and from the film it borrowed from armageddon and the films it borrowed from and so on except this time there's luke perry too this films version of the familiar save the world plot involves super earthquakes beginning in the pacific northwest and extending too the whole ring of fire its soon determined that everybody on earth just might be doomed so the military and some scientists build one of those high tech drilling machines to go inside the earth and fix things it just wouldn't be as much fun if they didn't have to go somewhere like space or inside the planet there's even a line the tries to make the journey into the earth sound more impressive than the journey into space like the one in armageddon it's a sci fi network movie so the script is paint by numbers disaster movie there is in fighting between scientists and military guys there are rock melting lasers people die and sacrifice themselves for the good of all and above all there are weak cgi special effects not original and not all that entertaining this is a movie to watch when you have nothing to do particularly if you've got beer
