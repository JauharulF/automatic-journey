<START> i was hoping to like this movie to settle in for an evening of goofy fun i like judy davis and juliette lewis and the premise seemed off the wall enough to be entertaining br br unfortunately i found myself dozing over and over again judy davis gave a fine performance but had very little to work with juliette lewis was fabulous as expected but had very little to do the plot was full of twists that were just plain silly and as so often happens in movies of this type nobody acted the way a real human being would act and personally i thought marcia gay harden was totally miscast br br the movie also seemed to shift about midway from a black comedy with touches of farce to a total farce with touches of black comedy one reviewer here notes that other reviews seem to want this movie to be something different and therefore decried it all i can say is that i would have settled for the movie being something and sticking with it this one feels like the director had some grandiose ideas but wasn't able to pull them all off i give it a 4 out of 10
<START> this movie has remained in my mind for years as one of the best made for tv movie mysteries i've ever seen the acting is superb i've seen it twice and still am puzzled at some parts i'd love to have a copy so i can play certain parts over and over again i am interested in buying a copy of this movie but cannot find it anywhere i am wondering if if anyone has any suggestions how to find it i've tried e bay amazon com internet searches and am completely frustrated i've not seen it on turner classic movies nor on american movie classics and i have even put out fliers in our community asking if anyone has a copy
<START> without anything to walk away with this movie starts with scenes in china with the finding of a newborn while this is not a new concept i wasn't going to give up right there then there is a flash forward to adolescence the man's wife and biological child are fed up with the father who has neglected them while this did not seem culturally accurate and the movie made no move to develop these characters or the purpose for the adopted father's devotion i pressed on br br next we're in malibu where we are bombarded by poorly constructed classroom interaction and terribly low budget fill in the blank acting camera work lighting br br i won't give away any more of the plot because i suppose the synopsis is accurate the movie is meant to show how a malibu girl who though she seems to innately have the compassion and interest to help others when she immediately asks her teacher about the trip to china is spoiled and inconsiderate finds herself as being a healer and helper of both body and spirit br br lame lame lame lame br br now i admittedly am a harsh critic so maybe take one of those away and you'll be on the mark
<START> low budget horror about an evil force hard to believe in this day and age but way back when this stuff actually used to get theatrical release these days this sort of thing would either go direct to video or straight to cable shouldn't be too hard to avoid this one who's ever heard of it
<START> frantic somewhat mean spirited infantile humor abounds in this city boy turned wannabe farmer tale it is not outrageous enough to appeal to the will ferrell crowd and not interesting enough to carry the feature length the most i can praise son in law would be to say that for the most part it avoids toilet humor the main problem is that all of the characters lack warmth and pauly shore is so abrasive that he is a most unlikable hero there are a few amusing bits involving farm animals and that's about it the story what there is is so simplistic and predictable it makes jury duty seem like gone with the wind merk
<START> with anatomy the german film producers have tried to make something totally new usually there just drama or comedy movies in the horror genre is or was totally new at that time br br the story's also new and shocking franka potente plays her role brilliant and i bet you won't find out who's the murderer it's possible but difficult a really great movie with a lot of talented actors
<START> travolta and thurman deserved a better movie this one is very secondary in all aspects not a single fresh idea but the biggest problem is this film's ridiculous philosophy a gang of black rappers after all their criminal activities and even killing people are becoming almost positive mickey mouse like heroes performing on stage and giving away awards at the ceremony perhaps this matches the real life but showing it as a quite normal happy ending is beyond my imagination what's wrong with shooting a couple of bad if they are not politically correct the show must go on that makes me think that hollywood writers have a big problem with separating good and evil even if the genre supposed to be a black comedy
<START> how is this a documentary much more like a walking ghost tour one might take in any given southern city quotes were generously dropped throughout without the first effort at identifying the source george orwell was the most identified br br documents were referred to without ever being produced in any form flat out fraudulent shots depicting period film stock were spliced aside historical film reels with no separation from reality and self promotion film reels which were entirely unrealistic and improbable for the time at hand were dropped in as if trying to ape blair witch hoping to drum up a spook house on what would otherwise simply be dead real estate br br is this not in some way a great disrespect to actual victims of tb a dance on their collective graves for the sake of commercialism the line between actual footage and manufactured self service is so thin the of doubt so played down the scientific boundaries so blatantly ignored how could this possibly be listed in my tivo as documentary br br it's a vacation promo and at that it fully succeeds br br hell i'd visit the joint if i could locate it on google earth not scary said a previous poster not too serious either says i fascinating story flimsy film making
<START> this movie is by far one of the worst b movies i have ever seen there are no plot twists at all though the acting is decent the storyline is terrible there are also many mistakes in the movie and it was bothersome to watch for any of you who like horror movies slasher movies or even b movies i don't recommend this to anyone at all most of the movie is focused on pointless killing in ways that aren't even worth discussing this movie could very well be compared to a crappy remake of jeepers creepers which too wasn't that great of a movie for anyone who wishes to spend a day at home watching poorly made movies this one takes the cake
<START> there's something about a movie that features female bodybuilders that gets me in front of the screen every time br br i've seen pumping iron ii aces iron eagle iii raven hawk and even the tv movie getting physical which featured some big names in the sport they were tolerable in their own ways mostly because they featured rachel br br then i went and watched nemesis iii prey harder on the sole basis that it featured such luminaries as sue price debbie sharon bruneau and ursula love the ladies always will but after this i'm kinda glad i missed the first two nemesis flicks br br well the first one anyway most of the footage here is lifted bodily and kicking and screaming i would guess from nemesis ii actually that one looked marginally entertaining from the evidence supplied here br br but even though price and company flex and pose they don't get much of a chance to do anything else like say act in fact this whole film is an exercise get it ha ha in oblique story telling ambiguous characters and open ended movie making in terms of filming as well as the story line br br nothing makes much sense but even if it did there would still be issues such as making such small parts for such larger than life women as these what a crime br br of course it was written and directed by albert pyun so what did you expect cohesion br br one star only in consideration for all the hard work that price bruneau and obviously put into their bodies not the craft work done within the movie itself br br thanks ladies
<START> so if a guy meets you and he says 'i want you to look at my erection ' don't be alarmed maybe he wants you to look at the film he made about how his house was to be built yes that's the only thing what happens in this movie it's like the worst warholian beep i ever saw it's like filming the inside of your toilet before you flush it in fact it's less interesting to look at than that br br but if you do watch lennon's erection be warned that he put a lot of background noise in it too i mean really it's as if the building is being attacked by space mutants from hell or something in the meanwhile the building in progress is growing up as an erection can do too in almost 20 minutes what an accomplishment br br so if someone does ask you to watch his erection be sure he wants to videotape it all
<START> i picked up this dvd for 4 99 they had put spiffy cover art on the package along with a plot summary that had nothing to do with the movie the acting is terrible and the writing is worse the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as mst3k fodder i paid too much
<START> i just saw this movie and it turns out to be pretty lame just as mentioned by other user reviews and the one thing that bothered me the most was the southern accent some of the characters had it took place in wisconsin not the south as mentioned from other reviews ed wasn't a big dude so why did the guy that plays jason and leatherface portray him br br i fast forwarded through most of it being that there are many slow parts br br hopefully someone will do their homework on ed and the town and make a more accurate movie
<START> yesterday was one of those days we decided to go to the movies we picked van more or less at random but we were interested to see the state of current dutch filmmaking br br the film is based on a book by ronald and i must confess straight away that he is not exactly one of my favorites the film features actors that are best known in the netherlands for their appearances in soap operas and or afternoon talk shows at least one of them has done some fairly decent stuff after leaving the soap world so we decided to give this movie the benefit of the doubt br br and what a mistake that was this movie fails on all fronts bad acting the best performance is actually by a guinea pig which very convincingly pretends to be dead flat uninteresting story with unexplained and uninteresting sidelines why france why tell the story to a girl from uganda mistakes black people dont have to use sunscreen as far as i know and heating systems in the netherlands do not produce clouds of steam like in new york even if this looks great on film people do not wear t shirts outside on new years eve in northern europe there's one funny moment which involves two little dogs and that's it br br so that's what i think but more importantly it seemed that none of the people leaving the movie theater afterwards had enjoyed it i overheard one of them saying that he was extremely disappointed because he liked the book so much i did not read the book but my advice would have to be read the book don't see the film
<START> when i was in 10th grade me and my buddy were up late at his house and were flipping around cable and started watching this movie we watched it because it looked kind of funny and because it had boobs but then the ending came and we just sat there completely speechless i think after a minute of watching the credits roll he just sort of whimpered oh dude it goes from dumb 80's teen sex comedy to nihilistic realism so quickly that it catches you off guard i have been trying to rent this movie for years and have not been able to find it and nobody has ever seen it except for me and my friend so it seems but now it is available i highly suggest renting it and brace yourself
