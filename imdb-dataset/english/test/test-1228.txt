<START> i gave this film a 2 mostly because it does actually have an ok cast but the film itself is just so insert unusually rude word beginning with the sixth letter of the alphabet ing pointless that i felt bad that at the time i voted for it its lowest vote was a three br br very predictable plot two do well musicians have no money and plenty of money problems however when a friend leaves a bag full of money that belongs to drug dealers in their care they of course spend it and then the fun begins br br not an original idea in this whole film
<START> dracula 3000 is the epitome of painfully cheesy cinema from the get go i assumed i was in for something pretty nasty with a cast line up that featured casper van dien erika eleniak coolio and tiny lister what could be expected well let's just say that expectations were crushed br br if i really start up i feel like this review will go on for ages so we're gonna keep this simple the vampire isn't even named dracula the space crew is carrying coffins from the carpathian sector of the transylvania system in his big scene coolio speaks of the most horrible things ever spoken of in film history in the year 3000 everyone wears bad clothes by today's standards they don't have anything more advanced than a modern wheelchair and they decorate with neon lights that appear stolen from a roller rink br br to top it all off the ending sweet merciful god it doesn't deserve to be ruined it has to be sen to be believed br br i've rated this movie a 1 and i wish i could give it a zero yet i feel compelled to make you watch it what madness is this
<START> the price of a dream and some dreams can be too expensive br br only having viewed the english translated version it is perhaps the reason for a low rating from this viewer br br it made the overall film poorer than the story material hinted at br br and other comments seem to suggest the subtitled version would be better br br but some plot elements remained unexplained leaving an unfinished feel br br it also leaves the thought is there a series to follow br br a pity there was no more at this stage at least anyway
<START> unusual film about a man who befriends his social opposite out of fear of blackmail peter boyle makes this film with his foul mouthed boorish portrayal of a working class stiff joe in love with the past and fearful of the future and worried about the present the first half hour of the show features the film debut of a young susan as melissa compton a weak willed rich girl who slums with her loser boyfriend replete with a full nude scene her boyfriend is the film's weak spot a poorly portrayed drug addict and dealer who meets his demise following overdose we meet boyle's joe in a bar as he spouts off and rants about minorities crime hippies and drugs and it is easy to see that the later norman lear television character of archie bunker is based on a cleaned up version of joe the comparison even carries over into joe's wife and personal life and pastimes joe insinuates himself into the life of bill compton melissa's father and the two make an unlikely pair as they search for melissa who has run away from drug treatment and back to the drug addicts she calls friends their search leads them to an oar gee as joe calls it a free love fest fueled by drugs a lot of nudity and surprisingly uptight bill compton and ultra conservative joe both join in they get robbed and this leads to a violent and murderous ending that foreshadows the stark and chilling ending to taxi driver six years later joe is a funny film that on the surface at least is anti violence and anti racist yet the film's main character joe becomes the very instrument of the upheaval he fears when he enters and joins in the illegal and unbridled sexual excesses he rants against so in that respect the film falls short of being a powerful message and leaves you wondering what the final outcome really was all about
<START> if you really really really enjoy movies featuring ants building dirt mirrors eating non ants and conquering the world with a voice over narrative then this is the movie for you basically a couple of scientists working out of a bio dome communicate with highly intelligent ants the most intelligent actors in this film in an attempt to try to thwart their plans of conquest and extermination throughout the movie the two scientists and a girl they rescued from the ants use everything at their disposal computers green dye and horrid acting but to no avail i guess they just couldn't afford any pesticides because the movie would be over too quickly br br the title of the movie phase iv is something of a mystery this is not a spoiler but phase i starts right after the opening credits whereas you don't reach phase iv until the end credits roll apparently the director knew the movie would be tedious to get through and so placed phases 1 3 throughout the movie as a kind of progress report hang in there buddy only 1 more phase until final credits as a mst3k episode this one wasn't very good for two reasons 1 this one is from the season 0 on ktma when they were first starting out so the riffing is not as good as in later seasons and 2 this movie is so bad not even j tb can lighten it up there are one or two gamera references as they had just finished riffing 5 gamera movies br br the movie does have a trick surprise ending but i was so glad to reach the end the effect was lost on me
<START> this is precious everything is illuminated is sweetly and sublimely funny from the first delicious line of dialogue oh how i've been waiting for this to arrive in austin while elijah wood is charming as ever as jonathan safran foer the real life author of the novel everything is illuminated it's eugene playing jonathan's ukrainian tour guide and translator alex who truly steals this film alex is a hip hop lovin' ukrainian break dancer who along with his grandfather helps jonathan find the woman who saved jonathan's grandfather's life during world war ii the ukrainian countryside has never looked so breath taking i'm thinking of packing it all up and moving to the former soviet state br br the tone of the film however shifts when jonathan and alex do finally meet the woman they're looking for and suddenly this adorable comedy turns into a heart breaking historical drama about a jewish village that was annihilated during the nazi occupation everything is illuminated is about history heritage and the wisdom that can be gained from uncovering the past it's perfect

<START> sometimes there's a film so bad that you just keep watching in awe this is one of those films of course i can't help that i'm biased i'm from chicago so i watched the scenes closely for accuracy and i don't find billy crystal funny at all and i can't stand all that english style photography tony scott etc with the smoke machine working overtime and all the soft lighting i suppose we're supposed to believe that billy crystal is really from chicago because he wears a cubs jersey oh and the plot if you really think about it these guys should be locked up not the bad guys since they're more dangerous and of course there's the clichÃ© of the cops on the verge of retiring but the funniest scene is the climax where the good and bad guys machine gun other to death in the thompson center a state building of course it's a cool building but it's the equivalent of making a huge drug deal at the white house
<START> i have some great memories watching robin of sherwood on tv as a kid but i think i only saw michael episodes by some reason and recently my brother bought the new released dvd boxes of the complete series it was great to see it again and it is the best of all the robin hood movies and tv series the cast is great and the locations mixed with music adds this very special feeling i personally think that is the best of the two robins but jason connery was a great choice to continue the series with ray winstone nicolas grace and robert is terrific in their roles as will scarlet the sheriff of nottingham and guy of itÂ´s a pity that a fourth season never got made and iÂ´ve also heard that the writer richard carpenter actually had plans to make a feature film following the events of the series robert of huntingdon connery could finally have married marion judi or maybe the hunter could resurrect robin of and he could take his revenge against the sheriff as have been mentioned before if the producers of robin hood the prince of thieves would have been smart they would have got the cast from robin of sherwood and made the movie to a sort of sequel to the series as ray winstone puts it in the dvd it would have been great to see them as old men just like in sean robin and marian who knows maybe we will se more of this perfect interpretation of the legend in the future in any case we can now watch our favorite series over and over again

<START> between the ages of 30 and 51 when he died of a brain tumour zachary scott made 70 films he was introduced in 1944 in jean 'the mask of where he played the next year 1945 he made three films of which this is one he is best remembered by cineastes as the star of jean renoir's 'the one of the 1945 films where he had a sympathetic role however he often played creepy characters and in this film he is a sociopathic killer of women for money so what happens here he lives in a house with three women so watch out faye emerson who also appeared in plays the older of two daughters in the house she falls in love with scott and they become secretly engaged then her kid' younger sister played effectively by mona freeman who resembles bonita granville both in looks and in behaviour returns from boarding school and reveals casually in conversation with scott that she has inherited a tidy sum so scott turns his sights on her instead with all the torrid jealousies seething in the household which that was bound to arouse things get tense and then they get meanwhile plans for murder are going forward in the mind of the calculating scott but it turns out that he is not the only one with such intentions he is also being searched for as a result of his last kill with which the film has opened so that we know his back story james wong howe gives effective noirish cinematography to this tale which was directed by frenchman robert florey who had moved to hollywood some time earlier the film is an effective psychopath in the house mystery which can cause a bit of wear of the edges of some seats for those of such an inclination
<START> this is the worst movie i have ever seen in my entire life period this movie goes beyond ridiculous it is like the director wants to get his ass sued by the actors for wrongfully their roles as the fantastic four i believe the movie should have been released in comic book stores in order for the only how u should say it desperate geeks who cant get enough cheesiness and want to see more and more crap movies in conclusion to my paradox statements and thesis i do believe this movie has had great disadvantages to the futures of the cast's contributors with the exception of jay underwood's character in which i do believe it was his best performance considering roles such as the not quite human movies in which the story is told in a way that he has no character he cant act and people have made good decisions to not go see his movies this is why he is most likely not going to be any huge roles unless he sparks his career in a most rare but interesting way
