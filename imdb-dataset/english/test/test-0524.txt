<START> oh you pilots are such men they don't call it the cockpit for nothing honey dialogue like that is just one of many reasons why the airport '79 or if you saw it in the uk where it dragged its heels getting released there airport '80 the concorde was the last and by far the least of the series the disaster movie was in dire straits in the what with the swarm having offered much unintentional hilarity and beyond the poseidon adventure when time ran out and city on fire simply offering much boredom and the desperation to find a new spin on the genre is all too apparent here this time it's a conspiracy plot with susan news anchorwoman discovering billionaire boyfriend robert wagner has been selling arms to terrorists and the north vietnamese naturally she decides to tell him everything rather than make the story public but he her off by explaining i'm a very rich man i have everything in life i could ever want why would i that by doing something so incredibly stupid just in case she doesn't buy that line rather than say hire a hit man to kill her on the ground he decides to do things the smart way by planning to destroy the concorde while she's flying to moscow via paris i've done a lot of things i've been ashamed of but i am not a murderer he insists indignantly on his way to a guided missile to destroy the plane so nothing incredibly stupid there and when that fails he sends a jet fighter after it and when that br br don't even think of looking for anything resembling logic here this is real bottom of the barrel stuff that even the studio gave up on and marketed as a comedy in the us after critics laughed it off the screen where the previous three entries all had the look of glossy big budget entertainments this small screen friendly effort the only one not to be shot in 2 35 1 widescreen doesn't even manage to make the concorde look good which is quite a feat tv veteran david lowell rich presumably got the directing gig because he was fast cheap and had previously directed tv movie disaster in the sky where peter graves' supersonic airplane found itself unable to land due to sabotage and senegalese flu which was not intentionally at least a comedy despite the presence of a young billy crystal in the cast and seemed like the natural choice for what looks like a tv movie that somehow escaped into theatres when no one was looking br br cast like a bad episode of hollywood squares stars are in very short supply this time round and most of the few vaguely familiar faces seem to have been rounded up from rehab and busted sitcoms alain delon gives the hollywood career that one last shot as the pilot happy fish don't ask george kennedy moves from the executive suite to the co pilot's seat in the hope of reminding people of the other movies while the rest of the ensemble includes a couple of veterans of the towering inferno wagner and blakely a soft porn star sylvia kristel trying to go respectable an ingmar bergman regular bibi Â and she's the one playing the hooker david warner's navigator on a diet having nightmares about being chased by bananas the voice of the devil mercedes charo and her seeing eye chihuahua screw me martha raye and her weak bladder jimmie walker playing the sax in his seat and smoking weed in the john in the few moments its not occupied by martha raye cicely tyson kissing her credibility goodbye as the obligatory mother with critically ill child and a frozen heart in the overhead locker airline owner eddie albert and trophy wife sybil danning occupying the best seat in the house ed begley jr in goggles and the russian olympic team and their lovable coach val avery and his deaf daughter ahhhh on a goodwill tour of the states who knew about the boycott just to add a touch of the simpsons to proceedings harry shearer voices one news report in the same tones he'd later use for br br highlight despite the impromptu wedding ceremony during a crash landing it just has to be george kennedy diverting a heat seeking missile by opening the window sticking his arm out at nearly twice the speed of sound and firing a flare Â while the plane is upside down and then alain delon turns off the engines so there won't be a heat source for the missiles to home in yes someone actually got paid for writing this and that someone was future oscar winner and screenwriter of munich and the insider eric roth hey everybody has to start somewhere although in his defence it was producer jennings lang who came up with the plot still what do you expect from a film that credits stunt and ends with a shot of the concorde flying off into the sunset amazingly in one of those won't admit defeat moments studios used to be prone to universal shot another 20 minutes or so of footage a couple of years later to include in the network tv showings not included on the dvd sadly its box office failure led to the fifth entry in the series the laugh riot that would have been airport 1984 ufo never getting off the ground even more genuinely tragically it was the concorde used in this film that crashed in france 21 years later br br oh and if you're wondering what charo says to her chihuahua in spanish when it's not allowed on board it's what do you think don't worry when the revolution comes i promise you will fly on anything you want i promise what a shame my love what do they think they are
<START> oh man i hated this movie granted the site locations were great but that's about the only positive thing i can say about it now i'm going to state right at the beginning that i am very critical of the way weapons especially firearms are both portrayed and handled in movies being a war flick portrayal was fine but the shoddy weapons handling in the movie would have never been tolerated by a real seal team the acting was more wooden than my first the equipment carried or lack of it was laughable and the dialogue was shall we say lacking in anything interesting well with the exception of the journalist which was actually prescient watching this movie was comparable to watching with woody harrelson where each scene was so bad you just couldn't turn it off because you had to see if they could get worse with the next scene like they certainly did the scene in the water where after shooting the first of the enemy they blow the damn boat up thereby having to face possible drowning made me laugh so hard that for a millisecond i almost thought it was worth waiting through the movie for then charlie sheen decided to drag the surviving enemy down to the depths of the ocean the way it was filmed with the many camera cuts it looked like they went down about 80 feet nice continuity there before slashing his throat was so damn stupid i was stunned then again so was the whole damn movie i enjoy action movies but not this one note the version i watched was a tv version pan scan i can't imagine that made a difference except for making the whole thing blessedly shorter
<START> i remember really liking batman returns when it came out in 1992 but now i think that this is the best of all the batman movies even over christopher nolan's terrific 2005 batman begins and definitely over the seriously over hyped overrated 2008 the dark knight i originally remember thinking that the 1st batman w jack nicholson was the best and i still love it but i think that this movie really hits the nail on the head the 4 main characters batman penguin catwoman and max are all vivid and memorable you really get to see what batman bruce wayne is all about in keaton's terrific characterization keaton is the best batman not kilmer clooney or even the up and coming bale who was exceptional in bb and could have stolen top honors from keaton had his character not been destroyed by nolan's hack film making in br br danny devito as the penguin is disturbing scary hilarious and lethal devito is great and doesn't need scenery chewing to give great performance like nicholson's joker the viewer can actually sympathize with this disfigured outcast and his plight to fit into normal society i had never really been big fan of michelle pfeiffer until this film but this is definitely my favorite performance of hers selina kyle is goofy and odd at first then when she is transformed into catwoman she is simultaneously sexy and scary a total deadly sexpot also i feel that keaton and pfeiffer have more chemistry than keaton and basinger from batman they form a tragic love story and christopher walken as is well as always christopher walken br br batman returns more so than batman is more confident and focused it is assured film making from beginning to end the way burton introduces the penguin's heartbreaking backstory grabs you from the very beginning the first 5 minutes are among my favorite beginnings to any film danny elfman's music sets an ominous foreboding tone that defines the rest of the film it is a modification from the original batman and a great one br br then flash forward 33 years to the present day gotham and we are introduced to powerful businessman who wants to build new power plant in gotham during same scene we meet meek bullied under confident secretary selina kyle and not long after all this is the film's exciting opening action sequence as batman must battle the penguin's red triangle gang a fun yet lethal group of outcasts and circus performers penguin sets plan in motion to attack the gotham christmas celebration kidnap in the chaos and force him to help re introduce him to society meanwhile selina discovers criminal plans and so he kills her by shoving her out his high rise office then she is revived by cats br br sound convoluted yes but burton never claimed to be posing a realistic story he has created a world where the viewer can accept that things like this can happen a dark noirish world comprised of mistreated deformed outcasts who deep down only want acceptance and to fit in confident storytelling if you ask me br br the action scenes are few and far in between but they are all exciting entertaining and nail biting they aren't there just for show the way some in batman are and they all make sense the climactic scene with penguin's army marching into the center of gotham with batman in on penguin's hideout and sidekick butler alfred michael gough in a welcome return from the original assisting batman is succinct solid heart pounding fun br br i also love the christmastime wintry setting which adds to the super dark cold feel of burton's batman world i also love the way burton slowly introduces to us the batman toys without shoving them down our throats each toy is appropriate for that moment in the film and we are compelled to accept them for their purpose and although dark returns is still a funny film devito's penguin has many funny lines so does walken's the batman catwoman exchanges are extremely stimulating and humor filled as well a great ensemble all in all batman returns is a tightly woven tale of the dark forces at play in tim burton's fun comic book world
<START> fun entertaining movie about wwii german spy julie andrews falling in love with american pilot rock hudson while trying to get secrets from him for some reason this was attacked by critics and shunned by the public in 1970 i can't see why it's beautifully shot has wonderful costumes and interiors and exciting aerial dogfights also it has andrews doing a strip tease strictly pg material and singing a beautiful song whistling in the dark the movie does have problems andrews and hudson did not get along during the shooting of this and it shows their love scenes lack spark and they have zero sexual chemistry still they turn in ok performances the film is a little long even in the 105 min director's cut i saw and gets way too dark and serious at the end still worth catching try seeing the directors cut the other one runs half an hour longer
<START> i agree with the other 9 and 10 star reviews i saw this at the south by southwest film festival in austin of the 20 films i saw 7 were really good and this was the best one for me i'm a sucker for movies that have plot devices where characters go through transformations that totally change their lives the excellent acting was mostly done by people involved in tv or it was their first movie it was written and directed by jay floyd this was his debut as a director jay's day job is apparently as a clearance administrator for lots of famous films forgiving the was a total delight and extremely funny in spots this is one movie where i would buy the dvd and re watch it truly a high complement from me well done jay yes give up your day job
<START> the best thing and that's pretty good about the black castle is that it's a black and white gothic grabber featuring a murderous mad count which was somehow made in 1952 the star ostensibly is the british actor richard greene a capable leading man who reminds me of an earlier version of roger moore the villain is a mad count played by stephen mcnally who does a credible job except when he's called on to laugh maniacally skulking around in the shadows is a long boris karloff in a decidedly secondary role of an aged doctor who may or may not be the salvation of our hero br br it's the middle of the 18th century in austria and sir ronald burton greene is determined to find out what happened to two close friends they disappeared in the vicinity of the castle belonging to count karl von bruno mcnally deep in the black forest it seems that sir ronald and his friends had been instrumental in defeating a brutal plan of von bruno's in africa three years previously involving slavery and ivory the count was left not only with failure but with a scar on his face and a black patch he now wears to cover a ruined eye von bruno vowed revenge and it seems he might have been partially successful so under a false name sir ronald arranges for a hunting invitation from the count and off we go by carriage through a dark journey of storm and howling wolves to the count's castle it's a hulking mass of stone turrets and corridors shadowy huge fireplaces and creepy passages that lead to dank dungeon cells a torture chamber and a great pit filled with snapping thrashing crocodiles it also is filled by the count's lovely blond sensitive wife elga paula who sometimes is billed as rita and by the count's two close friends played by those two actors we know from the fifties who specialized in being slime in costume john hoyt and michael there is a dangerous leopard hunt forbidden kisses knuckling servants wooden signs creaking and swaying in the cold wind and poison in a cup not the least doctor karloff has a special vial filled with a drug which will so slow the bodily functions that death will seem to have occurred the risk is that well when the person awakes ten hours later he'd better hope he's not already nailed shut in his coffin br br surprisingly for all the clichÃ©s the black castle keeps moving merrily along the movie takes itself seriously but it's competently enough made to keep our interest even if we wind up sitting back with a smile while we watch it's even reassuring in a way to realize there are strong echoes of the most dangerous game when burton realizes just how crazy von bruno is he becomes even more determined to bring von bruno to accounts and naturally he has fallen for elga von bruno crazed by vengeance yet crafty and capable is a man who loves the hunt and is by the kill hollywood's second creative rule has always been if you're going to steal steal from the best it's first creative rule of course is if you're going to steal steal from the best and then turn it into the black castle is a nice bite of austrian
<START> good show really good acting and the director takes us swimming through his storyline in an interesting unpredictable way especially since essentially it's two people in a room it doesn't race through like many modern films but doesn't drag either is flippant enough to believe her in the now of her character which is still involved and not going back on her choices so it is believable without the need for her to show us a deep self examination of her soul brundage has the delicate balance of weight innocence and class to pull off very well a bit grainy on the film quality but it fits the tone of the story could use a little polishing on the hair and makeup end of things but definitely worth watching
<START> i don't want to spoil the movie for anyone but this mimics life's reality in so many ways and if you are really honest with yourself you will resonate with it in agreement in at least a few of the scenes br br the acting is not only believable but convincing in a way that one to the characters moreover it's funny without trying too hard at it br br and yes i truly believe a sequel is warranted here see the movie you'll understand why br br highly recommended especially if you like movies that have a real message
<START> good attempt at tackling the unconventional topic of may december romances however the treatment is totally unrealistic sure sixty year old men can and do fall for younger women but they're usually adult women with whom they share common interests and values and viewpoints not neurotic immature near underage girls of course there are exceptions and they come close to being called pedophiles sorry rgv but it's not credible that a sane and accomplished would throw away a comfortable family life and become a joke to his peers all for an 18 yr old that doesn't have a practical thought in her head and that behaves like an unstable escapee from a mental institution you don't have to have a phd in psychology to see that amitabh's character is seduced by sex and that the young woman has unresolved abandonment and daddy issues br br as for the recurring scene of vijay perched on the edge of a cliff contemplating suicide that's about as close as he comes to having anything in common with by behaving like a smitten teenage boy br br on a positive note the actors did a good job and cinematography good
<START> i really do not joke when i can honestly submit that this film is not suitable for sunday night viewing on br br the underground scenes are just awful when london is supposedly under of water robert character is drab the police outfit reminds me of something kate moss threw up and nigel looks very very old in fact i am worried that he may have had suffered a stroke whilst filming br br the father of robert carlyle who was 'right all has obviously been necking too many and whilst he has a major part in this awkward journey he deserved to be killed off way way before he was caught pretending to be kate winslett titanic whilst dangling over the thames barrier br br i'm sorry film lovers but avoid at all costs
<START> the problem with this and with all vietnam war films is that they're all too biased antiwar films overlook the fact that the vast majority of u s soldiers were heroes while films overlook the fact that a lot of the soldiers did indeed commit atrocities like the one in this movie this film sucks it's time for a movie that is neither nor antiwar nor liberal nor conservative but completely unbiased
<START> this columbo episode is one of the better and perhaps one of my personal favorites the cast includes rosemary's baby john cassavetes as the maestro his wife played by blythe danner gwyneth paltrow's mom and his mother in law played by myrna loy one of america's greatest leading actresses in film of our time anyway i disagree with anybody who criticizes against this film this episode is one of my favorites because you have an excellent cast who do a superb job in performing i love watching columbo with his beloved dog who he never names in the series this time the episode focuses in on classical music at the hollywood bowl one of l a 's attractions of course columbo becomes as interested in classical music as he does anything else involving a crime
<START> very sadly i can relate to this movie as i'm 17 and have yet to be kissed so i really feel for josie it's been a while since seeing this film but to write this review i re watched it and remembered everything i loved about it br br drew barrymore is a great actress and this role suited her really well at the time the chemistry between sam and josie was really good and michael vartan was an excellent actor in this br br i loved the storyline too as i said up there i could relate and it's rare you find a film you can completely relate to br br all over i loved it 7 10
<START> irrespective of the accuracy of facts bandit queen is a true story its true because the themes it deals with hold as much truth today as they did way back in 1994 this movie is violent powerful and thought provoking the protagonist is a woman of flesh and blood whose adversity brought out the best or worst out of her keeping the subjectivity aside there is no doubt that character from a young girl of 8 who is married off by her father to clear a debt pun intended to a gang leader who goes on to become a leader of the lower caste has evolved into a champion in her own right her portrayal is so powerful that the viewer is even willing to forgive her for a massacre br br i can understand if the western audience is not able to appreciate this masterpiece bandit queen needs to be in the indian context and not just checked out in stereotypes i may not be able to sell it on its universal appeal but its certainly a must watch for the indian audience its a shame that the movie had a delayed overtly censored release in india br br bandit queen is the story of a woman who fought against two odds in india being a woman and that too a lower caste her rebellious nature and inability to just give in caused her the most horrible experiences in life which only went on to strengthen her into a self proclaimed goddess she responded to violence with violence and dint become the submissive woman society wanted her to be call it divine justice or failure had she killed a single person she would have been hanged she killed 24 and got revered respected and glorified br br p s whoever found her character psychotic needs to be sodomized at 8 by 10 men at a go and paraded naked then they should be asked how normal do they feel
<START> this movie was pure genius john waters is brilliant it is hilarious and i am not sick of it even after seeing it about 20 times since i bought it a few months ago the acting is great although ricki lake could have been better and johnny depp is magnificent he is such a beautiful man and a very talented actor and seeing most of johnny's movies this is probably my favorite i give it 9 5 10 rent it today
