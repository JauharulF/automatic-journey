<START> nine out of nine people who watched this have declared themselves to be mentally scarred for life no one should ever have to see this abomination the english language is poorly equipped to express how utterly dreadfully atrocious this film is it's really not worth the plastic it's made of no greater crime has been committed by the human race in the entire history of creation never is there likely to be anything worse br br it was agreed unanimously that the scene involving the shrunken head of tommy and the young girl's blouse was unbelievably sick and twisted in fact many of us have not yet recovered from the ordeal and are currently sitting in the corner of the room rocking sucking our thumbs and whimpering br br the fundamental question on everyone's lips however has to be why how is it possible for anyone to create such a monstrosity and then subject it to so many innocent people after viewing the trailer we thought that this film might be a laugh how wrong we were br br please sign the petition to rid the world of shrunken heads so that no other poor civilians be exposed to it please for the good of humanity
<START> the mission to see the movie the cave was a dream of a friend of mine after witnessing the highly dramatic trailer full of flashes of a creature lurking in a cave some young cave divers and not much else it's too bad that the movie didn't change much more than the trailer did br br the immediate allure of a movie like this is the creature what's he going to look like why does he live in a cave how is this one supposed to be different from the other creatures we've been shown in movies like alien and predator and the relic the cave demons do not look far from the skeletal creature in alien resurrection and even has the sight of predator shame that's a total ripoff br br well let's look at the plot very confusing and jumps to more and more totally improbable twists as a team of cave divers is sent to find a cave and its dwellers in the carpathian mountains the casting was very much clear that we want young hip tough chicks chiseled guys and the girls who have brains also have to be hot we also have to have one of every racial background in case the audience thinks that the film makers are biased to a certain viewpoint totally been done and i'm totally tired of it br br the other main problem was the ending as if to say there might be a sequel shoot me if there is one the tagged on ending made me wretch br br i gave this movie 3 10 stars the points that it did get were more or less appreciation points towards the creature builders for their high quality job spent on the costuming and design for the monsters who dwell within even when they looked totally ripped off and there's an interesting yet labored documentary on the dvd on underwater cave diving go check it out only if you love new creations of monsters and creatures but be warned that you've probably seen this movie before and it was better the first time
<START> contains spoilers br br garfield and his owner jon arbuckle were in a rut they basically had no life at all all they did was lay around and count the ceiling jon even organized his sock drawer according to color and fabric he needed a life so he consults a book on the subject that tells him to meet a woman a bar was a great place to start unfortunately when the music started and jon hit the dance floor we see what made disco die jon killed it jon next tried to pick up girls at the video store he ended up feeling down in the mouth literally the laundromat was no prize either when jon and his would be date get a glimpse of each other's underwear jon tried to act all buff at the beach but soon he angered a real buff guy which left jon feeling once again down in the mouth literally jon then tried to pick up girls walking and jogging by no avail jon pulled out a guitar and sings the blues unfortunately when he mentioned his cat being fat a fat man walked up and stomped jon's guitar it was hopeless br br fortunately for jon an ad flashed on the tv an ad for lorenzo's school for the personality impaired it guaranteed a lifeless person to get a life in a few easy steps jon and garfield attend the class the building didn't exactly look the same way it did on tv nor did lorenzo act as peppy as he did on tv jon sat next to a pretty girl named mona so while lorenzo taught his lessons of introducing yourself checking your pulse and pretending to speak a foreign language jon and mona get to know one another they leave together forgetting all about garfield at home jon and mona just sat on the porch and talked garfield was jealous of mona for fear that she would take jon away from him garfield envisioned the future jon and mona get married she moves in and soon she gives birth to a little arbuckle who is overjoyed at pulling garfield's tale back to the present garfield would not stand for it he tried to get jon to get rid of mona until she started scratching behind his ears but then jon learned that mona was allergic to cats so that was basically the end of their relationship but they still saw each other every now and then and garfield was sure to be with them br br another hilarious garfield tv special this one was made during the run of tv's garfield and friends garfield was slimmed down somewhat somewhat since early 1980's cartoons the scenes of jon trying to pick up chicks is funny so is the one where the fat guy stomps on jon's guitar good ol' lorenzo music is back as garfield thom huge is jon frank welker the third man of 1 000 voices is lorenzo and june foray the woman of 1 000 voices is mona if you like garfield then i recommend you see garfield gets a life today it along with here comes garfield and garfield on the town were just released on dvd so check them all out today you are guaranteed a good time hey has garfield ever let you down before br br
<START> this movie absolutely terrible not only was the acting awful but so was the sleep got while this movie played this movie achieved the all powerful goal of crap i watched this movie thinking my 5 wouldn't b in vein but i was very wrong i guarantee u r better off just reading what i have to say about this unbelievably horrible movie b4 yourself in the way of this dignity depriving movie i give it a negative 1 for trying but no please no don't watch this movie i had friends who joined me for this film shortly after they were no longer found this movie actually will make u end your life please please don't see it i beg of u if u see this movie make sure u destroy all copies because this movie is a spawn of satan
<START> i know this movie is a low budget horror movie intended for those in favor of shocks and inexpensive gore but even considering that this movie is just too dull filled with an incoherent plot along with awful music and obvious signs that this movie was never finished br br without giving any spoilers i'll just say that by the final reel things are wrapped up with no at all either by film or narration the girl is real attractive but yet that is not a good enough reason to enjoy this movie br br if you are a fan of those gore movies from the 60's and 70's then you should watch it but be warned that it does not even reach to the usual plateau of these kinds of movies
<START> ok so this film is well acted it has good direction but the simple fact is that it undermines what all gay and lesbian people have been fighting for all these years the straight man deciding to be gay and the gay man deciding to be straight i did enjoy it up until the last 20 minutes after that i got really offended as what usually happens in these films the straight actors play the main parts and the out gay actors play the secondary straight roles the leads are played by handsome men but don't let that distract you from the fact that this is a a film that leaves you feeling unfulfilled all the romance and relationships you hope would happen do not unless you are a priest that is in which case god bless straight woman who cure our homos
<START> i think this movie is amazing but there is one problem there is one song that i want to find but cannot find it it starts on about 18 minutes just after the coach has said what are u the runt of the family and then looks at the fat kid takes his hat off then he says go the song that starts there i would like to know what it is does any 1 no email me please or add a comment it starts something along those lines i just think it is an amazing dance track i would love to have that song so that i could use it in my break dancing lessons it starts when they are jumping and running over the orange fast stepper things which are used in football training to help you run faster
<START> i was amazed about this early performance of clint eastwood i had not read a summary of the film when i decided to watch it on tv due to mr eastwood i expected some nice shootings and no deep story i was quite mistaken i found a couple of topics unusually explicitly addressed and until the end i couldn't make up my mind about who's good and who's bad this movie is definitely not typical eastwood but surely worth watching
<START> this is exactly what australian television and australian politics needs people with a sense of humour good on abc for supporting these guys the show is based around a couple of aussie blokes who know how to take the mickey out of politicians or other people in the limelight the boys use sydney as their main base for making a splash in the public keep an eye out for the crazy guy or mr ten questions the guys who perform these acts are the same guys that presented if you enjoyed and the then you will love this show i am still interested in knowing which stunts are real and which are purely acting because there are some questionable actions made by the guys
<START> i can not say this movie was a hilarious but i must have had a grin on my face the entire time i like this darker kind of comedy very bad things 8 heads in a duffel bag or coldblooded br br the way the main character tries to get away with murder is a lot of fun to watch to me it was not much of a surprise what the ending would be but the way that ending came about was another thing that sticks out is the way they have managed to involve the audience the way terry looks at us is hilarious you can almost pretend you're his accomplice
<START> after reading over all these reviews i'm very surprised to see that no one has even once noted that this show was based on the 1957 to 1960 nbc cop show m squad starring lee marvin i read reviews comparing it to dragnet and some of the quinn martin police shows but if you watch m squad you'll see it was based on it in the late 1958 episodes of m squad onwards you'll see lee marvin who plays lieutenant detective frank get out of his car and then hes shot at and he shoots back the beginning of police squad is basically the same including the jazz music and then lee marvin narrates what goes on im lieutenant detective frank m squad a special department of the chicago police and in police squad leslie neilsen does the same im detective lieutenant frank police squad a special division of the police department and so on in one of the m squad episodes there's even the johnny the guy character and in a m squad episode entitled more deadly there's a police squad episode entitled a substantial gift the broken promise which is the same story
<START> with my two stars i will probably make it to the head of the imdb it list for this apparently tremendously popular tv series br br not least because of the enthusiastic comments on this website i decided to purchase a dvd edition of the series because i usually find british humour suits me just fine i gave up in the middle of the second instalment Â and according to other comments the bits were already through br br so now i know according to another comment that i definitely lack a sense of humour but then i had to laugh like crazy while watching and re watching fawlty towers to which black books is Â albeit faintly Â thematically related why the different reactions it might be a mere generation thing and yet the differences can be pointed out br br both fawlty towers and black books are set in businesses which are meant to sustain their owners financially both businesses are not successful but seem Â by a miracle Â to survive fawlty towers is funny because the protagonists have to deal with situations they cannot cope with the lies in the fact that they make a serious effort to succeed and while laughing one also feels sorry for them black books has no situations it's just there and the owner passes his time feeling sorry for himself if a situation threatens to arise it is quickly away it is remarkable how fast and how often a subject is dropped and the protagonists turn to something entirely different to produce an additional joke telling jokes Â and not very good ones seems to be all black books is about why a bookstore a hardware store would have done the job just as well br br no stop wait it's a bookshop because below the veneer of rudeness vulgarity and arrogance the protagonists are supposed to be delicate and cultured they are not some lowbrow gorillas but bumbling semi intellectual losers hey they are like you and me the manner in which the series makes that claim is the only way i can explain its success there is nothing remarkable in the protagonist's actions what's special about them is their economically unrealistic living conditions many viewers maybe envy them for that protagonists that narcissistic and vapid convey a sense of belonging and companionship seems to be a trademark of the time the first world is presently living in br br recently i watched also a fairly new british tv comedy show i found it uproariously funny it is often quite tasteless or xenophobic Â but always with a purpose and hitting the bull's eye in its social criticism the humour is mainly created by situations or by characters with a purpose the low ratings in imdb might indicate that this brand of humour is not in keeping with the times but i am glad it's still alive and kicking and hope it will continue to do so
<START> i can't add much to what has been said already except i'm going to have to because of the 10 lines minimum policy br br i've actually got this on a vhs to dvd copy but the quality is quite poor and i desperately need for it to be officially released br br i can just imagine what extras i would like to see tim healy's character swearing his way through one of those type programmes would be great you can imagine it now can't you but of course it looks like most people will have to carry on dreaming about a dvd release br br surely to god there must be someone in the dvd releases department at itv who also knows something about british culture is web savvy and has enough about them to look at imdb now and again oh well
<START> i checked this out at the vancouver international film festival and was not impressed br br the only area of the film i enjoyed was the commentary on film making for the most part this film seemed random and somewhat fantastical i don't say that in a complimentary way however and just silly it was as if he was mixing fantasy with everyday life which may sounds intriguing in some films but the fantasy merely seemed needlessly perverse br br my criticism of this film is not upon the actors rather the story itself i found it boring and narcissistic i wanted my money back but considering it was a film festival that wasn't about to happen
<START> i saw this movie previewed before something else i rented a while back and it looked decent i've seen some good stuff from full moon video and thought it was worth a shot unfortunately this was not good stuff br br the story is about a possessed bed a couple moves into a new apartment discovers the bed and odd things start happening odd things like the woman discovers kinky sex and the man discovers kinky sex and the woman draws pictures of kinky sex and the man photographs kinky sex and they both start having dreams about dead people having kinky sex you'd think a movie with so much kinky sex would be good right br br well no the problem is that this is supposed to be a scary movie or at least a thriller and it just doesn't deliver there is little tension no suspense and no fear aside from some troubling dreams and visions there really isn't anything for this couple to be worried about the whole movie is basically the two of them having these visions and playing around in bed sure you get a monster fight at the end and some bloodshed but nothing spectacular there's only one murder and one good scare and that's it br br and the kinky sex don't get your hopes up or anything else for that matter their idea of kinky sex is woman on top fully clothed trying to strangle her mate with a necktie not exactly my idea of a good time
