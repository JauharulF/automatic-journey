<START> imaginary heroes is one fine little film written and directed by dan harris this story is classic theater weaving comedy and tragedy together so tightly that the climax of the film takes your breath away br br the travis family is an odd bunch no member is who each appears to be beginning with a suicide of the reluctant 'hero' child swimming champion matt kip the father ben jeff daniels falls apart and isolates himself from his family and himself while the mother sandy sigourney weaver turns to pot and rage and sarcasm the daughter penny michelle williams returns from school repulsed by her family's behavior and the remaining son tim emile hirsch takes the brunt of all of the above by avoiding his classmates girlfriend and teams with his neighbor kyle ryan donowho to leap into drugs and sexual experimentation throughout the film tim tries to hide bruises on his body that have a secret all their own yet lead his girlfriend to feel rejection his mother to rage against the trailer park trash bully she believes is the cause and finally open the window to the deep scars this family has suffered for years secrets and lies here and the resolution of them is painfully dramatic br br this may be sigourney weaver's finest role although emile jeff daniels ryan donowho and kip despite the brevity of his role all contribute top notch performances the story begins slowly and seems to meander and that fact may lose some viewers' attention but stay with this little powerhouse film and the impact of the work will stun you highly recommended grady harp
<START> the snow queen is based on the famous and very beautiful fairytale by hans christian andersen about a girl gerda who goes on a dangerous journey to rescue her friend kai from the clutches of the snow queen this adaption attempts to capture that story's sense of adventure and luminously intricate imagery through lavish sets and production design but fails on a number of counts br br like so many hallmark productions the potential of the story is completely undercut by heavy handed scripting and direction the two actors playing gerda and kai are blandly pleasant but forgettable bridget fonda as the snow queen looks the part but is otherwise miscast for the role there's a notable lack of dramatic tension to this meandering three hour miniseries at least some of the pacing problems can be attributed to the addition of filler scenes that add very little to the original story particularly in the opening hour that introduces the main characters br br that said the snow queen would be just about ideal for pre teens with a liking for fantasy and a bit of patience it's great eye candy without being scary and the acting is pitched at the sort of pantomime over the top level that spells out the storyline in very very bold text just make sure you read them andersen's story too
<START> it starts a little slow but give it a chance in the spirit of the ship in the arm and the pink sub this movie is about a not so orthodox group engaged in not so orthodox methods to outwit everyone rob schneider is priceless as a lt that takes himself way too seriously which results in a failed mutiny attempt and pirate crew makes him walk the plank in contrast kelsey grammar similar to cary grant does not take anything to serious except the job this movie is more about lines than plot from the up fisherman in charleston harbor to the whale decoy their antics took me by surprise and i laughed out loud
<START> seriously engaging intelligent and thought provoking drama at its very best mean gripping moody and captivating every home should have a copy don't take my word for it see it yourself one life stand makes you consider your own lifestyle and how you treat your family and friends beautiful photography and impressive acting makes for one of the best cinema graphic experiences of the year john debut is a delight and adds a real touch of truth and realism to this deep and gritty film this is a film that cares and has an honesty that is in recent years no car chases but a film packed with hum our and emotion i first saw this film screened at the edinburgh film festival in 2000 and am now delighted to be able to own a copy on dvd
<START> i cannot believe someone gave this movie a 1 rating and it is only a 3 average what is not to love about this film it is original it has lots of scare scenes that actually made me jump out of my seat and it has some great special effects the story is fresh there is some nudity and it is very campy the killer was scary in his own demented way and the end is very unexpected i must admit that i really love this film one of spain's best horror films ever if you consider yourself a true horror fan you need to get out there and try to find this film you will be pleasantly surprised to do so
<START> uma and travolta were very good together but unfortunately when they left the screen the movie was nothing but a bunch of very boring and wordy secondary characters wrapped in some extremely bad writing occasional glimpses of greatness like the dance scene between uma and travolta quickly eroded when the likes of harvey keitel and similar uninteresting thugs came on and the white dude who tried to act black got very very tiresome after way too much exposure in the picture he weighed down a fairly good performance by the rock the only secondary character who you couldn't wait to see leave the screen bad dumb plot the writers clearly couldn't figure out if they writing to generation x or the 12 15 year old rap crowd and the combination turned into a film that kept me staring at my watch
<START> i think andrew davies did an admirable job of taking a magnificent book which emulated the pace and styling of a victorian novel and turning it into a moving and entertaining film i'm glad i read twice the book first which is usually the case for me i know that one must view a novel and a film as different media and judge them accordingly but still it's often hard to read the original material after a film gives away the best parts br br i realize that davies is a very good adapter but i wish the producers had chosen a woman to write the screenplay davies as he admits in the commentary that accompanies the film on dvd wanted particularly to emphasis the more scatological bits in the book i certainly enjoyed those on film as in the book but davies missed a half dozen moments that are so excruciatingly painfully tender which he could have incorporated if his sensibility were more feminine br br i also would take issue with his use of the book's primary symbol the rose br br as the screenplay was plotted by davies the denouement was inevitable and appropriate but i really think that author waters' final nod to the rose symbol was much more interesting and i preferred way the novel let nan come of age than the way davies chose br br one quick comment about the four actors who essay the primary roles they are all wonderfully talented well except for the singing and dancing perhaps and moreover their physical presences are so much what the mind's eye sees when reading the novel before seeing the film i thought they were all terrific br br i recommend that any lesbian and anyone who loves good fiction add both the book and the dvd of tipping the velvet to their
<START> the scariest thing about freshman director carter smith's new horror movie the ruins is the closing credits that list comedian ben stiller as one of the executive producers what was stiller thinking when he sank his bucks into this chiller about cursed carnivorous that creeps up on its victims and devours them oscar nominated scenarist scott b smith of a simple plan adapting his own bestselling novel sticks steadfastly to the standard clichÃ©s and conventions of all twentysomething scary sagas where reckless youth do everything but tote signs begging the forces of evil to eat them were cretinous characters not enough to contend with in this nihilistic nonsense we're treated to yet another film where american tourists find themselves in jeopardy simply because they are americans furthermore unlike really good horror movies that explain why the monsters have a need to feed the ruins provides no explanation for the supernatural shenanigans of its villainous vines br br the set up for the ruins resembles the 2006 horror movie where slimy south americans trapped brainless american and harvested them for their internal organs indeed generated some legitimate thrills and chills the ruins spawns nothing in the way of either thrills or chills a malicious that suddenly lurches on camera to snarl at our heroes is as close as it gets to a thrill br br the rest of the ruins borrows from another movie the descent a superb 2006 chiller about a bunch of babes plunged into a nightmare experience when they get lost in warren of caves inhabited by albino mutants with a blood lust for murder a couple of other movies that served either intentionally or unintentionally come to mind too they are the straightforward 1968 hammer horror classic the lost continent about murderous vegetation that menaces innocent bystanders in a sea of derelict ships and the roger corman cult class the little shop of horrors 1961 about a new york florist that grows a man eating plant in his shop br br the ruins unfolds in the scenic sunny mexico where four frolicking american college kids eric shawn of the x men movies stacy laura ramsey of the covenant jeff jonathan tucker of sleepers and amy jena malone of pride prejudice are wrapping up their tequila soaked spring break stacy loses a prized earring in a motel swimming pool but a helpful teutonic twentysomething tourist mathias joe anderson of copying beethoven recovers it and the group embraces him as newest best friend these people live to party and they have already made friends with a trio of greek tourists mathias tells them about his wayward brother who has accompanied a cute female archaeologist to a remote mayan pyramid that isn't listed in any he offers to take them with him and they accept br br first rule of horror movies if nobody knows about the place where you're going you'd be well advised to avoid it since they have only one day left and they haven't done anything adventurous our two couples along with their spanish speaking greek friend newcomer dimitri decide to follow mathias and check the pyramid out they catch a bus into the interior of mexico and look for a taxi to take them on the next leg of their journey a cabbie glances at their map and warns them to stay away second rule of horror movies when the natives warn you to steer clear you steer clear a crisp twenty dollar bill helps him change his mind and he them off to their destination and then he in a heartbeat br br no sooner have our heroes found the mysterious mayan pyramid covered with that looks suspiciously like a variation of mississippi in the jungle than superstitious natives appear they know that the pyramid is haunted and they kill without a qualm when he tries to dispel their fears the remaining protagonists scramble to safety atop the pyramid while the paranoid natives surround them to prevent them from escaping eventually the vines slink out to greet our heroes and eat them at this point the ruins turns into bug the recent and ridiculous ashley judd schizoid movie about insects that get under your skin before long our heroes are carving each other up in a futile effort to extract the vines from under their skin one particularly gruesome scene shows the americans off the german guy's legs to save his life by comparison it makes the tortures of the spanish inquisition look tame br br the ruins ranks as just another vine mess with nothing to redeem it
<START> i don't understand where these bad comments are coming from the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night br br the part that gets you is that this could all happen not to the extent perceived in the movie but the whole idea is reality this movie took that reality and twisted it into a dee snider nightmare br br three thumbs up the third one is from the dead body in my freezer
<START> who will love my children has changed my heart it made me cry all the way through the most i cried with was when the family had to say goodbye to the baby i cried the most with that and each time a child was adopted i cried when they had to say goodbye to their mother it was sad for them to lose their mother i felt sorry for the kid with epilepsy i was glad he was adopted by the same family as one of his brothers to me that boy i thought was the special one because he was going in a home i feel that i am special because i am in a world with syndrome and sometimes when i feel down i sometimes like to cry i really enjoyed this movie 10 out of 10 a true story very good another movie that would bring tears to your eyes i think would haver to be with http www imdb com title
<START> ok the show was a little uneven but i still loved it i found the main two bunnies annoying but plucky were always amusing br br i really want the baby plucky episodes on dvd or even vhs please release those br br specifically the potty years episode aired on 11 22 91 the going up episode aired on 9 17 92 and the minister golf episode in 11 92 br br they are the funniest bits of the whole series and even over a decade later we still reference these bits br br i have nothing more to say please reduce the minimum to something like 5 lines and rewards us for brevity
<START> lush cinematography beautifully written and edited john boorman's beyond is a must see for anyone interested in world politics and the arc of personal transformation it interweaves a personal and political tale that continues to haunt me popping up in my mind's eye with frequency the story line is gripping and the inner and outer journeys are paralleled carefully and delicately both cinematically and in the story line i've watched this film at least six times and it really holds up to scrutiny it is particularly relevant today given world events check it out you won't regret it btw netflix does not yet carry it but you can request that they do
<START> i've only seen this film once when it was shown on tv but i can still remember it 15 years later so that must say something about it i thought it was an intelligent look into schooling friendship bullying and the influence it can have leading into adult life br br the title really refers to how being good or bad at sports can either make you the lowest of the low or you will be tolerated by the cliques within school and even later on into adulthood if you're good at it this is set in a private school in england but it could be anywhere br br the main character is bad at games seeks revenge in later life which all culminates in a climactic confrontation on a cricket pitch i must admit i was gutted by the ending it was powerful and saddening
<START> although the story is good and portrayals what i expected of sam elliot my dvd copy contained almost unbearable synchronization problems the dialogue was almost 3 seconds behind the lip movement throughout the whole film br br i would therefore be very careful in purchasing any dvd of the film without checking for the problem br br i would also follow the recommended censors particularly in relation to language and drug usage br br this film could become a silent classic cop movie and with the above cautionary notes i can recommend it to prospective viewers
<START> imagine every stereotypical overacted cliche from every movie and tv show set on the streets of brooklyn between 1930 and 1980 populate it with a cast of interchangeable caricatures instead of actual characters throw in a mix of period music and wailing electric guitars during the rumble scenes then pass the time trying to figure out or care which of the deuces is going to be killed in the anti climactic final rumble br br i'll give this movie points for not being just another romantic comedy teen slasher explosive action movie teen sex comedy kiddie musical or oscar nomination vehicle but bringing something new or interesting to the street gang tragedy genre might've been nice
