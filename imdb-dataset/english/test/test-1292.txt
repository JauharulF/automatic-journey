<START> michael radford has done an excellent job bringing this difficult play to the screen he has taken a play with a reputation for anti semitism and shown us that shakespeare knew quite well the humanity of the jews radford said after the screening and i agree that shylock is his first tragic hero the first of his characters to be undone by a driving compulsive need for revenge he also points out quite rightly that a man who was anti semitic could not have written speech of if you prick me do i not bleed radford is himself of jewish descent and he has picked out the good and bad of all characters with delicacy and honesty no character is free from flaws no character is evil radford has placed the play in the 16th century which gives a lush background of venetian politics and decadence on which to project shakespeare's words br br if you get a chance to hear radford speak about the film i highly recommend you take it since he gives details about life in 16th century venice that illuminate a lot of the choices he made and give considerable extra depth to the viewing i'm hoping that the dvd will come out with extensive commentary br br jeremy irons does a gorgeous portrayal of antonio a man who himself to bearing the burden of his past misdeeds lynn collins a relative unknown gives us an absolutely flawless stunning and detailed job as not only is ms collins beautiful she also gives layers of intelligence and humor prior to the trial scene i've rarely seen in any production of this play the rest of the cast also does a terrific job with a notable performance by kris marshall as and a beautifully subtle work by allan as playing the foil to shylock finally while al pacino pulls out his usual strong and loud performance his best moments are when the camera focuses on him and he says no words but you can see all the emotions and flowing into and out of him as he perceives his fortunes changing br br if you like period movies i cannot recommend this movie enough
<START> there isn't much that comes close to the perfect paced storytelling and suspenseful action packed levels as goldeneye when it came out it was the greatest game of all time and even today it stays strong br br i will admit that this game did get boring after a few months of playing and by not playing it again until two years later i was thrust back into its greatest almost as if i was playing it for the first time again br br there are 20 action packed levels which is probably the most of any james bond game to date probably the most unforgettable one is the tank level which was likely the most explosive video game sequence at that time and the first person shooting as well as usage of q gadgets is what james bond fans are always dying to use br br frankly as a james bond fan i look for aspects of a true james bond experience which are now showing up in the ps2 games so this game while it has some great action and usable gadgets i was somewhat expecting a little more even back in 1997 i also disliked that this game didn't have q or m or moneypenny or anyone from mi6 while watching the movies bond interacts with these characters at least a few times throughout each movie but they are nowhere to be seen in this game and vocal dialogue would have made the game more lively rather than the text dialogue they wound up using they had the technology they just didn't use it br br probably the most annoying feature of this game is that in some ways it follows the story of the movie precisely and other ways it's incoherent for example there are two many levels where you have to protect or save even though in the movie she can take care of herself there are also some unnecessary levels like the boat level where you have to disarm some bombs which is not in the movie which adds nothing to the storyline whatsoever there are even some levels where you rescue but at the beginning of the next level she's captured again how br br oh well even those little things can't really put this game down and while i do prefer the newer games this bond experience is definitely one you won't forget br br 8 out of 10
<START> this metro film is episodic but nearly a constant series of chases mainly trying to escape police whether real or imagined as buster is mistaken for an escaped criminal it is consistently inventive and entertaining its greatest value is in its documenting what hollywood looked like in the early twenties since 95 of it is shot outside among the streets and building exteriors of the time one gem moment and one gem sequence are present here br br the great moment is when a train at a great distance quickly approaches the camera and finally stops just short of it with buster glumly sitting on the and thus moving from a long shot to a close up within seconds br br the great sequence is with the phone booth next to the elevator one constantly being mistaken for the other with races from floor to floor one of the great keaton gags br br kino's print is sharp and clear almost pristine there is a violin piano score accompaniment this is one to seek out and enjoy
<START> when i saw this movie i think i was a freshman in high school and i still feel like charging master p for the hour 20 mins or so that he took from my life that i'll never get back br br the guy who already posted is completely right master p is a wannabe mobster he like all the other rappers in this country made his millions off of selling rap cds to young impressionable white kids in this country it's widely known that the mob was not a black thing and blacks were not allowed to be part of it unfair as that might be rappers can't deal with this movie paints master p as a mobster named nino the script is terrible with the acting to match completely unbelievable while searching i came up with a link or something that said he was planning on making another movie called the black sopranos br br please spare us that and stick to you are not a white mobster your not even a good actor master p please stick to your music for the sake of whoever listens to it these days
<START> roy scheider is not steve mcqueen or clint eastwood but then who is the seven ups is one of the better cop movies even today and is second only to mcqueen's bullitt and the dirty harry series which isn't bad company there are three things that seem to make a good cop movie believable script with great acting great car chase scenes and some heavy action this movie has all three and the car chase scene is better than that in dirty harry scheider plays the head of a group of cops out to get bad guys sentenced to seven years or more hence the name seven ups overall not quite up to dirty harry or bullitt but far better than all of the cop movies made since the dirty harry series 9 10
<START> having some idle time before going to work i looked at my 50 movie pack comedy classics dvd collection and picked the most obscure title in the pack zis boom bah starring a forgotten grace hayes classics is obviously the operative word here since most of the titles i've never heard of and i suspect they're all in the public domain anyway this movie also stars her son peter lind and his wife mary healy who i just found out is a new orleans native from the state i live in louisiana with benny rubin as a malt shop proprietor and huntz hall taking a break from the east side kids as peter's buddy the plot about a vaudeville mother trying to turn her rich carefree son into a responsible one with him unaware of who she is is for the birds and doesn't have many funny scenes though i did like peter's celebrity impersonations and his dance with hall in drag and the songs and dances are entertaining in themselves rubin however is all over the place with his confusion of the american vernacular of the time and almost everything concerning him makes no sense whatsoever though i did like his funny dance since this was only 61 minutes that i'm sure played on the lower half of the double feature bill i'll be charitable and give this one a 3 for the few entertaining bits that i mentioned enjoying
<START> a cheesy b crime thriller of the early the story is droll the characters wooden allison hayes and lane are the only two that make it an eye catcher but one short shot only a few frames long shows an el train crossing the river on the state street bridge of the 6000 series pullman built cars painted in their original 1950 paint scheme as they were delivered when new in 1950 for traction fans like me that one short take makes the picture worthwhile i think films like this one detour d o a with edmund o'brien the fugitive with harrison ford and others of the film noir genre big city crime dramas make it interesting if for nothing other than the fact that i know chicago and san francisco intimately and recognize most of the street locations other wise it's a really droll boring film
<START> like a circle around the human condition 2001 starts at the beginning skips the middle and proceeds to the ending right back where we started noting the weakness of words compared to image s kubrick wisely dispenses with dialogue preferring the power and essence of the scenery and allowing the intelligence of the audience to do the deciphering or not depending on the audience br br a monolith in cinematic history 2001 is a high water mark of direction execution and achievement if one considers the ambition of the film a film about everything and the measure of success the film achieved to that end a very sound argument for this being the greatest of all films can be made br br
<START> i can admit right away that this is one of the worst movies i have seen in my life and that is not saying a little because i consider myself to be somewhat of an aficionado when it comes to crappy film but this is beyond bad this movie is so awful that there is no fun left in it it's just bad br br reviewing this is almost impossible there are no strong points and nothing positive to say i'll just ramble about a few of the points that sucked first off the cgi has to be one of the worst i've seen i can't believe this movie was made in 2005 the cgi reminds me of something i might have seen in babylon 5 way back when cgi was new and fresh it's poor beyond belief second the actors all seem like they belong in the worst kind of daytime soaps and looking at their resumes i see that i'm correct thirdly being able to breed enormous reptiles is no match to the other technology they invented in this movie the pistol with infinite ammo seriously michael parÃ© fires 100 200 times without reloading in every other scene as if that was not enough there are also shape shifting planes at first they are regular f 16 fighters in the next scene they are something else completely and in the third scene they are f 16 again if you're buying stock footage please don't mix it like this br br honestly there is loads more to say but i think i'll stop you all understand what i'm saying honestly i didn't think this kind of movie was made any more it's like something ed wood would do completely ignorant of quality not caring how anything looks it's almost amazing in all it's awfulness if i could give it 0 10 i would but 1 10 is the lowest grade so that's it
<START> this brings back so many childhood memories i'm not old i'm 19 it's brill the trains the old house the fallen runner the really scary landslide well it is when you're 6 the drama if the children can stop the train or will it crash this is a children's film without a doubt but it offers great harmless no blood guts guns etc for children and it's got bernard cribbins in it who's cool 8 10
<START> this program was quite interesting the way the program was displayed made it all the more interesting string theory is also very interesting to listen too the whole three hours in my opinion were well worth it i enjoyed listening to the ideas given by the physicists extra dimensions really boggle the mind if you have the chance watch this amazing documentary
<START> although there were a few rough spots and some plot lines that weren't exactly true to character this was classic h lots the characters outside of mike giardello giancarlo esposito were true to form and the reunion scenes of pembleton andre braugher and bayliss kyle secor were as deep and well acted as anything ever to grace the small screen br br homicide the movie aka life everlasting is a fan flick but stands on its own as well as any 2 hour episode of the series fontana overmeyer and yoshimura did a wonderful job in pulling loose ends from 7 seasons and every major cast member of the best damn show on television together for the series finale that nbc never bothered to give it true to homicide form there were no happy endings such is life that's what has always set this show apart from the mindless cookie cutter cop shows left on television kudos to the writers and the cast for creating something over the span of the series and in the movie that challenged television viewers and producers alike br br i call myself a homicidal maniac if for no other reason than to keep my co workers in a cooperative mood
<START> well i have to say i had the chance to see this show here in philadelphia pa sometime in june of 06 and i really loved it my all time favorite madonna look was the 1990 blond ambition tour era this to me is madonna now that she is a mother of 3 she has to change some things to suit motherhood and i totally agree this is a classic madonna concert i wish live to tell wasn't edited we saw body's falling from buildings on 911 we can see a woman on a cross any way i'm looking forward to the release of this tour on dvd and hope it is the entire show unedited and with a bunch of bonus footage she is a artist of all time the best out there and still at the top and going strong long live madonna
<START> this one was a surprise and better than most films i've seen recently highly enjoyable from start to finish this is a film that will surely satisfy 99 9 of movie fans worldwide great acting from everyone great script great story and fantastic plot and twists try not to miss it
<START> this is the movie that is somewhat based on the exit of rob from british metal gods and how the band replaced him with ripper owens who used to front a priest tribute band originally titled metal god this movie could have been something great instead someone in an office somewhere who knows little to nothing about metal music decided to water it down from the title change of metal god to the middle of the road 'rock star' to the lame soundtrack this movie plays out badly having spent most of my life in a professional metal band i was really looking forward to seeing this i was very let down by several points of the film the soundtrack is very not metal for one and the ending of the movie is lame as well the movie does have a few bright spots in the writing and acting but as a whole it fails in the end because 1 a movie based on a metal band should have a metal soundtrack 2 there is nothing metal about marky mark or jennifer aniston if bon jovi warrant def and poison are your idea of 'heavy go see this movie if iron maiden judas priest dio black sabbath are your idea of metal see this movie for a good laugh
