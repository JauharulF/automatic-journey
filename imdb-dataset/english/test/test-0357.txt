<START> i have probably watched the movie 4 or 5 times every time i get more and more impressed by how far the wish of a young heart can go and the strenght of both kai and to struggle for what they believe in br br and the whole story is presented in such a way you just get transfered into the plot and before you know it you are there you can see yeah there's kai working hard on the mirror a little jump there's fighting for her love and there's the snow queen br br it's just a wonderful mix of love adventure tension br br it's brilliant 10 out of 10
<START> i'm not going to say too much as this movie isn't worth the effort to put it simply the movie absolutely sucked this is the worst movie i have ever seen the storyline was stupid you couldn't follow what was happening the characters were so annoying especially the main guy i wanted someone to kill that kid and put him and the movie out of it's misery br br very very bad
<START> finally i discovered what i thought i remembered as a four year old after seeing the 1960 color version on vhs i kept saying i remembered seeing it in black and white 2 times before now the imdb has helped me to know the truth that it was broadcast twice 2 productions in black and white in 2 successful years 1955 56 these are the ones i remember best as a four year old i didn't realize the 56 broadcast was not the same as the 55 in 1960 i was 9 and the color production just didn't do it for me the black and white version was wonderful with just as much awe and wonder impact as the high tech films of today even without any computer effects you had to have been there please comment if you had a similar reaction to the b w version
<START> these guys combine low brow with low budget it's glorious br br look if you want bergman rent 7th seal or something if you want to see gross out humor and exploitation sex this is the one br br i think jane jensen as julia makes it all watchable she can actually act really well she's a complete dreamboat and she doesn't seem to feel above it all
<START> watch out this is not a gross out comedy like american pie or you know the comedies of the new millenium this is a sweet satire of dog shows focused on a bunch of completely different characters oh and the commentator is hilarious br br 10 10
<START> i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience br br it is a film that is visually rich but with slow direction poor plot line and 2 dimensional characterisation br br i did however know this when i went in i was willing to trust the two gentleman that i went with comic buffs that the visuals would be out of the ordinary and so they were unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict though this is a comment that could be made of many artists whose work is transferred to screen and who are given charge of direction the pace of the story is lost as the camera lovingly dwells on the pretty pictures br br i would not have gone at all without that reassurance that the style of the film would be worth seeing i have tried with neil gaiman's work but am always left with the emperor's new clothes feeling i live in hope but last night was no exception br br i do not think i can continue with an analysis of gaiman's work without losing the will to live read the rest of the comments and all his faults are eloquently described i cannot comprehend however how he imagined that he had any understanding of the mind of a fifteen year old girl nor that what he had to say added anything to the sum total of human knowledge on growing up and assuming adult responsibility or the changing relationship that a girl might have with her mother these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core
<START> eddie fischer was simply bad possibly the worst scene came early in the movie when he broke into a spontaneous song and dance number centered around a piano and some conveniently placed employees the song was totally stupid i think i could drunkenly offer a few lines on a sheet of paper that would far exceed it and probably win a grammy then as if the writers could come up with no better way to escape the ridiculousness of the scene fischer says something to the effect of don't tell insert the guy's name he doesn't like music and smiles i can't describe how bad this is i felt a little embarrassed and that guy debbie reynolds works with and who's always hitting on her is so annoying too i can't even imagine someone like her wasting a fraction of time on him the jokes were delivered without any sort of chemistry between characters which made the movie crawl by at least the baby had cute hair the two stars are for reynolds who was like a swan among ugly br br see bachelor mother instead
<START> this is one of my favourite films a delightful comedy so i was thrilled to learn it is about to be released on dvd in the uk september 2007 br br played by daniel auteuil is a rich company president of a dairy firm juliette played by the excellent richard is a cleaner of the company's paris offices juliette a black mother of several children discovers a plot against who initially ignores her attempts to warn him slowly he grasps what this charming lady from the parisian underclass has been trying to tell him 'he seeks shelter in her crowded apartment as his marriage and career fall apart an unlikely love blossoms cultures clash in what is a truly delightful light hearted comedy
<START> i am surprised that this well above average 80's comedy scores only a 5 2 from all the imdb voters dan ackroyd does his usual satirical turn as a con who seizes a great opportunity to steal a contract from his prisons physician he retreats to california to start his work giving advice on a radio show pretending to be the infamous dr lawrence the only person that knows he's an imposter is the drunken priest walter matthau who comes along to be pampered by ackroyd's new found wealth having him charles grodin throws in a good supporting performance too for its genre i think this film deserves the same as 'ferris bueller' or 7 5 10
<START> this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen there is not a shred of historical accuracy in fact reality is reversed just one example morgan preyed on the few ethnic chinese he encountered the acting is over the top the script is a poorly written lie i have never seen worse fake beards br br hopper arrived in australia and reportedly only would make the film if the script was totally rewritten so he could be a hero since the script was ten made up on the fly the may explain how bad it is and how disjointed the movie is br br any movie about ned kelly is a lot better than this film
<START> i had the pleasure to view this film when i was 10 years old having an existing interest in egyptology i know that there are subtle mistakes to the art direction and costuming but over all this is the best film to date with the look of the 18th dynasty br br the film only approximates the egyptian in plot a good portion of the text never made it to film as we have to consider the running length br br the music score by b hermann and alfred newman is beautiful performances as follows the late edmond purdom gave an excellent performance as an orphaned child adopted by parents past their child bearing years he states that he keeps to himself has the best education available and face it is a rather emotionally distant person given his upbringing and high intellect br br jean simmons is fine as a humble tavern maid honest loving and sincere bella people complained about her accent well she is a babylonian it is not that apparent in the film as to why is so insanely obsessed with her correct name in the book is enjoying her carnal fruits and gets his revenge early in the plot by leaving drugged body with the house of the dead's workers br br gene tierney as is brilliant when she tells that he is pharoah she looks like she could devour him in his weakness she is intense brilliant and coldly beautiful br br michael wilding is heartbreakingly tragic in his mission to bring all people to know his one god i believe that we are viewing thru the lens of egyptologist a a view at the time that had a pre messiah feeling about vocation did his monotheism influence the jewish people note psalm 104 and other egyption imagery in the psalms br br mr peter ustinov provided the alter ego to he is street wise and cunning a survivor excellent acting as always br br mature never thought much of his acting personally his is fine as an ambitious super patriot who ultimately has murder more than one person in his quest for power book br br i felt that the ending to the egyptian was confusing as personality changes too easily he has a living son toth dies in the novel power is handed to him through is half sister he world savvy now and has a grip on international affairs so he became enlightened he could have modified the priesthood as he was capable br br but no gives everything up everything including his son's future to become a ragged beggar preaching monotheistic love br br this change was too immediate and the major flaw in the script br br again the look of the film colour most of the costumes gold dress was too over the top as she is more richly dressed than the royal family music is beautiful br br i will watch this film again easily br br p s i know that you know that did not directly but i could not resist stating this fact
<START> after having spent a lot of my youth watching such movies i found this one very easy to follow in both the unedited and cut versions although the story has much more to hold it together in the unedited version unlike ninja scroll this movie hit a much more serious note and i think that's where it hit me the animation while grainy is very original and i just love the way artists in that year stressed shadows to show different emotions i think the story is perfect the beginning of the movie really hits hard and as the movie progresses you get the feeling that you're going along in this adventure with the characters as they meet become allies and find out the their greatest strengths a lot of heart was put into this
<START> set in 1962 hong kong in turbulent times as we are informed this extremely intimate story of a failed romance between a two married people tied to their traditions manages to recall the essence of old hollywood in scene after scene of lush colors evocative yet restrained sensuality as opposed of the requisite sexuality and occasional nude scenes which has become part of the norm of a romance in film and the use of facial expressions to suggest subtle changes in mood or communication it's not hard to see the influence of marguerite here since she is known for minimalism in storytelling as well as describing powerful drama using the art of verbal and non verbal conversation between two characters with a strong bond as well as the use of re enacting scenes that could eventually take place in both the characters' lives from hiroshima mon amour to her pen is strongly visible here from the moment we enter the cramped rooms of mr chow tony leung and mrs su li zhen maggie cheung to the last scenes which explain the intensity of regret that he feels as he recalls the opportunity which was lost in reaffirming this relationship br br the plot even resembles something that could have written mr chow and mrs su li zhen neighbors in a tenement apartment while both being fairly successful professionals begin to discover in the most banal of ways that their spouses are cheating on them and they discover quite naturally it's with each other the question is should they act upon what they also feel towards each other or not be like their partners every scene plays with the notion that at any moment they will give in to each other and at one point it is suggested that eventually they do though as intrusive as the camera is in detailing to us their encounters which seem to occur on a daily basis as seen by the frequent changes of cheung's dresses we never see it and just as not seeing either of their spouses heightens their own love story not seeing them carry through with their attraction makes the eventual separation even the more bitter because at every moment we want for something to happen some catalyst and the only one which comes is when leung reveals to her that he loves her followed by his quietly brutal revelation that she will never leave her husband which implies that neither will he it also gives us a glimpse of what culture and timing can do from a western point of view a consummation of their romance into a more solid lasting affair would have been possible especially in the 60s but as it's hong kong cultural values are markedly different br br performances here are of the high order it's very easy to play a torrid love affair but to continually play a repressed platonic relationship that is brimming with desire only barely suggested is hard and makes all the sensuality more cerebral than palpable or visual cheung and leung smolder and their blighted chemistry lingers long after the credits have rolled
<START> now we know where they got the idea of snakes on a plane to put it bluntly do not pay to see this movie if you really want to waste 90 minutes of your life then either catch it on cable or get it as a free pick from netflix or blockbuster do not pay to rent this if you do pay to rent this then you are one stupid individual the acting was awful the plot was awful everything was awful except for the snakes whether they were real or cgi generated they did look pretty good but that being said still this movie has to be one of the worst movies i have ever seen even the nude dancing scene was pretty bad that i actually fast forwarded through that don't sat i did not warn you
<START> this is a documentary about homeless women it was interesting in the sense that this focused on women who are engaged socially having jobs and lasting friendships but are in situations where they can not afford housing br br i found some of the women covered to be interesting but there was little focus or progression in the story the direction and editing failed to maintain my attention there were differences in the stories of these women of course but the message was essentially the same and could have been told by focusing on any one of them in more depth br br i made it to the end of the movie but it was a rather boring journey
