<START> at times when i watch this movie i start to think that the people who made this movie were on drugs what's wrong with this film i'll tell you bad plot bad jokes bad acting and flat out characters everything just bad br br the movie is about pest vargas a two bit scam hustler who is given the chance at 50 000 to survive for 24 hours by a german hunter who kills people for a living so now pest must think of ways to out think this hunter before he gets killed br br i know what your thinking what the hell is this a another wannabe ace ventura trying to get money really this plot is just dull and confusing at times it changes the story plot and you get lost during the film br br as for the funny scenes this film i had a straight face oh yeah i did smile a couple times but nothing laugh out loud besides the jokes are corny and seen before it's like watching ace ventura meets dumb and dumber but bad br br as for character development it's dry and flat you don't learn much about the main character pest all you know is he's a annoying scam hustler but that's it he doesn't change his image or be a little smart just corny as for the german hunter all you is that he's crazy and wants to go back to germany really you start to wonder why is this guy living on an island if has money to go to germany the hunter's son himmel fares better but not much he's really a coward and is snake obsessed for reasons by the end he stands up to his father and sides with pest br br as for the acting no only were there any memorable but just over the top for example john is so over the top with performance and dosen't fit in his role he's out of place as for jeffery jones who plays the hunter same thing but gives a stereotypical performance as well as for the rest either just no used enough or just over the top br br overall bad comedy that you'll find for 2 00 at k mart
<START> it's funny your worst nightmare always seems so far away br br dark characters a married couple alan rickman polly hunter and a vagabond norman reedus are slipping into a game full of hidden sexual energy and treason now and then tantalizing breaks increase the tensions and give much space for interpretations good acting and a story which if not using the brain will leave you in confusion you have to watch it twice at least the very strength lies in its unconventionality and in alan rickman of course those who love him will love this movie br br conclusion it is not a typical prime time movie but well done
<START> dan ackroyd in his prime stars as burns a mental asylum escapee who poses as his own shrink to travel out to la la land and host a popular radio talk show while the regular host charle grodin in his snarling prime takes a vacation along the way ackroyd hooks up with walter matthau a fellow nutjob and the rest is sheer hilarity ackroyd and matthau play off very well off one another ackroyd's stunning real life wife donna dixon is along for the ride as yet another shrink the ending feels a bit rushed and contrived which is the only thing that keeps me from giving this film my top rating an 8 a lost '80s gem
<START> i thought this was a really well written film i've heard of radio the person before this movie was even created and i can't begin to describe how good cuba gooding jr was in it it will make the women cry everyone laugh and most everyone will leave smiling
<START> sometimes a movie cannot easily be classified such a film is tank girl part cartoon part comedy and part action flick i'm sure somewhere there is an audience for tank girl' but it is extremely small perhaps punk comic book readers most viewers will be looking for an early exit or living with the fast forward button the only redeeming quality are short bursts of humor find me a microscope and a pair of tweezers but these tiny moments of comic relief are far outweighed by the sophomoric action sequences there is no character development which is not surprising since the source is a comic book do yourself a favor and avoid avoid avoid merk
<START> leonard maltin gave this film a dreaded bomb rating in his 1995 movie and video guide what film was he looking at kid vengeance or god's gun are bombs this film is a delight it is fantastic it is literate it is well mounted it is beautiful photographed making a brilliant use of colors right from the opening scene the film grabs your attention and tips you off that this film is a well done satire of the whole spaghetti western genre the film is played for laughs from the beginning to the end with homages to douglas fairbanks 77 sunset strip and the famous showdown in the good the bad and the ugly edd byrnes george hilton and gilbert roland work brilliantly together to make the satire work it is too bad mr maltin rated this film so poorly as it is undeserved one can only guess as to his reason i suspect that he missed the point of the movie entirely and was expecting something more serious than this film is meant to be kudos belong to everyone involved in this project this film is a little gem waiting to be discovered by people who care about literate movies and appreciate satire
<START> what a waste of great acting talent this is a shame because with catherine deneuve mathieu amalric emmanuelle devos chiara mastroianni and melvil not to mention others less well known in america that's a lot of acting talent to waste this film by arnaud was a terrible disappointment after having enjoyed his kings and queens and this film left me completely bored and frustrated to the point where i actually left before the movie ended the movie wandered around its central storyline involving catherine deneuve's illness getting sidetracked by every peripheral storyline and supporting character that appeared on screen the movie also gave us too little character development to understand why the different characters disliked each other so much this was a story of family dysfunction so that the dearth of coherent narrative became even more critical finally the soundtrack which ranged from hip hop to bach to midsummer night's dream was at odds with the emotional temperature of the movie and further obscured any emotion the viewer should have been feeling at the time the photography the director often began scenes with a mainly dark screen where our only sight is through a small opening making feel as if we are watching through a peephole that then expands was also pretentious and inscrutable
<START> out of stars br br let's see 14 divided by 20 times the square root of 13 equals 23 which was my departed grandmother's favorite number and the year she was born 23 minutes past the 23rd hour assign the number any way you choose and ooh be very scared be extremely scared when you throw in a brain dead looking mutt to go with 23 and you have schumacher's latest attempt at a dark suspense fest with the number 23 oh yeah 23 is also my record in cuervo shots at my favorite dive on 23rd street in the 23rd state in the union br br carrey carries the film to about it's halfway point then we lose sight of him not caring much don't look for any crazy expressions to come from the comedian carrey as you have seen in the mask and me myself and irene no and don't expect an embodiment of a character as he did with andy kaufman this role is a sad and peculiar for jimbo where's the riddler when you need him i know we don't need him virginia madsen like usual is underused as the supportive speculative and peculiar wife her talent like carrey's is suppressed and it's almost painful to watch her try to rescue her underdeveloped character from near anonymity br br to give credit where credit is due there are a couple of interesting scenes in the number 23 that showcase some very crafty cinematography they are arresting enough on their own without having to be convoluted within the incoherent narrative of this silly story br br i don't know about you and i realize this is a work of absolute fiction but i don't know of anyone who often reads his novel in a dank dark basement or spends his time at graveyards on a regular basis like carrey does in this movie schumacher keeps his film dark and blood red and gloomy and rainy and smoggy and gloomy and rainy and dank and on and on and on from beginning to end even and the lost boys had a little more daylight in them and we're talking about medical students obsessed with death and teenage vampires br br if you feel like watching this film even if it's out of mere curiosity make sure you do it while enjoying about 23 that way you can kill 23 birds with one stone
<START> the movie was surprisingly wonderful especially considering the last sequel the third was dark and semi interesting but it wasn't nearly as fun or enjoyable as this it is filled with comedic lines about martha stuart doll's anatomy masturbation and it was actually done effectively during gruesome and disturbing images the movie wasn't scary or suspenseful and i'm sure that it wasn't the director's intention it was fun because of the silliness jennifer tilly's over the top and sexy performance the puppetry of the dolls were so well handled the movement of mouth lips tears in eyes knife in chest and the costumes the dolls were just marvelous and it made the gruesome deaths more considering the fact that they were done by wonderful dolls the new chucky look was great and tiffany was very cute a few scenes with chucky hugging the human tiffany even made my father smile jesse and jade were surprisingly well very attractive and the special effects were cool the ending was so unsuspected and the fact that they could make another as good is quite unlikely it may not be as suspenseful as movies like halloween or urban legend but it is certainly more fun
<START> it's really too bad that nobody knows about this movie i think if it were just spruced up a little and if it weren't so low budget i think one of the major film companies might have wanted to take it i first saw this movie when i was 11 and i thought it was so powerful with the many great yet illegal lengths that mitchell goes to just to keep his family together it inspired me then and it amazes me now if you're lucky enough to find a copy of this movie don't miss it
<START> how could they take such a beautifully animated gem like don bluth's all dogs go to heaven and it with a charmless cheesy uninspired sequel the haunting music and delightful characters are gone now replaced with tacky animation and an unimaginative plot br br the pros charlie sheen is sometimes fun as charlie but he lacks the charming tough guy attitude that brought him to life by burt reynolds i did particularly enjoy the songs i will always be with you and it's too heavenly here br br the cons there seems to be no connection between this and the original in the beginning charlie is chums with carface but wait a minute isn't this the same character who was responsible for charlie's murder and kidnapped the sweet little orphan he loved i guess that all changes in heaven but why isn't anne marie even mentioned if itchy makes it to heaven wouldn't flo and killer make it too what is with annabelle the voice in the original it sounded feminine and charming and in the sequel it sounds like a whiny bitchy parrot the new characters aren't all that great except sasha and the animation is better compared to a generic saturday morning cartoon the constant cartoony humor is flat and unfunny and the heart just doesn't work when compare to the original which had such a moving unsubtle touch that makes me cry every time br br all dogs go to heaven is one of my all time favorite films how don bluth allowed this sequel to be made is beyond me br br bottom line not all sequels go to heaven
<START> jolene heather graham operates a night club in nyc and lives with her husband carl luke wilson a photographer after about 500 days of marriage jolene comes home to find a note from carl that he needs some space and a bouquet of daisies her favorite flower jo promptly puts the daisies in the blender and presses the button soon after she embarks on a journey to find carl somewhere out west because after all she is committed to carl however when she finally tracks him down in texas jo camps out near his home at first hoping to find clues to his decision to leave she meets a gorgeous sculptor neighbor goran can't spell his name but jo discourages his attraction to her when she learns carl may have a new girlfriend she decides to consult a mexican american mystic alfonso for advice jo is committed but does that mean anything to carl this is a very imaginative quite humorous look at the marriage vow it's quirky script and offbeat style is downright infectious graham is just great as the jilted woman who is having a hard time letting go wilson does not give his best performance but is adequate as the mixed up husband the rest of the cast is quite nice however with goran the gorgeous one wonderful as the sexy neighbor the scenery both in new york and in texas is very lovely and the costumes are fresh and fun if you like romantic comedies and independent films this one is made to order for you it walks to a different beat that is most attractive but still delivers in the ultimate happy ending category
