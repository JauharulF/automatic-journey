<START> i cannot believe that this is a film that i did not like i usually find that i am open minded about all sorts of stuff but this flick is just well bad br br i could deal with the subject matter if the script and story were better i could deal with the acting if the camera work was better or if the characters were better established i think it mostly boils down to script and direction though br br it was just bad br br i want to give this the lowest rating but i don't believe in that at least this guy got off his tail to make a movie so he gets four stars just above the average rating which this has so far
<START> in this early fulci work the director shows his most mainstream side as well as a talent for compelling storytelling and more than reasonable elucidation for the genre personally i think he has been unfairly maligned throughout his career as an aesthete of gore it's a pretty capable procedural and surprised me with its rich narrative that shows his distrust for small minded small town mentality and the of the police as well as the twisted ideals of the catholic church the last of which seemed to have cut this film at its knees when it was first released and could have possibly given the director another direction so early on the comparative lack of gore in the film shows a more urgent and psychological imperative to this film in its prevailing mystery but the gore and puppetry he does utilise is put to good use here most notably in the scene where a falsely accused murderer is senselessly lynched by a mob of men in a graveyard and left for dead in a show of vile and antiquated vigilantism expertly choreographed to the modern tunes off a diegetic radio br br another example was the final scene which was indeed awesome in which a strikingly handsome priest falls from a cliff and the puppet used is markedly showed in a medium closeup which accentuated its demonic appearance and evident ugliness curiously considering his later works fulci also invokes the idea of modernity seized upon the hamlet holding on to its anachronistic superstitions and ignorance when the idea of black magic is just that a quaint idea of supernatural evil that never really ends up manifesting from the voodoo dolls while making its witch nothing more than a disturbed woman another thing i liked was that he adds to these character layers by making a bourgeois city girl into an ambiguous figure is she the corrupter the priest fears for his wards and perhaps more tellingly for himself this giallo does lend itself to becoming one of fulci's more personal and substantive films in that we actually get a fair influx of ideas from him
<START> the pickle was the most underrated film of the decade despite my best efforts at home it is still seen as a bad movie i say to hell with everyone on this every one doesn't understand that it is in part a comedy with a dramatic twist at the end danny aiello plays a burnt out director with perfection and conveys a sad depressed man the scene when he is trying to record a last message is quite good the interludes of stones movie are absolutely funny this is harry stone and today i become a man in all a fine and sadly misunderstood movie plus a great cameo by little richard hilarious i hope that more people see this movie because people is not enough for a consensus br br silence
<START> this must be one of the most horribly titled films of all time the kind of title that ruins a film because it neither evokes the plot nor the characters a title like this makes a film flop even the french title is not much better too bad truffaut deneuve must have been enough to sell it br br this is a long film but largely worth it clearly influenced by hitchcock we have an intercontinental story about a personal ad bride her rich husband a theft an identity switch and obsessive love the plot here is actually very good and takes us on an unexpected trip br br the thing that works both for and against the movie is the focus on the relationship it is an interesting study in how these plot developments are played out in real life relationship with these two people unfortunately this is what bogs the film down and makes it ultimately dissatisfying we do like films to have a real sense of finality and that is missing here br br it was the case in many of her films that deneuve became a canvas for directors to play their fantasies out on and this time it doesn't work as well messy here is the fact that the director clearly just wanted to have deneuve take her top off a few times deneuve is an actress who always seems very deliberate and thoughtful so these attempts to make her seem spontaneous fall flat br br basically the script needed to be worked out better before shooting began to make this film tighter and shorter and to snap but truffaut didn't snap did he so it wanders a bit but remains interesting
<START> ok i know the original ghoulies aren't in this entry it even seems it doesn't belong in this series but it still a good movie it is hilarious i thought especially with the pepper spray or mace i give it a 9
<START> if you have few expectations then this will entertain for 90 minutes my problem is that they've dumbed down this tale for the modern audience are already sexy exciting characters they don t need the techno soundtrack and snappy dialogue
<START> it's a pity to throw away such a good idea the main idea of the movie is travel into past lives which fortunately is not a time travel but a journey inside man which has nothing to do with the past or the future maybe they shouldn't be called past lives at all in the film now that i think of it another minus i guess it's all in the present in a different space very interesting without causing much religious distress br br however the music is totally repetitive melodramatic sentimental and out of place not to mention western there should have been more variety and more thought on where there should be music and where there shouldn't the flashback romantic scenes take a lot of space and running time and are totally unnecessary the acting is not bad although the language has kept me from understanding better br br i believe the idea needed a little more thought developing and the inside scenes could have had better background settings because in many cases they seem unreal as a whole i would say that this movie leaves a lot to be desired
<START> twin peaks and blue velvet have always been two of my favourite pieces of film making and even though past films by lynch have been slightly disappointing for me they have always been worth watching a number of times to be pretentious lynch can be like a good wine he must be savoured and over but in the end you must make up your own mind about what you have seen for lynch never gives you the full answers br br many people will walk out of mulholland drive possibly wanting to throttle themselves over the mind bending visual jigsaw puzzle that has just unfolded before them but there is a twisted logic to this film you just have to look for the clues betty naomi watts arrives in hollywood doe eyed and in search of stardom she then finds an amnesiac in her bathroom who has escaped from an attempted murder on mulholland drive together they try to uncover the secrets behind the life this all leads to a club called where a blue box will reveal all and that is when the film throws everything out the window people we thought we knew are entirely different people altogether is it a dream a reminiscence about life's previous escapades you will either love this film or hate it david lynch always draws such extreme reactions from his viewers but as his universe itself is always about extremes it is fitting that his films provoke such reactions br br it is best to look at this film thematically rather than as a straight forward narrative and appreciate the fact that lynch is a film maker who will still let you draw your own conclusions he has had many imitators as of late particularly in vanilla sky where a mind bending film decides to give you all the answers in the last rushed five minutes and you will probably forget about that film as soon as you walk out of the cinema mulholland drive will haunt you
<START> 25 august 2003 league of extraordinary gentlemen br br sean connery is one of the all time greats and i have been a fan of his since the 1950's i went to this movie because sean connery was the main actor i had not read reviews or had any prior knowledge of the movie the movie surprised me quite a bit the scenery and sights were spectacular but the plot was unreal to the point of being ridiculous in my mind this was not one of his better movies it could be the worst why he chose to be in this movie is a mystery for me going to this movie was a waste of my time i will continue to go to his movies and add his movies to my video collection but i can't see wasting money to put this movie in my collection
<START> mild spoilers br br and that's 'top ten of all time ' i stumbled across 'two by accident maybe that made it all the more special no inflated expectations on ifc one night and couldn't believe that i hadn't heard anything about it now that heath ledger is getting more famous in the usa i'm sure it's more available at the time i was telling friends about the film and no one could find it anywhere except the occasional ifc showing br br anyway in the black comedy gangster genre it fits in well with my other favorites and everybody in the film really seems to end up with what they deserve bryan brown is hilarious as the main gangster who makes origami with his small son and plays scrabble with his henchmen also hilarious is the quick edit fate of a random car thief even heath was pretty good in it at the time i vaguely remembered him from a short lived series on fox called ' hopefully gregor jordan will make another hit but as far as i'm concerned this is his best yet
<START> i have just given a 10 for thieves highway i mention this for two reasons one to prove i'm not a git who only gives bad reviews but 2 because the theme of the film has the same thread namely the falling in love with a woman of the night br br we all know pretty woman is a chick flick but you can't avoid them all they'll eventually get you pretty woman for me does two things two terrible horrible ghastly things firstly it portrays prostitution as a career more akin to that of a dancer you know with absolutely great friends leg warmers lots of giggling borrowing each others make up you see in the reality of pretty woman the prostitute and this is a street walker prostitute we're talking about here has a great life she's healthy happy with only the occasional whimper to explain her predicament my feeling is this 'happy type protagonist is a lot more palatable than an even nearly realistic character which for me begs the question if you make a movie about a type of person but are too chicken scared to adorn that player with the characteristics familiar to that role then why do it if i make a film about a chef but don't want him to cook or talk about food or wear a white hat then why make a film about a chef in the first place by out and turning the hooker into a respectable dancer type the story misses the point completely and consequently never indulges in any of the moral or social questions that it could have what a cop out really really lame br br secondly 'pretty woman' insults romance itself edward lewis played by richard gere has no clue how to seduce or romance this that is without his plastic friend yep don't leave home without it especially if you are a moron in a suit who has no imagination 8 out of 10 of his romantic moments involve splashing cash in one way or another even when he first meets her it's the lotus turbo that does all the work necklaces here diamonds there limos over there money money money where's the charm where's the charisma don't mention that attempt at the piano please br br girls who like this film will also be girls who like shopping more than most guys who like this film will not even have realized that old eddy has less charm than a calculator as they probably don't either so it wont have registered more importantly anyone who likes this film will hate highway' a wonderful story of which part is based on the same subject br br i'll finish on a song br br pretty woman round the street pretty woman the kind i like to treat pretty woman i don't believe you you're not the truth no one could spend as much as you mercy br br pretty woman wont you pardon me pretty woman i couldn't help but see pretty woman and you look lovely as can be do you lack imagination just like me br br pretty woman shop a while pretty woman talk a while pretty woman sell your smile to me pretty woman yeah yeah yeah pretty woman look my way pretty woman say you'll stay with me and i'll pay you i'll treat you right
<START> i wish i could have voted this movie a ten it's that funny if they had intended for it to be that funny i would have given it a ten i have to give it a 1 but it's the funniest darn 1 you'll ever want to watch see the giant blur flash across the screen where did it come from what is it it flies it terrifies it's electrifying it's on strings this bird has real personality i was about ten when i saw it for the first time and when big bird appeared on sesame street i was sure they were one and the same
<START> death bed the bed that eats br br judging from the title you can guess what this movie is about and yet there is a lot more background story to this film then one might suspect br br okay so the main plot is about a bed eating people and food but there are also a few subplots i won't spoil them for you but they're a nice touch br br sadly the acting in this movie is very mediocre the fact that most dialog is not even spoken by the actors doesn't really help to improve the quality of the movie as a whole br br because there is a lot of voice over work the thoughts of characters are also revealed to the watchers sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't br br the effects are fine sure it could be a lot better if you compare it with today's movies but you really shouldn't just judge the movie as it is and don't take it too seriously you have to admit that a killer bed is quite creative if you are easily spooked don't watch this movie you might never want to sleep again br br death bed the bed that eats is a strange horror gem with a low budget but i'd still recommend it to fans of horror movies br br in conclusion i give this movie a 7 out of 10 stars for it's creative story and unexpected twists here and there
<START> i happened to catch this supposed horror flick late one friday night i wish i'd gone to bed tell me is a 3 ft tall raincoat clad twerp on a bike supposed to convey some sort of fear not here yet mi low is still able to beat the crap out of the janitor antonio fargas who is three times his size uh huh and the ending is so pitiful it just leaves you hanging with nothing to go on what so ever i found myself asking is that it br br acting is about as good as it'll get in a low budget film the aforementioned fargas delivers a decent performance but it is my conclusion that jennifer maybe one of the worse actresses to ever strut into tinsel town sure cute face but bad acting br br rating 1
<START> there is only one racist joke in this daffy duck short which is basically when daffy rides black beauty it is a black woman i can understand partly why this joke was included as at the time few people did not know how rude it was to be racist and it wasn't even illegal to discriminate black people yet br br aside from this point a coy decoy is basically a fun interesting short where daffy meets characters in books and does things in books i liked this short quite a lot despite the other reviewers on here the way daffy is so in love with the clockwork duck is vaguely disturbing yet highly amusing at the same time porky is a nice edition to the episode though it was not vital for him to be there the wolf is an example of how people thought of wolves in those days as well blood thirsty terrible animals which of course they never really have been unless they are very hungry i also liked the style of animation used and the theme of the episode br br for people who are totally into daffy duck and for people who do not mind the occasional racist joke in cartoons enjoy a coy decoy br br available on youtube
