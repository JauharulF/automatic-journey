<START> let's face it you know what to expect when you tune into a post 1990 corey feldman film there are probably boobs guns and cars saying that there is more to this movie than just naked ladies i'm sorry to say cos it's mainly people getting themselves killed in a variety of unusual and as the name suggests often ways i love crappy horror and i love this film if you don't you probably wont but i think it's worth most people giving it a go it's not so crappy that it'll ruin your weekend or anything all in all if its mindless good fun a bit of corpse loving and an 80's childhood superstar your in the mood for then you've come to the right place its a cracker
<START> admittedly alex has become a little but they are still for me the greatest rock trio ever i wholeheartedly recommend this dvd to any fan br br i was very disappointed that they canceled their planned recent munich gig logistics and regret not making an effort to see them elsewhere the dvd is a small consolation the greatest incentive to acquire a proper dvd playback setup br br naive perhaps but i still don't understand the significance of the tumble on stage i would be grateful for any clarification br br cheers
<START> br br this movie is sÃ³ incredibly unfunny it makes any man want to cry the clichÃ© are put on thicker than 5 year old peanut butter and in such a way that it actually sucks humour out of your heart every single joke was badly timed and wouldn't have been funny if it were timed correctly br br don't see this movie there's a real chance you'll never be able to enjoy going to comedies again ever
<START> i was in blockbuster and i saw a film called dark harvest the cover art looked great the plot wasn't that bad and the tagline you reap what you sow made the movie look pretty good but i was dumb that day because i did something i should have never done i rented a straight to video independent horror film walking out with my much better rentals i went home popped dark harvest in the dvd player and it began i figured i would watch the trailer after the film was done bad idea but went ahead and watched it anyway now to the review possible spoilers first off the acting by the kids sucks and the scene when the 2 main characters are talking the lighting sucks and the buildings even look fake now they go to this house where sean i think he's the main character i don't care relatives lived there all of a sudden one by one they all start getting killed by gasp a killer scarecrow ahhh the scarecrow is obviously the definition of low budget and the scenes where the scarecrow is computerized looks so fake it's hilarious it makes dinosaur noises and everything and then at the end they shoot the scarecrow with a gun that is red for god's sake and looks like it was purchased at a local family dollar and it pauses for a while and then gasp blows up br br save yourself some time i'm telling you this movie sucks if you need to pass an hour and a half look at the wall because looking at the wall is a fun compared to this disaster it is quite funny though br br overall grade f if there was anything lower f than i would give it that
<START> well i am the target market i loved it furthermore my husband also a boomer with strong memories of the '60s liked it a lot too i haven't read the book so i went into it neutral i was very pleasantly surprised it's now on our highly recommended video list br br
<START> if you've seen the trailer for this movie you pretty much know what to expect because what you see here is what you get and even if you haven't seen the previews it won't take you long to pick up on what you're in for specifically a good time and plenty of laughs from this clever satire of reality tv' shows and buddy cop' movies showtime ' directed by tom dey starring robert de niro and eddie murphy br br mitch preston de niro is a detective with the l a p d and he's good at what he does but working a case one night things suddenly go south when another cop trey sellars murphy inadvertently intervenes a television news crew shows up and mitch loses his cool which results in a lawsuit by the television station that's going to cost the department some big bucks except that they may be able to get around it thanks to chase rene russo who works for the station and likes what she sees in mitch enough to pitch an idea to her boss for a reality' cop show that would feature none other than mitch preston whom chase sees as a real life dirty harry ' br br her boss likes the idea and gives chase the green light now all she has to do is convince mitch to participate which shouldn't be too hard since the station has agreed to drop the lawsuit if he will do the show but mitch is a cop not an actor and he wants nothing to do with any of it that is until he has a heart to heart with his boss captain frankie faison who puts mitch's future into succinct perspective for him and just like that the show is on oh yes there's one more thing for the show mitch is going to need a partner and who do you suppose they're going to come up with for that let's put it this way trey sellars is more than one of the usual suspects br br this is dey's second film as a director his first being shanghai noon ' also a comedy and he's definitely showing a penchant for the genre from the opening frames he establishes a pace that keeps the story moving right along and he allows his stars to make the most of their respective talents and personal strengths including their impeccable timing with stars like de niro and murphy dey of course had a leg up on this project to begin with but he's the one who keeps it on track demonstrating that he knows what works achieving just the right blend of physical comedy and action and employing the subtleties of the dialogue to great effect br br there isn't a more natural actor in the business than de niro and he steps into mitch's skin like he was born to it and after years of doing hard edge cutting drama in which he turned in one remarkable performance after another with such films as analyze this ' meet the parents' and now this one he has firmly established his proficiency for doing comedy as well mitch is not an especially complex character he is in fact something of an guy but therein lies the challenge for the actor to make him believable to make him seem like the guy who could be your neighbor and just another member of the community and on all counts de niro succeeds he's mitch the guy you run into at the grocery store or the bank or say good morning' to on your way to work who likes to watch the game on tv and has a life just like you and me who happens to make his living by being a cop it's the character mitch has to be to make this film work because it makes the ordinary guy in extraordinary angle credible it's one of those role and work that is often wrongly dismissed out of hand because it looks so easy and of course this is what makes de niro so exceptional he does make it look easy and he does it with facility br br as trey sellars eddie murphy turns in a winning performance as well and it's a role that fits him like the proverbial glove trey is a cop but also an aspiring actor and a bad one and it gives murphy the opportunity to play on the over exuberant side of his personality reigned in enough by dey however to keep him from soaring over the top into jim carrey territory which works perfectly for this character and this film from his melodramatic take on a part during an audition to his throwing out of one liners delivered by looking directly into the camera which as far as he's concerned isn't even there while filming the reality' show murphy's a riot and he has a chemistry with de niro that really clicks which is not unexpected as this is another of de niro's many talents his ability to connect with and bring out the best in his co stars all of whom evidence will support are better at their craft after having worked with him including the likes of meryl streep christopher walken and ed harris just to name a few most importantly this is a part that allows murphy to excel at what he does best and he certainly makes the most of it br br russo makes the most of her role as chase too a character who isn't much of a stretch artistically but whom she presents delightfully with a strong believable performance and william shatner playing himself absolutely steals a couple of scenes as the director of the show br br the supporting cast includes de niro annie pedro damian vargas and james camera man well crafted and delivered is a comedy that's exactly what it is meant to be pure entertainment that provides plenty of laughs and a pleasant couple of hours that will have you chuckling for some time after it's the magic of the movies 8 10 br br br br br br
<START> this movie could be likened to comfort food for the soul anyone who has ever tried and tried to save a relationship could relate to this movie so many parts of it are so hilarious and so many parts are so heartbreakingly true it's not perfect in its production or even its dialog but the story is unique which is saying a lot for modern romantic comedies luke wilson is bland at best but heather graham does an exceptional job in my opinion give it a try despite the trite looking dvd cover the character of brings a lot of issues up in our culture of self service she asks us if commitment is really for the other person or ourselves truly it is ourselves following through on promises anywhere from marriage to an errand for a friend is a great feeling anymore our word is nothing but a shapeshifting puff of smoke is like a wake up call we must be conscious of our words and commitments they mean more than we think at the same time we must not commit to someone who is incapable of doing the same
<START> alright so maybe the impersonations of jay leno and david letterman are not spot on but you still get a sense of who these people are and how they operate behind the screen bob balaban and treat williams are as warren littlefield and micheal br br the movie doesn't go for joke and punchline but it is still funny kathy bates in particular is amazing as leno's manager br br funny amazing interesting very watchable this is a good tv movie
<START> in everything is illuminated elijah wood plays jonathan foer a jewish american who is looking for the woman who saved his grandfather during wwii in a sense the woman that saved his entire family br br this is a heart felt tale about someone who is on a seemingly hopeless journey a stranger in a strange land so to speak jonathan is not entirely prepared for this adventure he sticks out like a sore thumb in the ukraine he would probably stick out like a sore thumb anywhere but what he discovers is more much more than he anticipated this movie will make you laugh and will make you cry elijah wood is really good in this film based on the novel by jonathan safran foer br br from someone i talked to this movie is somewhat different from the book a book i gather is really good nevertheless this is a good movie it has something for everyone and i really enjoyed it can someone say oscar
<START> what can i say an excellent end to an excellent series it never quite got the exposure it deserved in asia but by far the best cop show with the best writing and the best cast on televison ever the end of a great era sorry to see you go
<START> this movie is widely as being a copy of the will smith feature hitch that movie was dull br br this movie isn't so much dull as unbearable govinda looks way past his prime he is not at his best doing roles like this it is similarly unconvincing as his performance in deewana mastana br br salman khan is at his eye aching best and that's in the few scenes where he remembers to put clothes on it could only have been through nepotism that this eye scenes could be saved from the trash bin of any movie's cutting floor br br another case of bollywood embarrassing itself with it's shameless cloning another case of the bollywood audience majority embarrassing themselves by making this a hit
<START> plot in a nutshell duchess voice of eva gabor is the well polished single mother cat of three little kittens when their owner the wealthy elderly woman known as madame adelaide realizes that her time is running out she decides to write up her will leaving everything she has to her cats which will then go to her butler edgar when the cats pass on edgar overhears this and is deeply offended by the idea that the cats would get everything before him and plots to destroy duchess and her kittens he drops sleeping pills in their supper one night and then leaves them stranded in the french countryside out of their element duchess and her kittens befriend a street smart stray cat known as thomas voice of phil harris who did the voice of the big bear in the jungle book after making a pass at duchess unaware that she is a single mother decides to escort them back home with duchess genuinely falling for as the usual codependent surrogate family bond develops chaos and mayhem ensues culminating in a violent clash between his brother cats from the streets and edgar also features appearances by british geese american southern hound dogs what they were doing in france is anyone's guess a mouse who sounds a lot like the rabbit from alice in wonderland he was in fact voiced by the same guy who voiced winnie the pooh and a horse br br sometimes slow paced but still enjoyable disney venture features the memorable everybody wants to be a cat musical piece sung by the late scatman crothers better known to 1980s fans as the voice of jazz on transformers of course if this was being made now it would probably be a dark social commentary on class division represented by the divide between well bred well fed duchess and the street born
<START> this is without a doubt one of my favorite columbo episodes ever the acting is very well done the music is very catchy the script is ingenious and the direction is fabulous br br peter falk who acts brilliantly in every columbo episodes acts particularly well in this episode br br also great performances from stephen gary alan fudge and robert culp br br the ending is absolutely brilliant and i love the way columbo describes it br br this is a columbo movie that won't go amiss
<START> don't waste your time and money on it it's not quite as bad as adrenalin by the same director but that's not saying much
<START> terry benedict andy garcia catches up with danny ocean and his team and demands that they repay the money that they stole from him in oceans 11 plus interest he holds back from violent action however as he is under the instruction of the world's greatest thief the night fox the team then have to pull off a series of heists to pay benedict back whilst testing their abilities against the night fox who wishes to maintain his position as the greatest thief ever put simply this film is a complete mess the masses may argue that it is cool and that clooney and pitt put in great performances but these are the same people who have a subscription to hello magazine and think that david beckham has the potential to be a great actor the story is convoluted it is not complex or clever and it does not have intelligent twists and turns it is just a complete mess that spills out in multiple directions with the hope that the audience will think it is cool and intelligent hello magazine readers any respectable movie watcher will however see the film for the farce that it is whilst oceans 11 wasn't a great film it had a decent pace was stylish and had some decent twists and turns this movie loses its way very quickly and then basically gives up it is as if the director and cast said to themselves hey this isn't really working out lets just have a laugh indeed the cast looks like they are enjoying themselves but i was not i will not delve into the plot as its confused evolution does not warrant any examination the addition of catherine zeta jones is largely annoying the scenes where julia roberts impersonates herself with bruce willis undertaking a cameo role whilst mildly amusing appear to be a desperate move to keep the audience interested the movie is so full of plot holes that it as if arnie has emptied an uzi 9mm into the film studio credit can only be given to some scenes where the night fox uses to undertake a heist against the back drop of some funky music but this is hardly justification to watch the movie the final scene features the team in a nonsensical drunken stupor this accurately sums up the movie stick with the original
