<START> ever notice how so many really bad films attract so many 10 10 votes not much of a riddle how that happens but this is not much of a film there are two ways of looking at it being given away in the mail on sunday br br 1 it's free so you can't complain about it to much 2 it's free so it can't be much good br br my vote is number 2 the free dvd in the sunday papers things is a recent trend and some great old movies have been given away they're ones that have been out for ages and have made most of the money they'll ever make so it's a case of anything else is a bonus it's the last stop for old films not the first for new ones so you can guess how bad this must be to skip tv and dvd rental br br the plus points are that vinnie jones does try hard and derek jacobi is good as dickens the minus points are a longer list trying isn't the same as succeeding for poor vinnie and jacobi's other tramp character is talkative ham that's gone off the story is very weak the dickens story does not have anything to do with the film's murders and feels like another movie slapped onto the script to make people think it's a british dan brown without the religion the supporting cast are either there for the money vanessa redgrave must be really hard up or because they are friends or girlfriends of the filmmakers it is also very very long for what it is br br vinnie taking his priceless dickens story with him in his jacket pocket everywhere is good for a couple of laughs but that's it not funny and very not good even for free
<START> i have seen tons of trash in every language about every topic and of every trend of film making from every period every director and any kind of budget available that said i really have to declare br br this is one of the three worst movies i have ever seen br br it's painfully bad it's pompous it's grim it's incomprehensible it's annoying it's a really bad mess it is a piece of you know what br br and what's more important it lacks a point and even if it had one the characters are so unreal and annoying that it's impossible to overlook the lack of cohesion of the whole thing br br it's just weird for the sake of being weird br br i actually felt sick watching this trash the theater where i saw it lincoln center in new york was full when it started by the end of it half of the audience had walked out there was a q a programmed at the end but nobody stayed with the exception of about two sickos everybody else ran for the door myself included br br save 2 hours of your life it's probably one of the worst ever done br br if there is a movie theater in hell this movie will be playing 24 7 for eternity
<START> he is very good in this role as a disaffected and bored husband a decorated air force officer who becomes bored with his predictable suburban life and decides to make a radical change br br one evening he meets karen an attractive woman younger than his current wife a relationship develops and cole decides to take it to the next level br br not only does he have an affair he fakes his death to escape his family obligations lies become increasingly more of a pattern as he begins to rob banks to keep his new wife happy and to project the image that he is a success a fictional delusion apparently br br this was also based on a true story which makes it all the more intriguing cole is believable and excellent in these roles recommended 8 10
<START> this movie is supposed to take place in milford nj i know the house that it is based on as well as the person as you see at the end of she was killed in the world trade center incident i know that because i was one of the police officers that helped with the identification of her remains she was the only one in our area lost the nudity in the movie went a bit far i am not a prude but the actors could have filmed the scene with the two woman without actually showing the whole thing this movie is in poor taste and i cannot see how her family would give there blessing to it this is an insult to the person whom it is based on
<START> rita hayworth is right there where she should be as a cover girl in this 1944 technicolor film also starring gene kelly phil silvers eve arden lee bowman and otto kruger rita plays a beautiful showgirl rusty working at a small club owned by the man she loves danny kelly each friday they go out for oysters with genius silvers the club comedian they all hate oysters but they're looking for a pearl when they find one all three of them will have good luck they believe br br rusty auditions and wins the role of cover girl for a magazine she starts off ahead of the other contestants because the magazine owner kruger sees a resemblance between rusty and the girl he once loved who turns out to be grandmother once she becomes the cover girl the world opens up for her and her dreams of appearing on broadway come true danny wants her to have her success but at the same time realizes he's lost her br br cover girl has exuberant dance numbers and songs by jerome kern with rita dubbed by martha mears rita is at her best playing both rusty in the present and her grandmother in the past for such a sexy desirable gorgeous woman she was apparently very insecure and always under the thumb of domineering men none of this ever showed on screen nor did the fact that she didn't want to be a movie star she is one of the true goddesses and brought everything she did to life gene kelly is in a serious role here but gets plenty of chances to dance and sing phil silvers is very amiable and funny as the in house comic and best friend br br this is a very good movie with no dull spots the only problem i had is the idea that rusty has to choose between a successful career and the man she loves when supermodel jinx who plays herself in the film speaks of getting married she's warned by her boss not to that she's too necessary to the modeling business we're not told if rusty continues with her career or goes back to work at danny's but all signs seemed to point toward the brooklyn club why couldn't she have had both nevertheless you can't beat cover girl for top entertainment beautiful color lovely music great energy fine performances and its most fabulous asset the glorious rita hayworth
<START> i will never go to another tarantino movie again the entire film was worthless my wife and i both regret that we didn't get up and walk out at the first indication of what the film was really going to be about which is still hard to determine since it was such a ridiculous storyline blood guts and violence seemed to be the only real theme but we kept hoping there'd be something redeeming just around the corner unfortunately there wasn't because there wasn't anything that made sense we along with a lot of the other people in the audience walked out of the theater muttering that was disgusting what a waste of time i should've walked out where was the comedy that was pathetic etc it actually made us the audience voice our disgust and the feeling that we had just been thoroughly ripped off the only thing of merit in the film was the costuming and the acting ability of almost everyone in the film there just wasn't a plot script worthy of their talents i rate this a 1 because there isn't a 0 i can't quite understand how anyone could rate this higher than a 0
<START> hartley on low key form martin donovan born to play jesus comes as messiah to millenial manhatten p j harvey is excellent as sidekick a slight film but amusing short and sweet
<START> jamie foxx did an incredible job playing ray charles i loved this movie because every so often there would be a flashback scene and then to the current movie when ray charles was little he went blind and his mother didn't baby him she was a strong woman who didn't treat him any different because he was blind she made him do things on his own and that really pushed him to become a great musician later on in life his mother also sent him to school as well then when ray charles became a man he could stand up for himself and take care of himself but there was a downfall into narcotics sex and betrayal when i am discouraged about something i can just think of this movie and it will inspire me
<START> quality entertainment all around the spectacle of kermit on his bicycle is one thats as memorable as any in cinema history there's just not a bad thing to be said tons of muppets great cameos slapstick puns whatever you want its here the lovers the dreamers and me indeed
<START> televised in 1982 from a los angeles production this is probably the finest example of a filmed stage musical you are likely to encounter issued on dvd in 2004 in a remastered digital transfer it is quite stunning and lansbury give the performances of their lives and the rest of the cast are quite obviously caught up in the electricity generated of course it is sondheim's music and lyrics that make this possible if anyone doubts that he is one of the greats of the american musical form listen to this the sets are stark as befits the plot and clever in allowing the swift scene changes required and the cameras catch the action without obliterating the fact that this is a stage production a central move able and revolving platform is mrs pie shop with the shop upstairs around it are various and moving stairs to allow the rest of the action to take place the brutal tale of injustice leading to revenge murder and mayhem is liberally spiced with dark humour and comic moments sondheim does for barber shops what hitchcock did for showers an important work in american musical theatre is here given an electrifying performance
<START> the best part of this dvd is the cover it goes down hill from there there was no chemistry between the leads the kisses looked like something i traded with my grandmother br br the sound was so bad that at least i was spared some of the dialoge
<START> what can i say curse of monkey island is fantastic the story is good and solid but appropriately silly the jokes are hillarious the puzzles are puzzling you couldn't ask for more in an adventure game the you don't need to see my identification bit is in itself well worth buying the game for not to mention murray who has become the hot topic among many of my friends only some of whom have played the game you will love this game and if you don't too bad
<START> this movie is a disaster within a disaster film it is full of great action scenes which are only meaningful if you throw away all sense of reality let's see word to the wise lava burns you steam burns you you can't stand next to lava diverting a minor lava flow is difficult let alone a significant one scares me to think that some might actually believe what they saw in this movie br br even worse is the significant amount of talent that went into making this film i mean the acting is actually very good the effects are above average hard to believe somebody read the scripts for this and allowed all this talent to be wasted i guess my suggestion would be that if this movie is about to start on tv look away it is like a train wreck it is so awful that once you know what is coming you just have to watch look away and spend your time on more meaningful content
<START> if you are having trouble sleeping or just want to take that nap in the afternoon but just can't seem to drift off pop in this movie the only neat thing about this movie are the electric planes aside from that prepare for some sweet it boggles the mind how big name stars such as those in this movie can be part of the one of the dullest movies i've ever seen now if you will excuse me i will finish my nap
<START> great little ground breaking movie in 1955 about an important subject br br i wasn't expecting much from sinatra's performance and was pleasantly surprised by it loved kim novak she was gorgeous br br loved the jazz score by elmer bernstein as great as that by schifrin for bullitt i am very surprised it doesn't seem available on cd if anyone knows about the soundtrack's availability on any other format they should post it here somewhere br br preminger's direction was as usual borderline flawless br br haven't read nelson novel nor have any idea how faithful the screenplay was to it the subplot of frankie as a hot card dealer was a bit of a surprise too as were a few other things but see for yourself it's very much worth seeing
