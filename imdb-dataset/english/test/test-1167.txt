<START> this is one of the most predictable movies i have ever seen and this supposed to be funny boring boring boring find the fast forward button at your remote and use it i can t say i laughed once and the only good feeling this movie gave me was relief when it ended
<START> the devil's men represents what turned out to be one of the last gasps of the occult obsessed horror scene of the 70's shortly before halloween came along tore up the rule book set fire to it and kicked it screaming through a plate glass window br br to cut a long story short a couple of enterprising greek film makers fancy their chances of nailing together a new film franchise featuring the unlikely double act of womanising wise talking american investigator milo and stuffy but kind hearted priest father an exiled nobleman is mixed up in some satanic offering up tourists as sacrifices to an extremely effigy of the minotaur and only milo and can stop him br br or something like that br br the reality is however horribly dull frustrating and loaded with wasted opportunities i strongly suspect that the fledgling film makers blew most of the budget on getting donald peter cushing and brian for the soundtrack onboard and hoped that would be enough to sway audiences in the english speaking world br br it isn't the devil's men looks beautiful with assured camera work and fantastic locations score though basically just a one chord drone that he probably cranked out in an afternoon is suitably atmospheric and the movie is laden with cracking 70's crumpet including that austrailian sort from fawlty towers and uber hottie jane lyle of island of death infamy but there the positives end cushing sleepwalks through it looking like he has a corn cob up his bum and pleasance about trying his best but never quite getting things right to make matters worse the character of milo is appallingly flimsy and unlikeable br br okay so it doesn't look that good but from there the film simply refuses to go anywhere there is an insinuation that the local villagers are possessed but to be fair to them they never really do anything very much other than shuffle about looking glassy eyed perhaps they were just tired just when you are sure things will come to some kind of a head milo and interrupt the baron's satanic party with laughable ease sending him on to meet his maker the statue of the minotaur falls silent and hey presto satan is defeated br br yeah right br br the inane optimism that the devil's men might be the first of a series of films is hammered home by father final line mere seconds before the ridiculously rushed ending br br who knows milo perhaps one day i may call upon you again to help defeat the antichrist br br i'm sure you'll be putting that call in any day now donald
<START> dear readers 2001 a space odyssey is kubrick at his best although i really can't say that as space odyssey is his only film i've ever watched but still it's a good film strange but good br br the movie is in three acts much like the novel which is unsurprising since the author wrote the screenplay anyhow we first start out with the simple yet spectacular opening with also blaring on the speakers then comes the boring beyond belief 'dawn of man' sequence then there's the odd 'finding of the sequence on the moon played to blue danube finally things get good with the spaceship scenes and hal going berserk and killing people after that things die down and we have the the sequence which was way too long and the ultra strange ending even though 2001 a space odyssey is a good film it's not star wars stargate terminator or the abyss but it rocks my compliments to the chef mr kubrick br br signed the constant dvd collector
<START> one of best movies ever fire it is not much about sociological description of india today it is the mind blowing use of light that never stops never becomes normal even when in this sense the movie is almost unique both leads are of very good quality the origin of das as a street performer are pretty obvious her performance is a superb but the use of the light i have look at it and looked at it again and again still mind blowing after ages nothing torrid in the story rather pure way of facing the subject in a way it is sad that in the bizarre world we live today a major art work is usually known as a gender film fire can stand face to face with dryer's jeanne d' arc or no or some of the major kurosawa movies just to name some wish my input could help a little this movie to its deserved way to fame
<START> you know i'm getting really tired of all the generic music being used in these type of movies see jawbreaker disturbing behavior etc every scene of genuine tension here and there is some is immediately undercut with some cheesy pop tune completely diluting the suspense why do they do that to sell some soundtracks of course but in this case mission unaccomplished did anyone buy the cd br br and yeah ms mirren attacks her role with zest and relish with some cheez wiz to add kick but what are molly leslie and vivica doing here their roles they're so underused that i cannot use characters here have no purpose in the storyline so i can't figure out why three well known actresses had been cast br br oh and the ending is so unbelievably hackneyed and irresponsible the kids get off scot free and act as if nothing happened all smiles at graduation they're criminals people no consequences for their actions kidnapping assault grade tampering nothing br br little things too was tale about her husband true what's with the crossbow would the virginal katie character loose her cherry on a whim like that great message guys why did go to her home how did kate's academic nemesis walk through the door at that exact moment how do students even obtain teachers' home addresses what's with jeffrey tambor on what basis did fire tingle she's bloodied battered and held hostage by students fer sake br br oh well i'm spending way more thought on the script than mr williamson apparently did so i'll stop here br br 3 10
<START> this movie endorses self justice it grants freedom to a black man who killed the men who raped his daughter and in the end he gets of scat free despicable enough as this may be there is also adultery in this film the character has the hots for the bullock character and the film has some of those stereotypes of trial films like the important news brought to the court in the nick of time that make every aesthetically demanding film goer such as me sick i really cannot believe that someone liked this junk it is a film so bad and holding up false ideals that i am unable to put my critic in an eloquently pleasing way when will the american people wake up and find out that they are being manipulated 24 7 by films like these that turn reality into some bs where there is justice for all if only they take it into their hands this cowboy attitude just makes me sick and in my eyes it represents everything that is wrong with america
<START> for those who expect documentaries to be objective creatures let me give you a little lesson in american film making br br documentaries rely heavily on casting you pick and choose characters you think will enhance the drama and entertainment value of your film br br after you have shot a ton of footage you splice it together to make a film with ups and downs turning points climaxes etc if you have trouble with existing footage you either shoot some more that makes sense find some stock footage or be clever with your narration br br the allegation that the filmmakers used footage of locales not part of the movie favelas next to beautiful beaches does not detract from the value of the film as a dramatic piece and the particular image is one that resonates enough to justify its not quite truthful inclusion at any rate you use the footage you can so they didn't happen to have police violence footage for that particular neighborhood does this mean not include it and just talk about it or maybe put in some cartoon animation so the audience isn't duped um no br br as for the hopeful ending why not yes americans made it yes americans are optimistic bastards but why end on a down note just because it's set in a foreign country and foreign films by and large end on a down note let foreigners portray the dismal outlook of life br br let us americans think there may be a happy ending looming in the future there just may be one
<START> i had never even heard of one dark night until someone mentioned it on a horror message board here recently and reading into it i gained interest due to meg tilly's involvement and recognizing that it was an early gig for friday the 13th vi jason lives director tom unfortunately sad to say it's nothing special the premise has a familiarity to it a college girl must survive the night in an old mausoleum until morning in order to join a sorority that girl is a young meg tilly as julie who wishes to prove to her loving caring boyfriend steve david mason daniels that she can make his cruel conniving ex girlfriend carol's robin evans sorority regardless of the tactics she pulls in order to see her fail along with carol's gang is kitty leslie always with a toothbrush in her mouth and leslie elizabeth daily who doesn't really wish to cause julie such trouble while leslie insists on leaving julie alone as she remains in the mausoleum carol and kitty plan to torment the poor girl meanwhile steve searches for her while julie carol and kitty encounter an evil they couldn't possibly imagine the corpse of a recently diseased psychic vampire whose telekinesis was of a dangerously powerful degree will seek to drain them of their very lifeforce the only one who can help these girls is the dead man's daughter olivia melissa newman who is equipped with the same psychic power he has br br i think what many will find exciting is the unusual evil that threatens the girls in the mausoleum it's certainly different than what you normally see in the slashers that were out at this time like adam west's character he was the cynical husband of olivia who found the idea of her father's power ridiculous i had a really hard time adjusting to the tacky plot and i personally never found anything within the film to get excited about the mausoleum to me never really was that spooky it doesn't really achieve the same kind of eerie quality phantasm captured and the corpses which are used to attack the girls are laughably unconvincing there is one great scene where a corpse's face melts away i have a soft spot for low budget films from this period of time but i just never really could find a reason to get involved when you have this unsatisfying undead corpse shooting electric bolts from it's eyes causing other bodies to break free from their crypts to obey their master it's just too silly to take seriously carol is your typical blond bitch wishing to punish a nice girl who is dating a former flame steve is your typical squeaky clean all american boyfriend handsome and tender who becomes the hero seeking to save his girl from whatever sinister forces are at play to make up for the small budget director tries every trick in the book to thrill the audience using a series of ooga effects such as corpses which pursue young girls chairs which shake and tremble doors that slam shut and objects levitating by themselves the film obviously has it's fans and i am glad i had a chance to see it but i was a bit disappointed that one dark night wasn't the horror sleeper i hoped for adam west has a very small role as the concerned husband hoping his wife will snap out of her depressed state regarding a father who had nothing to do with her melissa newman is the troubled olivia recognizing that she must stop her father once and for all or else he'd continue to prey on the living donald is an associate of olivia's father's who informs her of what he was i wasn't particularly blown away by tilly's performance here she was basically scared most of the time but she'd get a chance to prove herself to a greater degree from this point onward this will undoubtedly be of some value to those who watched it back at that time for nostalgia purposes it might seduce fans of movies from this era
<START> i am in awe of the number of people who consider this film to be decent much less great do the majority of people even have basic standards for a film they watch i just don't know anymore br br this commercial cinematic product doesn't really deserve the respect of being called a film to call dean cain talented is a gross injustice to anyone who actually has talent i have had a lot of respect for lori petty but most of that has gone right down the tubes at least her role was extremely small maybe she had a bill that desperately needed to get paid br br the ignorance i saw while viewing firetrap was amazing let me start out by getting this off my chest if you can't show fire realistically then don't show it at all okay it's an embarrassment to all involved when you show lame effects that don't even come close to simulating an actual burning building br br some interesting tidbits 1 a janitor opens the door to a large storage closet and finds the entire room engulfed in flames what does he do he tries to put out the fire with his broom 2 the same janitor who knows the building is on fire later comes across a door marked hazardous materials his brilliant mind tells him that it would be a great idea to open said door big mistake 3 a woman is giving a fantastically generous donation of 100 000 to a greyhound rescue fund but she's wearing a fur coat to the charity event they're holding wouldn't people who care about animals kinda frown on that sort of thing 4 several of the people in the movie are forced into a vault of some sort with massive steel walls that even an electromagnetic pulse couldn't penetrate yet they have a spacious air vent leading right into the back of the thing that anyone could crawl through that sure seems like a lapse in security br br i could go on and on but i have grown tiresome thinking about this lame movie our hero whom we are supposed to be cheering for is a career criminal who early on tries to kill some police officers what a swell guy if the general public wants to waste their minds away on this drivel then more power to them i just wish i could have it erased from my memory 1 10
<START> i'm lucky enough to have a good quality copy of my vhs on dvd so i can now watch this over and over again the characters are so well played i can't find fault with any aspect of the casting ok so there are a few differences from the book but the old clichÃ© of love conquering all is so powerfully portrayed that it makes no difference the reality of living in the rural countryside of early 19th century england is beautifully contrasted by the changing seasons from biting winter to glorious summer days and this is mirrored in the different characters from bullying father to all encompassing love a story that changed my life
<START> do you like explosions how about fighting well this movie has both of those you know the other thing you can't have a movie without a kick ass motorcycle the type that bounces off someone's head and knocks them out at the same time you bet the has one there's even a classic cliff scene br br all in all i'm quite proud that i have even seen this movie and even prouder to have my review be the first one yes
<START> there is one of the best movies directed by that story told about young writer who is his place after a second war he's survive german camp excellent true atmosphere action goes in camp for displaced placed main hero played by one of the best polish actor daniel finally fall in love but unfortunately his lady has been killed there was beautiful scene when he is talking with american soldier and says about death his girl nothing is happen simply you're shootin' to us now he's condition of soul has been destroyed 10 10
<START> this is an example of what film school would call a good debut movie it follows all the rules short scenes to the point cheap to shoot guerilla film making no sets just disused buildings and possibly an empty hospital wing also even the black white film stock was a stroke of genius probably selected more for its low expense rather than film effect but it worked br br reno was amazing as the brute everyone's acting was brilliant the plot was simple and effective and no flabby bits left to distract you a tight well crafted cost effective budget movie br br released in 1983 this would've been made just before the art of big budget action spectaculars became refined by the hollywood movie making engine and movie making was more exclusive and therefore more difficult and more in need of the right people in the right places than today's internet enabled world so luc would've had to do quite a bit of negotiating and promise keeping to achieve this result which makes the end product all the more remarkable br br but then again the french movie industry has always maintained an excellent reputation yes i know luc is belgian but the movie is a french production and has been the source of many hollywood remakes br br if i have one criticism it's that the cover picture on the dvd and possibly the original sales poster bears no resemblance to the movie whatsoever and appears to be a rather bizarre image rather than representative of any of the movie's themes at first glance it appears to be a man in post apocalyptic armour on a swing but on second inspection reveals a man in armour with a lance on an office chair with his legs on a desk in a self confident posture this never happens in the movie once br br it's black and white film stock zero dialogue physical acting tight scenes and brilliant actors makes this movie one worth adding to your private movie collection a superb movie

<START> this is a student film and it's a piece of crap i would use much stronger language to describe it but then the review wouldn't be posted and the world needs to know beyond any possible reasonable doubt this movie really sucks br br there seems to be a different ruler used when measuring an already famous director's early work like somehow it was genius that we were just too stupid to comprehend since he finally got it right now today i'm not buying it the early movie bad taste made by the lotr peter jackson's sucks and this early work from another famous director really sucks the same way too these early works are representative of crappy everything from budget to scripts to actors etc it all is bottom of the bucket trash don't be fooled by the big name br br if you like watching a handful of male 70's hippie pretend they could ever command a ship with the worst special effects you have ever seen this is your movie br br i can't f believe this thing won a golden scroll award for best special effects that is a joke right or a joke award br br if you want to watch what this movie wishes it was rent a season or three of red dwarf you
