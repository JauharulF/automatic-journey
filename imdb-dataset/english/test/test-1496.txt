<START> typically spanish production slow moving but with great sensuousness and sexuality oozing from the lead actress paz vega watch her in spanglish great sets lots of colour you get to see seville spanish mountains and countryside the plot tends to meander here and there but if you follow closely i managed to even though the film is in spanish you'll get the gist of it br br it's about how one very highly sensual young gypsy woman carmen uses her feminine wiles to seduce men to do her bidding carmen is being taken to prison after attacking a fellow at the cigar factory where she works she persuades jose the soldier in charge of taking her to prison to let her escape jose succumbs to her charms because she speaks basque he is and speaks the same language jose is punished by 1 month in jail and to foot soldier he later meets carmen at a party and they end up becoming lovers but carmen refuses to commit to him and continues her lascivious and flirty lifestyle in a jealous rage jose kills a fellow soldier who has been with carmen they then have to leave town life on the run turns jose into a bandit carmen meanwhile remains the same a wildly promiscuous woman in the end jose loses his mind and ends up killing carmen br br the story is told by jose in prison awaiting to be executed the person he tells the story to is prospero a french writer and anthropologist whose fancy watch it plays beethoven's fur elise was stolen by either carmen or jose br br worth watching for the sets and for the delectable paz vega
<START> there are no spoilers for this film as nothing could be written that could make it any worse the dictionary definition of puerile should now read sex lives of the potato men unless that is you like dog poo and in which case this is the film to see johnny vegas et all what were you thinking
<START> if you are a fan of either of the two origin franchises aliens predator duh and even if you liked or disliked flick in 06 you will hate this movie the innumerable plot holes flakey and unbelievable human characters terrible special effects and even worse directing and fight scenes make this one of worse films i've ever seen br br one of the hundred huge plot holes included the alien hybrid going from chest to full grown bad ass in seconds it takes off on an onboard predator ship killing spree and wipes out a ship of before the ship even breaks earth orbit as if in the first we saw a ship of sr hunters drop off three juveniles hunters going on an earning their stripes hunting party and then in the end saw them picking up the honored body of the juvenile that was left over at the end of the flick are we expected to believe that the single chest hybrid killed all these sr hunters before the ship even broke orbit also and this was extremely cheap production value on the director producer's parts jars and jars and jars of face huggers somehow magically appeared aboard the ship even though the entire temple complex and queen alien were destroyed in the flick these face huggers end up playing an part in movie of course and how about all these face huggers becoming full grown aliens in a days time what a joke although there were many many more plot holes i don't think imdb would appreciate me filling up their servers by writing them here br br on the flakey and unbelievable characters well where should i go boys and girls where to start almost all of these goof balls are clichÃ© people from other films or tv shows the town bad boy who left to avoid jail time but shows up just on the day everything happens to save the day where did i see that oh yeah last season on jericho then there's the 20 something town sheriff a former trouble maker himself who was best friends at one time with the bad boy where did we see that oh yeah jericho and walking tall then there's the generic soldier with no rank coming home from some generic war front that isn't met like a long missed loved one and hero at the airport or bus station but at her own front door by her daughter and husband and who is this soldier what did she do in the army air force marines navy coast guard we don't know because the movie never tells us but she was some kind of soldier airman marine sailor that knows how to drive a stryker infantry vehicle and magically a helicopter this character is just a generic copy of every coming home service person except that she brings home a set of night vision goggles to her daughter that cost several hundred dollars these are things soldiers have to sign for and don't just bring home ugh br br the special effects and fight scenes are what pi sed me off the worst though these are the things i enjoyed the most in the first movie watching and aliens go at it the way this was filmed though the action sequences were so dark and filmed so close up that you couldn't tell what was going on you couldn't see who was doing what and what was going on as they were fighting it out all in all these hundreds of items are going to kill this franchise and the no one is going to care anymore about seeing their favorite sci fi movie monsters and can only guess that the series will go down from here as producers won't like dump millions of dollars more on a sequel
<START> it is apparent that director writers and everyone else knows nothing about their own religion or the people who practice it this movie is endlessly flawed and overall a complete crock br br for instance there is a scene where the rabbi enters the woman's ritual bath while a naked woman is bathing puts his hand on the head of a woman there and blesses her this is complete mockery of the laws in this scene alone some of the laws broken include modesty a rabbi would never enter a ritual bath house while there are woman in it br br improper contact a rabbi would never put his hand on a woman's head not to mention that it is not the way a blessing is given br br the woman from the ritual bath is dunking a naked woman by pushing her head under the water the laws regarding ritual bathing require the entire body to make direct contact with the bath water this means nobody should be in contact with the person bathing certainly not pushing them under br br there was more just in that scene alone like dunking 13 times where does that concept even come from not to mention the rest of the movie was a total fallacy it is scary what ignorance can concoct
<START> put this movie out of it's misery and burn the negatives what am i saying the whole movie was negative fortunately only a very few would find this movie the least bit appealing this is what the vast american majority would call too much sex and violence it will probably show up on some non premium cable channel someday just for the shock value but after editing out the nudity most of the violence will stay all that will be left is 45 minutes of really bad acting interspersed with 45 minutes of commercials there are just too many starving actors in hollywood
<START> the actors were not believable the story was really weak total sap and completely predictable really disappointed in depardieu it was a shame that they did not focus more on the struggle of the canadian fight for independence we have seen this love story many times before only with better actors we had to wait for the last 15 minutes for a small sense of drama the soundtrack was totally disturbing the underscore hit you over the head with sentimentality but really over the top the only thing we found ok was the fact that they let the indians speak their language and we found the cinematography of the indian village relatively realistic
<START> spoiler mind ripper hmmmm i had just watched the nightmare on elm street movies and had just found out about giovanni ribisi i thought giovanni ribisi hadnt done any horrors so i checked into it i saw the outpost mind ripper i checked on my tivo for it there was an air date on sci fi so i was set i got my pop corn ready came in and set on the couch and what the hell is this a freakin bold guy in blue sweat pants running around yelling nothing is scary about this movie at all if anything its funny funny how low the budget is funny how predictable it is funny how bad the acting is and funny how much money it didnt make ok giovanni ribisi is a good actor but this movie is dumb it is so stupid they killed him at the end and then they go on this plane and the monster is on it they shoot him in the head with a shotgun and it falls a long way to the ground and br br gasp the killer ending its still alive scary sucky fat sack of crap waste of 2 hours br br bottom line you have somewhere to go and you need to kill some time mind ripper isnt the suggestion i'd rather sit out naked in the snow than watch this movie a second time br br overall grade f
<START> watch this movie only to truly appreciate how good the original is i'm not real hard to please but this was one of the worst movies i have ever seen br br it hurt me deeply because i like chevy chase jackie mason and dyan cannon the writing was just terrible i thought chevy would have at least ad libbed some better stuff than he did there was hardly anything to laugh at in this movie i went into it wanting to enjoy it i wanted to laugh but nearly cried br br in the beginning credits it read special appearance by chevy chase this worried me from the start chevy is actually in more than i thought he would be it's more than a special appearance too bad the appearance wasn't special mason's character would have been a good secondary character but got old as a main i would rather have seen more much more of dyan cannon at least her character was fun if not well written i also missed the teen sex scene mr gopher went from being cute and innocent to a pesky rodent that deserved to be blown up jonathan silverman is the only character that interested me and we didn't see enough of him br br i take it back try to watch half of this movie then remember the alamo the maine and caddyshack i
<START> i was really disappointed after viewing pinocchio's revenge the other night i had a good inclination that it was going to be a bad one but i didn't think that it'd be as bad as it turned out a wooden puppet of a murdered boy falls into the hands of an attorney's eight year old daughter from there it is a murderous path for anyone who gets in the way between the puppet and the little girl we've seen movies like this before i e the child's play series which is by the way far better however it was good to see actors like james w quinn and todd allen both of which have worked under kevin tenney before in any event i encourage viewers to check out night of the demons and the original witchboard these are titles that tend to bring out the best in kevin s tenney
<START> i saw this in a preview screening and have to say that this documentary style movie is the biggest load of tripe i have ever seen br br completely unfunny low budget boring rubbish script terrible acting the entire audience young and old sat through the film comatose without laughing for most of it there were literally only about 2 places you will laugh in the entire movie br br many people left halfway can't blame them i stayed thinking that the film would pick up however it never did and i wish i'd left br br the humour was really lame and i am surprised that this ever made it on to the big screen i am not someone who is offended by the adult content of this movie at all it just wasn't funny the people who made this movie really don't deserve your money so please don't pay to see this film br br this isn't even funny enough to be shown on tv let alone cinema br br i wanted to give it 0 out of 10 but the system won't allow it
<START> first of all i'd like to start by saying it's a refreshing start to see a british drama that finally looks and feels believable br br patrick stewart does the role justice as ian hood the government science adviser with his constant and unwavering views on authority and thoughts about the future of real world science and how he feels it's either being used or abused by others br br not only is the casting thoroughly maintained all the way throughout the series but it makes it's characters seem more believable than most other british drama's br br ashley jensen also delivers a first rate performance as dr hood's appointed bodyguard rachael young she brings a refreshing take on the unscientific uninterested everyday views of science and her constant battling with hood makes for some very funny and memorable moments between them br br the way the series keeps all the scientific elements more realistic i find positive and more engaging than the psychobabble we are so used to in other fiction or science fiction tv shows br br there are however notable disappointments with the series every time an episode ends i find myself disappointed that they didn't seem to cover all aspects of the plot and sometimes leaving open ended stories br br although bearing in mind that this is still the first series i hope that we see a return to form in the near future where these open ended stories can finally be given a significant conclusion they so rightly deserve br br for those who enjoy more slow paced science related plot lines this is the ideal show to watch as it always manages to stay believable and more importantly to the point
<START> shame on fox for dumping this movie it was a total riot and i only hope that it will find a second life on dvd and cable br br this is a hilarious satire it takes the what if situation to an extreme and it doesn't pull any punches or kicks to the groin it makes you think what is to become of this empire once we've gotten totally to lazy and stupid everyone gets hit in this one esp a number of major corporations and even fox news takes a punch which is probably why the movie never had a proper release other than the marketing department over thinking the campaign and not knowing how to market it so we'll just give up some may find the movie sophomoric due to the groin kicking and farting but the movie is much more than that you either get what mike judge is saying or you don't most of the negative reviews i've read seem to come from people who just don't get it or are film snobs br br it'll probably play for one week in the selected markets so if you miss it keep an eye out for the dvd it'll be worth the rental and i will eventually have it in my collection br br good job mike judge it's a shame that you got screwed but you made me laugh out loud and i look forward to the next movie you do
<START> rko radio pictures made a real classic in 1947 and even managed to get it nominated for the best picture academy award the acting script continuity et cetera are all just about perfect and the story is well worth the viewer's 82 minutes although the picture soft petals the true life story by making the murder victim a jew rather than a homosexual most viewers will see the victim as a jewish homosexual such disguises never work perhaps weren't intended to br br i could nit pick about a few details but just for fun there was no all night movie house in washington dc in 1947 and if there was i wish robert mitchum and his pal wouldn't talk through the show there weren't any bars where a gi could pick up a pretty blonde none if robert ryan wanted to read the latest murder scoop he ought to have bought the daily news not the times evening star and certainly not the know nothing washington post but these little things take nothing away from this classic br br the film benefits a lot from the absolute lack of a musical score except during the credits i've only seen this done in a few films br br on the negative side since 1995 it comes with a tmc introduction where some liberal about what the public was ready for in 1947 blah blah blah as if this fool has any business judging his betters i'd say the ex gi's in 1947 the greatest generation were much smarter and had better values than some commentator film historian or other wise mouth in 1995 put a sock in it
<START> recap a lone swordsman living in the desert and acting as an agent to other swordsmen recollects how his life turned out to be as it is it started with that the woman he loved chose to marry his brother instead causing him to leave his home town one of the swordsmen is huang who is himself in the middle of a complicated love story where a woman wants to have him killed for having ran away from a promise to marry her younger sister but the sister wants to hire a swordsman to have huang protected and everything is put to an edge when the woman and her sister is really the same person br br comments i've seen the redux version released in 2008 of the original that was released in 1994 how the two versions differ i can't say but the redux is very heavily stylized in the way of chinese wuxia action that is unfortunate as that style to me seems to have forgotten one of the most important elements of a successful and entertaining movie a comprehensible story but true to its style scenery and visual elements seem much more important and much more in focus of writer and director kar wai wong therefore there are lots of colorful very beautiful scenes that are completely unrelated to the story br br the editing and timeline of the story is also mishandled much is left out in the scenes the time line is broken and rearranged in a confusing way very slow and calm scenes are suddenly relieved by surprisingly brutal and seemingly unmotivated fights only to themselves being relieved by something else and unrelated the result is a confusing and very uninteresting movie br br thanks to these brutal but very few fights the movie is put into the action genre the poster and photographs also imply this but could almost be regarded as false marketing only a few minutes out of the 90 could be considered as anything like action the other couldn't be farther away from it the movie in its entirety is very slow dull and hence very boring not even the rare action filled scenes help since they are so disconnected from the rest of the movie br br i might say that i'm not a fan of this chinese style since they often seem to be afflicted of these same problems most importantly that the visual is more important than the story but ashes of time redux is perhaps the worst example i've seen br br 3 10
<START> nicely filmed a little uneven nobody is a good evening's entertainment the plot is simple enough three yuppies get into a scrap with a group of strangers in a bar and it turns out to be much more than they bargained for the acting is decent and there are a few unexpected twists watch for the completely unbelievable like the 10 shot revolver and 25 shot semi automatic handgun
