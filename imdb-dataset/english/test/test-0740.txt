<START> probably the best horror movie in 5 years there's been lame remakes attempts to make you scared when all they make you do is walk out of the theater and movies that just shouldn't have been made but this one is worth it the only reason i didn't give it a 10 is because paris hilton is in it but her death scene makes up for it believe me br br so here they are the spoilers of all the death scenes in the movie br br 1 my favorite death scene ever paris hilton's after finding her boyfriend blake laying on the ground with a knife sticking out of his neck paige starts to run well speed walk is more respectable she finds this like garage with all these cars in it then one of the killers cuts her ankle from below this whole time shes holding a huge metal spike so she drops it and runs and hides behind this car the killer picks it up and as she looks through the window he throws it through the window and it shoots through her forehead i've never been so excited or laughed so hard in my life br br 2 paige's boyfriend blake gets a knife stabbed into his neck and then the killer walks up to him while hes on the ground and steps on it pushing it farther into his throat then he dies br br 3 elisha cuthbert carly one of the hottest chicks ever doesn't die phew but she does get her lips super glued together punched in the face and gets part of her index finger chopped off yeah i felt like heaving 4 twin brother nick also survives but not without getting his ass kicked and a stab wound to the leg br br 5 nicks best friend dalton gets thrown down a flight of stairs and then is decapitated his body is dragged away and we see his eyes blink then he gets covered in wax br br 6 wade boyfriend gets his achilles snipped by a massive pair of scissors and then is attacked by the same scissors he doesn't die but hes covered in wax and on 2 occasions his skin is accidentally removed revealing his nasty bloody flesh yummy br br so there it is definitely worth your money
<START> this is a simple episode ad so far after watching all of the season 11 episodes with the exception of the trilogy this is the one that made laugh the most definitely is my favourite so far of season 11 so basically cartman sees at a toy store a kid who has the tourette's syndrome and a new idea comes to cartman you can imagine now cartman has tourette's syndrome and is great since kyle once he knows about this is like he's faking cartman is certainly on fire saying whatever he wants to the teachers to the principal to anybody on the other hand we have kyle who now is the intolerant one basically for saying that cartman was faking he was taken to meet children with tourette's syndrome just to let him see that tourette's syndrome is for real and is great since kyle is like well maybe someone is faking to have tourette's for fun in short kyle could not explain that cartman was faking probably my favourite scene of this episode is when cartman is with kyle's family but right after this scene another kid fins that cartman is simply faking the kid with tourette's who was at the toy store cartman basically said to that kid this isn't having tourette's awesome but to be saying whatever he wants and be for everybody a brave boy is sort of just the beginning for cartman his master plan going on national tv to say anything he wants people will call it brilliant tv they'll probably give me an emmy fantastic in this episode the word s is used 26 times and certainly that's not all south park won an emmy like a month or so before this episode aired but here there's a twist cartman basically removed all the bricks of the wall he says now everything without thinking so we hear from cartman that he wet his bed last night now is not fun for cartman and he is like i can't control what i say and certainly the person who was with him is like well of course you can't control what you say you have tourette's so cartman is like my tourette's has gotten worse before i just blurted out cool stuff about jews being lame and stuff but now it's gotten really bad there is also stuff about chris hansen and to catch a predator actually what happened with a pervert here happens with a lot more perverts kyle and thomas were behind that to stop cartman kyle ends being saviour fantastic br br voices concern over south park october 3rd episode br br on wednesday october 3 the cable network comedy central will air an episode of the animated series south park in which one of the young characters cartman gets syndrome given the nature of this program we fully expect it to be offensive and insensitive to people with ts and garner numerous calls and emails from our members and the ts community br br we have already taken some pre strikes such as requesting that comedy central air our public service announcement featuring comedian richard lewis during or after the show in addition once the episode airs and we are able to see exactly how ts is portrayed we will be able to respond with specific issues and problems we have with the show to the writers br br we are actually surprised it took the creators so long to use ts as comedy fodder in this program since no disability illness or controversial topic is off limits to them said ungar president br br we always see portrayals of ts good and bad as an opportunity for awareness and education and a show of this magnitude and popularity is certainly no exception and provides a way for to spread factual information about the disorder said tracy flynn manager of public relations and communications br br we will be posting an official statement on this site with reaction to the program after the show airs br br responds to south park episode br br unfortunately as has been the case with far too many media portrayals of people with syndrome ts the season opener of south park le petit 10 3 07 served to perpetuate even further the outright myth that most of those affected by ts have involuntary outbursts of foul language in point of fact fully 85 90 of people with ts never experience this tragically socially symptom medically termed for viewers less familiar with the symptoms of this neurological disorder the misleading take away message couldn't have been clearer Â unless you curse you don't have ts br br despite our pre airing trepidations we do concede that the episode was surprisingly well researched the highly exaggerated emphasis on notwithstanding for the attentive viewer there was a surprising amount of accurate information conveyed the scripted input from parents a neurologist peers and the therapy session with the ts children's support group all served as a clever device for providing these facts to the public no doubt this south park episode did generate increased national awareness about ts nevertheless we are very concerned that school children with ts will be mocked and even bullied by insensitive peers who may have seen the program said ungar president we realize that for over a decade the writers' satirical parodies have spared no group be they celebrities the disabled or political figures the fact that ts was the subject of a popular tv show attests to the fact that the public is so much more aware of the disorder obviously this increased awareness we've worked too hard to accomplish can at times prove to be a double edged sword br br contacted the program's executives prior to the airing and we will be in touch with them again perhaps we'll succeed in turning this into an opportunity for positive ts awareness
<START> the filming is cheesy some of the actors overact some of the actions are unexplained and unexplainable but br br this movie is in the mode of the psychological dramas of the 50s br br it is a morality play similar to the movie in which a method actor becomes the evil character he portrays on stage ed is forced to watch slasher movies because he is the film editor it gives him a nervous breakdown which leads to a complete psychotic break br br
<START> i just finished watching one episode s1 5 a boy in a bush so maybe my review is not very fair br br but based on that episode this is a very poor version of csi the acting is crap the main character dr whatever her name is is so fake it actually hurts i wouldn't cast her to do an add for dog food br br the other hurtful thing is david boreanaz of the angel fame a good actor does a great job but wasted coz of the idiotic acting of that woman br br supporting cast is ok but all is ruined due to this stupid acting of emily deschanel br br very disappointing version of csi very sorry to see it appear on the filmography of some of the potential talents involved in it br br that woman is really sh t at least in that episode but based on this one view i will not even invest watching it even if it was shown on an elevator screen
<START> there's no point in comparing this with the original series though different in look and content both are true to the original idea that is an sf horror anthology series due to indifferent scheduling in australia i've only managed to catch a small number of episodes spread over the first few seasons the very first episode really did give me the creeps nightmares at my age but a number of others did fall flat generally when the stories moved into horror realms and away from sf i only hope the dvds reach us eventually
<START> i really liked this movie i watched it last night on the public broadcasting system the part i liked about it was the fact that they dealt with issues of today not in the future or the past they basically had some terrorists take a van or two and rent them out to be car bombs i think what the movie could have showed was people in different countries at the same time it did show the fact that england or any other country isn't prepared for an attack on the magnitude that they showed i have never heard of any of the actors or actresses in the movie so i can't really say if they are normally their parts after the movie they had this panel of experts talking about if something like that could happen here in the u s it was a thought provoking discussion
<START> this episode from season one titled ironically answer me is a pretty well done and memorable episode and it takes a shocking twist at the end you have jean marsh as an over the hill and washed up actress from l a who's moved to new york city for an audition and she's living in an apartment provided by an old friend oddly every night she's kept awake by a ringing phone from the next door apartment yet oddly enough the dwelling where the ringing phone continues to ring is unoccupied as the guests have been dead for many years finally she has to give in only she should have followed along and not answered the phone with no one home as it's bad to get wrapped up in a phone with a life of it's own overall good episode a strange one though about a supernatural phone still it's suspenseful and it twists well at the end
<START> i saw this film when it first came out and hated it i just saw it again 27 years later i actually liked some of it although robin williams was totally wrong for the role what i remember most about hating the film is that it was almost the complete opposite of what i had understood when i read the book since i haven't re read it i can only give you my impressions from the past but i am sure of one thing the film is a paean to family life whereas in the book almost all traditional institutions including and perhaps especially marriage are shown to be strait jackets that we would be well rid of the only positive in the book is the wondrous nature of children something that only the very beginning and ending of the film really captures with that incredibly gorgeous baby floating in the air too bad williams doesn't have a tenth of his charm my low mark is therefore from the fact that the film misrepresents the book as a film on its own it fares better but only for a few key performances mary beth hurt is wonderful i think anyone watching it would fall in love with her and john lithgow as an ex football player who has had a sex change operation is fantastic he never once camped it up or made the character anything but commendable and as such his performance had an incredibly integrity i watched him closely during all of his scenes and never once was he anything except womanly nothing in his performance ever came near the performance of a drag queen and that made all the difference in fact of all the people in the film his is the only one which is irreproachable it is worth seeing this film only for his performance
<START> i picked this movie up because it sounded like a pretty decent flick and i've always been a fan of foreign films however for someone who likes movies i was surprised at how much i hate hate hated this movie br br although it does aim to expose the lives of young men in lima and to an extent it does the characters are hopelessly shallow and the audience winds up having absolutely no feelings whatsoever for them br br although the story chiefly revolves around m he rarely ever speaks and his dialouge is at best amazingly dry and dull br br warning some small spoilers br br basically the story revolves around a young man named m who has been searching for jobs but without success he does gain employment twice but quits because they're not for him when you're poor the last option you have is to be picky some amount of time is spent with his friends who's idea of fun is to rape a little 14 year old steal crappy tires off a piece of shit car for a dime sack of weed and several other slightly retarded activities br br m's friend with a plan to make 25 000 a piece and move to the us by running cocaine to miami when the drug lord gives them a job we're treated to an extremely lame scene of the three friends buying clothes at the mall with some music playing in the background we see them trying different clothes on like little girls given 200 to shop get there hair cut and then strutting off looking like slick gangsters one character carlos will from this point on wear sunglasses always even at night the day before they leave the leader of the group leaves to speak with the drug lord leaving m and his friend to be dumb they party up take several samples of the drugs they're suppose to run and break into thier old school acting like animals and smashing everything in sight br br the movie ends when m tries calling his girlfriend who hangs up on him the friends then proceed to set the pay phone on fire which brings out a bunch of kids and some old man with gun m and friend in charge of the drug run shows up on his motorcycle and wants them to leave with him now then he takes off by himself and gets shot by that old man the police show up and arrest m and his friends but not the man who shot the guy and cover thier dead friend up with newspapers as music plays and it fades to credits br br end spoiler br br i even watched this movie a second time hoping to see some subtle redeeming factor for it but i did not a complete waste of 102 minutes although i must give it credit for being straightforward and not shying away from disturbing elements the casting acting and overall direction still leaves much much much to be desired br br imho if you're interested in a movie that explores the issues this one was suppose to go rent city of god de deus instead avoid this trash at all costs you have been warned
<START> it's difficult to express how bad this movie is even in the 1950s when intellectual searching for the meaning of life was fashionable and beatnik rejection of physical comforts clean clothes haircuts etc was a common reaction to the smug middle class mores of both the usa and western europe this movie would have been a stinker the plot is a mishmash of several dei ex machina if that's the correct latin grammar the acting consists of deadpan stares broken by occasional hysterics by the male lead as well as the females the gratuitous view of catherine deneuve's or somebody's breasts are worthy of a budweiser commercial the repeated orchestra rehearsal in the abandoned building is i'm sure heavy with meaning in the director's mind but to me is just one more stupid symbol thrown into this meaningless movie i'm ranting because my time has been wasted watching this scam excuse for an art flic the scenery is beautiful and the sex scene is hot but underneath his clothes this king has no substance
<START> one of the best lackawanna blues br br great movie great cast great music this is one of those movies that is so good that when it is over you wish it would go on for another 90 minutes i will this one many times br br this is one of those movies that grabs you from the beginning and twist and slams you emotionally throughout the feature the cast is extraordinary without the faintest hint of anyone being in their role you get the sense that you're really there taking all this in a great deal of care was given in the sets costumes and music of the period the relationship between the characters we meet is both simple and complicated as the movie goes on but the steady performance of ms is so powerful that the movie ends before we've had our fill of the wonderful misfits to single out anyone other than nanny is an injustice because we have very good performances by great veteran actors including br br jeffery wright jimmy terrence howard and delroy lindo but it is marcus franklin macy gray and ms that makes this a wonderful experience br br the movie moves rapidly and is short by todays standards but it is without question one of the best movies you're going to see this year if you like good period pieces that will challenge you emotionally tug at your heart lift you joyfully and have you tapping your feet at the same time then this is the movie for you i've shown it to several friends and they all want my copy that says it all the movie is that good check it out for yourself br br 1 amsterdam holland
<START> the assignment is an outstanding thriller with several plot twists driven by character rather than star turns the need to stage special effects obligatory romance and endless car chases however there is a car chase in here and a dandy it is aidan quinn is wonderful as both the terrorist and the naval officer recruited to eliminate him it is rare that a second or third tier actor such as quinn is given an important starring role like this that carries a film usually such a role is given to an a list actor with box office draw which is probably why i never heard of this film before i saw it donald sutherland is great as the morally ambiguous somewhat creepy at times agent that recruits quinn ben kingsley is fine also as the israeli agent the plot is very complex and there are multiple story lines which converge in gradual fashion toward the end and not all at once as we're used to seeing the paranoia and claustrophobia of these type of thrillers is captured and portrayed with both moral ambiguity and frightening intensity the locations are convincing and effective the soundtrack is nothing special but rarely do we get all of the above mentioned qualities these days without dumb and or meaningless plot developments unconvincing star turns loud annoying music video type soundtracks a villain that hams it up and repeatedly a cast costumes and plot that cater mostly to an audience under 25 this is an outstanding thriller which most assuredly did not get its just due upon its release 1 2 of 4 stars
<START> this movie was so awful that i can't even describe it i was amazed that i even sat through this pile of trash i couldn't believe that a movie like this was even thought of it was a about a serial killer that like a chicken he doesn't just a couple of times he non stop through out the whole movie he even flaps his arms like a chicken which is even stupider than anything i have ever seen i couldn't believe this came out in 1990 i thought it came out in the early '80's or something then the daughter isn't very smart either because she was protecting the geek or man chicken the end just gets worse and is the worse ending i have ever seen this movie is just chicken s t i was laughing more than i was scared and i strongly suggest going out and getting a bucket of fried chicken instead of seeing this movie
<START> i have to say this is better than most syfy outings but that isn't saying much br br the plot is that someone buys a game that is made from the bones and skin of a dead witch from the spanish inquisition and nobody ever expects the spanish inquisition he and his friends play the game only to be interrupted halfway through when the friend who went on the beer run is killed in a way that the game predicted br br what then follows are a series of kills that are typical for a movie like this or any of the final destination movies it has the puzzle at the end and the interesting subplot with the cop who wants the game to bring back his family but otherwise it's just a mess
<START> what i came away with after watching this movie was a guilty conscience the film itself has a rather intriguing plot line and premise to it but unfortunately it is a movie that you cannot watch with out being bombarded with pornography if you plan on viewing this and have a moral problem with the degradation of the marital act for the viewing pleasure of an audience then you are making a big mistake this is not the type of movie with the token sex scene that you can skip on your dvd player near the beginning of the film baldwin's character is video taping his sexual exploits without the knowledge of his partner this tape and others like it continue to pop up throughout the movie at unpredictable times it appears that the film is attempting to make a statement about the dignity of women ironically in doing so they made multiple women into prostitutes i only gave it a 2 instead of a 1 because had they handled baldwin's promiscuity better it would have been an interesting film
