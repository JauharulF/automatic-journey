<START> not having heard of this film it came as a surprise when it was shown on cable recently gary ellis the gifted director of tough luck does wonders with the screen play written by bill and todd king the film involves the viewer from the start br br archie the young hustler at the center of this story has been involved in all kinds of petty crime in fact we witness a confrontation right at the beginning which makes him get out of new orleans as fast as he can he ends up in the carnival that is run by the mysterious ike archie falls for the woman he should have been wise to stay away from the result proves a fatal judgment for archie who then becomes the object of double crossing all around br br the director should be commended by the casting of norman reedus who obviously is loved by the camera in spite of his nature one feels for him because we know his heart is in the right place the beautiful is perfect as the exotic dancer who in spite of being lover entices archie into falling heads over heels with her armand assante is barely understandable with the thick accent he speaks during the first half of the film br br tough luck shows a new director gary ellis showing he will go to do bigger and better things because he knows what he is doing
<START> i love ustinov's distinctive literate narration and the photography is quiet nice we put the film on for our 3 5 year old who sort of wandered in and out of the room so for our first viewing we only saw about 1 3 of the movie and were quite charmed when we re watched sitting down for family time we were all mortified at the violence and life threatening situations the poor otter got into about halfway through the movie there's a rack of dead bloody furry animals lots of blood not just a little then at the end there's a wild struggle with a dog then blood clouds the water you'd think given the g rating that's all you'll see that they will imply one of the animals died nope they drag the carcass out of the water and show it plainly for several traumatizing seconds personally as an adult i love horror movies and am fine with violent movies ala scorsese cronenberg tarantino heck i love the ultra violent battle royale but those aren't kid movies and don't advertise themselves as such if you are deliberately raising your young ones to see the harsh realities of life for cute animals then this is the movie for you if you are like me and my wife though you might want to spare your child nightmares and avoid this one
<START> francis ford coppola's first film completed and released in 1969 was the last movie he made as a mostly unknown up and coming director before the godfather and is in stark contrast to both that film and the rest of his uneven career it's ostensibly a road movie involving a disconnected young woman bored with domestic life and pregnant with a child she isn't sure she wants fleeing the trappings her dull marriage and hitting the open road in search of freedom along the way she befriends a nice man an ex footballer player that suffered brain damage from a traumatic head injury played in unexpectedly subtle fashion by a young james caan and decides to him despite becoming frustrated with his simple ways her efforts to rid of him always fail either by guilt or chance and eventually lead her directly into the hands of an emotionally wounded cop robert duvall who has ideas of his own the plot is threadbare but coppola does a great job at detailing the emotional life of these characters and uses editing techniques to relay back story that were not at all common in american films of the time shots are simple yet extraordinarily effective conveying both the moody desolation of the open highway and the emptiness of american suburban life infused with a gentle melancholy provided by the film score coppola also deserves credit for addressing the issue of domestic discontent from a woman's point of view in the culturally turbulent 60's overall a fairly low key film that is not what audiences have come to expect from coppola but one that is a minor triumph in its own quiet unassuming way 7 5 10
<START> a young woman nicole jaimie alexander and her boyfriend jess joey become targets for a deranged serial killer after stopping for a at a remote road side rest stop br br what might have been an effectively scary chiller in more competent hands turns out to be a confusing ill considered mess under the sloppy direction of john who also wrote the screenplay there is a good deal of juicy violence a brief smattering of nudity and confident performances from the cast but the silly script leaves the viewer with so many unanswered questions one cannot help but feel disappointed br br on the surface the film plays out like a standard clichÃ© ridden 'killer on the loose' movie but an ex writer for the x files throws in some subtle supernatural elements which suggest that his aim was something else entirely a ghost story with the rest stop acting as home to a vengeful spectre out to punish sinners br br by reading up on the film checking out viewers' theories here on imdb and watching the extras on the dvd certain plot elements begin to make a little more sense although even with the advantage of extra information there are still many questions left unanswered in my opinion any film that requires this much investigation to make itself only partially understood is not particularly a good one
<START> i was wandering through my local library browsing vhs tapes when i saw a movie that made my mouth drop i have been hoping to see this movie again it's been over 22 years since i saw it cable movie channel around 78 79 i had recalled a good many of the details in particular my son who is 4 and i watched it br br he agreed with me that was not nice and the best way for me to describe it was that he didn't love tom he accepted that it was amazing that i still recalled some of the songs too they had stuck in my head for 22 years which means they had to have some memorable ness eh br br it's a good child's movie with parental guidance in case of questions about what children had to go through that were not nobility society in the time frame this is what all the children faced daily except for a few lucky ones and while we try to disney coat movies making them more pc for children these days it doesn't mean that cruelty didn't exist or even still doesn't i enjoyed the animation it wasn't disney no i don't think don bluth touched a paintbrush on this movie br br there's a lot going for it though david t plays two roles i really like him james m does too the themselves are cute you feel sorry for tom and root for him then billie herself is extraordinary in the multi role part she's playing it's as if her eyes are magickal i'm a huge fan of woo tw and company and looking forward to hp and i filed this along with those kind of movies yes he jumps in the water but not because of suicide he jumped because he trusted the lady in black she'd been appearing to him all along br br i think it's a good movie if you have kids pick up a rental copy if you happen to locate a buy able copy let me know where ian liked it br br dee
<START> although never say never again has a weak sound track it is far superior to its competition at the time octopussy never say never again is an updated and improved version of thunderball connery's least popular bond flick is rich with clever dialogue wit smarts sex appeal and one of the best and most convincing bad guys in the entire bond series in addition features a very talented young and beautiful kim basinger british comedy fans will also recognize the actor known as mr bean i wouldn't trade any of the moore pictures for this one however the earlier connery bond efforts with the exception of thunderball are superior br br
<START> billy and jade had a very close relationship that went to far one evening even though billy was sleeping with mother jade has to deal with the fact that her mother may never know and that it will never happen again billy is played by rob estes who couldn't have looked better lifetime tv has made another movie that everyone is bound to like
<START> i see hundreds of student films this is tops james cox is a fantastic director he moves the camera tells the story and uses music in a way that is far advanced for his years no wonder he got a feature from this film br br
<START> oh dear the bbc is not about to be knocked off its pedestal for absorbing period dramas by this one i agree this novel of jane austens is the difficult to portray particularly to a modern audience the heroine is hardly a elizabeth bennet even edmund is not calculated to cause female hearts to skip a beat however i must say i was hoping for an improvement on the last and was sadly disappointed the basic story was preserved but the dialogue was so altered that all that was jane austen's tone manner feeling wit depth was diluted if not lost if some past adaptions may be seen as dated the weakness of this one must be that it is too modern 'his life is one long party' the cast was generally adequate but i think billie piper was the wrong choice it needed someone more restrained i gained no impression of hidden depths beneath a submissive exterior she was more like a frolicking child i see i must wait for the bbc to weave its magic once again
<START> i have decided to flush this show from my memory down the toilet of bad tv show into the obscurity of forgetful disappointing pointless garbage tv show hell br br the skyler guy who is the host star creator of this show is boring uninteresting unbelievable not particularly good looking and not at all funny in short why is this guy on tv and especially why is he in a comedy show when he's not funny pretending to be a professional con man when he definitely is nothing but an obvious pretender others have said it here already but this guy is a total fake and fraud if you believe any of these cons i think you should seriously consider going to get your head checked because they're all fake and the ones that might possibly be true are so pointless like spending all day to con someone out of giving you an average meal at a restaurant seriously this guy needs to go away glad this show got canned
<START> this movie was in one word terrible first of all the people who invented that thingie that puts you in the tv are slightly insane secondly the three teens are so obsessed with the show it's scary the movie was stupid and no effort or thought was put into it
<START> boogie nights is perhaps one of the greatest examples any would be filmmaker should take a long hard look at sure you could spend loads of quality time reviewing the from hitchcock to scorsese but lets follow suit for the modern generation and study half heartedly br br where to begin i suppose one could look at the film as simply a story perhaps even docudrama which focuses on the late 1970's porn industry and what an industry it was the other half could focus on the incredible detail one brillant filmmaker can achieve simply by using polyester and ahem rubber but honestly boogie nights brings back the pure no shi in your face kind of cinema i haven't experienced since the film greats of the 1970's ironic or stroke of genius the story is full of richly detailed characters all of which you either can relate too love or hate but the impact is clear you are feeling something for them among the characters the two performances which stand out are burt reynolds as director jack horner and mark wahlberg as eddie adams dirk diggler julianne moore is also brillant as is heather graham but if i focus on any one actor it would have to be john c reilly john's performance is a perfect balance of comedic timing and character driven emotion i'm a sucker for the line ever see the movie star wars people say i look like han solo anyway the look of the film is incredible the director of photography and director writer producer have come up with a vibrant colour and flashy style that compares to martin scorsese and stanley kubrick in terms of his perfection of his craft but with creating his own unique look and pushing the edge with the longest single shot ever seen that being the new year's party sequence br br the music like in any great film is a character of its own at times it consumes oneself with sorrow or grief but mainly its all about fun dancing and having a good time the spirit of the 1970's ok back to the performances br br burt reynolds plays the character of jack horner a porn director who feels the burden of what the future of film means to his genre the awful transition from shooting on film to recording on magnetic tape the lose of his art as it were and the changes in mentality to the people he works with adds the perfect blend of and sexual bravado needed for the character for all those individuals who have seen burton's planet of the apes pay no attention to the performance of wahlberg in that film rent boogie nights and see what a difference a good script can make br br julianne moore plays the would be mother to all and with that comes the torment and anguish she feels as life imitates art and she loses all those close to her heather graham is the eye candy but later holds her own and steals some of the scenes from even the great mr reynolds himself each character is multidimensional rich with life and performed by actors that seem to be picture perfect for the part br br the film itself is often funny tragic exciting and provides a uncompromising look into the lifestyle of the fast pace 1970's it makes no excuses and tells no lies and offers the audience a trip back but even more importantly the movie gives us a grand example of how films should be made and a new director whose bold visions bring back art in film
<START> more is yet another addition into the countless pile of 60's druggie trippy junk avoid at all cost terrible acting equally moribund script the only thing to enjoy is pink floyd's wonderful soundtrack which is too good for stereotypical waste like this
<START> the man with bogart's face sets it self up to mine the viewers nostalgia for the late 30's late 40's film era it fails miserably for several reasons first sacchi while looking reasonably like bogart and even speaking like him on and using his mannerisms completely lacks any of bogart's charisma or acting ability this is really apparent whenever sacchi is not clearly imitating a scene from one of bogart's films second the film does not have the first rate character actors bogart was able to work with there are no peter lorre's or sydney greenstreet's in this one folks sure we are treated to performances by victor olivia hussey and george raft amongst others but they just aren't of the same caliber or aren't given enough screen time or are miscast third the attempts at modern humor all fall through all of the underwear jokes having marlowe almost never remove that damn hat and trench coat even though bogart would have etc just aren't funny and really pull down this film fourth i've never heard a goofier theme song this side of mitchell finally the film's false reverence for bogart and other classic actors work is truly irritating bogart almost never played a straight hero on those occasions he was a hero he played complicated characters this movie makes bogart out to be a trigger happy moralistic do gooder while this may have been true about some film characters bogart's characters rarely fit that bill it's movies like this that make people to the cinema of the past think that all of it is hokey good guy beats the bad guys and gets the girl crap with low production values
<START> when kristy swanson gets an attack of the guilts about what she does she wants out unfortunately madsen is her immediate superior in a company where giving two weeks notice ain't an option br br as a teen killing vampires kristy did a very good job the valley girl image seemed to fit but as an assassin on the run well keep running kristy run run far away this film is not a concept that hasn't been done before but it has been done better br br i didn't want to watch the rest of this film but i felt i should if i wanted to give a review of this movie i've always liked madsen and his character was a bit predictable but this movie was definitely a waste of time both to watch and make no wonder it never got released theatrically
