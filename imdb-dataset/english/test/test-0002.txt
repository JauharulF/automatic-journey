<START> tim robbins did a masterful job directing this film i say this because he avoided convention and clichÃ© he also oversaw superb performances from susan sarandon who won an oscar for her role and sean penn even more amazing robbins doesn't patronize he just tells the story and lets the events play on the viewer's mind this is so effective because it allows the viewer to form his own opinions on the death penalty one of the most controversial subjects of our time without being unfairly manipulated in either direction i can't recommend this film enough 9 10
<START> if you expect that this movie is full of action and grabbing you from the start then don't watch it but if you like those kind of meditative movies which stick in your mind for a while until you get the details then you will love it now don't get me wrong there is action and there are things going on just not in the usual way br br basically the plot is in a post apocalyptic world where anyone fights in his or their way for survival in this fight they lost the ability to speak i don't want to write more to not spoil the movie for you but trust me if you like sf authors like or or even some from orson scott card you will love this movie
<START> if you have never read the classic science fiction novel this mini series is based on it may actually be good unfortunately if you are a fan of the book you probably won't be able to watch more than the first hour or two all of the political intrigue has been taken out of the film the most important scenes from the book have been taken out characters motivations have been changed completely and words from the wrong characters mouths where in the novel paul was a teen age boy with incredible political skill and a great understanding of the way the world worked in this film he is hot headed and and frustrated avoid this movie at all costs
<START> if this is not heavily featured on every list of what not to watch it should only be because those keeping that particular list are not aware of its existence which as long as that remains so is the acceptable alternative i'm not kidding you this is a bad movie joseph meeker returns from the dead with various vague undefined supernatural powers the most employed of which would seem to be appearing in new increasingly comical looking and ridiculous and never scary or creepy in general when this goes for the latter of those it winds up just being bizarre and attempts at the former just don't work period outfits and stereotypes archetypes and he is portrayed by david keith whom i respect in well at least daredevil doing a more often than not terribly inconsistent which could also have to do with script and often over the top performance a character or two have personalities so unbelievably irritating that they're painful to watch the editing thinks it's considerably more clever than it really is and what on earth was with the red tint for the flashbacks cinematography oh dear framing coverage effective use of angle that one could be attributed some to editing too perhaps please guys stop me when i say something you've ever heard about the existence of as far as the technical side goes this is a pretty lousy excuse for something more worthwhile to put in the projector than film but why stop there the plot is just poor the basic idea's been done and it's been done so much better than this the crow would be one the way it's told is gimmicky and while there is some explanation behind the flashbacks it still doesn't satisfy pacing is about non existent the lead is distinctly unlikeable and there's more personality in a barn door not to mention that those are also considerably less wooden kelly and thomas ian nicholas what in the name of all that is good and just pun intended are you doing in this you were already funny before this on the drew carey show nicholas well i haven't seen you in anything preceding american pie but if nothing else you were funny later on and in those productions the amusement was intentional dialog is the less said the better language is unrestrained and tends to be stupid the violence is shoddily done and they don't even seem to care to try to hide it hinting at it might have been the smarter strategy characters don't get me started why spend so much energy on portraying unexciting at times utterly illogical events the more you think about this the worse it gets it's not even passable as a bad horror flick or a b movie it may very well pass through the rest of the alphabet and go further still it couldn't scare you on the scariest day of your life if it had an electrified scaring machine i recommend this only to people who want to disprove how bad this is and don't say i didn't warn ya 1 10
<START> fairly appalling enterprise suggests welsh to be an infantile artist helplessly drawn to the violent milieu he knows best but unable to resist vacuous rooted in banal fantasy the first story is a ham fisted meaningless trudge with a b movie sci fi premise the second achieves some poignancy but only via the outrage inducing surplus of humiliation visited on its central character the third and most risible seems to aspire to being a dislocated sequel to child's play the direction is consistently clueless all whirling sound and fury a slave to the extreme unpleasantness of the environment suffocating in an ill chosen music score and in indifferently flashy acting this is sheer stupidity masquerading as a guerilla sensibility as arbitrary and hollow as the abstract images that link the three sections
<START> this is about one of the worst movies i'd ever seen it's not the worst though manos the hands of fate holds that honor br br this movie has a lot of problems to begin this whole movie is a cheap rip off of the conan movies there's the babe in a skimpy dress wearing a the quiet asian warrior the cookie cutter bad guy the almost mindless and so on there's lots of continuity errors in this film some of the dumbest errors i've ever seen are in this film br br fortunately when i watched this film i seen the mst3k version joel and the make the film watchable otherwise i probably would've turned it off five minutes into the film
<START> this movie is certainly one of the greatest films ever made it is a story told in a steady pace told mostly not by words but by cinematic means of expression perfect blend of spectacular special effects and classical music bring to life creations of human imagination in both realistic and poetical way the story itself is quite simple at a first glance as the title implies there is an archetypal journey a motive repeated for thousands of years this motive was always used not only to depict a trip in space and time and beyond but also had rich philosophic meaning the film is a poetical contemplation of most exciting eternal questions it is not just an odyssey of a person it is an odyssey of our species the film is great by itself yet in my case the impression from it will always be mingled with that from the book i've read it at the age of 10 really not thinking about problems like 'what is the relationship between evolution of humankind and development of human but the impression was great enough to make me fall for entire genre of science fiction br br the day i learned got only special effects oscar and was not even nominated for the best picture was the day when award' completely became two words meaning nothing to me
<START> mani sir as usual brings out another amazing story with such an amazing relationship between parents and child is brought out in a beautiful fashion mani sir as usual without much special effects and not much outdoor shoots in fact this was the only movie where he went outside india ever that too just to sri lanka mani's class is written all over the movie and to add to it music which is just amazing is one of my most fav songs ever maddy who is what he is in the film industry has impressed a lot too starting from to to to guru mani has showed to the world what a versatile actor maddy is has been really good too she has showed that she can act too in non glamorous and character roles in all an amazing movie sad that the tamil public could not appreciate this gr8 movie and it bombed at the box office
<START> oh god it could be a very interesting film and in fact it is i would have like to give it a 5 but i give a 2 for my vote why i saw it in a theatre see this film on dvd or on tv the shooting is really really poor it keeps shaking all the time in a completely tasteless framing br br its really painful to see this very interesting film in a cinema you got quickly seasick and you have to make some huge effort not to puke on your neighbor 's seat br br it's really a shame 'cos the story is edited in a non linear way which is quite rare and a very good idea for a documentary br br watch this at home
<START> this documentary was boring and quite stupid br br i mean the documentary maker obviously does not even know what how darwinian evolution works it is a theory and the name is just plain dumb reading a college biology text book could have told the documentary maker what darwinism really is darwinism is a good theory but evil if it is done as politics br br also there was no real evidence in this documentary just interviewing some people no expert testimonies and shady leads br br the documentary was also boring i mean it could have been edited down to 35 minutes and then it would have been lots better br br there are a lot better documentaries than this this was not worth watching you can get better information from wikipedia d don't waste your money and time
<START> in 1927 a young man alone in a single engine aeroplane flew non stop from roosevelt field in new york across the entire north atlantic ocean to le field in paris a distance of three thousand six hundred and ten miles in this triumph of mind body and spirit charles a lindbergh influenced the lives of everyone on earth for in the 33 hours and thirty minutes of his flight the air age became a reality this is the story of that flight br br billy wilder adapts from charles a pulitzer prize winning novel of the same name in what is re creation of historical 1927 solo flight boosted by a considerably strong lead performance from james stewart himself a pilot as lindberg and containing an intelligent screenplay from wilder and wendell spirit of st louis is a sincerely well told story br br in what at times threatens to become a monotonous film wilder keeps it ticking over by using flashbacks to life after the nicely told build up to the event such as the peril being realised as and go missing never to be found whilst attempting the same trip in reverse we learn stuff like how he come to buy his first plane and his work with the flying circus this is all relative to understanding the man and his obvious passion for flying this also helps to give us a complete picture of lindbergh thus putting us with him in his isolated cockpit as he undertakes this dangerous journey battling isolation his only company is a fly and chronic tiredness it's here where stewart perfectly portrays devotion to the task aided by a terrific score from franz waxman and academy award nominated effects by louis wilder's movie turns out to be an engaging human interest story that got a thoroughly professional production 7 10
<START> little dieter needs to fly is another in the remarkable body of werner herzog's filmic work that is without peer having recently rewatched it on dvd nearly a decade after its initial us release in 1997 it has lost none of its power and one can see its influence on documentaries as diverse as herzog's own recent grizzly man and errol morris's academy award winning the fog of war like the former it details in its far too brief 74 minutes the life of an interesting american like the latter it gives a peek at a side of war that few see yes we see the violence and the heroism but as the fog of war brought us into the mind of one of last century's foremost this film allows us a peek at the life of a grunt who is captured by the enemy tortured and ultimately triumphs except in no way shape nor form is the film as simplistic nor upbeat as my brief description of it nor is little dieter needs to fly's titular subject dieter and immigrant german who survived the of the nazis we find out as example that in his hometown in the black forest his grandfather was the only man not to vote for hitler and suffered brutally for that stand post world war two germany and his own imprisonment at the hands of the vietcong when his air force jet was shot down over on february 1st while the title of the film and the idea of passion for becoming a pilot stirred by the impression allied fighter planes made on him when they razed his town as a child make one believe that is the central subject of the film this is not true the subject is survival or more precisely his human will all human will the details of romantic life are too hollywood and staid an aspect to interest herzog nor is the fact that he won a purple heart medal of honor the d f c and the navy cross that thing which pushed to survive so much and remain such a relatively upbeat man although there are glimpses of darker sides is what is at the center of this film and all of herzog's canon dieter 'distant barbaric dream' of his past is fully ripened herzog country and the use of a chant e during many jungle scenes among other excellent touches in the score show herzog is perhaps along with only martin scorsese the best manipulator of image and music in film long may he merge
<START> having been a godzilla fan for many years gamera was to me a cheap knockoff to capitalize on the success of toho's 1 kaiju star attack of the monsters was for me at the time 1975 an almost painful viewing experience br br last weekend i attended the annual godzilla fest known as g fest where carl craig one of the stars of gamera vs made an appearance of course they featured this movie it was one of the most hilarious bad movies ever made of course you have to be in the right frame of mind to watch it in one scene for example the boy scouts held prisoner on board the alien space craft manage to escape by distracting the not too bright aliens when they realize they ve been duped one of them says that's funny i think those kids lied to us not even plan nine from outer space can boast that kind of dialog br br this may not be godzilla or even gamera 3 but this one is a decent enough time waster if you watch it in the right frame of mind br br however if you want top quality kaiju entertainment check out the recently released gamera 3 br br rating 1 2 out of
<START> i saw this 1997 movie because i am a fan of lorenzo lamas and of his father the late fernando lamas in my opinion lorenzo looked his best in this film mostly due to his hairstyle and the preppy wardrobe that were flattering to him br br as the plot progressed i realized the movie was more than just entertainment or a reason to see a favorite actor the story was about a ring of serial killers and the attempts of law enforcement to investigate the ring and bring the members to justice there was adequate suspense and i believe the violence was necessary to relate the story to the viewer br br at the end of the film i was shocked to learn the film is the true account of horrendous murders that occurred in utah furthermore lorenzo and his leading lady were portraying actual fbi agents who solved the disappearances of many young women and contributed to the apprehension of the ring i believe the film is worthwhile as it informs the public about the dangers and capabilities of the criminal element
<START> uk born australian helmer alex calls for attention with his strange necessitating a meticulous read visually stunning modern love 2006 following the steps of a man incapable of controlling a drastic personality change spurred by the death of a close relative pic offers a fascinating examination of human psychology distributed by accent film australia br br john mark constable his wife emily victoria hill and their son edward william arrive in a small southern town to take care of his deceased uncle's don barker property while emily and edward check into a local hotel john begins to question the locals about uncle tom's death some say that he committed suicide some are unwilling to talk puzzled john comes up with a theory of his own uncle tom is alive and well hiding in the nearby bushes br br if not for the occasional lines of dialog used to ease its heavy atmospheric tone modern love could have been easily mistaken for a sokurov film shot with a 16mm camera its washed out color scheme is strangely evocative of the russian director's reflective forays into human agony perhaps it isn't a coincidence that it was at the moscow international film festival where modern love had its premiere br br looking under the surface of this unique collage of intoxicating visuals however reveals a slightly different picture while sokurov's films tend to remain painfully intimate to a point where they intentionally detach the main protagonists from the surrounding environment by blurring everything into a large splash of the director's preferred yellow modern love very much feeds off the australian countryside john's gradual psychological transformation is dependent on it and the more the story progresses the more it becomes obvious that nature was an integral part of vision br br in sokurov's the second circle a young man returns to the russian countryside to bury his deceased father in the shack where the old man once lived everything is covered with dust he gathers the few old clothes scattered around and places the body of his father in a coffin then he bids goodbye and buries it the rest of the film is a prolonged reflection on the collapse of the soviet system the loneliness and dissatisfaction many were left dealing with br br in modern love somewhat ironically love is nowhere to be seen on the contrary it is pain loneliness and dissatisfaction with modernity that suddenly invade john's life unlike the second circle however here the main protagonist has the opportunity to re embrace his modern life his wife and son await him yet he walks away slowly but surely the present begins to disintegrate under the weight of a somewhat confusing past br br i doubt intended for modern love to be so strikingly similar to what sokurov did in the second circle yet the pacing and in particular the puzzling framing are precisely what transforms this film into a near meditative experience a difficult and enormously brittle approach to deconstructing human psychology the two directors have mastered to perfection br br mark constable delivers a top notch performance as john adding even greater depth to his highly challenging character his facial expressions are outstanding both victoria hill and william match perfectly with their performances tense visual style
