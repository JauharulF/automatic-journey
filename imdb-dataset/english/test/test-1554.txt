<START> i only watched this because i saw a couple of good reviews for this so i was expecting at the very least a half way cheesy movie doesn't even deliver that there are so many problems with this flick that i don't even know where to start so i will list a couple of main issues once again spoiler warning just read them it'll save you the trouble of watching this later br br one this movie starts out with and often mentions the mythical folklore of both celeste noir a witch who the main character claims she is the reincarnation of and the mid or something like that an evil man with a big smile who cuts people open with hooks and sells their innards in pies i liked that it was a cute concept anything to do with pies is simply enjoyable but then you watch the movie and it's all about this idiot girl and her boyfriend and what was the deal with him was he psychic did he have powers why did he keep seeing visions that even the so called 'witch' didn't notice and them meeting their insane family not really insane they just argue a lot that's what most of this movie is arguing and they barely touch on the supposed myth ever again except in a couple of confusing scenes that you can't make heads or tails of br br in one scene the main witch related character wanders off and does some sort of ritual by candle light it seemed rather important but absolutely nothing happened after she did it it just wasted more of my time br br and who the hell was that guy with his dog you see him walking towards the house from the very start of the movie with that evil red eyed dog and then he finally gets there and gets killed what the hell was he the mid was his dog possessed did someone kill the dog they never really showed that also any scene involving the vicar was completely pointless and only served to weakly explain the lame ending it was like they had all these interesting character ideas and they all went nowhere the boyfriend who obviously had some sort of powers but never explains them the grandmother who appeared to also have some sort of witch powers but never used them the vicar who ok never mind there really was no point for his existence at all and then there was and her stupid amulet could she really do magic or did she just use it to reflect light and blind people this was a complete waste of time and the only reason i give it two stars at all is because a is kinda cute and b it mentioned pies save yourself the money of renting this and dear god don't even think about buying it unless wasting money is a new fad
<START> a young doctor and his wife are suddenly expecting a child both are disturbed about a two hour memory lapse on the night of conception interesting twist on an hackneyed story very good f x and interesting editing jillian is outstanding in a cast that features arnold vosloo wilford brimley and brad dourif brimley brings normalcy to the outlandish kudos to director brian yuzna
<START> this brass eye special was swamped by complaints more on that later when it was broadcast in 2001 following a national debate around a possible sarah s law following the abduction and murder of school girl sarah payne in fact it s scheduling was delayed while phil collins took legal advice after he found out he d been fooled by the show s maker chris morris into a starting a campaign entitled sense br br if truth be told this show is probably more remembered for the controversy than the content which is in very poor taste but i do confess that i laughed out loud the edition centres around and how society treats both them and their victims chris morris plays the presenter who tells the audience that an infamous paedophile has been launched into space then confesses that an eight year old child has accidentally been placed into the capsule along with the paedophile cue the child s frightened screams like i said very poor taste br br other highlights of the show include dr fox giving a scientific lecture that share an identical nervous system to crabs no one knows this but it s a scientific fact labour mp barbara follet giving a public warning about equipment put on their genitals while surfing the net and kate thornton warning viewers that can send gas through the internet which makes young children to sexual predators including one victim who was once a shy innocent child and who now has the sexuality of a sixty year old colonel morris also shows a police officer in the child protection squad a serious of photos wanting to know if they re classed as obscene the photos included barbie surrounded by a marital aids and a composite photo featuring a young boys head a dog s body and an erect penis that could only have belonged to john holmes hey i never said this show was tasteful did i br br it s impossible to mention without the hypocritical fall out that surrounded it where politicians childrens organizations and policemen rushed to condemn the show for making fun of a very serious subject the show was poor taste despite me laughing all the way through it but it s a biting satire perhaps the critics should take a long hard look in the mirror where a liberal elite allows convicted paedophile slime to walk around the streets of britain before they criticise a mere tv show for tensions
<START> i find herzog's documentary work to be very uneven fata morgana a companion piece of sorts to lessons of darkness lacks not only the harrowing spectacle but mostly the discerning eye of an author it is by comparison amateur looking aimless pans left and right across the desert the kind of which you would expect from any german tourist equipped with a handycam the camera left running from the window of a car picking up all kinds of meaningless images wire fences derelict buildings and patches of dirt going through the lens in haphazard order intercut with shots of sand dunes at one point herzog encounters a group of starved cattle rotting away in the sand yet the image is presented much like you and me would perhaps worse the camera peering hand held from one cattle to the next for a documentary that attempts to be a visual feast a hypnotic surreal excursion in uncharted landscapes it lacks the visual orchestration and conviction of a disciplined author it's all over the place half hearted and tedious mayan creation myths recited in voice over then some other text herzog fancied for literature it's not until near the end that fata morgana jumps alive through a series of bizarre encounters first with a man and a woman playing music in a room the man singing in a distorted voice through a mic both of them apathetic in their task a man holding up a turtle a group of old people trying to get out of some holes in the ground other than that this one seems to have very little of substance to offer or visual splendor to offer
<START> while i am a long time shatner fan since we used to watch trek re runs over the dinner hour in the early '70s i cannot think of any possible reason why he wanted to do this film whether for personal development or business reasons did he lose a bet br br as a movie fan i like to appreciate the bad films along with the great ones but shoot or be shot doesn't have any flair or funny bits unintentional or not br br while unrated there were no objectionable scenes blink or you'll miss it nudity cartoonish gunfire violence with the endless bullet gunfights so one is led to believe that the producers merely wanted to save the fee required to get the mpaa to rate it this will make its way to cable with barely 10 seconds edited out br br of the eight people that were in the theatre with us four of them left mid way muttering statements like this is stupid br br shatner plays an escaped mental patient who has been denied release because he views himself as a screenwriter the examination board stamps his request insane he runs into a group of z grade moviemakers who shoot on video because its 80 cheaper than film and decides to force them to shoot his script at gunpoint there are a few minor subplots that develop some of the secondary characters but for the most part that is the whole movie br br if you want to spend 90 minutes on a shatner art film see free enterprise instead it is a much better film
<START> remember that friend in college who always insisted you rent the weirdest movie possible this is the movie he would have made if he'd had the chance br br i wish i could tell you exactly what sea of dust was about it pretends to be the story of a doctor who gets sucked into weird goings on in the black forest he goes there to help but ends up being caught between two young women both of whom he seems to have a thing for but that's just scratching the surface this is the kind of movie where things just randomly happen and not nice thing people are constantly being whipped and stabbed there's a pair of creepy little girls who appear to have walked out of the shining tom savini is some kind of imaginary religious figure who decides he doesn't want to be imaginary anymore he's got a plan to take over the world by sharing jesus suffering br br on some level this is a movie about sex it's one without nudity which was a disappointment but there's no mistaking the intent on another whole level it's a paradise unexpected stuff happens so often that it stops being unexpected by the time the doctor travels through his girlfriend's birth canal to be reborn you'll just chalk it up to the crazy nature of the flick br br on the down side the film is pretty wordy some of the points are hammered home over and over if you're watching it with a bunch of stoned friends this might prove an asset
<START> being a 90's child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons br br i don't know why early 90's cartoons had something special i don't know if it was the uncertainty atmosphere a generational change whatever but tiny toons kept the 90's vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created br br the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers br br the characters were all funny and had the of not having a true lead character every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead
<START> this has to be the best movie of all time in my opinion it really taught me when i watched when i was 10 in 2000 that the freedom of a being a child slips away sooner then we expect it to also joseph has to be my favorite actor ever and i think that him and elijah wood did a great job in the roles of brothers this movie is quite sad and some people don't understand the ending but the story itself is quite incredible the thought of a poor 7 year boy bobby getting abused by drunken step father is horrible and what the two boys do about this is sad and important my favorite part of the movie is when tom hanks older mike lists the 7 things of being a kid that are lost to the grownup world however there are some parts that could have been done better in this movie such as the casting of the mother lorraine who i think is a horrible actor the king played his role well since it is a hard role to play joseph and elijah definitely were the stars of the movie i couldn't believe how well they played victims of a abusing stepfather being the age that they were 7 and 9 but overall i recommend this movie to anyone who loves great child actors and a great movie
<START> my original comment on this particular title was deleted by a imdb user or the staff only because i just happen to dislike this film to the point i had to sincerely write what i felt after seeing this poor excuse for a film where's my freedom of word br br obviously this movie was made by students 'cos so lame and amateurish it felt of course even they have to start from somewhere the script was incoherent mess and so was the acting with low budget and b class actors what can you expect there's some cgi in places so poor it looks like done with an old pc some may say this is sort of an alien clone only this time it's dracula in a vintage costume who's sucking the other cast dry one by one the sets are unconvincing cheap and small boiler rooms although the story takes place in a large space craft br br it would be fun to know what the stars erika eleniak casper van dien coolio and udo kier thought about the film after it was released coolio must be the worst rapper turned actor ever br br it was a total waste of my time and money don't know why i even bothered to rent this flick honestly i just hate this film with uwe boll's house of the dead dracula 3000 shares the questionable honor of being the worst movie ever well i've seen even worse than these two br br avoid any other film will do better
<START> i did and i lost two and a half hours of my life that i can never regain again br br i honestly have no idea what the critics and fans see in this movie and that's not because i can't appreciate art i love a good film with profound messages brilliant cinematography and great directing br br this film just isn't one of them br br my main complaint about this film is that it's so horribly slow paced to the point of boring its audience to death on the other hand sequences of dialog go by too quickly and there's not enough exposition to let people who haven't read the book know what's going on my mother had mercy on me and explained everything before i watched it would it have killed them to hire a narrator at least for the beginning and the end br br let me break it down for you spoilers throughout br br for the first two minutes you are treated to a black screen with no music waiting for the actual movie to begin br br for the following minute and a half you see several pictures of sunrises and savanna landscapes like the audience couldn't figure out how to set the scene unless they saw the establishing shot three or four times br br the next eleven minutes are occupied with the grunting monkeys they fight see the monolith fight some more pommel things with a bone supposedly they are prehistoric men whose evolution is being influenced by the singing not that you could tell if you hadn't read the book br br finally we get into space only to be subjected to twelve minutes of ships slowly spinning to the blue danube waltz a pretty quick tempo ed waltz as i understand yet here it feels absolutely agonizing at last we get some innocuous dialog and rather cryptic exposition about the government not letting people land on the moon we are left to wonder about this for fourteen more minutes of blue danube and spinning ships and neat camera tricks with anti gravity br br next comes four minutes of watching a ship travel over the surface of the moon and dock at a space station we get a little more exposition in a board room scene that follows then we're back outside traveling at a snail's pace over the moon a second monolith is revealed again filling our ears with that horrible ringing i had no idea that was an actual piece of music the monolith does its little light show and then the plot jumps forward br br seven minutes of watching the ship to jupiter travel by this point in time my brains had turned into mush could it be moving any slower maybe it's realistic to portray it as such but we still don't need to see five or six different shots of the same thing to grasp the concept of its realism let me tell you about this realism thing i cheered when the secondary astronaut character died not because i'm a sadist and like watching people die but because after five minutes i was just so annoyed at the sound of his darn breathing i'm supposed to care about this character feel when he dies instead i found myself waiting for blissful silence whatever way it came br br anyway now we get to the most interesting part of the film the part with hal forget dave the stick of wood protagonist the real star of the show is that coldly impersonal chillingly villainous ruthlessly merciless bad guy of a computer he's great and the open the pod bay doors sequence is wonderful but it's too short and it's not long before the director once again lapses into too long goings on br br four minutes for hal to die and die he does slowly painfully losing intelligence with every minute voice getting lower and slower singing daisy daisy all with a low and constant hissing that becomes just as annoying as the heavy breathing br br seven minutes of flying colors as dave enters the monolith seven i could feel my brains melting and dripping out of my ears seven full minutes of absolutely nothing but some guy's whacked out psychedelic version of space travel again with that thrice cursed chorus we got the idea at the beginning of the sequence why drag it out so long unless he wanted to make lsd users go psychotic and have flashbacks br br i'm not even going to try to explain the ending mostly because i don't quite get it myself supposedly he's in an alien research laboratory and they're teaching him deep and profound things while he watches himself getting older and older and then they send him back to earth as some kind of cosmic celestial space baby none of this comes across in the film for all you know it's just a sequence of images with no purpose or plot whatsoever a lot of the movie felt that way br br the first time i tried watching this movie i gave up halfway through the second time i suffered through this sore excuse for a film it was to help my sister time the sequences to see how long they lasted it's that boring br br call this crummy film art if you wish i wouldn't i've seen more interesting art in the local museum and i am never subjecting myself to this kind of suffering ever again
<START> in another of the dreadful horror films i seem so masochistically attracted to we have a bunch of friends stuck in a haunted house slowly being killed one by one thanks to a horde of zombies that spurt yellow blood and have very bad dental problems the first 45 minutes is all talk however and considering the young thespians cannot act their way out of a paper bag and are given the most banal dialogue ever to dispassionately recite this is especially painful to sit through if you manage to stay awake through that nonsense things don't get any better with bad make up galore and cheesy bargain basement not so special effects as for the conclusion well what's the betting that the old timer who warned them against going to the spooky mansion in the first place will turn up and save the day for the last two survivors a boy and a girl of course with his mystical powers please life is too short for these kind of movies donate the time you would otherwise have spent watching this tripe helping out the community do a couple of shifts in a soup kitchen or something you'll feel you've actually done something productive with your life and you won't have put money into the pockets of studios who churn out irredeemable rubbish such as this br br unfortunately it's already too late for me now where did i put that copy of 1 10
<START> released as king boxer in the u k br br this film was essentially the first kung fu film to go on general release in the u k many of us had through kurosawa's astonishingly gritty and involving dramas and were used to oriental film being beautifully shot and lit with somewhat restrained pacing all in all like through an album of very fine still photographs that just happened to be moving br br along come run run shaw and co with their widescreen home movie production values and astonishing ripe for parody dubbing and all the rules have changed king boxer was the first in through the door leaving a clearly marked trail for others to follow with their feet planted firmly on top of the blazed footsteps br br in spite of hokey plots pantomime acting cheesy jump cuts and spaghetti western style snap stepped zooms this film was marvellous gorgeous without being opulent and with the most brilliant fight choreography ever to grace a screen we loved the sickening violence the anguish the testosterone the martial artists among us found some of the techniques fascinating if flamboyant and oftentimes silly it was so very different from the japanese stuff we all knew and it had lovely acrobatic grace that perfectly complemented the sickening violence and bloodstained floors delightful br br the king lear scene was at the time quite a milestone in schlock you cruel bastards my now it's rather less shocking but still a bit of a gut br br we didn't notice that any females in sight were absolutely one dimensional after seeing more films of the genre it now stands out like a sore thumb but at the time it didn't matter br br this film defined what would rapidly become the kung fu movie clichÃ©s all of them watch it and remember that until this burst onto the western screens there was no genre for it to slot into it was unique and awesome it was the first kung fu movie and it still is for me and many others the best
<START> as a kid this movie scared me green as an adult i couldn't stop laughing br br i have not had the pleasure of watching this movie via mst3k i caught it instead on a late saturday afternoon when there was absolutely nothing in the theaters and there was nothing left to do outside but rake some autumn leaves i figured this had to be better i was wrong br br the movie has some very good elements a water mystic a beatnik painter couple of idiot ranch hands an elderly history buff and an evil wind um i mean evil head an evil head which will as soon as the systematic hypnotism of each and every one present is complete be looking for its evil body br br the whole story takes place on an evil ranch which apparently neither grows crops nor raises evil livestock br br as everything is declared by their resident mystic to be evil you either roll your eyes horribly or laugh til your sides split depending on your mood me i laughed until i had tears streaming down my face br br i remembered this movie fondly as one of those which really scared me as a kid but some kids are afraid of santa claus too no anyway if you're into 50's horror camp then this is definitely a movie you shouldn't miss br br if you're looking for a good story line this movie has that it's the over the top dramatics and downright innocence of the time that makes it so horrid the acting was just bad but it still had some good elements perhaps it rates a remake br br it rates a 4 3 10 from br br the fiend
<START> for pure gothic vampire cheese nothing can compare to the subspecies films i highly recommend each and every one of them
<START> this film doesn't have a very clear picture of what it is or wants to be there are some good bits when stewart is on screen and they give him some lines to work with it works best early on as romantic comedy but the story keeps heading for more dramatic territory and gets itself lost in the process by the last fifteen minutes or so the plot twists are just a series dramatic clichÃ©s br br the part with the airplane feels like some leftover footage from another film spliced in br br the main reason i can think of to watch it is if you want be able to say you've seen all of jimmy stewart's films
