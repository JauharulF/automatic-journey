<START> i just got this movie for christmas and have already added it to my favorites list a cute and simple story which makes a beautiful movie who could not love uncle felix or not have their mouth water at the sound of all that food definite points go to sydney greenstreet for his performance of alexander yardley and also to reginald gardiner who played john sloane the impossibly boring fiancee truly a gem to be watched every christmas
<START> i presume you are here for damage to your mental circuitry val br br mike nelson made me watch this he mentioned it in his book movie i asked myself why would mike nelson steer me wrong i now know why the bots never trusted mike nelson br br the music is by john williams which is probably part of his payment to the devil in fact i'm sure anyone who worked on this movie is probably in league with ol' or is now cursed from the executive director down to the guy who ran the catering truck outside the studio don't watch for the love of god don't watch not even making a copy and showing someone else will un curse you i'm doomed now i understand this i accept this but save yourself
<START> i am a huge gone with the wind fan and i read scarlett before it was a miniseries and loved it this is a sequel of sorts like you didn't expect it with that frankly dear i don't give a damn ending timothy dalton was great as rhett though no one will ever replace clark gable whaley kilmer on the other hand could give vivien leigh a run for her money though i feel almost guilty even saying that her attitude and presence in the film fits the character to a tee making you love and hate her at the same time which is how most feel about ms leigh's portrayal as well the film does move slowly mostly because it follows the book so closely and was not released as a feature film excellent choice on the producer's part i think this movie deserves some recognition for the great storyline the revival of characters that had been gone for almost 50 years and for being something that even margaret mitchell herself could have been proud of
<START> it seems like people are attracted to shows that showcase pathetic lives that have no purpose what so ever to me i give my sincerity to nbc for their dire efforts to make new changes in television making laugh track free shows they seem to always find big success like the office when i first started to watch it seemed to me that it could have potential to be a smash hit but after a couple of episodes i really felt like going to church and donating every penny in my entire bank to pathetic people showcased in these lowlife poor disgraceful areas and the end where they show earl and the brother in bed together it just seems to me that this show is trying to show the bad side of life like street beggars or people who struggle to pay the rent and have no sense of what the real world of normal people in society are like i just seem to always be disgusted when i watch the filth the people in this show live in it's like venice beach in california beautiful but so many hobos believe me i'm no rich guy middle class and not a clean freak either a bit sloppy but it just seems to me that the show just can't seem to get off of all the gruesome schmuck people out there who have one leg i just wish that they would show a little more class not all filth and poorness and trailers and just below average life it just seems to depress me to me this show is nothing more than a showcase of what not to do in life what not to be it also shows me that education is the most important thing you can have because apparently these two don't have an ounce of smarts this is a schmuck u
<START> amnesiac women who remove their clothes at the drop of a hat or a blouse are about the only stand out points in a film that is otherwise slow and aimless although the basic premise of the story offers a wealth of possibilities they are never developed to any satisfying degree and exposition is almost non existent a large proportion of the film is mere wanderings through the corridors of a multi storied clinic hospital the overall effect is bleak and sterile a la thx 1138
<START> the first half of the movie is not that bad actually although there's not really too much depth in the characters the story is somehow funny and generally ok with potential to get better which it doesn't br br in the second half things start to turn for the worse not only for the characters in the movie but also for the viewer who will be basically waiting for the story to come to its obvious end br br the previous user comment mentioned it's a love story a road movie a thriller a comedy of errors an 80's movie and most of all it's a jonathan demme movie br br well please allow me to rephrase that it's a boy gets girl story they happen to be driving around in cars the thrill is gone as it is all too clear how things will evolve there wasn't any scene in this film to which one might laugh out loud it does have some slight 80's feeling and yes jonathan demme really was the director
<START> this covers just about every area of the creative process and goes through the three stages chronologically with the main focus squarely placed on the production there are documentaries that go into more detail and cover the other two groups better this consists of artwork behind the scenes footage clips of the movie and many interviews with a running time that comes in at just over two hours the audience is entitled to a lot of information given that this is nearly the same length that the film itself is it could be argued that a lot of the time is spent on the people with the craft and the result of their collaborative efforts coming in second this is well done with tight editing it gets into the technology some and reveals how certain effects were achieved this spends a lot of time on the physical training in preparation for the fighting and such you do get nice candid shots of the people crew and actors alike the ultimate matrix 10 disc set of this also holds nearly three hours of music in a simple system with individual track selection and a play all function about 38 minutes worth of material in addition to the title itself in various featurettes the original release however has several very brief extras including clips of the making of the sequels a preview of the animatrix and yuen wo blocking tapes a complete run through of a couple of the biggest martial arts sequences with stunt performers and almost the exact cinematography with the same shots and angles of those bits in the finished silver screen effort the language is quite strong but rather infrequent nearly non existent i recommend either version of this to anyone who enjoys the concept and or wants to know about how they put the first one together 7 10
<START> i like both this version of dorian gray and the mgm version both add a little girl early in the story who grows up to have an association with dorian this is not in the original book and that is my only complaint i especially like angela lansbury as sybil vane and george sanders as harry in the mgm version but shane briant as dorian in the tv version is much better looking i think and far more ruthless than hurd hatfield in the mgm version i think briant is more true to the novel's dorian in the end this is a very good adaptation of the novel it even hints at with men as does which could not be done in the mgm version
<START> dull one note characters with next to no development unimpressive performances by people who sound like they're simply reading lines and ludicrous special effects combine to make this a genuine stinker the story begins with eminently bland commando russo and his fellow soldiers attacking an al qaeda training base the scene tells us that al qaeda has recently come to seek an ultimate weapon and also serves to illustrate russo's only character trait a tendency to eschew teamwork with the help of a collection of blank slates and walking stereotypes including a russian spy russo travels to territory to catch a mad scientist working for the terrorists along the way they encounter vast hordes of flesh eating bats that fly in broad daylight for some reason from there the movie becomes nothing more than a dragging morass of ridiculous action including a scene in which a swarm of bats slices a soldier's arm off
<START> i was not expecting a classic but at least a funny film there were only a few scenes that makes you laugh but nothing more you don't scare it is full of american teen slasher cliches and you can guess what will happen easily br br but it tells much about a senior student in a turkish high school pressure of student selection exam oss that 3 hour exam determines which university you'll go and thinking about the exam when a ghost is after you is not exaggeration the movie is bad don't waste your time to watch it
<START> this is one of those movies when you are watching it you wonder whether it is documentary or fiction after the movie ramin answered many questions and we learned that the movie has a script br br camera is silent he is not judgmental he almost erases director from the movie by purpose background is not organized to make the picture pretty however don't get me wrong there is a lot of preparation for this movie starting on personal level being the part of environment being to be ignored when you film br br main character is a 'real' actor in every sense br br i would like to thank all crew for this movie showing us another country within nyc i strongly suggest it if you like stories of others br br
<START> it was a rare treat to see checking out i was touched by the characters laughed a lot at the wonderful script and was deeply moved by the genuine emotions magnificently portrayed by this ensemble cast and especially by peter falk in fact one of his scenes in the kitchen of his apartment with his children where he tells of his experience of his life his deep love for his wife and his decisions about his life going forward is so profoundly real that it is at the highest level of the best academy award winning performances he is a consummate actor who out did himself in this film the screenwriter offers a combination of literary knowledge timing a gift for dialogue and hilarious situations that had me laughing out loud in the theater i highly recommend checking out to everyone wanting to enjoy quality storytelling superbly acted
<START> since i was just finishing the book mrs by virginia woolf i was excited to see that it was on one of the movie channels last weekend what i encountered however is a film that was boring incomprehensible and non sensical one cannot entirely blame the film it tried the best it could with the material it had but when the source material is virginia woolf and is almost entirely written in stream of conscience style with extended periods of and little actual dialogue one would certainly think that there shouldn't be a film made from it just because a film can be made from it br br vanessa redgrave who plays the title character does not deserve any blame for the failure of this film nor do any of the other actors it is just simply a film that could not be made from the story that wrote and should not have even been attempted don't watch the movie read the book br br shelly
<START> am i the only one who thought the point of this film was the graphic violence i knew nothing about leigh scott when i rented it and would not have done so if i had known that most of his previous films were horror films i am not into that at all i was just expecting an informative docudrama of the 9 11 report br br instead i got an almost incomprehensible violent movie the only good thing about it for me was that it made me want to read the report to figure out what the heck this movie was about br br i wrote this because i am shocked that we have become so immune to violence in films and on tv that it was not even worth commenting on by the bloggers whose reviews that i read
<START> all through his career hitchcock did great films this was not one of them br br a man knows too much his daughter is kidnapped to secure his silence and in the denouement all is resolved to the accompaniment of gunfire and rooftop drama br br anyone who has seen 1930s fritz lang films 'm' comes to mind will know how far this urban narrative of crime and conscience falls short of what had already been done in that genre at that time there is an altogether amateurish air about much of the staging and acting which subverts any sense of menace darkness and depravity that hitchcock might have been seeking to br br what it is worth watching out for however is the sequence associated with the shooting at the albert hall once that kicks off it is as if the film has been given a blood transfusion the camerawork is lively the cuts are interesting and the way that everything combines to a climax is masterly here you can see the future master hitchcock effortlessly orchestrate all the resources to impressive and memorable effect when the scream comes you really feel as well as hear it
