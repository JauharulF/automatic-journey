<START> a superman cartoon br br when america unveils its colossal new bomber the an elite force of japanese spies saboteurs strikes stealing the behemoth with intrepid girl reporter lois lane aboard and the destination either tokyo or destruction it's time for superman to get involved br br this was another in the series of excellent cartoons initially created by max fleischer for paramount studio they feature great animation and taut fast moving plots meant to be shown in movie theaters they are miles ahead of their saturday morning counterparts bud collyer is the voice of superman joan alexander does the honors for lois lane
<START> this movie was awful ashley rose orr while a talented tap dancer and singer actually a little better than temple was in terms of the latter is a terrible actress she plays the character as the shirley that we saw on screen in her movies whether she's playing her onscreen or offscreen persona so what we get is an overly cutesy and wholly unrealistic not to mention uninteresting portrait if one wants to see that side of her one can just rent one of her movies the only bright light here is connie portrayal of gertrude temple i don't think it was terribly realistic but at least it was well acted save yourself the trouble and rent the poor little rich girl
<START> some aspects of this production are good such as the performances of angela lansbury george cris and sal but am i the only one who is distracted by the horrible performance by betsy joslyn as johanna she is terrible she the songs with her screechy voice and overacts in a role she clearly doesn't understand i also think the chorus isn't up to snuff they drag the tempo and make the worst facial expressions overall i think this production is okay but sweeney todd can be so much more if done correctly this production doesn't come near the level this material demands the concert version with george and patti is much better
<START> seeing the title of this movie stupid teenagers must die made me believe this was a spoof of some kind i discovered later on the original title was blood and guts both titles are misleading though this is not a spoof neither a serious splatter movie this is something in between failing in both areas a group of teenagers is attending a sÃ©ance at a spooky house and then the killing starts sounds over familiar doesn't it well this movies adds nothing whatsoever to the endless stream of similar movies and it is badly made because of the lack of light the entire film is grainy now this effect can be highly effective but it isn't in this case the young cast isn't acting too badly but the director has no clue as what to do with actors in numerous scenes the actors are clearly waiting for directions but these are given too late it could also be an editor's mistake of course the characters are unrealistic and the story line just stinks the sound is terrible at times conversations are undecipherable but when talking loudly or screaming the actors are very loud indeed br br this is not the worst horror movie i have ever seen but it still is a bad one for me a 3 out of 10
<START> i have read reviews of this film that found it and i am at a loss to understand why this should be so from the beginning i found it a remarkable experience and a complete joy to watch br br spoiler the opening titles overlay a beautiful visual of the evolutionary process and this introduces the story with a serene and sweeping style the film isn't about the process itself though it concerns charles darwin's struggle with his conscience his love for his wife his deceased daughter and his search for truth br br the appearances of his daughter are the manifestations of a tormented mind that knows it has killed god the daughter is an adult making adult comments about his work and torturing darwin with personal doubts was he in some way responsible for her death husband and wife in real life paul bettany and jennifer connelly give truly wonderful performances as charles and emma darwin as does martha west as annie bettany's size and awkward gait give darwin's character a genuine sense of reality whilst connelly seems very comfortable with her english accent and occasionally somewhat severe persona br br it's easy to misunderstand the times in which this film resides the grip that religion had on society and the inner struggles that a man like darwin must have endured to seek the truth in what he witnessed science and religion have always been awkward bedfellows and although it didn't cost him his life as it did with so many earlier men and women science put a barrier between husband and wife fact and faith this film portrays that barrier supremely well br br i give creation ten stars because i think it's beautiful profound superbly well acted and a genuine no extraneous frills required look at one of the world's true geniuses br br what seems obvious to everyone today well almost everyone see bill maher's wonderful religulous was hidden for millennia the truth once it was discovered was undoubtedly painful for many creation examines that pain and the realisation that we are all that we possess br br a wonderful cinematic experience
<START> i've just watched this with my three children boy boy and girl and this film was good old fashioned family action adventure although definitely aimed at the kid market i'd say 5 to 13 it was certainly watchable and as a parent it is a pleasure to find a movie that appeals to a broad range of ages whilst still being suitable for the whole family to watch particularly younger children br br the story revolves around ricky a bit of a nerd with a vivid imagination this can definitely be seen in his daydream sequences who foils a kidnapping and major art theft while on on board a flight to washington for a school trip ricky's dad is an airplane mechanic so ricky not only knows the structure of the aircraft inside out but is also a top gun on his computer flight simulator this comes in handy when the pilot and co pilot are out cold through a series of misadventures and there is no one left to fly the plane i don't want to give away any more of the plot
<START> i liked this movie the second naruto feature film i enjoyed the one in the snow a tad better though as i found the story here a bit disjointed as i was not sure where certain things were supposed to be happening or when still like the first film this one too has a nice run time to it of a hour and a half plenty of time for a nice well developed movie with some really cool fights the story starts off with ninja from the village hidden in the sand in combat with unknown assailants it then shits to naruto sakura and hunting down a ferret for what they think is going to be an easy assignment they soon find out otherwise as they are also attacked and naruto is separated from his friends after he has a fight with a strange young warrior clad in armor they both are injured and taken in by a caravan and soon after naruto is invited to join this strange organization that wishes to create a utopia of course all is not as it seems and there are plenty of fights to go around my favorite was the one involving fighting this strange woman who takes him very lightly which is a very big mistake the concluding fight is rather good too involving naruto and this strange man who is a better villain than any of those in the previous movie
<START> spin offs for somebody who don't know are not usually successful because most of the original characters are absent br br here they are and you couldn't ask for a better ensemble in what is essentially a silly little cartoon not meant to do anything but entertain br br j p replacing david spade does an admirable job of retaining ego and yet not seem as annoying as spade's character a character spade has done for decades and gets on one's nerves after a while he has a softer voice but it fits somehow br br eartha kitt reprising her part as is brilliant she hasn't really been given much accolades since her turn as batwoman centuries ago except maybe for her vile part in boomerang it's funny how much the character looks like her though br br and patrick warburton there is no way that he can't be funny except when he was thoroughly wasted in men in black 2 i have been a fan of his since seinfeld but unlike that character he plays a genuine likable guy who is sucked into doing not so nice things br br the animation is really beautiful as all disney usually is but sometimes the character design is a little too sugarcoated oh well two out of three ain't bad
<START> luc besson's first work is also his first foray in science fiction a genre to which he will return fourteen years later with the fifth element 1997 even if this film was strongly influenced by hollywood cinema it is still highly enjoyable back in 1983 le dernier combat reveals besson's own approach of science fiction he takes back a threadbare topic and his efforts are discernible to make a stylish work shot in widescreen and black and white a disaster has destroyed virtually all the population from earth and we will never know what was this disaster and why men can't talk any more some barbarian hordes were formed in parallel a man pierre lives on his own and arrives in an unrecognizable paris where he is received by a doctor jean br br there are no words in besson's work the characters' actions and the progression of the events go through looks and gestures although the starting point and the backdrop are unnerving the film has never the look of a despondent one it seems that the man and the doctor try to reproduce gestures and actions linked to mankind before the disaster the film opens with the man having sex with an doll later the doctor tries to make him speak through a machine and he is a painter in his spare time it's all the more intriguing as these paintings seem to come from the prehistoric times following this reasoning one could argue that the bearded giant jean reno embodies evil and a threat to the efforts deployed by the man and the doctor to regain what finally made a human being ditto for the gang of baddies at the beginning of the film br br the pessimistic whiff that such a film could convey isn't really at the fore and gives way to a glimmer of hope personally the film could have gained with no music at all except the one the man can hear with his cassette recorder luc was to make better and still entrancing films like this one he also boosted pierre career as a director who will leave a patchy work behind him in the future force 1989 simple 1991 ma petite entreprise 1999 or 2003
<START> why are there no good reviews because this film is hysterically bad br br set in a japanese prison camp in world war ii we have jim brown as the hero who puts up with a hysterically unbelievable racist officer and just as hysterical is the way the japanese officers brown nose jim brown's character br br this is probably the worst film any of these actors ever did stereotypes not only abound but they dominate this film the sixties seventies music may be the best thing about the film maybe because it has nothing to do with the film br br this is even difficult to sit back and enjoy as mindless fun this film is even more racist than the message of racism it tries to deliver and believe me i was alive in the seventies and we thought crap like this was just as stupid then it was never popular
<START> this bbc version of an agatha christie book shows the pitfalls of following a book too closely christie's books tend to move at a gentle sometimes even sedate pace and evans is one that certainly does it also has a solid school of red herrings to confuse the plot this version is extremely faithful to the book which results in a very slow involved story as a christie fan i gave it 7 stars but it takes 3 hours to make its way through a relatively action free story i appreciate some of the tightening of plots that the bbc did for its later christie productions much more br br in the end this movie is a leisurely pleasure highlighted by the breathy waif francesca annis who brings considerable charisma to her role and plays off james warwick very well
<START> when i die someone will bury me and if they don't what's the difference who gives a damn huh thus the philosophy of life or lack there of is summed up once and for all in this less than classic but nevertheless fun spin off of sergio leone's dollars trilogy in the opening scene three obviously evil gunmen ride into a western town and with menacing glares they intimidate all the pathetic normal people hiding in their homes the observant watcher will notice that each of these three bears a striking resemblance to characters from leone's for a few dollars more there is one guy in eastwood's poncho one in lee van cleef's black suit and one seeming to act like gian marie but this movie is not about these guys no sooner do they ride into town when they are gunned down by someone even cooler than they a mysterious bounty hunter known simply as the stranger br br no this is an altogether different story br br in an obvious copying of leone's the good the bad and the ugly three gunmen are again vying for a hidden treasure once again there is the bounty hunter and the mexican bandit the stranger george hilton is a bounty hunter with a penchant for shooting people while dressed up like a priest he is after the reward for the bandit gilbert roland but when gang steals three hundred thousand in gold coins the stranger gets sidetracked from his normal line of work br br to round off the trio there is edd byrne's corrupt bank executive clayton he too wants the money for himself but after the money is hidden away the only man who knows where it is gets shot now the only clue to the hiding place is a medallion that shows a family crest the game is too find the treasure before anyone else does and any gun can play br br with plenty of gunfights fist fights and double crosses the action takes these three to the ultimate showdown ripoff a three way draw for the hidden treasure ala the good the bad and the ugly but with a twist br br this movie is not as good as leone's films of course but in the end who gives a damn huh this movie is fun 60s nihilism spaghetti western style there are no rules no enduring loyalties and no right or wrong just the treasure and whatever it takes to get it and though the movie is not classic the ending surely is hey maybe we all can get along after all for a hundred thousand a piece br br if you like spaghetti westerns check this one out it is fast furious and worth the look my name is evren buyruk from california
<START> horrible script which was apparently directed by no one the marines can't fend off the monster with machine guns however it backs off when a 15 year old girl karate kicks it in the face a few times it's supposed to be a luxury liner but the fancy dining room looks like a cafeteria in a hospital it appears that they rented a high school for the summer and pulled out chairs and stuff to decorate the set with in the end shot they are pulled from the water and into a boat and less than 3 seconds later they are apparently about two miles from the ship as it sinks how do movies like this get made i guess anyone can be in a film these days aaron james nyc
<START> i had the great pleasure of recently viewing this beautifully filmed wide screen adaption of the the 1943 stage revival which unlike the original 1935 production which included extensive spoken this had been the fashion at the time so to blame the film for an 16 year tradition the film should be seen if only for sammy davis brilliant catlike performance as life creeping in and out of shadows his seduction of dorothy bess there's a boat soon for new york is one of many highlights nearly all of the principal music is intact and beautifully sung it certainly never bores which the recent pbs and met versions did it was a pleasure to see that time had not diminished the movie and hopefully it will be made available in the near future for the generations that haven't had a chance to experience it
<START> i think the romance of this movie helps couples develop a deeper appreciation for each other although i saw one goof in the early part of the movie it was fairly well done the plot can make you cry if you think about the situation enough i loved it watched it twice already and highly recommend it
