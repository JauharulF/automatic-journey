<START> i saw the premier of this movie during the 2005 phoenix film festival and was very impressed with the skill director jeff hare exhibited in bringing this timely topic to the screen the cast of characters meshed perfectly and allowed us to examine the issue of a senior wishing to die on his own terms in a very warm and humorous way peter falk was brilliant as morris and the supporting group of family members and friends were perfectly cast in their roles the interaction of the family friends and outsiders with morris created a realistic view of how families address the issue of their parents aging and their wishes to die with dignity br br although this movie is ostensibly a movie about a jewish actor and his family it is truly a movie about all families the jokes the family and morris crack during this romp through the life of a force of nature are fresh and realistic childhood rivalries adult successes and failures and hope for the children are integral to this screenplay while many will question how you can make the topic of suicide humorous i thought the treatment logical and timely if you are not afraid to shed a few tears or laugh at the quips of a family struggling with this issue then you must see this movie br br the movie was awarded best picture at the phoenix film festival
<START> a true yawner and a bad film even for the chan series i like a good charlie chan film or even a reasonably good one but this one falls way short of the mark charlie is enlisted to help figure out the murder of a scientist working for our government when someone in the house has stolen the plans for another power the mystery is very pedestrian and the acting doesn't fare much better the only saving grace for me in the film was the presence of mantan moreland as birmingham brown he gives the film a little comedy and has some good scared faces but after that the pickings are rather slim benson fong is here as tommy chan and pairs up with chan's daughter of all things what about sidney toler he is pretty decent but looks like he is straining to carry the film what i noticed most was the way the film was shot chan director phil rosen of whom i generally like most of his entries uses lots of long shots with no action like charlie's initial walk into the house from outside why the film is only 64 minutes long for crying out loud shots like that tell me the director had to fill time up because the script was even weaker than he was accustomed to this probably isn't the worst chan film ever made but up to now it is the worst i have sat through unfortunately
<START> have you ever seen one of those shows that became so popular that it could eventually get away with any crummy nonsense and repetitive halfhearted gimmicks that it's creators can get away with if you haven't then you've never seen family guy br br fans of the show seem to think of it as witty edgy and poignant it's none of these it is however dull repetitive insulting and uninspired br br the humor of the show comes from two sources br br 1 irrelevant idiocy the show often has flashbacks to things that have nothing to do with the plot and are mostly just absurd and pointless and then there's the random movie references in which the shows characters reenact a scene from a popular movie without effectively parodying it or parodying it at all which isn't funny br br 2 the same crap that's in every episode the show the one guy is a sexual deviant with aha ha isn't that funny hey ya know what's even funnier making the same joke about him anywhere between one and fifteen times in a single episode and don't just tell it numerous times in a single episode make sure you drag it out so that an entire scene is devoted just to telling the one joke now also imagine that this same routine is used over and over again for practically every character in the whole series br br the offbeat un pc humor isn't as un pc as they would have you believe mostly they just say whatever morons think about the latest newspaper headlines politicians and random celebrities br br the series had it's moments but now i think it's time just take the show off the air and be done with it br br you know what is funny i still like this more than nausicaa of the valley of the wind
<START> i watched the first episode and i found it to be a very wooden performance br br i have watched the original from it's early days on big girls blouse to the last series on channel seven and kim was a great mocumentary and it's humor is something that most people get br br however in this american version i found it to be dull molly shannon is to fashionable to be day wardrobe is supposed to be stuck in the 80s with her frizzy perm while selma blair's figure hugging clothes isn't as good as what the original kimmy wore i also found that selma seemed to be puffing her belly out a lot she is obviously a australian size 12 where kim should be australian a size 16 18 br br the exchanges from molly and selma is obviously so scripted and there is pauses where there shouldn't be pauses or the pauses are a bit long as someone suggested there could be a laughter track in there during those pauses it's like molly and shannon are not used to each other there is no mother daughter chemistry br br phil was okay he had the eccentric air around him like kel however craig was to handsome and not the sweet plain humble brett from the aussie version br br i found watching this was like watching a very bad stage play the acting was pretty much wooden and the exaggeration of expressions wore the funny off after ten minutes especially her sulking scenes br br to sum up i find this show to be a waste of time the script obviously has been dumbed down for americans which most on the board say they prefer the original if nbc wanted to show and kim why not pay the producers the money to screen the original br br all i can add is magda you are one smart cookie for not letting the producers use your character of sharon
<START> riding high on the success of rebel without a cause came a tidal wave of movies arguably this is one of the best a very young mcarthur excels here as the not really too troubled teen the story concentrates more on perceptions of delinquency than any traumatic occurrence the supporting cast is memorable frankenheimer directs like an old pro just a story of a young man that finds others take his actions much too seriously
<START> a wonder my favorite film the most important film about relationships ever made brilliant writing magnificent directing image systems and symbolism that leave you thinking about it all days weeks years later wow a truly great work of art
<START> max cash a charter boat captain who works off the caribbean island san sebastian is hired by sarah who's looking for legendary boat el diablo and its stolen treasure that sunk out in the reef in the 17th century but something seems to be protecting the whereabouts of the ship as people who knew anything about it are being killed br br i have to agree with those that were under the impression that this was going to be a horror feature instead what we ended up with was a low rent b grade late 80s take on 1977 deep sea adventure film 'the deep' but with a baffling supernatural origin and an injection of mystery the story is a tame muddle so many inconsistent angles don't make a lick of sense and encourages a pace and the technical side is clunky nice exotic location and under water photography though while the carefree performances weren't too bad either a gruff wayne crawford is enjoyably witty and june chadwick is fair along side him sheri able is pretty much eye candy there are some bizarre developments that amuse and one or two eerie sequences however there's a real lack of cohesion most of the cutaway deaths happen off screen except for the bloody fitful opening kills done by something unseen again just another thing that leaves you high and dry the music is generic with its thumping cues to warn us of approaching danger and the pov shots get a good working out tatty but watchable
<START> its a feel good movie that made me feel good some in this genre can be sickly sweet but this script is restrained the movie is funny and fun the acting is great br br if this were a musical i would have left the theater humming the tunes
<START> lost has been one of the most mesmerizing and thrilling experience i've ever seen not only it's the mother of coincidence but also every time that you think you can set up the whole puzzle in your head the story takes a completely new direction br br take this casualty for example the us marine whom gives sayid the way to become a torturer is clancy brown playing a character named joe in the last episode he is playing kelvin the desmond partner in the hatch destiny uh yeah right br br i guess that all of us will have to wait to see what's next in the life of the wonder people in that strange island in the middle of nowhere knowing that several of my favorites characters desmond sayid and mr eko have an unclear destiny br br i believe that along with 24 and the shield this is one of the best tv shows ever of course keeping twin peaks at a special place
<START> they don't make movies like this anymore Â though some may say that's a good thing although this was amongst the first of disney's pg rated films it has more of the feel of the g films their studio turned out in i e freaky friday the world's greatest athlete than the pg films that came out in the early i e watcher in the woods tron something wicked this way comes because of disney's backing midnight madness obviously had a large budget a huge cast and a ton of diverse locations go to show that but zaniness a madcap scavenger hunt and spectacular visual style weren't enough to save the film from being an enormous flop a failure at the box office most of us were introduced to the film on hbo in the early back in the days when the same films would be shown 29 times a week oh wait Â they still do that essentially hbo did for this film what cbs did for the wizard of oz Â they created an enormous cult audience for a sugary sweet mega flop br br the biggest problem that makes this a bad film is that there's too many characters and very few of them are fleshed out Â eddie squad don't even have names the blue team although they're the villains are the most endearing and have the most work put into their characters with the exception of the girl who can't act doesn't have enough to do harold perfectly played to the hilt by stephen furst is really the only one whose character is fully realized in the film the other standout character is goof off played with tons of charm by now director andy tennant although then dr pepper spokesman david naughton was supposed to be the star his character often comes off obnoxious particularly when pitted against his brother adam michael j fox while everyone has favorite characters i don't think anyone who loves the movie could disagree that furst and fox are the only two characters that you really learn anything about br br despite the film's many flaws and bad actors most of whom fell off the face of the earth after this movie it still works because the actors appeared to be having fun and fun on the set equals fun on the screen come on what college jock doesn't dream of floating around in a beer vat and what girl doesn't dream of stealing the show at the local er i guess it would be at a rave nowadays campy squeaky clean fun for anyone who was young in the it's only fitting that this has finally gotten the massive video release that it deserves but where the hell's the widescreen dvd release with the commentary trailer and the full version of the song that plays in the disco
<START> wealthy horse ranchers in buenos aires have a long standing no trading policy with the crawfords of manhattan but what happens when the mustachioed latin son falls for a certain crawford with bright eyes blonde hair and some perky moves on the dance floor 20th century fox musical has a glossy veneer yet seems a bit tatty around the edges it is very heavy on the frenetic gymnastic like dancing exceedingly thin on story betty grable an eleventh hour replacement for alice faye gives it a boost even though she's paired with leaden don ameche in tan make up and slick hair also good charlotte greenwood as betty's pithy aunt a limousine driver who's constantly asleep on the job and carmen miranda playing herself who else the stock shots of argentina far the action filmed on the fox backlot and some of the supporting performances are quite awful by the time of the big finale most viewers will have had enough 1 2 from
<START> all american the biopic about the famous notre dame beloved coach is an excellent sports film to watch not ever having seen it we were surprised by the technique used in the movie by director lloyd bacon who shows he was ahead of his times in photographing football games the result is a vibrant picture about the man responsible for the legacy of the sport br br the film presents from his humble origins in chicago to his studies in famed notre dame university in south bend indiana he was an ambitious man who had a vision about how the game should be played luckily he went to give his beloved notre dame the glory he was after br br pat o'brien looks a bit older when he starts as a freshman in fact he doesn't change much throughout the film but he is fine as mr pat o'brien shows he could inspire the players under him by just being a father figure gale page plays bonnie the wise woman who understood her husband's call in life ronald reagan plays george the who was a legend that died much too young but who left a legacy behind donald crisp makes a good contribution as father john callahan who was mentor at the university br br this film will delight not only sports because of lloyd bacon's direction and the fast pace he gives to the movie
<START> yeah it may not be for adults and some adults may find it stupid but if you don't think about it it's really not that bad br br the story has alvin and his gang going across the world in search of jewels for a bad person and the misadventures that they come in contact with br br so the animation is good and the story is cute and the songs are forgettable but it's a good movie br br i give it a 6 out of 10 or out of 4 stars
<START> i know that many people will have automatically given this film a rating of 1 just because it doesn't have the huge budget and top of the line special effects that they are used to i however knew what i was getting myself into when i popped this into the vcr br br i don't think we get much more low budget that this unless we are filming a family reunion the lighting is awful sound quality is at times incomprehensible and the acting is ultra bad by almost all involved but this is still a fun movie and the plot is interesting enough it centers around a fellow named tom russo asbestos felt who has been down on his luck with his job he is very protective of his wife and does not allow her to work putting even more pressure on himself as he begins working more hours we see him slowly transcend into madness and obsession and he becomes suspicious that his wife cheating on him and begins to brutally murder the various men most repair guys that he feels are responsible br br i must say that the gore effects are extremely cheap but fit with the overall tone of the film the brutal ways that tom russo comes up with to murder these men gives us an idea of just has mad he has become the pacing of the film is also very good and there is rarely a boring moment the ending really doesn't follow the rest of the plot of the film as it seems to want to go from a psycho slasher film to a dawn of the dead wannabe but it is entertaining nonetheless and i must give tim ritter credit for wanting to use an unconventional ending br br i can honestly say that i enjoyed this film but it is by no means a good film if that makes sense it's budget is its main stumbling block and the consequences are almost too much to overlook i do not recommend this to people who are totally spoiled by the big budget movies and who can't have an open mind to ultra low budget films you simply won't enjoy it for others and fans of gore i say give it a shot you will find at least something redeeming in it br br my grade d
<START> the acting is generally pretty weak the dialog was also apparently dubbed in after the filming so it just doesn't come across well what do you want for a tv movie br br annette o'toole was ok there were a few strong lines from the parent of the queen br br otherwise these kids weren't quite up to it didn't impress my kids either br br on the upside it is only an hour long considering that it got through plot and character development in a creditable fashion the settings and cinematography are ok too br br some other viewers may like it for sentimental reasons
