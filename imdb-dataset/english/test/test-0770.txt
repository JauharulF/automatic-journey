<START> this film hits the heart with a reality like no other i have seen it shows what us what we in a democratic society take for granted and just what we are lucky enough not to be experiencing the acting in the film is superb sometimes you have to remind yourself that the movie is a dramatization and not real life mr rickman does wonders with his role as he does with all roles making the interrogator fully dimensional and human the set is incredible it gives the feeling of 'in the round theater which does not add or take away from the emotion of the action this movie seeks to open the eyes of the viewer and i'd say they have made a success of that goal
<START> a vehicle for michael caine its fairly well written and there's some ok acting in it but really it's a mess not funny enough not frightening enough it's a flaccid modern cockney thriller br br i like the premise that even in the refracted moral hinterland of east london people do do things for the right reasons a surprise result to the first proper fight caine's old school billy shiner has promoted his paranoia the second half of the film has him chasing shadows to deal with the disappointment of the outcome of the first br br my greatest disappointment was in director john failure to make more of the relationship between shiner and his lieutenant substitute frank harper harper's a british tom sizemore understands his role well whilst those around him seem to have ignored it pity 4 10
<START> kane is a killer named jacob goodnight he lives in this burned down old hotel where eight teen convicts go to do some cleaning most of them die except for 3 of them in my case it wasn't the best writing or the best ever i still thought that the killing scenes were really well done like when the one girl go eaten by the hungry dogs the best had to be when he shoved the cell phone down the blonde girl's mouth kane was a seriously great horror movie actor he had this serious look the entire movie and it would never change that was his only look the entire movie great action and killing scenes i don't think i could give it a full 10 out of 10 but 6 seems good
<START> i went to see the movie because my boyfriend was raving about how much he wanted to see it and how his friends had already been and loved it so i came in with a neutral attitude not really expecting the worst unfortunately that is what i got i could write a 15 page paper on why this is easily the worst movie i have ever seen but for your benefit i will point out the pros and the endless supply of cons to begin the acting was very good especially christopher waltz and melanie laurent there were also a few lines that deserved a laugh and a couple suspenseful scenes sadly good acting a little humor and suspense is where the good points end the whole beginning story could have been great a jewish girl's family is butchered she goes into hiding later encounters the man responsible for her pain and then hatches a great plan for revenge sounds very good but the movie wouldn't be quite as satisfying for the americans and jews craving nazi blood i have no problem with wwii movies or killing nazis i saw defiance and like it very much however it's the way and attitude with which our would be heroes kill i'll give you a prime example of the kind of hypocrisy this movie oozes our hoodlum gang ambushes a german unit and kills scalps all of them except a sergeant and two other soldiers no problem so far they ask the sergeant to divulge information on another german unit when he respectfully refuses to betray the lives of his fellow soldiers they bash his head in a with a baseball bat cheering and swearing as if they were at a football game they took that nazi's head off now let's look at the hypocrisy in that scene here's a hypothetical situation a group of american soldiers are ambushed and taken captive by the enemy the same scenario follows and the american commanding officer would rather die than betray his fellow soldier the enemy bashes his head in with much celebration this would infuriate an audience if this scene were in a movie that american soldier was a hero for placing his men above himself and those barbarians brutally murdered him about the nazi sergeant well he's a nazi and deserves to die the cruelest death possible right coincidentally the nazi's felt the same towards the jews see the hypocrisy by celebrating the butcher of the nazis we are placing ourselves on the same sadistic level br br major hypocrisy 2 the nazis make a propaganda movie about a german sniper who kills nearly 300 american soldiers near the end of the movie the film is revealed hitler and his cohorts giggle with delight as they watch an american soldier get shot out of a window and fall into a fountain the nazis cheer as soldier after soldier falls to the snipers skill this is supposed to enrage the american viewers of this scene those evil nazis are laughing over the deaths of our brave men well the irony is isn't that what we were doing or supposed to be doing the entire time we're watching inglorious basterds laughing over the pain of others simply because they were the bad guys how would we feel if native americans somehow made a hit film in which they reek bloody vengeance on the american settlers or what if blacks made a movie glorifying the nat turner rebellion ok enough about the hypocritical flaws br br i'll summarize other reasons for the 1 star rating 1 there were view admirable characters throughout the movie brad pitt even tortures a woman by sticking his finger in her gunshot wound because he suspects she betrayed him he's the good guy 2 scenes dragged on way longer than they needed to 3 brad pitt's southern supposedly tennessee accent is horrible and thoroughly annoying throughout the entire move i'll quit now since i'm at 700 words br br unfortunately it seems that the general population doesn't think anymore they just want blood and that is why this movie received such a high ranking i recommend this movie for the ignorant or if you are jewish and simply wanting to see a nice fantasy justice personally when i finally got out of the movie theater i felt like i had been scalped or wish that i had so i wouldn't have suffered over 2 hours of mental rape
<START> saw this last night at the 7th annual nyc home film festival a rather tumultuous venue that quieted down for this sweet and touching two woman film br br the relationship between the two one older and blind the other a twenty something who helps her with her mail is established deftly and its depth is readily apparent br br there are no car chases explosions or mind boggling special effects just the sometimes difficult but rewarding task of humans reaching out toward each other to help and be helped br br see if it you can
<START> son in law didn't do so hot in the box office but that only means the masses were wrong this movie is one of the few movies that pauly shore really excels in with some of the funniest lines i've ever heard although the ending is sub par the antics of shore carries the movie
<START> i have a lot of respect for mr argento's work but this film lacks many of the qualities that make his films really unique the opening to the film is great and sets you up for the possibility of a really scary horror film what occurs for the rest of the film lacks structure or purpose and does not build into much there are some good performances though and a lot of great atmosphere the end of the film is weak considering everything this builds up to where there should be some grand climax of huge proportions you instead get a very typical conclusion that too many other bad horror movies use making it feel like they just needed to wrap it up a couple of scenes are very memorable for their imagery but in the end the film does not gel to make a really good movie unless you feel you must see everything this director made i suggest passing on this one
<START> ok so one night me and some friends decided to get really stoned and watch a movie unfortunately for us we chose goes to africa ' i have never laughed so hard in my entire life this movie is beyond bad i have literally pooped out better films than goes to africa ' i poop films br br the highlight of this movie for me at least was the opening sequence when ernest is making silly faces when they showed him with a head the size of a peanut i lost it perhaps i found this so funny because at that point i was the most high perhaps you are right br br if i had to guess what george w bush's favorite movie is i would guess goes to africa ' never before have i seen a movie rely more on 1950's stereotypes of people of color there were times when words escaped me and i just stared in awe br br as i was watching this i couldn't help but wonder is this movie meant for children do literate adults actually watch this how could there possibly be a whole franchise of 'ernest' movies is this really my life is this real br br i hated this movie
<START> in the early '80s i recorded honky tonk freeway from the cable since then i have waited hoping it would be on dvd yesterday i found it it is one of the best humorous character studies i ever saw the old fashioned episode is priceless at this time 4 28 02 only two have reviewed it one hated it the other loved it if you have a dvd player either rent it or buy it as i did
<START> although i'm not a golf fan i attended a sneak preview of this movie and absolutely loved it the historical settings the blatant class distinctions and seeing the good and the bad on both sides of the dividing line held my attention throughout the actors and their characterizations were all mesmerizing and i was on the edge of my seat during the golf segments which were not only dramatic and exciting but easy to follow toward the end of this movie came strongly to mind although the greatest game ever played is far less complex a story than that film in both cases the fact that the events really happened deepened my interest
<START> this movie was better than i expected i don't think it deserved an r rating though i've seen pg 13 films with worse language and violence i found this movie entertaining and i enjoyed it if you're a person who dissects everything you might find a lot wrong with it but if you take it for its face value i think you'll find it entertaining
<START> being from eastern pa right on the border of northern new jersey i still get a feeling like this was a documentary more so than a movie i have friends from new york and new jersey and this film represents the kind of lifestyle that still exists today in lower income outside of the big city lifestyle if you have not seen this movie and ever wondered what really goes on in the urban jungle check this movie out no really big name actors its as if they just pulled these guys off the street and said act which adds to the realism of the movie the performances are fantastic none the less see this film
<START> i saw this film at a special screening at first i thought the movie would be like a typical amanda bynes movie but i was wrong the movie is based on the shakespeares book the night this movie tells the story of a girl who lives to play soccer well when the girls team is cut she has to go to great lengths to get on the guys team at a different school to get revenge on the egotistical guys team at her old school on her way she gets caught up in a long tangled web of love lies and deception this movie is this years mean girls i think it shows some great new actors abilities and there are defiantly some big stars to be featured in this movie
<START> i love stephen kings work and the book was great but i was very disappointed when i bought this movie on dvd this was one of the worst b movies i have ever seen it feels like they had a tight schedule and only took one shot at every scene even if it turned out to be a bad one and where did they find the actors
<START> those reviewers who have complained that this movie lacks plausibility or has problems of construction are missing the point this is a wonderfully camp romance with plenty of play gypsies dance gypsies music that both sends up exotic love stories and celebrates them up ray milland makes an amusing foil for a dietrich with black hair tattered scarves and tons of jewelry the character's eagerness to feed milland and look after him more closely resembles the good german dietrich was off the set than her mannered vamp roles censorship being in force it's made clear that they share a caravan on platonic terms only with milland fighting off dietrich's advances with a determination remarkable for a heterosexual bachelor who might be killed any day his only excuse is that she smells so perhaps a stuffy fastidious englishman might indeed be put off br br in the small role of milland's young companion on his secret mission bruce lester adds a note of camp of a different kind we are told at the beginning that he hero worships milland and indeed he rather on him when after they are separated he meets milland now transformed into a brown skinned gypsy with a shirt open to the waist his glowing appreciation of the disguise even further suggests that not only dietrich is romantically infatuated with milland br br despite the wonderfully improbable characters and sequence of events the growing love of milland for dietrich and his acceptance of the non rational aspects of life is rather touching and when on their last night alone before he escapes he says that each of them now contain half of the other the two have become one and then darkness falls i think we can assume that the censor decided to give them a break one goof at the beginning milland who is supposed to be english refers to a lieutenant using the american pronunciation the english say since milland was british he must have been saying it that way because the american movie makers feared that american audiences would be distracted and confused by the british style
