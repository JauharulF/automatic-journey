<START> i really loved this original screenplay and the different places it took me emotionally spiritually and just plain silly stuff i didn't get caught up in believability in the screenplay or the actors and didn't even think about it until reading the reviews listed here in imdb for the movie listening to michael talk at the q a about his idea of the film wanting to see how crazy people or up people as he put it fall in love is really interesting i identified with not having a story book romance and liked seeing dysfunction at it's best i like watching david in anything he does and have followed his career for a few years now i believe this is some of his best work and say to anyone just see this film to watch an amazing young actor i agree that guillermo dÃ­az really was a scene stealer and what he did with his character is really a great acting lesson in commitment i laughed and cried both in this movie and was disappointed that it didn't win any awards at the festival i question why that didn't happen i gave max and grace a ten because these interesting unique creative indie films deserve an audience technically watching this film it's really beautifully done Â the colors are amazing and lastly it's one of the best soundtracks i have heard in a film in awhile
<START> dakota incident has to be one of the strangest westerns i've ever seen not good but definitely strange br br a driver less stagecoach rides into the town of christian flats with all passengers killed it's scheduled to go on but very few for obvious reasons want to risk the on the warpath out there but linda darnell regis toomey john lund whit bissell and ward bond each have their reasons for going on and dale robertson who killed john doucette in a gunfight after doucette and skip shot and left him for dead in the desert is so anxious to go he's willing to drive the team br br of course the attack the intrepid group of passengers if forced into a dry wash for cover who will live and who will die is the remainder of the film br br dakota incident came at the very end of republic pictures before herbert j yates pulled the plug on his little studio westerns were their specialty but normally of the kind roy rogers made this would not have been a rogers product br br in fact it's beyond belief the characters aren't ground in any kind of reality whit bissell is taking back ore samples from his claim but robertson discovers it's iron fool's gold toomey is a guitar playing cynic who goes mad from thirst darnell is after a cheating manager of her's but really doesn't know what to do when she finds him lund is looking to bring in robertson who committed a crime he took the rap for but has to bring him in alive for that he'd require help but doesn't have any br br but the worst is ward bond who's a united states senator on his own peace mission to the in real life bond was a most right wing individual and i'm not sure this wasn't some kind of a caricature of what he would perceive as a liberal he's really quite the fatuous fool but i think that might have attracted him to the role br br i tried to get into dakota incident but couldn't and the ending was a bizarre fantasy to say the least br br give it three stars for the cast involved
<START> in his descriptions of platinum card lunches in hollywood psychoanalysis a vacation in provincetown he never took and free trips to nicaragua financed by columbia pictures br br it sounds narcissistic but spalding gray possibly because of his unusual personality ropes the audience in laughs at himself perhaps because he did not take the hollywood thing oh so seriously and gets us to care br br this monologue is not just about the killing fields or swimming to cambodia it is more a pastiche of events as he sees them some of the lines are classic as when gray meets with the esteemed talent agents at the conference table is full of them tanned healthy fresh from drinking blue green algae from an oregon lake there are no drugs now in hollywood br br this was before the tragedy occurred many of us will miss his off balance humor 9 10
<START> this movie is excellent in how it portrays the reality of sexual abuse the daughters perfectly express their conflicting emotions of affection and betrayal the on location scenery is authentic and the soundtrack is unobtrusive yet moving this film is a graduate level course in a reality that's too little recognized in american society personally i'm freaked out by the names of the characters lange's character is ginny cook smith my name is connie cook smith and my mom is cook the youngest daughter is caroline cook which is my sister's name and the father is larry cook my cousin's name but sex abuse was not in our immediate family
<START> this film is terrible honestly the acting is terrible the script made me cringe the effects are completely lousy which i usually don't mind for older films but this was made just two years ago and everything about it just annoys me a few friends go out on halloween into the woods and meet a witch and her cannibal son of course before that it has the clichÃ© you really believe that ha ha ha it's just a story routine dragged out for a while the witch's cannibal son was made a retard i don't know if it was for comedy or to make it creepy but this film failed at both it has minimal gore and no nudity which made a bad film even worse heck the only good thing about this film is the leg eating scene and even that could of been better br br honestly don't even waste your time watching it on cable and certainly don't consider buying or renting this else you'll be kicking yourself for wasting time which could of been spent doing something more constructive or entertaining
<START> it starts out looking like it may be going somewhere then quickly leads the main characters into a three ring circus of remarkable stupidity which permanently destroys any likability of the characters i'm a huge collector of stoner movies but this is something i would not consider a valid addition bong water is trash from the very deepest regions of the dumpster and i wouldn't be caught dead with this on my shelf i'm actually convinced this movie was created by a partnership for a drug free america if you're a jack black fan then i would say that you may think 5 minutes of the movies is ok because jack black continues his legacy of singing songs for retards i really can't say enough bad things about this movie
<START> after the failure of hellraiser iii hell on earth the chapter that served as a kind of 'death to the franchise another embarrassing cheapo cash in did not come as a surprise an abysmal attempt to explain every single mystery of pinhead and the puzzle box covering literally centuries of history in a film that runs under 90 minutes on display is sub par to wretched acting par to wretched b movie special effects and a ludicrous and insulting attempt at dark humour while still attempting to keep the whole project completely serious i'm wondering how many freaking directors did this thing have poor pinhead has so much screen time that every bit of mystery and menace that this iconic character possessed is completely lost after an hour of hearing long winded speeches and dramatic posturing we simply want to tell the guy to shut up mildly entertaining in spots especially in the first segment this mess begins to look and feel like a cheap ugly made for tv splatter flick after a while and ends in the most ridiculous way imaginable pinhead along with his pet dog killing a bunch of idiots in outer space i'm sorry but any true fan of the first two films in the series that gave this abortion of a film more than 3 stars should be ashamed on a side note the film that follows hellraiser inferno is actually a surprisingly intelligent and stylishly made film noir piece that brilliantly as a master of illusion and cruelty and brings back the concept of the inherent evil in human kind that was the centerpiece of the original film and the whole point of the story for any serious horror fan see hellraiser i ii skip the lousy iii this one and continue with ' you won't miss a thing by skipping this garbage
<START> i'm the first to recognize that chan wook park's thirst is exceptionally well made but spending over two hours with tae ok vin kim is enough for anyone to tolerate for such a length of time sang kang ho song is a priest desiring to volunteer for experimental studies on those willing to subject themselves to rigorous injections concerning a specific virus which kills infectiously instead of legitimately dying becomes a vampire always yearning for the blood gives for him to fight off an infectious disease which returns causing the symptoms which flat lined him to begin with bumps sores and the body vomits blood sunlight as is known in the vampire genre causes torturous death if exposed to for a length of time falls in lust with tae the wife of sickly childhood friend kang woo ha kyun shin tae was taken in by mrs ra hae kim regarded as a puppy and practically used as a domestic animal to be ordered around ta is miserable in this situation and begins a torrid affair she with soon manipulating him into perhaps killing kang woo by having him believe she's a victim of abuse his priesthood dives headlong into the relationship with tae soon a willing participant in killing kang woo this incident which tae woo contributed to using a boat in the middle of a lake both proceeded to burying him underwater tae woo keeping him kang woo from re surfacing as he attempted to re enter will haunt both as circumstances arise with kang woo missing got rid of him where police would not find his corpse soon mrs ra suffers a stroke though one finger and the ability to blink her eyes contribute mightily as the story progresses showing that she more aware than they are led to believe and gives tae a special birthday gift vampirism in doing so has created a monster tae admits though a slip of the tongue that in fact kang woo never hurt her and as she for blood it is soon realized that killing for a supply doesn't bother her morally or psychologically tae becomes such a hand full has to take desperate measures if he is to stop such a menace to society himself included br br i will say that thirst is one of the best horror films i've seen regarding 2009 it's a methodical approach park takes and we are led down a dark road with and tae as they commit terrible deeds with nothing positive ever to come from their unholy union innocent people die because of love what once was lust shifts into an obsessive love by the end for tae and it will cease to end if he doesn't make a painful choice we see inside their heads their souls and it isn't always pretty 2 hours with them can be quite exhausting but credit to the director for pulling no punches in regards to devious behavior and how the powers of vampirism can be given to the wrong people seen as a rather pleasant soul at the opening accepts hell for tae so one could look at thirst as a unique love story but not exactly a healthy one br br in regards to the violence while park does have a tendency to pull away from extremely graphic details there's enough sadism involved to perhaps turn the stomach a bit at the very least the way the violence is carried out may be certain to leave a lasting impact the sexual situations between and tae can be pretty heated and erotic while also sordid and morally reprehensible the movie i think is still quite a complex examination of the lengths one will go to remain attached to an object of affection lust
<START> not to be confused with the 1943 george zucco movie the mad ghoul the mad monster is a film that zucco appeared in the year before in this fairly paint by numbers affair zucco perfects a way to turn his dim witted handyman into a wolf man hybrid by means of wolf's blood injections and then wastes little time in sending the transformed doofus to slay the former colleagues who had scoffed at his experiments it is a very simple plot really and an extremely low budget production glenn strange who plays the man wolf here would soon achieve greater fame playing the franky monster in films such as house of frankenstein 1944 and abbott and costello meet frankenstein 1948 the makeup job on him here is pretty lame and only succeeds in making him look like a hippy with bad teeth like the one in 1957's teenage monster the sets in this film in addition are fairly nonexistent and the denouement is abrupt and unconvincing i have given the movie a very generous 4 stars in part because i have an abiding love for 1940s horror films but truth to tell most objective viewers would probably deem it laughable crap and i suppose it is it's certainly no well crafted universal affair or val lewton masterpiece that's for sure still zucco is always fun to watch even in undemanding piffle such as this if you can spare 72 minutes of your life i suppose you could do worse than the mad monster not too much worse of course oh one other thing this dvd is from alpha video and you know what that means fuzzy images lousy sound indeed the worst sound of any alpha video dvd i've encountered so far and no extras you've been warned
<START> this is undoubtedly the most harrowing black and white war film that i've watched as a matter of fact the only western director during this time to remotely approach its level of intensity and sheer visceral power in his work was samuel fuller by the way i had attended a kon ichikawa retrospective at london's national film theatre in september 2002 but only managed to catch some of his work made between 1960 and 1973 br br the film is certainly as depressing as it's reputed to be however it also displays welcome touches of black humor throughout the 'dead' man who wakes up to answer a soldier and promptly again the deliciously ironic shoe exchange sequence a moribund eccentric telling the hero which part of the body he should eat etc incidentally the script was written by a woman wada the director's own wife br br ichikawa is a versatile and prolific film maker whose reputation may not be as high as it was during his peak years 1956 65 but his direction here is often striking the startling pre credits sequence the hero is violently rebuked by his superior officer for being discharged from hospital earlier than expected the death of a surrendering japanese at the hands of a gun toting philippine woman the bombing of a hospital with the medical staff running away to save themselves leaving the wounded soldiers behind to crawl out of the shack at their own limited pace the automated march in the rain of the disillusioned soldiers which also involves the afore mentioned business with the shoes that actually recalls a similar scene in all quiet on the western front 1930 a hill littered with the bodies of soldiers attempting to climb it the finale etc surely one of the film's major assets is the stunning cinematography of the unforgiving and desolate muddy landscape br br the film is notorious for treating the taboo subject of cannibalism almost 10 years before it became a staple of horror movies but approach is not only subtle but highly effective the flesh is actually referred to as monkey meat while the hero is seen partaking only once and promptly spits out the piece along with most of his decaying teeth conversely when the weak underling soldier played by mickey curtis who despite his name was a japanese pop idol of the time rabidly indulges the ground nearby is splashed with blood br br in the supplements ichikawa remembers that method practicing lead actor whose portrayal is unforgettable by the way arrived on the set at starvation point with the result that production was forced to shut down for two weeks until he donald richie's perceptive interview favors the nihilism of the film over the underlying patriotism behind such gut wrenching recent hollywood fare as saving private ryan 1998 br br fires on the plain is universally considered to be one of its director's top efforts and out of the several films of ichikawa i've watched the closest to it in spirit are the burmese harp 1956 another character driven war film but with a spiritual tone and which is also available on dvd from criterion and aka conflagration 1958 which was actually given a limited theatrical showing locally as part of a foreign film week a couple of years ago personally i also have a particular soft spot for the director's stunningly stylized color extravaganza an actor's revenge 1963 which i've actually caught twice at the in 1999 and the afore mentioned 2002 retrospective
<START> i really liked this movie br br everyone has something to be blamed for everyone is real no heroes or cold omnipotent know all characters br br i read many others viewers here complaining about anne morality and about james will to maintain his love for her despite her cheating on him but i don't agree br br i found anne emily watson absolutely wonderful and i felt love for her br br she was a heavily repressed woman her actions were not planned once she started to break free she was in confusion and did many errors but so it's in real life when you gain freedom you are likely to do errors at the start point br br was she a little too ungrateful maybe but we must remember that she is running with her feet for the first time she knows that james after all is a good man maybe a little too stiff serious and work centered but she also feels the urge to live the life as herself br br is she to blame more than him i think no br br but the turn happening into their lives generates some changes br br james instead of letting his wife go out of his life as other viewers suggested as the right choice bites the bullet and waits hoping for the better he starts to understand that what he superficially though was ok his marriage in reality was a control game played by him on his wife br br this is not a story with characters having over emotional and precarious nature i e the usual clichÃ¨ latin american or italian jealous guys this is a story of men and women that use both heart and brain br br it can be very painful but if you really love a person women or man and if you are not a terribly unstable nature you are likely to forgive his her cheating and let him her go unless you are a jealous prehistoric crime of passion inclined possessive and mentally individual br br a really good movie the last scene when james despite all the things happened before goes with anne to the train station is really moving she is free and he understood what freedom means for a person br br guido
<START> a tremendous action movie that i have ever seen it was the first expression that i uttered after watching it twice on the local tv in my country indonesia a combination between a constant shooting and a great fighting choreography played well by david bradley he was good here besides american samurai his skill in martial art was performed above average he succeeded to make the fighting scenes nice to watch not only punching and kicking like what most of martial artists show in their movies david bradley could utilize all the martial arts techniques such as throwing smashing and kicking very recommended for action fans i have tried to look for the dvd but i still cannot get it particularly in my town anyone could help me
<START> now before i tell you the synopsis this is a non spoiler review bone eater hits its mark for being the worst movie of the year i don't know how these movies even get onto dvd if i saw this in theaters i would get extremely upset bone eater is about these people who dig up an ancient burial ground and find some bones it's the eater' and the more bones he eats the more powerful he gets br br first of all i thought okay well the dvd artwork looks creepy and it sounds creepy when i rented it and looked at the dvd label it looked scary but then when i played it in i could agree on one thing the title eater' is better than the movie itself tell me what's more stupid a bone eater that just attacks by throwing a bone ate you and you disappear don't worry that's not a spoiler you see that happen in the first 5 minutes or is it more stupid that eater' has a horse you know what i think is the stupidest the whole movie br br the cgi is awful yeah i thought the idea of eater' was creepy but once you see the actual thing you think this is some kind of action movie or just a cruel mean joke the film felt longer than titanic and this was half an hour once the film actually has its moments of suspense it just stops i admit the acting was not the best but actually decent and that the violence wasn't over the top but everything else is a stinker br br overall bone eater is a film you can skip if you like interesting movies with great creatures great cgi and suspense eater' is a film to skip if you like bad movies no matter how cheesy they are then eater' will satisfy
<START> like some people here i love loved stingers in norway it got aired a lot later that also means that we are in the episode yea that's right i have to say that i really love stingers it can make me cry laugh smile and so on i think i'm going to die the day we reach episode number 192 stingers might be the on series except from grey's anatomy that i really watch the actors are amazing especially stapleton i think she is one of the best access we have i know he is not like super known but she is really a great actress stingers makes me want to be a cop i love it br br p s do you know if you can buy the episodes
<START> fellow noir devotees be not deceived this is a stinker poorly filmed poorly acted and there is nothing nothing here for the film buff looking for yet another solid b movie from the goldmine of the 40's 50's era of classics i gave it a try based on the relatively high rating on imdb there's no accounting for taste but i found nothing in this movie to recommend to other imdb members this is a classic example of having watched a movie and feeling like you have been cheated out of x number of minutes that it took the movie to get to its thankful demise to have alan ladd on the cover of the dvd tape is nearly fraud he is on camera less than two minutes and has almost no dialogue this isn't this gun for hire folks it is a classic in the lousy sense of the studios cranking out fodder on no budget we all search for the great ones save your time on gangs inc paper bullets it is lousy
