<START> as a kid i never understood why anyone would watch this very crappy show it was pretty stupid and i always wanted and jim jim to get in some sort of fatal accident they were that annoying br br now almost 40 years later i have a new attitude about the cartoon while i still think it was complete crap this is only in regard to the american version of the show that's because i was reading a book about anime and found out that the shows we watched growing up were completely different from those originally shown in japan you see the idiots in charge of the series thought it was too violent so they cut this out of the episodes that's bad enough but what else they did is beyond belief they actually chopped the episodes apart and spliced them together to create shows that were nothing like the originals for example one episode might be made up of parts of episodes 3 6 18 and 27 as a result i really don't know if the original show really was bad it might have been brilliant but who can tell considering all we have to watch is this americanized mess
<START> i like the star wars series i like a good cheapo sci fi flick every once in a while too heck i even like the roger corman produced nickel and dime br br i do not like the ice pirates though br br for one it just looks too cheap you know for a movie that's supposed to take place in outer space it feels cramped and closed in like it's being filmed in the front seat of someone's and the special effects while appropriately cheesy look more than anything like foam rubber painted metallic gray br br usually i don't let things like that bother me especially if the story and the characters are worthwhile br br they ain't br br the whole storyline about these ne'er do well space pirates who decide to find a planet loaded with ice they can melt down and sell as water a hot commodity in the future i guess is about as original as the jokes which is not a compliment br br the humor comes in at about crotch level like that castrating machine you'll see early on and everyone seems to have a cranky attitude and who told john that he was funny whoever did shame on them good old robert urich tries but he's a reliable actor on board a badly sinking ship or starship in this case br br i watched this one about three times and ended up feeling the same way every time br br no stars in spite of of the presence of huston one year prior to prizzi's honor and carradine at the tail end of a once lofty career these pirates should walk the plank
<START> i loved the great lighting and was warmed by this story of american working class society and life in the first half of the 20th century i was drawn in by the timeless watchability of this realistic performance see and feel the star power melancholic greek comedy anybody in the mood for a shot with a beer back or a little ginger hey waterboy
<START> renoir's tale of paris the cancan a washer girl and the moulin rouge a more subdued but highly entertaining version of the opening of the moulin rouge jean gabin gives his usual excellent performance the technicolor photography on the print i saw was exquisite an easy evening's viewing chris w
<START> being a huge fan of the bottom series i was really looking forward to the release of this film i was eagerly anticipating a laugh a minute roller coaster ride alas br br where to start on this mess i think its a good start to say that its hardly richie and eddie on our screens in the first place as none of the jokes and one liners they usually deliver so well are funny i was still waiting for the first laugh after a good 20 minutes of viewing many aspects of the story were pathetic and it was as if the film was full of those bad moments they rehearsed and decided to leave out of the final cut br br the overall sets and atmosphere surrounding the film is dark and dingy which i suppose is good if they want to portray the guest house the 2 buffoons attempt to run but to me its just puts an even higher on a sorry state of filming that should never have been created br br the acting at times is pathetic fielding is wasted as the loony mrs and i've seen simon pegg have much better outings br br i'd recommend guest house paradiso to anybody who is blind drunk because they might appreciate the terrible puns much more but to any bottom fan who hasn't seen this film and is expecting true richie and eddie action you have been warned
<START> this film is the proof that a good actor is nothing without a good direction ed harris is awful how could you cast an actor built like rambo to play the maestro he shows no credibility at all and overplays beethoven most of all long hairs doesn't look good at all on his head the main actress is missing all the subtleties needed for its character the camera shots are cheesy and too conventional the lights are to close of the characters feelings bad casting and cheap direction too bad the only scene that worth the movie is when i hope you don't care that i call him trough his nickname is turning the girl's song to a joke any way i hope that harris could find his way back to true movie where he can really shows his hairless talent
<START> i first saw this movie around 1968 and if i don't see it once or twice a year i'm surprised i've always found it engrossing well acted and for hollywood surprisingly accurate historically i heartily give it 10 stars and recommend it highly
<START> i didn't hate this one i just couldn't adapt to the story it didn't really grab me michael mann is a very good director but i have to disagree with his methods in this i'm also a fan of daniel day lewis some projects he's been in are pretty rubbish but his acting is brilliant my favourite daniel day lewis films are there will be blood and gangs of new york br br there is one thing i loved about this and that was the musical score it gave the film a lot of atmosphere thats about all i liked in it though this film has a high vote as well which is a bit random i can see that a fair few people will like this but not enough to make the overall rating 7 8 br br i would give this film a miss if i was you but there is a lot of high votes for this so i guess you should watch it and make your own views on what you think i didn't really like it 4 10 j d seaton
<START> when i heard disney had the rights to underdog i figured at the very least it would be a cool pixar partnership affair and we'd get a great adults kids film like the incredibles alas i forgot how disney must dumb down classic material for today's dumbed down youth what were they thinking underdog was a product of the 60's your prime fanbase is in their 40's and 50's why would you it to 5 year olds it should have been done ala roger rabbit half animated half real instead we get characters like riff raff a wolf dumbed into another dog underdog can't have an energy pill as we're now so enlightened it would obviously be a steroid or drugs reference the only good casting was patrick warburton as cad because he actually sorta resembles the cartoon version otherwise old school underdog fans should avoid this like the plague it is what next a live action version of the go go disguised as a re history lesson my advanced apologies if disney jumps on this
<START> the large bell in a bar intermittently rings for last orders and the inevitable rush to queue forms at the counter Â do we want what we need only when it's too late or is the irony of the opening scene's wailing cassandra a more resonant reflection of our perceptions on individual existence there's an endless fascination about where writer director roy wants to take us in his fourth feature you the living with fifty or so semi related vignettes strung together by a penchant for hyper reality its wistful interpretations and symbolic instances of life that bind us all in this great big cosmic sisyphean struggle the sheer simplicity of these vignettes act to the and immense of being apart of the symbiotic relationships we have with one another might whittle down the complexity of the human condition through harsh and fast cynicism more than he should but he also reminds us of the inherent reassuring glory of waking up each morning to a new tomorrow when we're all aware of our own distinct forms of arrested development
<START> you know after the first few chuck norris movies i got so i could tell that a movie was produced by golan globus even if i tuned in in the middle without ever looking at the credits or the title what's more i could tell it was golan globus within a minute of screen time something about the story structure the goofy relationships between the characters the mannered dialog the wooden acting spiked with the occasional outright terrible performance the scene tempos and rhythms that made albert pyun look like john the paper thin plots and not ready for prime time fight choreography golan globus has been incredibly consistent over the years in style subject matter and point of view br br what can you say it must work for them since they've produced literally dozens of movies you go to one of their productions and you know exactly what you're getting and it ain't brain food folks br br ninja 3 is another piece of in a long line of products from the g g sausage factory and offers the typical limited pleasures to the movie goers' palate you've got a bad ninja slicing up cops and criminals and anyone else who gets in their way you've got a good ninja pledged to stop him you've got a westerner thrown into the mix so we americans can identify with him or her in this case and be reassured that we can still beat those pesky orientals at their own game you've got a love interest who is usually also the worst actor in the film fencing with the hero you've got your endless string of assaults assassinations and lingering shots of men gurgling in agony while an arrow or throwing star sticks unconvincingly out of their eye neck or chest you've got your beefy white guy bodyguards in suits calling a ninja a 'son of a b and throwing a roundhouse punch only to get his ss handed to him you've got a final confrontation between the good guy and the bad guy which goes on for 20 minutes and just sort of stops like a roadrunner cartoon instead of reaching a climax or a resolution br br ninja 3 is a little different in that the plot revolves around a scrappy female athletic type getting possessed by the bad ninja so she ends up killing a lot of the cops and criminals and beefy white bodyguards in suits while under his spell but all the other elements are there as formal in their way as a kabuki play or a drama br br i actually thought lucinda dickey was pretty likable in this film she's nicely muscled and curvy has great cheekbones and some athletic to her movements and you can actually suspend belief enough to accept that her character could do some of the feats she pulls off in the movie she can almost but not quite carry this thing one extra start for her participation and good energy br br naturally sho kusugi is in here and he pretty much dominates the last 10 15 minutes of the movie and just to show you how 3rd rate and uninspired g g movies are the director and editor inter cut the last climactic fight between kosugi and the bad ninja scene with numerous reaction shots of dickey and her boyfriend watching the life and death battle with an expression of mild bemusement i'm serious for all the emotion and reaction they show to the proceedings they could be looking at a sea turtle in an aquarium at i can only imagine how dickey must have felt when she saw the finished product she probably wanted to run the editor through with a katana for real because those reaction shots make her look like a complete idiot br br an enjoyable waste of time but it definitely is a waste of time maybe if you are a sho kusugi fan or even a linda dickey fan you'd find it worth your while
<START> this movie is very scary with scenes where the devil uses horn to open heaven and pull the good angel dogs out and them on the devil sings and dances to a few songs about the joys of being bad and at one point eats a live rat br br we got this movie free with a pizza you get what you pay for
<START> on my continuing quest to find the worst movie of all time my friends and i stumbled upon this little gem it is hilarious through and through especially if you don't know like we didn't that it's a semi sequel to another horror series br br i won't bother going into the plot except to mention that everyone complains about the horrible snowstorm that was coming it was equivalent to the characters just screaming foreshadowing at the camera and waving their arms and in some odd twist of fate the snow storm ever occurs budget problems i guess br br add that to a magical front door that is opened or closed depending on what scare effect the director wants to create and the electricity being cut off until the gym teacher decides to take a shower with lots of soap i'll admit it i had trouble breathing at points br br the only actual decent part of this movie as it turns out was from the original slumber party massacre movie it's so much funnier now that i know that br br spoiler the end where it is revealed that the slasher did it because her drunk friends stumbled in on her and a female friend making out and then the friend driving into a train or something is probably the funniest psycho killer origin ever heightened by the fabulous use of blurring and stock footage i'm glad all of the friends forgot the incident completely until a flashback was necessary br br run don't walk to pick this up and see the hilarity of course the continuity editor should be given an award for all of this if only they weren't stuck in that horrible snow storm
<START> in a film as successful as this it is difficult to single out any one factor all departments work in perfect union to create on of the most moving human dramas ever put on film br br the production is a tribute to the ensemble efforts of the writers producer cast and crew to name but a few the magnificent score of hugo is a subliminal marvel the subtle yet striking photography of greg and the unbelievably effective direction by william wyler all combine with an ideal cast to create an american classic br br the dvd format version is a special treat to view what a pleasure to see the best years of our lives so beautifully preserved for generations to come to enjoy
<START> i should've realised it was a sign of things to come when the trailer for this film bored me br br having watched several indie films on the strength of the reviews on here and subsequently finding that my view is completely opposite to those other reviewers i began wondering if it's possible i am watching completely different films from these people or are they perhaps friends family etc of the film makers trying to 'big up' their work hmmm br br are you interested in seeing an homage to pulp fiction and 11 14 except done with worse actors a silly score undermines various scenes and unbelievable jumps in logic if not then skip this film br br here is my open letter to two of the players in this film br br alfonso morgan please please please stop trying to 'be' samuel l a la pulp fiction no one can do what he does as well as he does br br director please come up with something original it does you a disservice to churn out this stuff pretending to be quentin tarantino br br simply dire and i really cannot see how anyone could say this is a good film it is a disgrace that people have somehow managed to put a score of 8 5 on this the same as films like pulp fiction or goodfellas it is no where near these movies a 4 or 5 would be a more reasonable average rating i give it a 3
