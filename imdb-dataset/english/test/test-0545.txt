<START> this film is amazing while not perfect by hollywood standards it encompasses a gentle look at the wide divide between rich and poor black and white that is true in many parts of the world it handles the audience with kid gloves while delivering a truthful look at societal problems the children are beautiful take special note of the young man who plays the friendships that develop are universally true anyone can relate to the choices these young people have to make the influence of adults is interesting it appears to be taken from real life experiences as there are snip its of conversations and interactions much like a child would remember experiencing i would highly recommend this film
<START> imagine this a high school except it's boarding school and the kids don't have parents around oh and it's in malibu and the kids are all thin white and gorgeous with the exceptional token minority or fat kid to play the weird outcast and there aren't any reasonable rules like how they have co nuclear weapons in their dorms coffee stands a sushi bar and a complimentary laptop per student br br here's the story a girl zoey brooks attends a formerly all boys school absolutely perfect in every possible way she is smart pretty thin athletic creative and everything a perfectionist wants to be almost all the boys in school want her and every girl wants to be her friend she's the one everyone comes to for advice the one who saves the day with a simplistic plan and is just wonderful too bad none of this makes her likable br br are we supposed to believe that if we don't even come close to perfection we're bad people in the show nothing's her fault and if anyone contradicts her they're portrayed as the bad guy logan he may be a jerk but at least he has some kind of brain that thinks for himself instead of simply agreeing with the princess every time br br her loyal group of blind followers are chase the average dumb ass that has a secret crush on her michael the token black guy and the only decent actor on the set lola a wannabe actress and anorexic snobby airhead quinn the smart but clueless girl when it comes to teen stuff and logan the rich jerk who has a soft side yeah this show basically spews out stereotypes br br what ticks me off though is that they all try to pretend they're normal kids they complain that logan gets too much money while they have to work themselves even though they already go to a too good to be true boarding school and have relatively nice things that many teenagers can't afford they drink coffee and eat sushi on a regular basis hardly have homework and suntan almost every day wow they have it hard any other problems i'm too good looking rich and stress free i guess zoey 101 what's the 101 for anyway is nick's attempt at trying to portray teens realistically except they caught a glimpse of reality didn't like it and decided to give the kids lives like the asses on the hills br br but hey at least the set's pretty
<START> total disgrace truly awful the screenplay and dialogue is a joke and combined with a director who doesn't have a clue about life in saudi arabia it's not a surprise quite saudi film ha the director is palestinian canadian the writer is lebanese the lead actress is jordanian and the shooting took place in dubai and all those elements show very well to make the film far from representing the saudi society yes it contains some saudi clichÃ©'s the stuff we see in cartoons in the newspapers everyday but that's about everything the film had the opportunity to show real problem with saudi society or at least give us something new and genuine about the youth troubles and concerns in saudi arabia instead it copied and pasted from here and there and the result was a mess even the supposedly love story in the movie doesn't exist or at least we haven't seen it the only bright side in this total debacle is some good acting from the supporting cast the veteran sami was funny in a badly written role as the grand father which he is clearly got miscasted for he looks younger than the actor who plays his son also the actor who plays the fanatic brother's role al has done well in fact he was the best actor in the film the rest of the cast being professionals for long did an ok job but the lead actor was just bad he had one look of a little adorable bobby for all situations he couldn't even say his lines in a proper manner he has charisma that made him win the title of star academy a very famous reality show and he is good in interviews and tv shows but he was just the weakest link of this film the lead actress i didn't mind very much but even she acted badly in some scenes and overplayed her sensuality in unneeded way br br the film was a huge hit saudi flocked in thousands to neighboring bahrain and dubai to attend it when it was screened there and it made a tone of money then it was screened in pay per view then in broadcasting tv and that was in a span of a few weeks this was to cash on eagerness to homegrown entertainment but alas the film was neither homegrown nor entertaining
<START> some nameless aliens off on a distant ship from a distant planet have sent the giant robot kronos to rob the world of its energy they've got a prototype around mexico for openers and if he proves successful more will be sent it would certainly take a lot of time for just this one kronos to perform that task br br for reasons i can't explain the aliens first capture the mind of leading scientist john emery who telepathically directs kronos to his first targets since emery is killed off later and the monster seems to function well enough without emery as a controller why the aliens needed him in the first place is a bit bizarre br br in any event scientists jeff morrow barbara lawrence and george o'hanlon who work under emery aren't fooled a bit about his nature and of course they come up with a plan to deal with the raging metal giant br br kronos is a perfect film for the fifties the bad guys are never seen they're just out there looking to undermine mankind it's a perfect film for the cold war and jeff morrow assures us we'll be ready for them in the future br br the players look like they're having a grand old time mouthing as many clichÃ©d lines the writers could put in the script i get the impression that kronos is the kind of film ed wood might have done on a bigger budget with a bit more care
<START> i saw this movie for the first time when quentin tarantino showed it to a bunch of us at the alamo in austin he prefaced it with how freaking awesome he thought he was and how funny it was and in the context of his explanation it was hilarious i can see how it would be damaging to some audiences and the subject is not funny at all but there are at least three lines in the film that had me laughing so hard i thought i'd pee they don't come until after the halfway point but when they do oh god you will die oh and jim brown is brilliant he's not in a lot of the movie but when he's there you know whose movie it is naturally the best line in the movie and the funniest is his you'll know it when you hear it
<START> i found myself watching sex lives of the potato men with a furrowed brow puzzled why so many talented and witty comedians decided to be involved in a film so totally devoid of humour br br poo and wanking jokes are funny when you're eleven eighteen plus and you begin to lose friends around the water cooler br br maybe some enjoyment could be had from this movie if you're the kind of person who frequently plays practical jokes involving dog mess brown bags and matches or maybe partake in 'man' competitions on nights out by vomit urine etc when you're not back at your parent's basement punching your teenage wife br br even then sex lives it's hard to recommend perhaps if you're really weirdly into masochistic cranial surgery and spend your evenings happy slapping the elderly or watching toilets flush you might think a close up of a bogie is worthy of cinematic distribution br br i'd discuss characterisation narrative or performances had i not zoned completely out following the lengthy tuna paste vagina comparison
<START> this is halfway to being a top movie the opening section which spoofs hollywood social message films is absolutely brilliant it is a riot from start to finish br br the second section which introduces us to the main characters of the story is really great too we get a lot of great comic setups top notch performances and the dialog is really dynamic br br spoiler warning br br the one think that really annoyed me about this film though is the ending which i think contradicts everything that went before my interpretation was that this film was taking the mickey out all the silly prejudices and innuendo of small town gossip and national tabloid sensationalism i loved that the film was championing the cause that a person's sexuality is not determined by their hobbies idiosyncrasies fashion sense or whatever and then the ending goes and re enforces all the gossip and stereotypes that the movie successfully lampooned in the first place it turns out everyone was 100 right this was very disappointing to what was actually a great story
<START> a very interesting documentary certainly a lot more than sideways a pseudo wino drama where the capitalist conspiracy is revealed in all its greed according to the documentary and confirmed by the recent publication of a biography on parker only two men dictate the nature of in the world robert parker of and michel a french wine industry expert based in bordeaux and also known as a flying the director is clever enough to insert interviews of local wine producers from many different regions of france from sicily to argentina and interviews of the biggest players in the industry such as the family to uncover the wraps on the globalization of wine making and marketing a must see for anyone interested in the dark side of the industry drinking a glass of wine will not be the same political and commercial act after watching this well made
<START> going by the good words of my friends i hired this movie hoping that it would at least equal the laughs of the similar movie house party but i was very disappointed and very bored br br falling asleep while watching a movie is never a good sign i don't know whether this didn't appeal to me because i don't live in da hood or if i'm not black but it's probably one of the two br br it tries to spoof a few movies only coming up with a couple of laughs but in the long run it fails miserably miss it
<START> why is it that virtual x rated video game women can speak through their mouths but virtual fighting game champion dante has to use a combination of telepathy and over dramatic facial expressions i feel that either they needed to cast someone who looked more villain like michael big brown doe eyes don't exactly strike fear in the hearts of well anyone except for maybe casting directors who consistently cast him as either a villain or a heroic 'bad boy' or they needed to just let him use his real voice and move his mouth and maybe give him a costume that would not make him stick out like a sore thumb when walking down the street but of course this is the future and we must assume that bad fashion taste is considered the norm
<START> some things just won't stay dead they just have to keep coming back for more whether we like it or not i guess some people like to beat a dead horse the first 'ghoulies' was a surprise hit and it's first sequel was an even better film the third film took a more comical approach and by this point the little were starting to overstay their welcome i guess someone out there in hollywood thought it was a bright idea to resurrect the franchise but the outcome will likely disappoint fans of the previous entries br br pros the acting is actually pretty good for a movie like this a silly but fun score moves at an alright pace some cheese for those who love it some pretty good action packed sequences has a bit more plot than the others and unlike ii iii at least attempts to link itself with the original br br cons not nearly as much fun as it's predecessors though it has more plot than before it's a pretty ridiculous one poor effects the original ghoulies only appear in flashbacks and here they're replaced with two trolls who serve no purpose other than to be comic reliefs speaking of comedy all attempts at humor are lame is a direct sequel to the first film but there are so many loose ends for example i thought jonathan was done with black magic after what happened in the original not that it was spectacular in the others but this film's direction is especially bland br br final thoughts the first three 'ghoulies' movies are a bad movie lovers' dream this fourth and so far final sequel let's hope is a bit of a letdown sure there's some fun to be had but it just isn't the same the others are low budget too but the people involved put a lot more into them see if you're a completeist or you wanna see beautiful women in skimpy outfits otherwise just stick with the other three br br my rating 2 5
<START> one of the worst movie i have seen in 2009 so far the story hesitates between a silly thriller or a dumb comedy br br as nothings happens the void is filled with long boring dialogs that don't make any sense br br the cast is famous but doesn't bring any emotions except to fast forward the play br br and it happens in a plush seaside hotel that looks really gloomy in comparison the one of the shining is funfair br br nb a lot of users think that it is located in the french riviera they are wrong it isn't the south of france nice cannes but totally the opposite normandy to be simple the beaches of the d day that's why the sea is as grey as the sky and there isn't sun
<START> i literally ran to watch it expecting a film that will make me cry or touch my heart br br what i found was not heart rending but a lame exploitation of 1 strong human character br br between a pair of young lesbians and an obese man br br in a setting that is substantially devoid of sound not to mention acting of the most common br br it was not entirely bad as i have seen worst and i left the cinema 10 poorer but wiser that a film well advertised is not the same as a film well made
<START> i went to see quitting with high hopes because the director's shower had impressed me so despite a few lapses into shower ranks high on my list of all time favorite movies for its penetrating insight into family relationships and its generally superb acting and direction and i've seen it at least three times now br br but quitting fell flat in my estimation it seemed a pointless exercise and i was quickly so tired of the main character's insufferable personality that i was longing for the movie to end i admit to falling asleep six or seven times but it was only for a few seconds at a time so i think it's still ok to write this comment br br i did admire the parents and sister the device of using all real characters in the film is a nice one i've never seen used before br br disappointment aside i will still make an effort to see any film bearing yang zhang's name simply on the basis of the beautiful shower
<START> i rented this movie because i am a huge dudikoff fan i figured it couldn't be that bad boy was i wrong at the 15 minute mark i was the others to let me rip the dvd out and fling it back to the rental store but they refused they swore it had to get better br br they were wrong this movie was lacking everything the actors delivered their lines with as much emotion as a comatose rock the plot was ridiculous and i was offended that hollywood assumed people were dumb enough to enjoy it none of the characters interacted very well with each other ice t gives one of his worst performances here br br after watching footage of the wrong plane bad guys standing up to get shot and clips being emptied and missing everything i wanted to scream and bang my head on concrete the movie hit its plateau of ignorance when the people on the space station used an elevator to travel space suits are not needed and there is gravity in space regardless of what real astronauts may say br br i didn't finish this movie and hated it i don't want to finish this movie this is slow suicide i could feel my cerebral planning to avenge the torture i put it through
