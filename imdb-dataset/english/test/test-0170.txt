<START> usa the movie is like this you take a nap on a long hot sunday afternoon it feels great to close your eyes and let your worries drift away soon you're lost in one of those intense lucid dreams where you know you're dreaming but you still can't wake up not that you want to you go with the flow and soon you're in a kind of weird alice in wonderland story complete with characters you didn't think you could dream up they're telling you all kinds of crazy stuff about war and peace while taking you through a trip into the past and even the future br br the dream starts to get heavier and you feel like it's going down a path you can't control maybe you want to wake up so you try to open your eyes but you now there's destruction and sadness and confusion and scary voices telling you what could be truth or could be lies you're seeing images that flicker and change and then get clear but do you even want to see what you're brain is creating for you br br finally you're lost in a myth world and you realize the end has come the end of the world and the end of the dream it's over what do you wake up to what do you do next br br maybe you'll write down that dream because you know dreams like don't happen too often and when they do you better pay attention br br or maybe you'll crack a beer and forget the whole thing bad idea don't forget
<START> first off let me say that this is probably in my opinion one of the 10 most underrated movies since this came out in 72 i absolutely loved this movie it's very urban gritty no real hollywood glam added to it you can actually feel for all of the characters in here i love the blood just splattering abound in here joe pesci was pretty good in here but to me it seems like he was definitely outdone by the lead character joe cortese now i don't know anything about him but boy can he really act i believe this movie is probably true because living in new jersey living close to philly you here this kinda thing all the time i think that if the movie had a bigger budget and say robert deniro as jerry's boss you would have a perfect movie but hey who am i to argue i was so engrossed by this film that it is already up there in my mind with mean streets i wish hollywood would go back to this urbanized gritty display of movie making it would serve them very well to do so this movie is a great drama with great actors in it and i highly recommend it to anyone
<START> nothing better than an android boasting 80's technology and a coming of age storyline to pull your thoughts from the depths of your mind front and center to be taken captive by a beautifully lovable cast growing up in the 80's gave me the priceless opportunity to see re runs of not quite human on many special occasions considering the fact that my parents were never present during the viewings i would guess that i would most likely not enjoy it near as much as i did as a child so perhaps this is a film to dig out of your vhs collection and hand to your kids it can be found on the same tape as the apple gang and an episode of tour of duty that is if you recorded in lp mode of course
<START> it's not awful but what a waste lousy gags bad music poor drawings and animation br br regarding the impressive number of animators and on this picture from hum a hundred different studios throughout the world come on how can you expect something coherent when doing an animated movie this way i wonder if one guy on the credits one drawing the lines are rough the 3d work inadequate i'm not against it but not in this film but the backgrounds are corrects the storyline is rather dumb far from the precise cleverness of the bd and obviously aimed at an international audience to distribute a movie all over the world doesn't mean to take everyone in the world for a simple minded guy a cultural object is far more interesting when challenging even when it is a foreign movie being french in this case it's even worse br br some new stuff is doing well the olaf character sometimes like with the stone explanation but it's not great but the modern references are exasperating music not even a verbal joke just a stupid bird named short message service does anyone know imagination but hey it's a production with some celine dion in it pathetic br br asterix is underemployed and talks too much could be great like in the book but he is too clearly a cool guy having a love affair with an uninteresting made up female character in fact only the vikings wizard excepted are funny too much action not enough laughs the best part of the movie are the end credits not the music but the few stills it contains bd style well definitely asterix is not made to move
<START> this movie seemed like it was put together very quickly in both plot and graphics my two daughters were ready to go 30 minutes before the end of the movie which rarely happens when we go to the theaters this was a nickelodeon production and it would have been better if they had released it on the t v station the animation itself in some parts was o k but the plot was horrible a classic tale of a son trying to fulfill a fathers expectations is used in a lot of kids movies but the animation or graphics need to be really good to keep a childs attention this was not the case with this film there were also awkward elements between the lead male character and the lead female character that the plot could have done without
<START> probably one of the funniest movies i've even seen obviously this isn't intentional though it takes about half the movie for the main characters to realize what the big hilly thing is in the middle of the city is spewing hot red stuff and the other half spent diverting the flow through the city using fire trucks yer right it certainly made me laugh the acting makes arnie look like a rsc thespian it is amazing that films like this get commissioned a more interesting version would be someone going near an active volcano and filming it and would probably cost about Â£20 to make 40 i can see some guy pitching the film to a film company well there's this big volcano and it erupts in a city pretty radical hey if you can find it in the dollar bins maybe worth buying as after watching this most other films would look good
<START> to begin with i really love lucy her tv show still makes me laugh she was one of the greatest comedians who ever lived right up there with chaplin and keaton but her performance in this movie is disappointing she was too old and the gauze filters on the lens make her look like a london fog refugee she couldn't sing and her voice was so that she through every song her dancing days were long in the past just because you are a lucy fan don't gloss over this mistaken sad performance and sing it's praises i prefer to remember lucy in her wonderful tv series i love lucy and to draw the curtain of charity over the terrible mess of a movie called mame
<START> this show is like watching someone who is in training to someday host a show there are some good comedy ideas and tons of mediocre ones it doesn't look like the writers know the difference between what's funny and what's just weird or gross br br it has its moments when spike down a neighbor who had been letting her dog soil his lawn repeatedly it hit it's peak but the hilarious moments are too few and there's too many experimental comedy bits that miss the mark br br the show's better than say watching a test pattern or the qvc network but it needs some better writers br br reading the positive imdb comments on this show i am convinced that most of them were written by show and by relatives and personal friends of spike br br it just isn't very good most of the time
<START> well another shootem up typical run around film with guns revenge and violence not much of a story in fact i forgot most of what this film is about don't rent this one i think the exercise would be more entertaining during late night
<START> ironically what makes john carpenter's the thing such an entertaining sci fi film are its genre defying elements of mystery suspense and tight plot structure it puts to shame such films as aliens or armageddon that are content to the viewer with special effects while their plots revolve around stunts that butcher the laws of physics testosterone laden one liners heroes equipped with enough artillery to conquer iraq and pathetic attempts to inject meaning into the barrage on screen with emotional sequences that only serve to further insult the intelligence of the audience the supreme tragedy of course is that these kind of lobotomized movies are also the most popular i think that there is a cause for this although it isn't very comforting there is an increasing trend in our culture to passively surrender to the media to immerse oneself in the images we see without dedicating a single brain cell to comprehending the statement the work is trying to make this mindset is becoming increasingly dominant in all arenas even the once hallowed print medium is being diluted thanks to the abominable reader response theory that pervades our schools and the tabloid brigade that lines our magazine racks whose mentality appears to be infiltrating the once venerable mainstream press nowadays we just flip the switch and put our minds on pause is the thing a good movie for the rare individual who still values his faculty of reason a more appropriate term would be entertaining its plot keeps one guessing its ending is uncompromising and it has some redeeming statements to make about human paranoia upon subsequent viewings one begins to note a conspicuous lack of depth in the acting but the taut storyline remains compelling of course citizen kane it's not but then again sci fi never was a thinking man's genre
<START> producers golan and globus should have been ashamed to release this piece of trash publicly i know this is gonna sound cliched but compared to this the first hercules of 1983 looks like a mature and exciting epic this sequel is moronic cheap unredeemable childish phony inept and badly acted a landmark in bad cinema and one of the few few movies i've seen that really deserve the lowest possible rating no stars
<START> i saw this one at sundance and i can't figure out why it won the directing award it was painfully slow and literally colorless it's the type of movie that is only appreciated by film fest snobs who think any movie that a lot of people like must be beneath them br br the jury at sundance this year seemed to be making a conscious effort to reward the underdog ultra low budget films that's all well and good but this wandering dragging mess looks like a home movie mini dv shot in a snow covered gray winter results in a drab look for a drab movie br br certain motifs snakes are beaten to death in spite of the fact that they add nothing to the story and make no sense as symbols br br now it wasn't all bad vera farmiga is phenomenal in her role as a mother with a drug problem she will be going places and she deserves it her co star hugh dillon also does a fine job frankly there are many fine moments in this movie but they just don't fit together very well
<START> this was a random rental at the video store but i was impressed from the start wooden camera is a gem of a 2nd feature by an engaging director the film captures deeply insightful moments and several often times frustrating and complicated social interactions young interracial friends would experience in a modern post apartheid south africa the young actors are quite good and well directed in their approach to the core material and the dialogue is natural and interesting the film is very rich in visuals providing a frame by frame study of deeper understanding and fulfillment without falling into iconic stereotypes and clichÃ©s the musical score to the film adds body to the film without being obtrusive after watching it the second time i tracked down the dvd on amazon and have been happy ever since
<START> i am not sure who recommended surveillance to me but i think i have an idea one of the fat guys at the movies the person said they were astonished by how great it was and said it was one of the goriest disturbing movies i'm paraphrasing and doing this only by memory so forgive me if i misquoted at any rate i made the decision to watch it so i take full blame for my own miscalculation in watching one of the most horrible predictable and stupid movies i've ever seen strange i doubt i've ever called a movie stupid but that was the first word that came to mind about one third in and stayed in my mind until the end br br where to begin unbelievable premise and reactions incredibly brain dead characters could blame the writing or the actors or i'll just blame both and enormously bad acting i'd sooner believe bill pullman as president of the usa than a fbi agent here of course there's a reason for that and i'll partially go into that and to top it off if you can't figure the so called shocking twist in the first 5 minutes then you must have arrived late to the theatre or came into the room to watch it late don't worry they'll tell you the twist every five minutes thereafter br br there's been some serial killer s on the loose in the most depressing town in the county or world but there's more to the story some dumbass and corrupt cops like to blow out tires for their own amusement could there possibly be more oh yeah there's a family well maybe not but there are four humans one boy one girl and an adult couple the girl says she sees things with much less conviction than cole sees dead people in the sixth sense there's gotta be more to this than what i mentioned that's what makes a movie interesting adding as many subplots that may may not be developed is the way to go okay then i'll continue we have goofy fbi agents that made me laugh a pair of giggling druggies who's shocked at first their dealer od's but then resorts to robbery a gosh tooting great guy cop who must've been put in for comic relief who's always battling an angry suspicious cop and finally poor poor michael ironside who didn't just phone his performance in he barely text it in br br none of these work they're all told in various forms of presence tense or flashbacks and believe me you'll lose all sense of caring after the first of many subplots begin in addition the reaction some of these characters are the most shocking of all i guess i'm referring mostly to the cops but mainly the girl who did or did not just lose her family and barely blinks br br this stupid stupid movie stinks it's barely gory as the person that recommended it said it was unless his exposure has been limited to goosebumps stories and what's with the title surveillance oh i get it it's because it was used in 1 50 subplots just to film interviews since that's so random it might as well been called cop car bullet or coffee just stay away from this horrid mess
<START> even though this film is 11 years old i just rented it yesterday and i found it to be a really touching film the story of true friendship in the face of a very real monster is an inspiration and quite touching br br while i did not care much for the amount of language used by some of the young actors especially from i understand that art is imitating life once again does a magnificent job of the rough and tough very and i mean very disturbed wannabe bully his role in the client comes to mind and does a wonderful job of the witty somewhat quirky dexter a child who realizes that his life must end too soon br br while there are so many touching and funny moments in the movie i have to say that my favorite was when the boys were cornered by pony in the abandoned church and dexter cut himself saying his blood was poison while very resourceful and somewhat amusing seeing a grown man running away from two little kids it's one of the hardest scenes in the film br br definitely check this one out but prepared with your kleenex you'll need it
