<START> the obsession of and is not enough to make a good film pascal should have remained in our memory as a brilliant film theorist back in the it was not necessary to take the camera the result is quite frustrating itÂ´s a pity for his excellent leading actors
<START> i love this show it's truly unique i was under the impression it was going to have more seasons in anticipation of series 2 recently i purchased series 1 to re watch it in order to be refreshed when part 2 started now after watching it i was excited and craving more so i came to the site to see the schedule for the continuation i am really disappointed to see there no longer are plans for a second series as i was eagerly looking forward to watching more of this story i think they really dropped the ball on this one there was plenty of story line left to build on and lots of unanswered questions i'm now a very unhappy view and i hope that they would reconsider their decision and pick up the story where it left off
<START> i found this film to be one of those great heart warming gems the story line is tightly woven and the character development throughout fantastic i am a big fan of non us films anyway and this is right up there with happenstance the closet even king of hearts as is fantastic it is a love story in the true sense of loving life and the twists and turns it takes to get the viewer to understand enjoy view of life which nearly costs him br br more than he is prepared to give are wonderful his co star is unforgettable as his fed up wife i highly recommend this movie for the whole family my children loved it
<START> i just returned from viewing this academy award nominated doc and i was thoroughly touched and interested in exploring the works of this fellow i'd never heard of before of course i'm someone who's captivated with beautiful architecture so i realize others won't care br br we can only imagine if there had been a couple more visionaries in philadelphia back in the late 60's when kahn's plans were a possibility what a wonderful city center there would be if you wonder whether you'll see more about the bangladesh building at the beginning of the movie be patient for there it will provide the climax of the film at the end br br his son's personal discoveries in the process of making this film are quite interesting sometimes touching and even funny at times there is one of the most comical anti visionary rants ever captured on camera br br rounding out the good points of this doc is a touching musical score with some excellent expressive string music and expressiveness is a major point to be found in kahn's architecture the points made by other architects about the spiritual nature of matter and how kahn's buildings brought that out tie together the overall experience of this movie
<START> well the sci fi channel keeps churning these turkeys out and they seem to get worse every time when normally good actors like john rhys davies and giancarlo come off as rank amateurs you can imagine how abysmal the rest of the cast in this waste of your time effort is the only halfway decent thing is the rubber outfit of the creature which is glimpsed in such quick flashes that you don't really have time to see how phony it really is the dialogue the plot if this movie and i use the term loosely was food jack in the box would be a gourmet meal compared to this watch a re run of the munsters for the viewing your time would be better spent and a lot scarier as well
<START> i usually give sequels the benefit of the doubt and go easy on them but very poor the exact same as what happened in the first film happens here again the exact same only they wanted younger kids to be able see it this accounts for the repeated presence of bugs bunny but why they threw in one 'f is beyond me br br they didn't even bother to change jackie mason's character from dangerfield's let me explain in caddyshack rodney dangerfield played a boorish real estate owner who enrages the uptight members of country club in this movie jackie mason plays a boorish real estate owner who enrages the uptight members of country club a big effort they made to change the content of the script huh no i don't think so a very unfunny dan aykroyd shamefully copies bill murray's character he even goes after the gopher now more like a gremlin in much the same fashion as murray did br br there is not a laugh to be had a sample of the 'comedy' in this film jackie mason is getting ready for a hot date with dyan cannon he is in the bathroom is his robe he moves to the door to get dressed in his bedroom door handle breaks off wow that's the best they can do eight years to think of a completely new sequel and that's all we get i could have pulled a better script out of my ass br br see it only if you're a die hard fan of the original it's the only way you'll find any kind of laughs in it everyone else steer clear
<START> a scarily real drama there isn't another drama out there that has scared the crap out of me like this has the characters are not your typical islamic terrorist you have a blonde haired blue eyed guy who is as dumb as he looks he is a converted muslim a well respected business man who pretends to be jewish and a frenchman who has converted to islam but has clearly taken the word of the koran to a whole new level the hero of the plot is who is an undercover fbi agent who has infiltrated the terrorist cell and has to do all sorts of god awful things to prevent himself from being detected the first episode is a small taste of what's to follow although it is about islamic terrorists the drama has a unique way of pointing out that not all muslims are extremists which is comforting to those concerned with racism considering half the terrorist cell are islam converts it makes you think that maybe they are the ones to be afraid of the most chilling drama i've ever seen the reason its so chilling is cause you never know who your friends your husband or your neighbours really are terrorists can be anyone anywhere anytime
<START> i saw one life stand when it premiered at the 2000 edinburgh international film festival and was blown away by it made on a micro budget this black and white digital movie is very much a european film and succeeds brilliantly in spite of the limitations of dv the film works because it's in the indie tradition dealing with complex issues yet moving and relieved by touches of understated humour one life stand avoids falling into the trap of other uk realist films with ordinary working people portrayed as either hopeless victims or comedic stereotypes the performances are strong particularly maureen carr as the mother i understand the film has recently been released on dvd and i would definitely recommend it the rating on this site is misleading which is why i gave it a high score because the filmmaker may miles thomas obviously put her heart and soul into it and deserves better than 2 8 for her amazing achievement
<START> when i was a kid i loved tiny toons i especially loved tiny toons how i spent my summer vacation i thought it was laughs on the floor funny a few years later my friend had the video and i figured i'd watch it for the good old days i was still on the floors laughing my opinion the plucky and hampton skit is the best they decide to go to happy world land and they end up having a crazy adventure to get there all the skits are funny i'm still looking for the video so if anyone has any tips please write me br br this is one of the funniest cartoons i have ever seen br br 10 10
<START> all the airport movies are stinkers but this one is the biggest turkey of them all the formula was different for this one because it focused on two disastrous flights and a lot of plot occurring on the ground while the other movies focused on just one disastrous flight and less plot on the ground the stunts with the concorde are worth watching for the laughs although the special effects aren't as terrible as i'd expect for a movie of this quality made in 1979 george kennedy's sexist remarks are disgusting and his rendezvous with a prostitute in paris is totally unnecessary and made me gag a little poor martha raye was relegated to a role where she did nothing but relieve her bowel over and over in the bathroom there are no big stars in this movie compared to the previous films giving you one more reason not to watch this one
<START> this film doesn't know what it wants to be is it making fun of action movies in general is it satirical is it supposed to be a black comedy this is truly one of the worst films ever made br br lori petty is annoying there i said what everyone else is thinking it's bad enough that she's such a terrible actress route 666 bates motel but she doesn't even qualify as a mediocre b movie actress her screechy voice strange mannerisms and poor comic timing dot this film from start to finish until you just want to put your head in a vise and end the pain br br do yourself a favor and avoid this movie at all costs you'll be glad you did
<START> minnie and moskowitz is the most pathetic and love story i've ever seen between minnie a disillusioned museum curator whose abusive married boyfriend dumps her and leaves her even more uptight and confused than she already was and seymour moskowitz a parking attendant so desperate for attention that he spends his nights going to bars and restaurants aggravating people there is a chaotic and disenchanted match from the start just like so many pairings that we see every day br br in nearly every love story there is a man and a woman the man being confident funny either classically hot or attractive in his own way whose shortcomings are charming and the woman a wounded soul who could have any man she wants who chooses this guy because there's just something about him these movies make everyone feel so good because the characters embody what every man and woman wants to be not what they are minnie and moskowitz instead of indulging in any hint of fantasy in the realm of romance depicts people who may just be more common than the attractive confident people with so much experience playing the field what's the story behind the love affairs of the ugly alarmingly awkward man with no life and no job that we all run into or the woman so crippled by insecurity that it's difficult to talk to her br br this film is not as fascinating as cassavetes's faces or opening night but it has that riveting quality that cassavetes always fought so hard to render which is an unbridled depiction of people underneath the ego that hides behind itself in nearly all other films gena rowlands and seymour cassel delivering startlingly pitiable people are hardly likable moskowitz nearly drives us mad let alone minnie he imposes himself so forcefully in her life the dates are an explosion of the inner voices of ours that respond to the screamingly inept uneasiness on dates we've all been on rejections we've all swallowed and arguments we've all had that we know were our own faults i admire a film like minnie and moskowitz because as the trademark is with the films cassavetes helmed himself it identifies with us in 100 honesty our egos play no part in company with his characters thus a tremendous achievement per performance by actor
<START> i found this movie to be a complete waste of 96 minutes jones was a weird kid and is messed up according to my memory which might be wrong wasnt he only 16 or 17 years old spoiler why did he leave college and rent an apartment with a two crazy girls who feud over boys for a and the cowboy who lives underneath jones creeped me out too how he knew what happened in the apartments didnt float past me for a minute i do not understand his thinking about the girl that took pictures for fun and stayed in her room when mandy moore was always over and is was quite obvious that she wanted to be more than friends with him i dont really find this movie funny or artsy or dramatic or anything i found it to be stupid and a complete waste of time d f
<START> this movie is awesome due to the fact that it showed how good cartoons really looked in the 80s the animators were not lazy like they are today the cartoon had so much detail with very little resources they have with them compared with what we have today if more people would request these cartoons to be rebroadcast then maybe all of the other 80s cartoons would be shown on television once again therefore to finish my sentence i would just like to say that this was a cartoon that i grew up with and really would like it to be on tv once again
<START> tug 3 is absolutely right although i am sure that mr osmond wanted to make a sincere heartwarming christmas movie this one is as cynical and creepy as they come the religious significance of christmas is forgotten and replaced with cute kids clueless grownups and dopey villains the production values demonstrate that this was either filmed on a shoestring or by truly inexperienced filmmakers i suspect the latter unfortunately the worst part oddly enough really is the music you would think someone with a long standing musical career could do better than the title song but you would be wrong even my mom didn't like this movie and she likes the and sappy stuff
