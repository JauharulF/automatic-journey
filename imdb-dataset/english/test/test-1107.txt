<START> i can't believe how dumb this movie truly is the storyline written by keira knightley's mother is what ruins the movie to the extreme it is straight out dull absurd and makes absolutely no sense whatsoever br br this movie lagged so bad for most of it especially at the beginning the story just kept going on and on about their everyday flirts with each other often times seeming like a threesome in this movie you have an annoying deadbeat couple the poet and his wife who are complete total drunks from the start the wife sleeps around with other men to make ends meet while the poet is a pervert who thrives on cheap boos and women the wife who too quickly becomes friends with his former childhood lover played by keira suddenly gets jealous knowing full well that the two were lovers since they were kids something doesn't seem right here i mean come on get with the program lady you expect br br bottom line is former lovers meet again with new wife embracing it then gets jealous then former woman lover gets married and her husband gets jealous bombards the crazy drunk couple's home crazy husband calls police and they end up going to court for the man's attempted murder charges that's it summed up in a nutshell br br this movie had it's moments such as the quality and good acting by cillian murphy but other than that i cannot believe i watched it i complained about it during the movie and some family members watching it with me fell asleep i decided to give it a chance and i should have stuck to my first instincts
<START> if this film was just outrageously poor would be fine the problem is many take it seriously to make it short a few points br br there is no story no focus no lead whatsoever and all the questions raised fail to find an answer overall the film is extremely repetitive and boring i have been in war torn african countries several times and found all the lingering on local misery and hopelessness very painful to watch but still having no sense br br questions raised are pure manipulation and the truth is that they are no questions but statements br br i am no doc filmmaker but what's the point in raising for example the question of weapon smuggling if the only element brought to the audience is a local reporter's statement the director doesn't even bother showing us at least a sequence where he would be waiting near the airport trying to spot heavily loaded trucks leaving the area right after a plane landed br br the story of the fish takes up less than 5 mn and is only supported by a sequence where the director films a documentary shown during a local conference did this guy do any work at all br br abject poverty is shown all the time in endless sequences but where's the point one can go almost anywhere in africa with a hand cam and shoot the same images unfortunately where's the big news br br filming the prostitutes watching and crying over images of their assassinated friend and fellow prostitute is worth the worst emotional manipulations one can see these days on thrash and real tv br br the parallel drawn between the famine devastating the country with over two million starving and the of fish is absolutely pointless dishonest and makes no sense but to manipulate viewers in typically anti globalization and anti western feelings br br there is an interesting debate in france after an academic published a very detailed comment on the film which brought number of journalists working in africa for decades to investigate a bit further about several details it turns out that br br the fish waste shown drying in the sun and collected by some local people is not at all meant to be eaten by human beings but is collected to be exported for reasonably good money for animal feeding purposes i think i am not the only one having had the impression that the director suggested the exact opposite br br arm smuggling is a reality but there again where's the big news but not the way this film explains the issue if the empty planes landing in do participate in smuggling they actually unload their shipment in a different location in africa then go to to pick up fish in order not to make the trip back empty meaning that they do actually land empty in br br people do eat fish locally contrary to what the film suggest around 40 60 of what is taken out of the lake and thousands of people make their living with it good for them it's private business of that kind that will one day take african countries out of poverty and not western moaning and endless foreign assistance br br i cannot tell how shocked i am seeing the success of this film
<START> this lasted several years despite the late hour it was on br br like a lot of 80's crime dramas it looked cold both physically and figuratively this isn't a bad thing though and the obviously low budget actually worked in it's favor gritty during a time when 'slick' was in br br allan royal's wraparound segments as the news writer gave it a slight edge br br the only actors i remembered were scott earthquake and tony sctv the cast of barely knowns was a good thing because one could see the group as a whole and not as a bunch of people supporting a 'star ' and yes that's a young clark johnson homicide in a recurring spot br br i hope a dvd release is in the future someone out there wanna get on that
<START> irwin allen's first venture into all star spectacle was one all star disaster the story of mankind contains some of the most incredible casting decisions of all time virginia mayo as the blond cleopatra dennis hopper chewing the scenery with napoleon peter lorre dining on the scenery for weeks as nero marie wilson as marie antoinette as a roadshow marilyn monroe that's just some of them br br the film also is known for being the last film which featured all three of the marx brothers though they all have different roles chico plays a monk who is christopher columbus's confidante groucho the indians out of manhattan island as peter and most astonishing of all harpo marx as sir isaac newton who discovers gravity when an apple him on the bean br br holding all these portrayals together is a story where mankind itself is being judged a super h bomb is about to be discovered and let loose will do in the world's population it's judgement day a coming br br but mankind has its advocates and detractors speaking for the prosecution is old scratch who's been bringing the worst out in man for centuries in the form of vincent price but man has his good side as well and who better than ronald colman to demonstrate man at his most civilized best colman and price plead their case before the judge played by cedric hardwicke br br in those three individuals you have some of the finest speaking voices the english language ever knew when the film is on them as they each bring out the exhibits for their case it's a pleasure to listen to then when the focus is on the individual stories you want to scream in agony br br what was irwin allen driving at i'm still trying to figure it out was he deliberately camping it up with some of these casting decisions if it was satire it just doesn't get off the ground br br this was ronald colman's farewell film and while it's hardly something i'd like to go out on i can't think of any man who could have stated the case for civilization any better br br so when you see the story of mankind fast forward through some of the exhibits and treasure every moment the advocates are before the judge
<START> i saw this film because did the score a real disappointment annoying trendy scenes with urban hipsters and their cliche hip lifestyles cheesy stereotypical mexican border culture mystic grandfather with the rattlesnake and potions granddaughter in her mariachi style restaurant a few laughs but hipper than thou and sorely lacking in vision and basic filmmaking talent
<START> i'm a sucker for mob gangland movies so i rented this movie this movie is a complete train wreck with all the big name actors in this film i can not believe how bad it was it was so bad that i began laughing hysterically towards the end of the film the actor better known as zues or the big dude from the ice cube movie friday does an incredible overacting job throughout the film first thing i told blockbuster when i returned the film was to remove this garbage from their shelves do not rent this movie unless you want to waste two hours of your life if they come out with a sequel i wonder if it will be twice as bad as the first i will be more cautious when renting so called movies
<START> if this film is an accurate display of j acting skills i think he made a big mistake leaving television hasn't he watched any films starring david caruso especially cold around the heart along the lines of acting ability what about mary louise she has done much much better yes it is a terrible script ineptly edited and totally lacking in continuity but skilled actors can and have overcome similar obstacles a very big disappointment
<START> for me this wonderful rollercoaster of a film bears repeated pleasurable viewings its about the tangled lives of three very different people holly hunter is the obsessive workaholic producer albert plays the but brilliant journalist william hurt is the affable but dumb new kid on the block news anchor br br the classical love triangle emerges with the stunningly witty and self deprecating in love with hunter but she of course is attracted to hurt br br this film works on many levels at the very least it is a brilliant comedy with the one liners flying so thick and fast that each viewing bears a new harvest of ones that you may have missed last time its also a film about attraction and unfulfilled romance br br but perhaps most importantly the film examines the modern obsession with physical appearance and its ultimate triumph over intellect as a valued human attribute this is personified by the meteoric career success of the hurt character in contrast to relative decline br br despite being fifteen years old the film has some relevant messages about modern news values and the continuing decline in journalistic standards br br this film is a classic in every sense and it is difficult to understand why it has been so neglected
<START> in 1984 the karate kid had some charm to it even if it was little more than a poor man's rocky alas producer jerry failed to realize it was best to leave the story at the point where it had ended and convinced ralph macchio and pat morita to make an extra effort to turn the film into a trilogy part iii was the definitive low in the franchise yet someone must have thought the series still had some potential what other explanation could there possibly be for the existence of the next karate kid br br wait a minute next yep macchio's gone at least he was smart enough to stop eventually and his replacement is hilary swank playing a troubled teenager what else named julie pierce now the girl has family issues she also gets in trouble at school said school has a sadistic gym teacher michael ironside as it turns out though one of his students is actually a nice guy and julie falls for him this gets her in bigger trouble than before of course lucky for her she is currently living with mr miyagi morita an old friend of her grandfather who happens to know how to get back at the bad guys br br all those factors ad up to seven clichÃ©s and that's just a generic plot summary imagine what the detailed scenes must be like from beginning to end the next karate kid is a tired flat and dull marathon of idiotic lines and set ups swank does thankfully have the likes of boys don't cry and million dollar baby to redeem this disaster but why did morita accept to come back he may have received an oscar nomination for the first movie and was quite enjoyable in the sequels but has nothing to speak for him here even the revival of the wax on wax off gag is stillborn as for ironside he is slightly better than martin kove and thomas ian griffith in part iii but that's hardly a stretch br br so is this picture really that awful not exactly there is one sequence that manages to achieve a weird beauty but when the best bit in the whole film involves a group of asian monks dancing as they hear pop music for the first time in their lives it doesn't qualify as a recommendation to see the rest
<START> the show itself basically reflects the typical nature of the average youth partying and picking up chicks is the common weekend goal at the clubs people frown upon the show due to its perverted idea of picking up girls using technique and strategic characterization but truth be told practically every young guy is out doing it at the club overall the show really appeals to the younger population as we like to see the outcome of a player's performance at the club as the show offers a comical approach made possible by the judging panel br br 10 10 a cool fun and thrilling series that allows the audience to really interact good job boys
<START> estevez martin sheen and kathy bates are superb in this portrayal of a vietnam vet home from the war but still haunted by it bates plays a clueless mother who just wants the family to be a family sheen is terrific as the father who tries to understand what his son is going through but is too wrapped up in his principles to really empathize the setting is thanksgiving day and the relatives are coming for dinner estevez who plays the returning vet wants no part of family tradition and insists on wearing his combat fatigues to dinner explaining this is what i wore last thanksgiving the bickering and family arguments are priceless particularly the peanut brittle crisis but the ending is both gripping and terrifying it has to be seen to be appreciated br br overall one of the best movies i've ever seen
<START> this mostly routine fact based tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole this is the story of a highly trained military man unhappy with his wife and children fakes his demise and runs off with the other woman to support her in the manner in which she is accustomed he robs banks predictable but not a bad watch
<START> i loved this film because of the dialog and superb acting by candace and jacqueline however i never knew until now watching a bette david marathon on tnt that this film is a remake of a 1943 bette davis classic called old acquaintance bette co stars with miriam hopkins who she was in a terrible feud with during the making of the movie because bette had had an affair with husband who directed her in a film before they made old acquaintance br br anyway both are worth every minute spent watching i highly recommend this film if you like a lot of dialog and drama it's a study in the psychology of women and their relationships with each other in my opinion
<START> i went in expecting not much from human traffic and came out really pleased the film is well made and acted and very stylishly shot it has so much going for it it's a film i really recommend especially to those who liked trainspotting or for those who like to argue the debate in the drugs and the media sector tremendous fun
<START> this movie starts out as if it were a comedy it almost appears that the actors are reading off of cue cards especially in the airport sequence william smith plays the role of a hunter who is quite twisted and deranged smith seems to always play villains such as in the ultimate warrior 1975 and the frisco kid 1979 to name a few although in this film the villainous role seems laughable this is one of those films where senseless things take place only to fill up screen time such as the girl chasing sequence at the beginning and the long silly motorcycle race i give this film 1 10 i would have liked to see this film on mystery science theatre it would have been hilarious
