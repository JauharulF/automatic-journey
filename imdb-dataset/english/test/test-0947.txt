<START> i realise it's very hard to live up to the first the 10 commandments movie which was grandiose and personally not a charleton heston fan but wow this movie mini series was disappointing even the animated the prince of egypt was better br br the one thing that threw me off was compared to yul version paul version just seemed so weak and un like the acting really wasn't that great for a modern adaptation i was expecting something better it just didn't look as stunning visually as the first one i guess they were running on a tight budget or something there's an occasional voice over narrator which i found strange and unnecessary it also broke up the flow of the story and um god's voice lines were kinda weird
<START> br br i still can't belive louis gossett jr agreed to appear in this film everything about this move feels artificial forced and contrived the air sequences are flat the enemy characters seem like puppets this is just a poor excuse of a movie at least top gun had air sequences that looked good the external shots anyway the songs by queen are cool though rent midway instead
<START> the first child's play was an original and effective little horror movie as expected though the 2 horrible sequels seemed to spell the end for this franchise br br well when i heard they were making a 4th one called bride of chucky i just rolled my eyes and muttered a when will they ever learn br br but when i heard that they had gotten a great director ronny yu and a solid cast including the awe inspiring jennifer tilly my interest in it perked up br br this film is extremely well done it has a great sense of humor highly stylized graphic violence great cinematography and the stunningly sexy jennifer tilly strutting her most impressive stuff during the first half i should add that she is also a fantastic actress as well br br it keeps it's tongue firmly in cheek without veering into campy territory the doll effects are great and the verbal interplay between them is priceless it's more of a horror comedy than straight horror but the humor is welcome and well integrated br br i've already heard that they're planning a son of chucky if they can match the quality of this film than maybe this franchise will have made a legitimate comeback br br rating 8 5
<START> on monday earlier this week sometime in july i happened to be under the influence of the sweet leaf and me being a horror fan wanted to see something scary i was thinking of the horror 2 but i got something way better i was at my friend's house and he had the vhs evil ed no cover or anything he didn't even see the whole thing himself but he told me it was about a guy who goes crazy and kills a lot of people well this movie was very shocking i've never seen the actual brutal nature of sadistic violence until this movie it buries ted bundy and ed gein both it is pretty funny too with references to the evil dead trilogy and plus the evil dead 2 poster is everywhere in the movie the movie is about edward a obsessive compulsive nice guy who happens to be a film editor he is then lent to another department in the building and he is sent to the posh yet violent world of sam campbell the splatter and gore department sam campbell eddy's new boss is telling eddy about the big break on his movies the gruesome loose limbs series and he needs eddy to make the movie somewhat less violent so they can be shown all over europe eddy has his regrets soon as the images and scenes that are displayed to him from the lonely suburban house he is sent to work in and then what happens from there is truly nightmarish imagine yourself in his place the acting is great the overdubbing is little funny sam campbell's voice is often found funny same with the other actors however the overdubbing job was done pretty good i give this movie a 10 10 and it's a good introduction to the gore sub genre to horror very good nightmarish bloody you just have to see it for yourself br br quote from movie where in the f k is my beaver rape scene
<START> wow well you know those shock things they use in hospitals to get your heart pumping again i needed one for my brain after watching this movie it literally took me almost 4 hrs in total to watch because i had to take a break and restart my brain to semi normal functionality every so often i mean this movie goes soooooo slooooow its ridiculous to say that the script had about 10 pages of dialogue would be generous they just don't talk and while talking isnt everything and i admit there were some scenes where only the music was necessary and the music is great that was probably the best part but then go listen to a symphony or something and forget about the movie so many people give this awesome reviews and for its time i'd say the special effects and filmography is quite good but as for the acting or lack thereof it just needed a little something more no shootem ups or sex etc profanity isnt even required but a little more emotion these guys were like stones just sitting there with long faces all in all if you need something to calm yourself down just play the movie dont even start at the beginning if you've seen it before just start anywhere lay down and relax it'll put you right to sleep
<START> ok i've seen over 100 troma films and some of them are pretty bad sizzle beach u s a was horrible and i was a teenage tv terrorist was unwatchable but this is the worst film in the troma library br br a bunch of women are kept in a prison and tortured as they try to escape br br this is really terrible even as exploitation films go doris wishman and gordon lewis would probably kill the director if they saw this poor excuse for an cult film avoid this movie at all costs br br
<START> it's a talking trigger happy alcoholic ass cop i have seen the first and second episodes the artwork and animation fits very well note the facial expressions lol the main character being a gun toting badge wearing pair of butt cheeks shooting at whoever he thinks to be offensive or guilty so far the episodes have had simple and followable plots that work very well with investigations don sanchez partner play's the sobering retort to a a antics and random i've got a hunch leads lines are very funny and clever here's one for example i've got one bullet and its got your email address on it don't make me hit send bang looks like your in box just got some new mail the think box at mcgee's headquarters are so far consistent and on cue as for the sound it's perfect the sound effects and voice work are 9 10 sounds like sylvester stallone all boozed up don sanchez the mayor the chief of police all have voices that fit there persona's very well i recommend this to anyone who wants to catch a few laughs before they go to bed as it does air on adult swim on sunday nights very funny imaginative visually different comedy 10 10
<START> this show was crap when it first came on the first actress that played the daughter didn't fit the role the writing was hit or miss and damon wayans clearly wasn't comfortable doing such a cornball family friendly show the chemistry between himself and cambell they're long time friends as are all of the wayans clan with husband and will smith and jada pinkett did work so they retooled the show once it returned they recast the daughter made the son much dumber a la eric from boy meets world and made the youngest daughter into a genius later they gave her a little genius boyfriend to do comedic guest appearances the show while if often from over the top buffoonery to being corny walks the line enough to keep it as a show that you can see damon wayans be comfortable in his own skin on the set especially since the main writers directors and consultants were all members of the wayans family and in his character once everyone had been on the show for a while they worked to everyone in the casts strengths and were able to make a consistently funny show on the air br br however there is too much buffoonery too many over the top antics and oftentimes too much chaos happening in the life of the kyle family they made junior too stupid they also made the eldest daughter an attractive clumsy idiot from time to time and the youngest daughter wasn't even spared by the writers i feel they jumped the shark and signed the shows death warrant when junior got his girlfriend pregnant she moved in and he married her and her parents were introduced junior's wife's father's character makes me wince just thinking about him the show remained funny but it was a upn show on abc if that makes any sense to the reader br br the reruns are funny enough but i'm relieved it's over there was nowhere left to go with it when it's bad it's really bad it tends to be cornball at times but at least he was a black man who had a sitcom make it to syndication on a major network who can say that for themselves now given the cw and the on tv networks lately that is one
<START> nice description of the situation in the us it explains different kinds of islam not just show terrorist and extremist islam can be other thing that killing they show why some people become terrorist and how to be muslim without being extremist it is a great series that muslims and no muslims should see now we hope that other series or films will be done to change the idea of all muslims are terrorist and all americans want to destroy islam it gave me the interest to discover what islam is exactly and what the us and also european government do to help cohabitation between people of different religion
<START> you might suspect that the plot of this movie was written in the process of filming it begins as a punks versus vigilante movie but in the middle of the film the plot changes abruptly when the vigilante turns to be an honest man with his honest girl and his honest gym and has to fight the corrupt businessmen who want to turn the gym down at any cost to build a mall or something then the plot changes again and we forget about the corrupt guys the villain now is the friend of the leading man who thinks he is a ninja the guy becomes crazy evil and wants at any cost to win a martial arts contest seeing this movie is like having a nightmare with the television on
<START> it is real easy to toast roast flay and otherwise burn this film for all of its abundant flaws it was made by high school students and faculty and a whole community it shows sure i could examine the script which is just ridiculous a monster created from the garbage of a growing californian city starts eating garbage and taking garbage cans all over the city soon this huge beast with wings no less begins to destroy buildings and even plays the beauty and the beast act with a young high school girl fortunately for her there is a gang of guys her former boyfriend nicknamed the penguin and the town drunk out to help her the direction is awful the production values just dreadful the acting non existent and the pace sluggish the movie is hard to sit through period however that being said it is also a miracle of a film when you consider that this thing was crafted by an entire community you can see all the collective effort from the actors the actual mayor and actual firemen and policemen to the area location shots used i also was really amazed at all the local businesses credited at the film's end with helping to finance or contribute in some way to the film when you look at the film from that perspective it is indeed quite an achievement i didn't know anything about it before i sat down and watched it now that i have found out something about it i am impressed but make no mistake i have no no desire to sit through it again
<START> sure you get to see some boobies but if that's all you're looking for in a film you get more mileage from youtube i just paid a dollar from because i saw val kilmer's name bad move plot didn't dialogue was shoddy characters undeveloped at best somebody said cinematography was alright but don't expect too much this movie moved very slow and ended without grace blacklist i spent much of the movie wondering if some event or color scheme of things was symbolic i never actually rewound to figure it out because nothing was ever explained in the end no twists it also left many questions that as it turns out i had no desire to hear answered one of the worst movies i have ever seen
<START> when i was a little girl i absolutely adored the swan princess it was reliving the same fairy tales of snow white sleeping beauty and cinderella the princess and her prince who saves the day is always a timeless story that will never die well hopefully but i figured that i would check out the sequels for the swan princess to see what they were like and unfortunately this is the typical cartoon sequel that just disappoints more than entertains the only character i found still very amusing was the queen she was very funny in this movie and had the best part but with the voice changes they were noticeable and also bothered me quite a bit i don't mean to be picky just it was too weird for me the story also was just more or less borrowed from the first swan princess just the villain in this movie is following footsteps br br odette and derek are about to celebrate their one year anniversary but derek has been too preoccupied with fighting for his kingdom to keep it safe with his mother's birthday also coming up he forgets about that since there is a new villain in town who is hoping to go above and beyond where powers went and kidnaps the queen on her birthday but odette must change back into her swan self in order to help derek fight him and save his mother br br the swan princess 2 is of course more than alright for the kids that i never mind it's good clean fun for them the reason why these sequels are disappointing though is because it is usually just for the kids that is the audience they aim for but it's more enjoyable when the jokes and story can be enjoyed by everyone now there are a few laughs and giggles here and there but this wasn't as clever in my opinion to the first swan princess i would recommend it for the little one's but if you're looking for a fun cartoon movie i'd recommend staying with the first swan princess br br 4 10
<START> i came across this movie on dvd purely by chance through a blockbuster rental voyage to the planets is an excellent bbc 2hour documentary drama about a future grand tour of the solar system taking pains to adhere to current knowledge about the planets and space flight and plausible from existing technology this movie tells the story of astronauts on a journey to venus mars jupiter saturn and pluto br br the special effects are excellent for a tv show i found the actors believable as astronauts the situations presented are for the most part plausible and you learn a lot about the science of the planets and spaceflight only two minor complaints i found some of the situations and dialogue somewhat maudlin at times furthermore i am unsure that a single crew and ship would be sent on a single mission to see all those destinations at once time more than likely visits to venus mars jupiter etc would will be separate missions br br they didn't try to skimp on this show with production values the scenes of venus and mars were actually filmed in the northern deserts of chile the driest area on earth and a dead ringer for the martian landscape sequences were filmed in a diving russian transport jet the producers could have fudged on either of these using studios and cgi but chose the real thing instead br br i would like to especially mention the marvelous music that was composed for this movie don davis's thrilling theme is the first thing that grabs you when the movie starts as the magnificent shot of the pegasus passes the screen and david suchet intones it is the destiny of man to explore the stars br br watching this on a small television screen is one regret i have what a thrill to see this in a movie theatre or even better an imax presentation
<START> i had been very curious to see the original six hour miniseries that steven soderbergh's latest movie was based on and now that i have i am happy to say that one is not better than the other they are both intelligent involving and extremely entertaining the only real advantage that the miniseries has over the movie is that it is three and a half hours longer so we get to know the characters more in depth br br there isn't a false note to be had in this production one that you should definitely make time for when pbs re broadcasts this miniseries sometime in 2001 you won't regret it
