<START> possibly the worst film within the genre in existence it was announced as a comedy but is simply tragically pathetic i don't think anyone could have achieved anything more terrible and irritating if they were specifically requested to it is toilet humour at its very poorest i would avoid even watching the trailer i only went to see it because it was announced that if you like monty python you are bound to love this whoever wrote that was either biased or seriously deranged i am still bewildered how one can honestly believe such a statement rarely do i leave the cinema really it takes a lot of effort for a film to have that effect on me this one did it in just 30 minutes
<START> why can't there be better tv movies made i was at a loose end today and watched this film on a satellite channel in the uk what a terrible waste of my time it was poor sets poor acting oh my god what a terrible flood blimey that woman can even outrun a torrent of water too br br i really wish that people would make tv movies using better effects better or at least more believable plots far better acting killer flood is well up there with poor acting a few bits of ham couldn't act any worse br br 1 final thing i really agree with the comment about the dog but i believe it would of already in real life
<START> this movie has got to be about one of the worst i have ever seen the humor was crude hardly funny and been heard a million times before the start was noting special and it got worse and worse as it went on i got about halfway through and couldn't stand to watch any more of it luckily i was only watching it on tv so it didn't cost anything but i seriously recommend you do not waste you time or your money br br nothing in the movie was new the characters were not at all developed i actually think it would have been better as a little kids movie in that it was full of stupid unrealistic funny events occurring thats like what happens in home alone or something not to imply home alone was in any way as terrible as this
<START> even though this was set up to be a showcase for some kickboxing and swordplay vampires the turning could have aspired beyond that because it doesn't even aspire to be a good vampire movie fails to deliver any punch that it may have been attempting to br br using the idea of an 800 year old thai vampire was interesting but the story about progeny she mistakenly brought into existence and now must wipe out actually reminds me of gizmo and his plight in gremlins and that isn't a good thing when it come to a vampire flick br br stephanie chao is attractive and serves as the good vampire very well but her lack of any accent grates when you realize that she's an 800 year old vampire added to that when she tells connor he's a young soul she doesn't deliver the line with much of the weight you would expect from an old soul attractive but not believable br br meredith monroe was more believable in her role but for a dawson's creek alum you would think she would have more screen time the question of whether amanda succumbs and turns is the most compelling reason to continue watching this movie and you never get it you get a tease of it but you never actually get any type of development out of the characters for that plot device it's a cheap way to play your audience folks br br if you want something that is a good vampire movie go find lugosi's dracula and if you want a sexy vampire movie you have dozens of flicks from hammer with a lot more strength than this one in the end if you want good or sexy this isn't the place this is just forgettable
<START> after reading so many glowing reports of 'to serve them all my days' i went out and bought it for christmas a waste of money i'm afraid i was looking forward to something in the same league as and some of the few other great productions from british television but this is decidedly not among them br br the characters are all too good to be true swathed in a very predictable plot and with the most trite and eye rolling script i've heard in years yes it has its moments but they are very thin on the ground the lead actor is interesting mostly because of his uncanny resemblance to anthony andrews sebastian in only dark but his undoubted talents are wasted on a character who is insufferably self important and priggish his is attributed to the effects of his experiences in the somme during ww1 he does the early episodes centered around his nervous condition better than he does playing the the squeaky clean socialist do gooder later on br br the women are completely unbelievable as in un real his first wife is annoyingly chipper and chirpy the girlfriend the perfect sophisticated slut and the last lady a hodge podge of political bosh the most interesting characters are howarth alan and one of the other masters named i forget the actor's name br br the high minded preachiness of the script is typical andrew davies screen writer in his early years and becomes tiresome within the first two episodes this mini series is 11 episodes long by episode 4 i just wanted to get through the blasted thing br br the music is equally tedious limited mostly to one mawkish piano tune and a sung by boys during the credits no expense was spared on the location settings which gives some visual relief to an otherwise excruciating viewing experience br br i like stories of this sort as a rule and am very disappointed at the maudlin nature of this series if you want to watch something riveting about ww1 and its after effects there are many other far finer vehicles to rent or buy one that comes to mind is 'the unknown soldier' from 1998 the characters in that masterpiece theater presentation are real and fascinating and move one unlike the 2 dimensional puppets in 'to serve them all my days ' as for films on boys' schools stick to 'goodbye mr chips' or 'tom brown's br br i know this goes against the general favorable view of this mini series but i strongly recommend thinking twice before shelling out 80 00 to acorn media for their 4 dvd set 2 discs of which on my set had insurmountable problems with freezing and skipping
<START> man this thing bites i am sorry i ever sat down and watched it friedkin was insane for making a film attempting to win over the viewers sympathy for this lunatic if it were up to me i'd have made the audience hate that low life instead of getting all misty eyed over him he killed people quite grizzly i might add too and friedkin wants you to feel sorry for him because he's not right i say friedkin can forget it i hate the guy this movie is partly based on and hope they did wise up and give his sorry butt the juice in a nut shell don't waste your time it's sick and perverse
<START> this is one of bruce's most underrated films in my opinion its an awesome heartwarming film with a neat story and an amazing performance from bruce willis all the characters are great and i thought willis and spencer breslin were just awesome together plus bruce willis is simply amazing in this this is definitely one of bruce's best comedic performances the thing was great and i thought it was very well written and made as well plus the finale is especially cool it's good natured and it was cool how you can see russell's willis character change throughout the film plus the ending was pretty good i think this should be higher then 6 0 and it's one of the best disney films i have ever seen plus it has many surprising moments throughout all the characters are extremely likable and it also has a cute love story angle too it as well plus bruce and spencer breslin both had some really funny lines holy smokes this is one of bruce's most underrated films in my opinion its an awesome heartwarming film with a neat story and an an amazing performance from bruce willis and i say its a must see the direction is great jon turteltaub does a great job here with really good camera work and just keeping the film at a very fast pace the acting is excellent bruce willis is amazing as always and is amazing here he gives one of his best comedic performances is hilarious had wonderful chemistry with both spencer breslin and emily mortimer had some funny lines and was dead on throughout the movie he was one of the main reasons i liked this movie so much willis rules spencer breslin is fantastic as the younger version of russell he was very funny and didn't get on my nerves once he is one of the better child actors out there emily mortimer is good as amy and was really cute i liked her she had decent chemistry with bruce too lily tomlin is funny as janet i liked her quite a bit jean smart is good with what she had to do which was not much rest of the cast do fine overall a must see out pf 5
<START> this was the biggest disappointment of a movie sucks cos i was really looking forward to it br br all the twists were crap they were all flashbacks br br what makes a good heist movie is the believability of the the job yes it has to be surprising so the audience is stunned but if you walk away and go that's bulls t what's the point br br plus the main heist was a bag snatch anyway you didn't get to see the team operating at it's full deceptive and brilliant potential there was not even one good heist in this movie they were all rubbish including that french break dancing crap to get through the lasers it's easy to do that when they are composited in afterwards plus that kind of stuff has already been done in at least one other movie and it was stupid then as well br br also there's no reason to have even half of the 12 or 11 in this movie what difference do half of the cast really make to the outcome of this movie half the scenes don't even need to be there br br the first one was classy this was cheap and it makes the whole team loose credibility especially ocean himself for bowing down the bennett
<START> i'm rating 'the decline of the american empire' just about below average since it wasn't terrible but also not great i liked the very open conversations from people so incredibly selfish and ugly inside and out that was probably the most original aspect Â a dialogue laced sexual small film with people who are extremely far from models that aside it seems ironic that these french speaking canadians have a movie about a neighboring society that well is in when their own actions are their own demise a group of women friends and male friends spend half the movie laughing it up on their infidelities and acceptance of such behavior and the other half intellectually speaking of how powerful they are for their speech and actions these are the normal targets in typical sitcoms the main characters make fun of at parties occupied mainly by college professors sadly it's not their intelligence or mastery of history that disturbs me it's their pedestal made of ego and than thou attitude that pushes me away and not one character could i relate to nor like when one cries i couldn't care less Â it's your bed when one complains i barely what made me skirmish was one character uh peeing red another example of playing with fire sure i understand it happens to some people but it was hard to watch and i sincerely hoped the he washed his hands as he had no problem going right back to cooking for everyone on the complete opposite end of the noses up educators they introduce a stereotypical nomad this made me cringe as no one seemed real everyone was as shallow as their laughter on society unfortunately with no one left to root for you're left as empty as these character's souls
<START> the coen brothers have done it again three depression era convicts george clooney john turturro and tim blake nelson escape a mississippi chain gang and head off in search of buried treasure that will fund their new lives along the way they sing on the radio and become much sought after stars as well as escapees great laughs and a soundtrack that is a lesson introduction to bluegrass music br br clooney is outstanding as the fast talking quick witted ulysses everett mcgill holly hunter plays his estranged wife turturro and nelson are flawless also in the cast are john goodman and charles durning br br dan provides the singing voice for george clooney on i am a man of constant sorrow the soggy bottom boys song that serves as a template for the bluegrass laden soundtrack that also features alison krauss ralph stanley the whites john hartford the cox family and gillian welch toe tapping knee slapping fun for the whole family you'll be surprised with how relaxed and funny this movie is
<START> i admit that i almost gave up on watching tv shows why because most of them are about doctors forensics or some girl boy who can predict a murder by sitting on the toilet seat but i must say i was wrong when i watched the first episode of oz one of the most brilliant shows on tv until today oz is a show about maximum secure prison and shows episodes in life of every cell mate inside the prison and their frustrations what i like about this show is the fact it has the courage to show the real life in prison without any annoying characters stereotypes and unrealistic dialogs even thought the characters in the show are not supposed to be heroes you became quickly attached to them and their life sure their is a lot of violence in this show and some disturbing images of rape and taking drugs but that's the point of this show to present how brutal and frustrating can be life in prison heck you can't show life in prison like a clean environment with likeable characters right oz is perfect in every way the actors are doing an excellent job and the whole hour of this show is going threw really really fast the only thing that i didn't like in this show was the last season of the show i think it became too weird and brutal and the finale was not satisfying but overall oz is still my favorite show on tv so far it surpasses sopranos and million csi and dr house crap with just a main title brilliant show which has the balls to show what other shows are taking away from us realism
<START> i found this a very enjoyable light hearted comedy set in wales with some truly funny sequences highlighting the rivalry between two funeral directors the showbiz ideas used by christopher walken's character to liven up his funerals are genuinely laugh out loud moments
<START> i'm sure that any legitimate submariner would happily ship out on the yes sos why you could play full court basketball in the torpedo room it's so large and how 'bout the bay windows in the bow the better to see giant squids or that appear out of nowhere did i mention the colorful mess cook with the parrot on his shoulder and the with what appears to be a loft big bleeping sub br br ok ok it's never gonna win any prizes for authenticity and if the sub is laughable the plot is even worse somehow the van allen belts of radiation hundreds of miles in space have caught fire are going to make global warming look like a weenie roast pompous admiral nelson walter pidgeon along with his sidekick lucius peter lorre looking suitably uncomfortable hatch a scheme to put out the fire by firing a missile into its midst br br there's plenty of intrigue sic along the way with a born again survivor and his little dog too two dames who can never leave well enough alone a of red shirts who are expendable and plot holes big enough for godzilla to walk through thrill to the being chased at what looks like 60 miles per hour by another sub no need for advanced sonar when you can follow from 100 feet br br the movie careens from one cliff hanger to another the payoff is so anticlimactic as to be pointless certainly not worth the 1 hour and 50 minute wait br br the technical adviser for this shipwreck must have been a 14 year old boy with a stack of popular mechanics magazines worth watching if only to riff upon
<START> i really like harrison ford so i eagerly rented this movie only to be disappointed minute after minute mr ford seemed to be walking through very warm water looking for a place to urinate his co star was very good and had the better lines the story intrigued me but the mistake big mistake as everyone is identified via driver's license or passport before they board any american commercial aircraft left numerous plot questions in my mind br br i could have cared less about these people in fact the sub plot of the internal affairs investigation was more interesting than the two lovers killed while flying first class to miami br br i am disappointed in the director sydney pollack who gave us the classic tootsie and other films this one is a waste of time and energy
<START> i couldn't even i mean look okay br br wow br br not even a bunch of my drunk friends trying to make fun of the movie could enjoy themselves in the least bit br br i can only think how how do independent film makers everywhere go years without getting noticed or even their lives and con artists like the guy who made this get a dvd on a shelf it seriously looks as if some guy with a home movie camera went out with some guys he met at subway and made the worst thing he could think of br br hey guys give me some ideas start with a corn field and work backwards well you've gotta have actors straight out of high school and some broken corn stalks with shreds of clothing attached and boobs thanks guy i'm sure that you and windows movie maker will be side by side on your next anxiously awaited project
