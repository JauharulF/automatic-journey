<START> i am a college student and i bought this movie at a used book store because it sounded really funny from the back description nothing would prepare me for what would be the funniest movie ever made br br it is especially good to watch if you are an atheist like me because then you can see how silly these christian people are they seem to think non believers like to live in really disgusting messy houses and do nothing but drink beer and be mean to the neighbors it's a laugh riot br br my buddies and i watch it every couple of weeks so that we may be entertained beyond our wildest imaginations see this movie now br br let's hope rich makes some more of these movies to entertain us heathens
<START> one can always tell if i'm enjoying a movie by the number of times i cross my legs switch positions make slight rustling noises etc etc the lesser the better i moved so many times throughout this movie that i succeeded in knocking over my friends giant tub of popcorn and getting a huge thigh strengthening workout br br sobieski a young actress who at some points in a soldier's daughter never cries gave some promise for her thespian talents played poorly in a poorly written part depressing fact number one number two chris klein was in it depressing fact number three chris klein had lines number four chris klein played a valedictorian woah dummies from rich families unite even worse he actually tries to act but only succeeds in sounding like a mentally disabled in an increasingly sappy independent version of a b demille film go back to humping your american pies br br this movie was terrible in almost every sense save josh hartnett's mildly endearing performance as stiffed boyfriend jasper luckily he refrains from trying to have too many moments unlike all the other characters of course this is why he's much better than the rest and he actually shows some mettle here if you like josh or are thinking of casting a kid who knows a few things he's your man br br hartnett is a sharp actor but the rest need no further lambasting br br 2 out of 10 for poor hartnett in this terrible film br br
<START> oh it's an excellent piece of work to be sure in fact several of the best scenes in cinema or at least in bergman's cinema are to be found in this film liv and max von sydow are as good as you would expect do these two give bad performances sven nykvist delivers some masterful although unconventionally masterful cinematography the script is quite good especially in individual scenes sometimes the film lags and the pace is uneven though probably intentionally br br so what's the problem well the film is too bleak for its own good other bergman films are similarly bleak but nowhere near this harsh eventually i just gave up and i started to become a little irritated i was greatly affected often during the film but by the end i felt uninvolved it's a great film but i doubt i'd ever watch it again nor suggest it to friends or if i did suggest it i'd be very sure to warn them of what's ahead 8 10
<START> no doubt about it this is the animated short that put uncle walt on the map of success when walt's older brother roy suggested that the next mickey mouse short should include sound walt jumped at the chance the result steamboat willie was a runaway hit for 1928 it was after all the first animated short subject with a synchronized sound track mostly music sound effects as dialog was minimal not to sound like a wet blanket but the short is far from perfect animation prior to 1935 was creaky rather herky jerky but once equipment made improvements and better artistic techniques came about the rest was smooth sailing and the sound was primitive disney wanted to use the then well known rca sound system or the western electric sound system but was refused by both firms prompting disney to use the system that p a powers was experimenting with at the time the plot there's an actual plot line here concerns mickey as the aforementioned willie is the pilot of a steamboat that is terrorized by black pete captain pete to you and decides to have a jam session on ship using the various animals on board as musical instruments take notice if you don't think too much about the technical shortcomings steamboat willie can be eight minutes of fun and a piece of history
<START> another of the endless amount of cookie cutter fight to the death for the amusement of wealthy films that there were so many of in the 90s y'know the ones created by taking the words 'death' 'blood' and 'steel' and the words 'ring' 'fight' and and putting them in a random generator saying that though death match is a pretty good entry in the over used genre thanks to its exciting fight scenes and the surprisingly good acting of its kickboxer cast br br the story concerns two buddies ex kickboxing world champion john larson played by pug faced kickboxing champ ian probably previously best known for his awful performance as the main villain in ring of fire 2 and nick wallace nick hill a likable guy probably best known for the role of street fighter sergio in bloodsport 2 who work the l a docks loading crates onto ships one discovery of a of guns and a brief fight later our two heroes are jobless and propping up an l a bar sensible john larson decides to head north and look for a job headstrong nick wallace has heard of a guy paying good money for fighters to fight in private kickboxing matches why should things change says john if you need me i'll be there predictably enough it isn't long before nick has gone missing and his good friend is fighting in the deadly of death' trying to find a lead to his missing buddy br br sure enough there are no prizes for originality here but like i said before this films strength lies in its action its cast of real life fighters and the fairly good performances it manages to wring from them ian in particular surprised me previously i'd just seen him as the bad guy in ring of fire 2 and in bit parts in tripe like the steel ring and i've always been quite amused at how bad an actor he is good fighter though but in death match he's pretty good given a decent script and a haircut he proves himself to be quite the charismatic leading man and his friendship with nick is very well portrayed and hill have a nice chemistry and you really believe these two characters care for each other enough for one of them to lose a job travel halfway across the country and risk death to save the other i wish i had a friend like that br br it was also nice to see matthias hues as a villainous henchman with a little more depth than we're used to seeing from his many roles however don't be fooled into thinking he's the star just because he's on the video cover with it seems his head stuck on the body of michael from the cover of he is good while he's on screen but he isn't on much br br on the negative side the film is pretty slow when there's no fighting going on with lots of unnecessary scenes whats with gangster jimmie pointless story about his grandfather and the end fight is disappointingly short but on the whole i enjoyed it plenty of fights most of them good isn't that all we martial arts really need and of course eye candy here in the lovely form of the very pretty renee all in all a pretty entertaining kickboxing movie
<START> i couldn't believe that the adult swim guys came up with this character i laughed for days just thinking about this show having finally seen the pilot i guess i will stick around for a few more episodes is pretty funny and the whole crew of police show characters are around but is hard to understand and that was a little frustrating most of the humor revolves around the fact that the title character is literally a walking ass with nothing else but legs that sport socks with and feet with traditional wing tips drinks too much and plays by his own rules as you might have guessed the only other funny moments are shooting many many people and spending time at home in the bathroom it is not funny but it is worth a look
<START> james bridges' the china syndrome is a first rate thriller a model for those who want to make a genuinely terrifying thriller but don't know how br br most thrillers end with the standard shoot em up and chase that ends with the villain getting what he she deserves but bridges understands that such a standard finale isn't the case in some scenarios the china syndrome is thrilling in a way no one would expect it has the type of ending that's so unexpected but yet so logical br br the film stars three then current oscar winners jack lemmon best actor 1973 for save the tiger jane fonda best actress 1971 and 1978 for klute and coming home respectively and michael douglas best picture 1975 for producing one flew over the cuckoo's nest this isn't your standard spot the star flick that became so popular in the 70s the acting is so solid and strong that we forget who's playing the roles and believe that the characters are real people that's a testament to the collective of all three actors they may be stars but they're actors first br br there is no music score in the film asides from a few background songs from jukeboxes or tv shows there is nothing bridges doesn't allow any directorial style to come through on screen he is simply presenting the material straightforward with a strong dramatic story like this we don't need a score to distract us it kind of strikes me as a predecessor to the dogma 95 started by lars von trier in 1997 it focuses on the characters and story rather than style br br the story is about a nuclear power plant located in southern california spoiler an accident appears to have happened and basically the film is about lemmon fonda and douglas try to expose the truth in a way this is not a spoiler since the trailer tv spots video boxes and reviews all give this away but from this seemingly simple premise a surprisingly complex morality play springs and the suspense comes from human nature and the actions of people rather than a villain framing another guy although this is an element in the film that's what makes the china syndrome so good br br out of 4 stars
<START> i remember watching this film in 1981 when i was 7 it was absolutely brilliant i found the dvd just a couple of months ago i was nearly jumping up and down with glee i bought it and showed it to my kids they loved it too they asked what words the was singing i didn't tell them though because i don't think telling the words 'gay' and 'ecstasy' to 6 year old kids is very good parenting the songs are brilliant i still remember them all i'll still remember them when i'm 60 there or near abouts tommy is was such a brilliant actor it's a pity he gave it up br br if you find the film buy it you'll love it
<START> i supposed gone wild' is a dull slasher flick yes it have some good point but it's a rehash from another flick the acts is so awful nor the plot br br the story goes from a legend about a living scarecrow on the cornfield when an initiation become a prank and cause the life a boy in jeopardy the scarecrow comes alive and start a killing frenzy sound familiar right it's derived from scream friday creepers children of the corn you name it br br gone wild' is so below average film barely have a scary moment even the final scene is laughable sadly we still could enjoy it as our time killer but i prefer you to watch something else instead unless you're a big fan bad and cheesy movies off course br br 4 10
<START> this b w film reached the spartan movie house of my village about 18 months after its release in those days much of our full length comedy fare hailed from denmark nils anyone so this movie struck like a thunderbolt it had me weeping with helpless mirth as we'd now put it ok so some of the sight gags were in fact recycled vaudeville but how was this boy with cheeks of brass' to know that at the time in any case my favorite scenes had jerry's unique brand of frantic clowning like that hawaii boxing match br br seeing sailor beware again fifty years later i still guffawed loudly at the goings on granted without the nostalgia component it would probably be just another fair to middling comedy but then another movie that once had me in stitches even more helplessly the spike jones outing fireman save my child now seems dated and stilted apart from some too short orchestra bits and doodles weaver scenes must be some special ingredient that makes martin lewis product stay fresher longer to me this one at least rates eight out of ten
<START> i would like to submit the following goof br br during the bridge scene soldiers are seen wading out in the river asking to be taken away and seeking to escape some of the soldiers approach captain willard's boat and attempt to board carrying with them suitcases soldiers are not issued nor do they ever carry suitcases into a combat zone they have duffel bags packs and but not suitcases the use of a suitcase in this scene is absurd and out of keeping additionally if you look closely you will see that the suitcase is floating on top of the water this is probably a very good indication that it is empty otherwise it would sink
<START> forget about donnie darko i open with this because it seems that a good portion of the reviews i have read on the box amount to the simple but weak argument that it doesn't hold a candle to darko it isn't that i disagree with that necessarily i just feel that this movie is a different animal altogether and deserves its own analysis there are points of comparison to be sure but they are peripheral concerns when you consider that the key to the heart of each movie is different in darko the driving force of the narrative is existential in the box the driving force of the narrative stems from a moral dilemma believe me when i say that i understand the inclination to compare an innovative by looking for trends and patterns but for me it is more important to approach each new film as a self contained entity first and then broaden my gaze afterwards br br the box is one of those films you get mixed feelings about because it seems to be in some sort of identity crisis it isn't always sure what it wants to be the twists are numerous but easy to follow if not to predict james marsden and cameron diaz play a relatively believable pair of newlyweds who are in financial straits a box containing a button unit arrives on their doorstep and they are informed by a horribly burned man that if pushed the button will cause the death of one person whom they don't know and they will receive one million dollars one of the things the box achieves is to conjure up this invisible fear that somewhere out there our actions have moral consequences before the button is pushed it has an eerie and seductive quality alluring yet sinister once it has been pushed events are set in motion that make the two leads question their own morality and deeply regret their fateful decision br br the notion that the box is an experiment is interesting because for me it provides the movie with a paradox if there are external beings developing an altruism based on data gathered by couples pushing and not pushing the button then as the conspiracy unravels we notice that ultimately it is a forced altruism be selfless or the species will be wiped out i suppose the couples don't know the consequences of their actions when they are faced with making the decision but they have no reason to suspect that the box can do anything so why would they choose altruistically is altruism devalued by the fact that we only care about it when presented with a problem in our own lives br br the psychological hurdles in this movie are everywhere push the button or don't it's likely someone is messing with you take the money or don't no one gives anything away for free search for the truth the answers you find slowly reveal your demise br br i propose that the box is an ironic work because it offers the false choice of free will while revealing that we are trapped in many metaphorical boxes you can only choose to be free at the expense of another's life is that freedom no it is only another box because then you become trapped in the consequences of your own morality there is no escape for us because we live on earth and that is another box this is precisely why the external beings in the film are ultimately antagonists they demand we conform to moral standards which rob us of our freedom we made it to mars and we were burned for it and turned into slaves in a sick game br br the references to jean paul sartre illustrate this point rather well you can only enter the final chamber free or not free sure but no matter the form in which we enter the chamber it is a chamber nonetheless br br trevor
<START> i suppose i should be fair and point out that i don't believe in ghosts that said i'm very interested in the subject and i enjoy a scary story as much as the next guy i am a fan of ghost hunters because they at least try to give their investigations a scientific angle even early episodes of most haunted had a camp entertainment factor to them paranormal state has neither of these qualities the cases themselves have the potential to be interesting but as with so much reality tv these days it suffers from poor acting and silly scripts the makers of the show freely admit that writers guide the stories i hear they are even going to shoehorn in a romance subplot to appeal to the young female demographic the show has many other flaws too as others have stated the narration quickly becomes like nails down a chalkboard over the top visual and audio effects quickly become just as irritating i'm willing to suspend some disbelief for the sake of entertainment but this whole demon with a vendetta story arc is just ridiculous given that the producers of this show are also responsible for brain dead fodder like mtv's laguna beach and newport harbor i suppose this is really no surprise if you are a die hard fan of ed lorraine warren or a big reality show junkie i guess you'll find much to like in paranormal state for the rest of us i recommend you avoid
<START> i wasn't sure about getting this movie on dvd because i really do have something against people making black and white films in the 21st century but i ended up buying it anyway i still don't understand why it had to be black and white but that's the only negativity i can see about the film and it sure is a perfect example to see the definitive rise of brazilian cinema not everyone can understand a film like this but it's quite rewarding to those who do unlike o homem que the surrealism fits this movie pretty well and the acting is at least as good as that one or other successful brazilian films such as de de deus brava etc br br my only hope is that this gem doesn't get insulted and raped by a crappy hollywood remake it's amazing to see how those guys spend zillions of dollars and still can't make a movie that's 1 as good as this possibly low budget flick br br bravo to the entire crew 10 10
<START> this movie is so bad it's almost good bad story bad acting bad music you name it o k who are the jokers that gave this flick a '10'
