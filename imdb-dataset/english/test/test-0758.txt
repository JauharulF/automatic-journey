<START> this was essentially a remake of diagnosis murder minus victoria rowell scott baio charlie schlatter dick is playing a college professor who teaches criminology 101 and can't even find his own classroom barry is now a private eye not related to dick this lets barry shoot at guys speeding away from him which a cop can not do barry still gets the girl in the end tracey needham portrays the girl she is the prime suspect and dick and barry believe she's innocent and prove it that's all the spoiler you get the ending is sufficiently unexpected that you don't already know it half way through the movie br br don't take it seriously don't critique it just sit back and enjoy dick and barry van dyke
<START> in terms of historical accuracy this is the absolute worst roman film i have ever seen the list not only of errors but of plot ideas that are flat impossible would run longer than the three hour film but just to give you an idea br br julius caesar and augustus are presented as liberal democrats taking the side of the people against the nobles this is patently absurd the caesars were as noble as you could get their interest was in power and a country that had been wrecked by 150 years of civil war there had been reformers notably the brothers who lived about 100 years earlier and to some extent advocated for the rights of ordinary citizens br br there are several scenes that are utterly ridiculous if you know anything about the period cleopatra with richard burton will give you a much better idea of how events unfolded fanciful though it is br br historical accuracy is one thing acting and dialogue are something else and here this film veers perilously close to being a bad junior high school production i burst out laughing several times especially when julia the daughter of augustus meets a lover they clutch passionately as she breathes my father ah your father your father your father would disapprove peter o'toole is at his worst forced to gnaw his way through some very pompous and silly lines the actor who plays augustus as a young man is such a nebbish and the character is written as such it's impossible to envision him as the cunning crafty machiavellian politician who created the roman empire here he's just a whiner who has to be told what to do most of the time br br charlotte rampling does manage to emerge from an underwritten role as livia wife with dignity had she been given a fuller role to play she might have rescued this production from absurdity br br there is some nice photography and battle footage helped by plenty of standard issue cgi oddly this was made for british tv and appears to be a british italian co production but is labeled with an r rating br br the dvd picture is excellent and the dolby digital soundtrack is very nice although you only notice it during the few action sequences as the movie is mostly talk br br almost any roman movie even cleopatra or the fall of the roman empire has more historicity to say nothing of compelling drama than this bizarre classics illustrated jr adaptation this one gives new meaning to the much abused phrase based on a true story in this case they could have said suggested by real events
<START> i can appreciate movies with subtitles from foreign countries and specially the ones in which the subtitles are weak and don't really seems to follow the story or really make sense but this movie had too many parts that didn't really make sense br br all in all i can admit to a few scary and freaky parts but they are repetitive i felt like i was watching a loop trailer seems like it was a short film shot with different actors br br in the veins of ringu and grudge but not even close the the hype the excessive length killed the thrill br br unless you are a die hard fan of these types of movies wich i thought i was don't waste your time on this one
<START> sometimes hallmark can get it right like the 10th kingdom but many of their fantasy films plod and this falls into the latter category the version i saw may have been cut a demon shown in the trailer and publicity stills didn't appear but anything that made the movie shorter can only be a blessing br br possible spoilers if you are unfamiliar with the original fairy tale br br anyway the film updates the story to the early part of the 20th century and makes gerda and kay here called kai being a fan i kept expecting him to say the dead do not solve 18 year olds hans christian andersen's basic story is followed the boy gets a shard of ice in his eye goes bad is taken off by the snow queen to solve a puzzle in her palace and gerda goes to find him having various adventures on the way br br as the two main characters are older than in the original a lot of time is spent getting them together and in love' unfortunately i was never convinced that they were particularly in love and certainly not enough in love to make sense of quest by the time the main plot kicks in the movie's pace has slowed to a crawl alas when gerda begins her search for kai it only manages to pick up the pace to a leisurely stroll br br there are a few odd additions to the story that seem to go nowhere at the start of the film the snow queen kills mother but no explanation for this is given a polar bear living in the snow queen's palace is more than he seems though this is possibly because the producers realised that the bear's feelings towards the snow queen would be ok in a fairy tale but not in a modern film again this is never explained also hints that the snow queen has an erotic desire for kai are dropped but never followed through the script is also full of anachronisms that really jar you out of the fairy tale' mood br br the production looks good though there is evidence of penny pinching the snow queen's palace is the hotel where gerda and kai lived covered in ice the three main characters are played with varying degrees of success kai comes across as bland as does gerda initially but once she sets off to find kai you warm to her bridget fonda looks great as the snow queen but seems to be in a different movie to everyone else br br ultimately the film is unsatisfying it looks good but drags and lacks magic
<START> first of all i want to say ang lee did a very good job on this one i watched it yesterday and i was presently surprised the story is very good but all the ignorant people would say this sucks people cant fly to them i say it's fiction and that it is this is not to be taken as a film about reality you could say this is a fairytale and a very pleasant to watch asian fairytale the can actually blow your mind because there so artistically filmed ang lee has a very u might say big talent the fight scene's are very cool and beautifully brought to the viewer but it's sad but this film didn't get the appreciation it should have gotten but ang lee did fortunately get the attention he deserved with his blockbuster broke back mountain so even for viewers who are not interested in the story the images are entertaining enough
<START> throughout the 1950s and into the 60s 70s and even into the 80s a slew of war films were produced in the former yugoslavia glorifying the heroism of the partisans Â civilians who turned out to fight a guerrilla war against the invading german forces who's generally only known in eastern europe directed quite a few of these partisan stories unfortunately only a handful of them were ever exported to the rest of the europe and the united states battle of the eagles is a rare low budget look at the formation and exploits of the partisan air force br br marshal tito decrees that a partisan air force must be formed to combat the german luftwaffe in the skies over yugoslavia a group of former pilots join forces with two small and begin raiding enemy bases and convoys over the course of several months more pilots and planes join the ranks eventually forming a formidable air force maybe it's history or maybe it's fable Â whatever it is it sure isn't convincing but a cast of great actors sure try to make it work br br the film opens strongly with a well shot german air raid on defenseless partisans the nuts and bolts of the plot come together almost immediately and for a short while the audience is treated to a rather patriotic series of scenes then the action starts and this title quickly becomes yet another low budget by the numbers adventure all of the characters are familiar clichÃ©s major played by a well meaning bekim fehmiu is our typical patriotic heroic leading man he blasts away at strafing planes with a machine gun and even has an aerial duel with the villainous a completely predictable and corny climax with an equally predictable outcome the rest of the partisans are familiar the battle of is a a hotshot playboy hell river is voss a veteran flyer who comes out of the woodwork now that his country needs him and the day that shook the world is a young messenger boy who moves up through the ranks eventually becoming a seasoned combat pilot the characters and their stories are familiar to any war fan and doesn't try to build upon these stereotypes the cast does a fair job and despite the two dimensional script every player is engaging and fun to watch in particular has some great moments Â when he's going to take his first flight as a gunner and later when he is forced to land a plane after the pilot is killed the plot merely consists of a string of air raids against the germans and subsequent acts br br handles the action sequences competently with a mix of actual footage and miniature effects unfortunately the miniatures are so cheap and false looking that the transitions between actual aerial photography and toy planes are jarring and laughable some of the strafing and bombing scenes look shockingly real while dogfights involving scale models complete with action figure pilots are just plain pathetic sometimes smoke puffs from the machine guns are so big that the smoke engulfs the entire model plane worse the editors often superimpose shots of fighters over real footage although the aircraft are usually in proper perspective they're surrounded by a distracting glow which hinders any attempt at realism all of this action is set to an incredibly familiar and annoying score by br br battle of the eagles also suffers from a very poorly edited english language release to begin with 28 minutes of footage is missing Â cutting the film from 130 minutes to a mere 102 the missing segments were carelessly excised and the cutting looks very sloppy music cues are abruptly cut off and scenes are abandoned before they are resolved in the last third of the film the story falls apart and only some badly needed action scenes can try to save it from total incomprehensibility then there's the all of the scenes revolving around the partisans are dubbed in english rather poorly however yet several lengthy scenes remain in german without the benefit of subtitles the film might have made much more sense had the german language sequences been excised instead of crucial scenes revolving around the partisans br br on the plus side handles the outdoor footage quite well there is never a moment where the audience feels like they're on a soundstage in particular the german luftwaffe bases are expansive complete with dozens of messerschmitt fighter planes and extras costumed in leather flying jackets the scenery is fresh and green and isn't afraid to shoot scenes with extremely wide angles or from far away simply to convey the scope of a battle or long trek a german ambush of a partisan unit early on in the picture stands out as does a sequence where and escape from an enemy base br br as it exists on home video battle of the eagles is just another of many stories about the yugoslav partisan movement there is nothing to set it apart from the rest of the crop and the terrible special effects and drastic editing put it a notch below acceptable try to avoid this one unless you can find a full length copy
<START> in search of the cheesiest so bad it's good movie i've repeatedly laughed at the first fifteen minutes of various films only to be left disappointed and bored at the end not this time my eyes teared up my belly and my cheeks ached from laughing so hard throughout the movie sure hulk hogan is a subpar actor and the plot is utterly predictable but everyone dives into this movie knowing all this all anyone wants to see when renting this is hogan breaking out a can of with a bunch of yeah brother s and s flying from his infamously mouth and while the on the screen pales a bit in comparison to the in the ring seekers of the ultimate cheese will certainly not be disappointed by this gem of a flick a laugh riot
<START> gone with the wind is one of the most popular books ever printed it is by far the movie of all movies the romance between scarlett and rhett made people dream all over the world and turned the lead actors into cinematographic icons one can ask is it really necessary to make a sequel and there are some big shoes to fill br br well there was the book first by alexandra ripley is we have to admit well written and fully respecting the world created by margaret mitchell she picks up exactly where we left our heroine previously and gently leads us from mitchell's heritage into her own fantasy in the book scarlett defeated after melanie's death and leaving travels to charleston to reside with her mother in law in hope of regaining love her typical manipulative behavior evokes once again a lot of criticism from rhett and drives them further apart until a certain boat trip that will change everything scarlett now carries a secret the series follows the book quite accurately until the arrival of scarlett in ireland from then of book and series slowly split ways the actual end differs but of course the both have scarlett and rhett back together br br the production of the series was announced with a worldwide search for the next scarlett o'hara many countries made their own television shows featuring young actresses auditioning for the part eventually about twelve girls were chosen to participate in the final screen tests and interviews in atlanta georgia unfortunately the producer found no scarlett amongst these actresses sad for the girls major publicity for the show it was already sold to many television stations worldwide before shooting even had started robert the producer who bought the rights to told he discovered the right actress while watching tv gave her a call and two days later signed the deal joanne whalley kilmer who starred and the latest being the movie robert was watching that faithful evening is not vivien leigh but she certainly is scarlett her performance is not a copy of leigh's she makes the character her own the major difference between gwtw and is the fact the lead character evolves and grows as a person this is the series why copying something that has been done before considering there is a gap of almost seventy years between the first and second storyline it is natural that both authors emphasize on different aspects of the characters whereas mitchell works around scarlett dealing with the consequences of the civil war and fighting for tara ripley lets scarlett face her demons this to me is the most interesting aspect of the series we get to know scarlett in a different way as she learns that not everything can always go the way she wants i totally agree with the choice of timothy dalton as rhett butler he portrays him with charm and irony and is less of a cardboard figure than clark gable's performance the rest of the cast was well chosen julie harris is endearing as mother john gielgud gives a very amusing performance as grandfather and sean bean is always at his best playing a dirty character his lord fenton makes no exception poor choices however with stephen collins as ashley and ann adaption of belle watling was a waste of money costumes sets and locations are elaborate and convincing the newly built tara set looked exactly the same and it is a moving sequence in the series when the house appears for the first time br br is there a point in making a sequel well six hours of romance are to me one to watch
<START> sony pictures classics i'm looking at you sony's got the rights to harry records you need to distribute the film and you'll get radically increased sales of his back catalog anyhow this is a great study of a fascinating musician woefully full of great stories greater music and it could have been 3 hours longer and i'd have loved it even more saw it at the american mods rockers festival at the aero theatre in santa monica where it played to a packed house they were turning people away at the door i went to many of the mods rockers festival films and let me assure you that no other film came even close to selling out let alone turning people away see it in the theatre buy the dvd and make sure some slow on the uptake company cough sony cough picks it up asap
<START> dolemite may not have been the first black exploitation flick to come along but it certainly is one of the best it is a pivotal film in the black exploitation genre as where it caused a dramatic shift between the films that came before it in contrast to the films that came after it it wasn't necessarily a poignant or moving film about black culture and it's fight to overcome issues like racism or anything as important as that but it was the story of one bad assed dude fighting whitey with his army of hot kung fu mama's it was a guilty pleasure great fun and best to watch it with friends 10 out of 10
<START> before i start to tear apart this movie mark you i love the scarlet pimpernel that story is one of the best romantic adventures ever written the movie staring jane grey is very good and the musical on broadway is the hottest thing there so i thought when i heard that this film was coming out that it would be great since it was a bbc film br br to my surprise it was a weak totally stupid story that utterly failed in capturing the gorgeous tale br br there were no exciting escapes with daring disguises there was no deep love that made your heart flutter as percy left the room and marguerite sighed as her husband was leaving her again br br all it had was a confusing plot and a lot of out of the blue sex and violence br br sink me what a horrible movie br br
<START> this is a great premise for a movie the overall plot is very original interesting and something to think about however poor production an obviously small budget acting from the main character and several side actors really detract from this would be classic an up and coming producer should try to this story and give this basicly half hearted atempt a proper release
<START> but i can't say how i really feel about this pile of steaming dung where to begin the film quality there isn't any i've seen clearer pictures on america's funniest home videos the acting is substandard the gore effects is okay the clown mask is the best part of this movie the story is repetitive the same thing over and over again at least in a friday the 13th or halloween we stick with one main character for the most part there is no main characters just victims man now we come to the worst part of all the final survivor kills the clown and finds out it was one of her friends then when the police finally arrive they don't believe her and she is locked up in a rubber room what kind of ending do you call that crap that's what in my opinion there is no excuse for a bad ending in a horror movie that was just sloppy writing the excuse it has to ending badly it's a horror movie or we need to end it badly to leave it open to a sequel are just lame excuses and that is all i must give the camp blood the thanksgiving turkey
<START> i was in my mid teens when i saw this movie and i was struck by the beauty of the young stars as well as the loving cinematography and the simple sweetness of the story it amazes me to learn that has recently died that bury apparently has not worked in the film business for almost 30 years and that both would be in their 50s br br the elton john soundtrack is amazingly beautiful and supports the air of protected innocence the characters experience in seclusion i have seen the movie poster billing it as deux enfants which apparently means something like two children who like each other the english language distributors were wise to the title br br paul the ignored 15 year old son of an english businessman living in paris meets michelle an orphan at the zoo the two take what they intend as a day long holiday to michelle's late father's rural cottage but end up staying there for a year isolated from the outside world they fall in love michelle gets pregnant and they have the baby alone at home after the baby's birth the police come to paul's work place and take him away br br blue lagoon comes to mind as another film that almost captures the theme of innocence protected in an isolated paradise so sad that friends has never been released on dvd
<START> i tend to be inclined towards movies about people who choose to cross the barriers of censorship and express what they really want to express eric character of barry is like howard stern but much more intelligent the character itself is very fascinating as an oliver stone film i guess i was expecting more the film sags a bit during the third act plus it's pretty obvious that talk radio is based on a play with its long dialogue scenes but overall the film works bogosian is great in the lead and the fact that he also wrote the play from which the movie was based on probably helped him if you want to check out one of stone's greater films i better suggest you check out jfk or salvador this is not his best work but a good movie nonetheless
