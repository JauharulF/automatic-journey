<START> cactus flower is what i call a pizza movie a personal favorite that never fails to satisfy perfect for an evening at home with a pizza knowing all the lines and what lines by heart only enhances the enjoyment br br since so many others here have retold the plot i'll simply add the correction that bergman's character miss dickinson was a nurse receptionist meaning she was a skilled nurse and therefore an educated person not just a receptionist br br bergman's performance in this film and the film itself was largely dismissed at the time but today's audiences will marvel at her range not just the impeccable comic timing but the ability to make us believe her character is unaware of her own feelings while revealing them so clearly to toni and to us while the general plot stretches credibility bergman's performance is compelling honest and utterly believable br br also a standout is jack weston's performance as the matthau's old friend and co conspirator harvey no one could deliver a zinger like weston and i a l diamond's script gives him plenty for example that's such a big dirty rotten lie it has class weston excelled at slightly seedy characters because he exuded a warmth that allowed you to forgive his characters' flaws br br the film is a fairly straight adaptation of the abe burrows play which was itself adapted from a french play by and on broadway matthau's role was played by barry nelson bergman's by lauren bacall and hawn's by brenda vaccaro it ran for 1 performances three years and was nominated for two tony awards vaccaro and burt who played igor br br for me the film's score written and adapted by the legendary quincy jones is another highlight the main theme a time for love is anytime is performed by sarah vaughn over the opening and closing credits it is also insinuated in different arrangements throughout the film most notably as the romantic piano music underscoring speech to hawn in the record store jones also created covers of popular songs from the period to sir with love i'm a believer for the night club scenes as with all of the film's elements there is a tremendous amount of talent taste and professionalism evident br br in my opinion few modern romantic comedies can hold a candle to this classic it's great to finally have it available on dvd time to call for a pizza
<START> i rented the china syndrome recently mainly because i read that it was this film that inspired abc to make the day after syndrome however is more of a thriller than a drama the film is quite political but i agree strongly with its message nuclear power though extremely efficient is far too dangerous for common use the risks are simply too high hopefully the persons in charge of real nuclear plants are far more responsible and ethical than those depicted in the film however given that the real life near disaster at three mile island happened mere months after this film was released puts that in question in fairness that case was probably more one of incompetence than of corruption br br syndrome is not just critical of nuclear power but also of modern news media similar in vein to network only much more serious being a print journalist myself i am quite familiar with how people perceive the media but it was a little frightening to see that even in the '70's tv news was already selling out when jane fonda's character tries to convince her boss to let her do real news instead of fluff she is advised not to try the change as research finds that people prefer a pretty girl to do fluff not hard news br br what truly makes the film memorable however is the incredible suspense generated in its final third during this period the viewer is constantly fearing for the lives of the protagonists whether the danger is coming from hired thugs or the potential meltdown of the nuclear plant and that very last scene i won't give it away of course but it will keep you guessing br br on a final note i did get a distinct feel watching the film that it seemed at times more like a tv movie than a true theatrical film this could be however due more to the fact that the rental tape i was watching was quite old and not formatted to fit tv screens the way videos and dvds are today
<START> yet another lo wei production to completely waste the talents of a young jackie chan to kill with intrigue is a strange mix of wuxia melodrama supernatural action and plain old school kung fu fighting that is pretty dull despite featuring several surreal wtf moments and lots of laughably bad dialogue br br in an effort to protect his pregnant girlfriend chin chin from the killer bees a gang of ruthless killers that are about to attack his home lei jackie chan pretends to be a heartless cad driving her away and thus saving her from danger br br during the attack relatives are all killed but he is left relatively unharmed by the gang whose leader a scar faced woman seems to have the hots for him then goes in search of chin chin whose safety he has entrusted to his close friend chu chuk br br during his quest to find his true love befriends the head of a courier company whose precious cargo has been stolen by the leader of the evil 'bloody rain' clan eventually after being injured in a fight against members of the nasty clan a fun scene with lots of silly weaponry and then nursed back to health by the scar faced killer bee who shows her love by burning his face ultimately learns that he is a lousy judge of character his friend chu chuk is none other than the power hungry head honcho of the 'bloody rain' clan who has plans to marry chin chin himself br br cue the drawn out climactic battle with getting kicked in the face repeatedly before eventually choking his traitorous ex pal to death with a scarf br br even die hard chan fans will find this one a chore to sit through with only the final fight managing to showcase some of the star's amazing acrobatic abilities fans of general asian weirdness might dig the spooky appearance of the killer bees at the beginning of the film with one character inexplicably demanding back his severed hand or the moment when three men float through a window to attack our hero but for most this film will have very limited appeal
<START> this movie had great production values good lighting costumes set cinematography and acting but someone somewhere took the script and replaced all the dialogue with grade school level barely literate writing i felt my iq dropping points any time any character spoke br br did they do this on purpose was this just an accident of brain dead studio executives at this point we don't know br br all i know is this movie was one great mistake from beginning to end we don't even get to see how the squad became cops so instead of any character development we get what feels like a bad tv movie leftover from the 60's or whenever br br find the screenwriters beat them with a sock full of quarters everyone else nice work but read your scripts next time br br 3 10
<START> everyone has their choice for worst movie they've ever seen some like to pick on gigli or battlefield earth some pick on classics like plan 9 from outer space ever since i was 14 i have been very vocal in saying that to me it is problem child 2 and 9 years later i feel the exact same way it's not one of the worst it's not just an expression it is the actual worst movie i have ever seen br br how much farting pooping peeing and puking can you put in a single movie i don't need to see a dog take a dump that goes up to my waist why is it that i'm so hard on this filth i have nothing against bathroom or gross out humor heck i like the american pie movies having such an excess of it within 90 minutes is a bad idea but the true tipping point is to do it with kids having little kids call each other sexual names imdb won't even let me post that word on here yet here it is coming out of the mouths of 8 year olds think of the irony in that and urinate and puke on each other just makes the whole thing feel dirtier worst line in the movie i guess i should fart in more people's offices br br what other film has urination into lemonade dynamite sticks exploding toilets a little boy filming his babysitter having sex and projecting it on the side of the house and a little girl joking about scratching testicles br br however my absolute favorite moment has to be when the same little girl is on a carnival ride says i'm gonna puke opens her mouth and fake looking puke shoots straight out of her open mouth in a perfect 90 degree angle the puking scene in scary movie 2 looked more real than that br br i suppose the only redeeming element in the movie is gilbert gottfried you get the impression that he didn't even have a script but was just being his usual self too bad he has to act stupid while pizza gets thrown on him br br you know what thinking about the movie this much has just made me have to go to the bathroom goodbye
<START> here's the spoiler at the end of the movie a little piece of you dies you'll spend the rest of your life searching in vain for that missing piece but it's gone it's gone you'll wander the streets at night peering into your windows as they sit down for dinner friends and family will try to pinpoint when exactly you turned into the walking dead you'll answer their questions and concerns with a blank stare and some mumblings about a runaway testicle when amc inevitably makes the movie of the month a series of mysterious murders will take place in your city you'll wake up the next morning balled up on the floor of the kitchen with a faint taste of brains in your mouth then you'll crawl into the living room and onto the couch you'll stare at the wall wet yourself a little and then begin to laugh maniacally because once your dead inside jake busey in a thong is actually pretty damn funny
<START> my blurred childhood memories have kept the echo of the cult serie of in the french 60's so i was eager to see the big screen adaptation i should have kept my money and gone for a stroll in the louvre br br the idea of the scenario is still very apt and interesting the of le louvre but the adaptation is ridiculous the dialogues hesitate permanently between french irony and serious american business without achieving neither but not without sounding asinine br br acting leaves somehow to be desired and special effects are meager compared to what one could expect low budget br br what is left of all that not much outside a few good shots of paris which is seldom a disappointment br br was worth more than that br br
<START> it's not as good as the movie that said it's a cute kids show okay so the emperor has back slide and become a selfish spoiled brat once more accept it and enjoy the cartoon as something entertaining it has plenty of jokes for the parents and still holds the attention of children also it boasts two of the original voice actors from the movie earth kitt who has been in numerous films but i'm sure many people know as catwoman and patrick sorry if i misspelled who also has appeared in many films and tv series but is most widely recognized as the tick it's really a rare and wonderful combination if for no other reason i highly recommend comic book fans watch at least one episode just to enjoy the dynamic duo to sum up entertaining children's show with plenty of inside jokes for the grown ups to laugh along with if your looking for educational value this isn't your show if your just looking for something funny this is a great saturday morning pick
<START> back in 2002 when matthew lawrence did the hot chick i also saw drumline that day drumline wins by default if the had been released in march as planned the same time tmnt was released tmnt would've won by default br br granted matthew lawrence did a fine job portraying a quarterback he didn't have to resort to uttering dirty words which is a plus but when he started playing with his private parts as well as another football players and touching a girl's boob those were the minuses br br but the biggest minus that ticked me off is that every football player got to participate in the mock music video except matthew lawrence insert the price is right's losing horns another blown musical opportunity for him just because he's shy about doing music br br in the past matt has disappointed me many times super human samurai squad where he came so close to having a musical moment but ended up failing br br sure joey had a singing career with two albums to his belt and andrew's starting a music career of his own but it's very rare to find a matt musical moment the two that stand out would be on brotherly love where he played the guitar and sang pigeon on your car art which he wrote by the way and that romantic boy meets world moment when he sang this dame as time goes by br br matt you've played jocks too long why not make a musical comeback you have a good voice and i miss your musical side
<START> it's another variation on the oft told tale of two people getting married and having to share their brood of kids with six you get egg roll is directed by howard morris from television and it shows because it's the kind of tale that plays like a half hour situation comedy padded out to feature film length but with a scarcity of laughs or to put it differently only the number of laughs that would have been possible within the half hour limits of a tv show br br doris day decided to call it quits after this film and it's rather easy to see why even the presence of some fairly reliable actors in the cast doesn't help brian keith barbara hershey pat carroll and alice do their best but the script is the real problem and should have been left untouched for the big screen br br nothing much can be said in favor of it skip it and see miss day in any number of her more worthwhile films
<START> forget the fact that most people expect an action movie form seagal this movie simply had no substance very long drawn out and boring scenes were much longer than they had to be the camera would often focus on something for long periods of time when absolutely nothing was happening cure for insomnia worst seagal movie by far i do like some of his other movies 1 10
<START> after i read that the time of its release in 2002 its budget of 47 million or 000 000 frf was said to make it the french film ever however et contre cÃ©sar 1999 had a budget of 48 million or 274 000 frf which supposedly made it the most expensive french film i discovered the reason why i found this movie to be one of the most beautiful and colorful of all i have ever seen i loved the scenarios the clothes specially the ones from cleopatra and the atmosphere of the movie it's so happy and cheerful i found the jokes smart and hilarious and i have to consider this movie to be in my favorite comedies of all times br br the cast is also excellent with monica bellucci who is very beautiful as cleopatra gÃ©rard depardieu great christian clavier that i saw for the first time in among others br br i recommend this movie even for people who doesn't know asterix and comics you are going to have a great amount of fun br br aka asterix e brazil
<START> i did it too when i first saw the band i dismissed them straight away without even listening to the music then one day out of sheer curiosity i bought the cd and fell in love with it so i bought the video hold onto your lunch kids this isnt going to be pretty the video was excellent a great opportunity to hear the music see some of the promo videos and meet the band although i still dont know how they can cope with wearing those masks all the time a must for all fans of the band and fans of alternative music in general
<START> fun movie great for the kids they found it very entertaining somewhat predictable but there are a few surprises great movie to watch if you're looking for something just to entertain don't expect to be seeing a classic
