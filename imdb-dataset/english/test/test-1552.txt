<START> a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart it is rare when a film maker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesn't fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent nine out of ten for a truly lovely film
<START> let me be clear i hate these kinds of movies i do not like anything where the protagonists are all bourgeoisie english i find this kind of literature and film awfully pretentious you will never get me to read a jane austen book willingly that said the only reason i read w somerset maugham's book and watched the subsequent film was for a class br br mary kristin scott thomas is a beautiful english woman living in a borrowed villa in florence before world war ii one night after dinning with some of her rich royalty related friends she willingly picks up an austrian refugee has sex with him and ditches and then he kills himself as the movie gets further and further you really want to dislike mary br br what a load of crap this movie was first of all there were many subplots and characters invented in the movie that weren't even in the book i doubt very much the late mr maugham would've appreciated them the characters though wealthy were some of the most superficial and self centered people i have ever seen br br the only reason i didn't give it anything less than three stars was because the acting was the only thing redeemable the always talented kristin scott thomas is perfect for the role of mary in fact i couldn't picture anybody else filling her shoes sean penn and anne bancroft also had supporting roles that were just as good as the lead br br save yourself the pain of watching this movie
<START> this film is excellent fear of watching documentary movies cancel your shrink and watch little story you won't believe how captivating this fine piece of film making is until you have experienced it i'm eager to say that it even out goes almost any vietnam war movie including apocalypse now it's a real story it's a personal story a story about the love for flying the dream of being a pilot and the nightmare of being shot down above enemy's territory all is shot in a return to style at location herzog asking the questions dieter answering them in a memorable german english accent and with fine remembrance pointing out what happened where about 25 years before there is this part that i told friends over and over again bailed out from his us navy plane dieter becomes a pow of the vietcong blindfolded for the greater part of the days he is being dragged through the southeast asian jungle for miles and miles on bare feet tortured insulted disorientated and covered with wounds they arrive in a small friendly village to spend the night the next morning after walking for several hours dieter discovers someone stole his wedding ring from his finger that is it he can take no more he starts to cry as a result of complete exhaustion the vietcong men react surprised dieter manages to explain what happened immediately the group returns to the village and starts searching for the person that stole the ring they find the man immediately chop of his finger and return the ring to dieter the movie is full of these mind boggling and surprising situations the immense cultural differences the clash of east and west the fear of the unknown i e all that stands for america on the one hand the asian jungle and his secrets on the other can be sensed the entire movie back problems that's because you sat at the edge of your seat for two hours and didn't notice
<START> glenn ford is hired by a crooked bank owner and wily stable owner buchanan to stage a fake robbery while the banker hides the real loot with ford a no show the two instead go with a trigger happy second choice leaving ford on the hook for killings he didn't commit br br columbia pictures' first color feature the desperadoes looks fantastic with sets and costumes fabricated to take full advantage of the technicolor process accentuating tons of well staged western spectacle br br this has the irresistible teaming of a young glenn ford third billed but essentially the star and a prime randolph scott leading an incredible supporting cast of great character actors in colorful roles including scene stealer buchanan as a good natured but mildly villainous yokel who isn't as dumb as he looks and who has quite a few memorable lines br br a fairly complex script effectively mixes incredible action sequences melodrama and comedy well directed by charles vidor this is one of the great westerns of the nineteen forties and highly recommended
<START> awesome movie great combination of talents i'm a huge fan of david duchovny and he is outstanding in this movie i would love to see him in more movies of this nature his talents are definitely under used and has so much more to offer besides agent mulder although i'm a huge fan of that series too anyway i want to see more of him he is easily the cary grant of our generation if you haven't seen this movie you must great love story that shows love never dies it's with you forever minnie driver is great and how can you go wrong with a cast containing mr o'connor and mr loggia and mr belushi this movie didn't get any type of awards nod but deserved one great job bonnie hunt by the way the soundtrack is great too
<START> this definitely the most tension filled x files episode of the first season this episode is what i think of when i hear x files the plot is simple but exiting our main cast plus a few scientist go to investigate an outpost in which it's research team appears to have killed each other it turns out a small parasite that got dug up from the ice had infected the research team the parasite attaches itself to the brain and causes paranoia and insanity soon none can tell who they can trust or who's infected or not br br this episode was a direct tribute to john carpenters great horror film the thing the thing is set in antarctica and a team of scientist find a destroyed outpost in which it's occupant have been killed or killed themselves an alien that had been buried in the ice for a years had been out it has the abilities to imitate any life form therefore the main characters can no longer distinct friends from foes br br believe me the thing is one of the most exiting and tension filled horror movies you'll ever see if you liked the episode ice i advice you to see it or if you have only seen the thing i advice you to see ice br br ice is the best direct tribute homage to john carpenter's the thing i have ever seen and it lives up to it's inspiration as one of the best x files episodes i give it a 10 10
<START> i really enjoy this movie the first time it was on turner classic movies all the actors did very well but brynner steals the show again like always he is so sexy this is one of the movie that you do see emotions actually this movie this is the first i ever seen him laugh because he plays very strong larger than life and serious roles in other movies in this movie you see both a masculine tough and sensitive side of brynner brynner seems to be a in this movie that is amazing how brynner eats the glass cup and speaks in his russian tongue it drives me crazy in love i don't understand when both brynner and kerr they both have very good chemistry stars in a movie together and then brynner always die at the end it kind of reminds you the king and i in a way
<START> hollywood movies since the 1930s have treated gays as lepers in condemning homosexuality the film industry has reflected only what the repressive society of its day espoused as an ideology for example in the 1962 otto preminger melodrama advise and consent straight actor don murray was cast as a queer congressman who commits suicide rather than confess his alternative lifestyle gay movie characters have covered a lot of ground since advise and consent in the 1997 movie in out 1 2 out of heterosexual actor kevin kline is cast as a homosexual teacher who comes out of the closet on his wedding day while the conservative hollywood of yesteryear that the congressional queer in advise and consent had to commit suicide the liberal hollywood of today dictates that the gay english teacher should be embraced rather than br br basically in out preaches good citizenship in the garb of a politically correct comedy director frank oz and scenarist scott endorse honesty as the best policy because honesty always ensures happiness high school teacher howard brackett kevin kline of the big chill will be happy only after he comes out of the closet just as his once fat but now thin fiancÃ©e emily joan cusack will only feel happy when she can ditch her diet ultimately the movie contends that straight society will accept gays when homosexuals can act with greater honesty and candor about themselves the happily gay tabloid reporter played by straight actor tom selleck here effectively dramatizes this open minded commentary br br lightweight script embellishes the true life incident that occurred at the oscars when tom hanks paid tribute to a high school teacher in in out cameron drake matt dillon a blond brad pitt style bimbo type actor wins the oscar for impersonating a fruity foot soldier drake honors his mentor howard brackett during his acceptance speech not contend to stop there the candid cameron reveals to a live television audience that howard is gay suspicion paranoia and horror set in as the media descend upon the sleepy town of green leaf indiana when would a no name high school english teacher's sexual deviance spark such massive media concern among those reporters lurks peter malloy tom selleck of high road to china and he wants to do a week long exclusive one on howard howard however wants nothing to do with the witch hunting media especially the pesky peter malloy howard denies drake's gay charges to everybody including his fiancÃ©e and his mom malloy lingers because he smells a scoop the revelation has turned green leaf upside down high school principal tom halliwell bob newhart nervously with all the media coverage halliwell warns howard that were his marriage not imminent he'd have to give him a pink slip meanwhile peter bets howard that his marriage to emily will fall through at the last moment and he'll be there to record the result on camera br br howard resorts to audio tapes about macho men he struggles to reform himself but howard's efforts are futile guilt swells up inside him and then there is peter malloy who rags him to come clean about his homosexuality finally at the altar in the sight of god howard bursts of course bride to be emily montgomery is floored by howard's gay confession predictably the school fires howard but he shows up for graduation drake shows up too and rushes to defense not only has the school stripped howard of his job but they've also given his teacher of the year award to somebody else drake appeals to the principal and wins howard the unanimous support of the community br br the biggest defect in contrived script is howard himself has created a character too chaste to be true either by gray or straight standards howard brackett looms as more of a saint than a sinner he helps one student gain admission to college and he coaches the track team how often do you hear of an english teacher doubling as a coach too everybody at his high school adores howard he doesn't have a mean bone in his body further and oz ask us to believe that nobody else in green leaf is gay where are howard's gay friends are they too scared to come to his defense no in out is not targeted strictly at homosexual audiences oz whose screen credits include cute comedies like dirty rotten scoundrels and house sitter as well as teeter on a politically correct tightrope in out is not a gay recruiting movie the filmmakers show no interest in what prompted either howard or peter malloy to prefer the gay lifestyle instead oz and are only interested in up a thin premise is he or isn't he gay they flesh it out to involve the community response to the answer finally when howard admits that he is gay the filmmakers devote the rest of the movies to showing how a conservative norman rockwell like town can accept him despite his difference br br the most shocking scenes in in out is probably when tabloid reporter malloy does a lip lock on howard straight guys kissing each other in a movie about a gay identity crisis are as hilarious as they are phony kline and selleck grind their faces together in what appears as more of a head on collision than a closed mouth kiss nothing at all like the controversial 1994 british movie priest in out emerges as an engaging but labored piece of social propaganda with its okay to be act message if ellen weren't the tv equivalent in out would probably be heading toward tv as a new sitcom watching in out is not so much about dealing with the issue of gay or straight but how to be a decent person in the last days of the 20th century what makes in out a tolerable comedy about sexual intolerance is its equal opportunity cheers and jeers about and steers
<START> this is possibly the worst film i have ever seen i gave it one star simply because it is the lowest score possible whoever thought flood would ever be a good film the director and cast should be ashamed and then it dawned on me this could all be part of a shambolic scare tactic only propaganda could be this bad br br the redeeming feature of flood is that it's ghastliness and shameless formulaic storyline make it funny if only the characters had the same depth as created by the flood itself yet they from sound bite to sound bite without any emotional response whatsoever br br the sad thing about this film is that it could have been so much better informative imaginative and tense flood has the amateur streak to found in many recent british films where a more focused use of funds would have made for a better entertainment br br where was smithee
<START> i never really understood the controversy and hype this movie caused especially in french and the neighboring countries in belgium where i am located for example baise moi was announced as the most shocking and the most thought provoking social drama you could ever experience yeah right it might be a little shocking maybe how often do you see someone getting shot up the arse but the weak and pointless plot surely didn't cause me to think much baise moi is another one of those blame everything that goes wrong on society films and they're generally not very convincing about 99 of the people functions perfectly well in this society so why would you blame this exact same society for the vile and hopeless acts of two deranged nymph girls the two main characters and their miserable lives are introduced separately and in flashes nadine just killed her roommate manu shot her brother and the two meet in an abandoned train station late at night they decide to travel around france together leaving a trail of sex and blood behind wherever they made a stop although we're constantly exposed to pornography and violence this film is very boring to sit through like the girls are indicating themselves all the time the dialogues are lame and the people they run into and are very uninteresting if people want to make porno movies that's fine by me but please don't pretend that it's art house film making if you leave out the swearing and the hip camera work all there is to see is not so arousing pornography cool soundtrack though
<START> wow this wrestlemania took place from 3 different cities this was the very first wrestling pay per view i ever saw and it's a good one indeed there is a great steel cage match for the main event as hulk hogan takes on king kong bundy
<START> i've never really been sure whether i liked this documentary or not it was shown on channel 4 before a cut down version of revelations and is on the revelations video tape before the uncut show the documentary is basically friends of bill saying how great he was for an hour with video clips of the show mixed in a bit like a trailer for the film you're about to watch it also features david letterman grovelling like a worm for dumping bill off the his show before he died the reason bill made a joke about how pro life people should picket funerals and letterman had pro life advertising anyway look out for the video as revelations is bill at his ranting best
<START> first let me state that i have no idea who nora roberts is so the book may have been great but the movie isn't br br i have spent my entire life living in the region of nc i have never heard southern accents as ridiculous as the ones in this movie i have lived in two small nc towns and charlotte and raleigh on occasion you will meet people with a strong southern accent but i have never encountered a town where everyone talks like a bad imitation of gone with the wind br br in response to gore won from the atheist community your comments reveal more about your warped psyche than it does about the movie if we were to stretch our imaginations and pretend that there is anything realistic in this movie which there isn't then the truth is that bad people such as father will always find some justification for their actions the author chose religion as a counter to supernatural abilities your that the true character of the gospels directs a man to beat his daughter is about the most perverse and interpretation i have ever heard before you start spouting off about the gospels maybe you should read them first br br back to the movie the dialog is flat unnatural and unbelievable most of the time in particular many of the things that said to tory are inappropriate and do not match the mood context or way they are said br br the exciting twist at the end of the movie is lame predictable and lacks any credibility some have also claimed that jacqueline bisset does a wonderful job in this movie but the truth is that the bitter mother character is also a stale predictable one dimensional character is that fault i don't know br br if you have a choice between watching this movie and a twenty year old rerun of the muppet show i recommend the muppet show
<START> this movie may not have seemed like much to some people but it had everything i look for in a comedy fall down funny moments accompanied by a moment or two of seriously moving scenes great actors and pretty much everything a good movie is supposed to be like despite david spade playing his usual snobby character he made this role into an unusual performance which i don't think he had ever exceeded until he hit the screen with joe dirt regardless of whether or not some people were not chris farley fans i saw this film when it came out and my friends and i still talk about it 11 years later this movie was what finally told me that chris farley was the real deal he is the best comedian i have seen in my life in the words of some he could be clumsy clever funny serious crazy sober and moving or depressing at the same time not the same words but the message is all that counts one of the true great actors of our time and one of the true great comedy's of all time along with good acting good story hilarious moments serious scenes that at times brought me to tears this movie stands atop the hordes as a movie that marked the beginning of a brief reign at the top of the comedy world by the late great chris farley no actor before or since has captured my interests in a movie since because no actor before or since has put so much into his movies this movie is worth the time if you haven't taken the time to see it do so the next time you rent a movie
<START> shes the man is great its funny original and made me laugh so much i nearly wet my seat the day i went to go see it at the movies i wasn't in the best of moods man trouble but leaving the movie i had a grin plastered on my face the story is a bit out there with the whole no one noticing that she looks way too much like a girl but hey who am i to say whats believable the jokes are great and some of the one liners in this 2006 hit could go down in history amanda b did a great job as the main role and channing tatum looks too good to be true as her opposite as the gorgeous duke so girls go see this because its a great laugh and there's a hot guy in it and boys u go see it because you might just learn something about girls br br all in all a brilliant fantastic and fun movie which i will be buying on dvd when it comes out
