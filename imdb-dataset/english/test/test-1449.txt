<START> i'm sure a lot of guys will love this movie the only woman who shows any balls unfortunate pun regretted is made to look talk and seem like a guy the other 2 women are portrayed either as sexual objects with one thing on their mind sex being sexy with sex as their only attribute and skill iris or as freaked out pretty little princesses who's neurosis negates any strength and professional authority they had before all hell broke lose doc the only strength iris has in the end is the result of some advice from a big strong man besides my negative gut reaction as a feminist i have to give the camera work props and ethan hawke is great in the very first scene after that his performance loses steam empty entertainment for a brain that wants to take it easy at least the film skims the subject of the duality of good bad in the criminal mind
<START> just had the misfortune to see this truly awful film br br think of that scene in magnolia at the end with the slow pan in on that woman now remove the pan add breathing and unshaven men to the mix and you have what the entire 2 and a half hours of humanity was br br the inspector is a true dolt not even a dolt just a dim witted slow moving simpleton how they ever solved a crime is beyond me br br obligatory sex scenes are awful and br br eventual villain of the piece he raped and killed an 11 year old girl is signposted very early and no surprise unless your are similarly dimwitted br br uninspiring camera work br br the director was there saying that it is up to the audience to provide their own interpretation on the proceedings i assume he also meant provide their own dialogue there is bugger all adding to its boredom level inventive camera work just static shots totally stripping away the obvious beauty of the landscape the film is being shot in and plot br br truly awful br br 0 out of 10
<START> i realize it's a small statistical sampling 8 votes as of this posting but 5 9 out of 10 i'm giving this movie a 3 and even that's generous i've tried to watch this movie three times now the saturday night 9 p m premiere on scifi channel and the saturday night at 1 a m and thursday night re broadcasts and i've fallen asleep all three times before the movie ends which leaves me with a laundry list of unanswered questions for example is lance henriksen that strapped for cash that he has to keep playing supporting roles in these god awful pumpkinhead sequels is henriksen contractually banned from doing any non pumpkinhead movies can't the creators of this franchise do better than a monster that looks like a geriatric emaciated alien who walks like he has a stick jammed up his a when are the hick characters in these movies going to realize that handguns and rifles don't hurt the pumpkinhead why don't they try jamming another stick up this thing's a instead and lastly are the writers of this movie so creatively challenged that they couldn't come up with names for the two feuding families more original than the and the mccoys while you're at it why not write a screenplay about a fictional president and name him george bush someday i may have the mental stamina to watch this movie all the way through without drifting off to sleep until then if somebody has the answers please let me know
<START> long ago and far away they knew how to make a musical and cover girl is no exception to the rule br br a story of a dancer in a nightclub who becomes a cover girl and famous the old adage applies here that happiness and fame always don't mix br br the dance routines are marvelously choreographed what dancing and chemistry between rita hayworth and gene kelly br br otto kruger is the older gentleman who discovers hayworth when he sees her picture that shows a strong resemblance to the woman who left him at the aisle hayworth's grandmother br br a jealous reaction by kelly drives rusty hayworth into the arms of broadway producer lee bowman br br the picture is basically history repeating itself at the end br br to add to the glory of this fine film there is the always wise cracking eve arden and the hilarious phil silvers appropriately named genius in the film
<START> i rented boogie nights last week and i could tell you when i watched the film i had a blast if you think that when you watch the film you will get by the porn i mean yes if your not a porn person who can't bother being by it than this isn't the film to see but the thing is the whole film isn't really about porn well halfway through the film is about the porn industry but the other half is about the character development and the bad situations these characters go through the actors played there roles perfect especially mark wahlberg john c reilly and william h macy the sex scenes of course are terrific but mainly focus on the character's hype in porn films until there struggles excellent film one of the best br br hedeen's outlook 10 10 a
<START> no music no stupid masala a reasonably realistic portrayal of the police system in india and based on a real encounter specialist in india that is ab tak 56 56 how many criminals the lead has killed well you already know that bit brilliance exudes nan patekar in the role as a relaxed and calculating indian cop the one liners are just hilarious the plot though slightly predictable on review is intriguing all the same another one of the films from ram gopal the factory movies which are either decent or really good ab tak meanders close to very good but yet remains one of the top 70 films released from india commercial and artsy included br br what is great is the story telling is relaxed and showcases finally in an indian flick how the police network works the cast is really damn good but seriously the one liners are funny as hell though i dont know if the subtitled version will appear as funny the producers are trying for a cannes release which is interesting made by debut director aman i think thats his name br br again 55 y o nana patekar is brilliant away from his silly shouting roles of the past just shows what a good director can do with a good actor really good stuff if you are interested in indian movies and are disgusted by the nonsense some of our guys dish out then this is definitely a relief br br again patekar is the guy who carries the movie on his shoulders and epitomises the style of the movie relaxed funny intelligent and calculating good good acting nice direction all in all great stuff recommendations ram gopal verma's company both indian flicks
<START> this movie got better with time i can't believe that it has been forty years since i saw this at the age of 15 yes that's right movie ratings were not yet a reality so any teenager could walk into any movie imagine what it was like for a kid my age to see both midnight cowboy and in the same year imagine the times bobby kennedy and martin luther king has just been killed but the following summer had a man walking on the moon and woodstock was the woodstock nation's chance to stick it to the man you'll see where robert downey jr got his sardonic brilliance his old man was an instant hero to kids like me no punches are pulled in this classic and aging hippies will rejoice when they relive this era hopefully new flower children will be emboldened by it and this current era of fascism will come under the same scrutiny my era was subjected to
<START> boogie nights follows a theme that is extremely familiar to gangster films although it doesn't fit into that genre itself the rise and the fall we see the rise of several individuals some of them from complete obscurity to achieving great heights and then falling from grace due to their excesses br br i believe that this is the first feature by writer director paul thomas anderson and it's a great start i saw elements of other directors' influences such as robert altman but the film holds its own in originality and plot development br br character development is the movie's finest feature i really identified with all of the characters and felt their pain and their success with them all of the performances were brilliant it was especially good to see a small part performed by real life porn veteran nina hartley br br basically this film combines comedy and tragedy with the result being one of the best films of 1997 which was snubbed at the oscars probably due to the racy as they would say subject matter and the general conservatism of the academy
<START> if you like to watch movies because they are pretty you should be okay with this one if you like to watch movies that start out with a good guy trying to catch a bad guy then reveal clues to the motives of each throughout the movie skip it at the end of the movie i still didn't know why killed the women the way he did when you set up such a ritualistic serial killer it would be nice to know where the rituals originated from in dreams was a similar pretty movie with a serial killer which also wasn't the best but at least the whys of how he killed the girls was explained they also hinted at a dark background for vaughn's character but didn't explain didn't really say why lopez's child psychologist was so much better suited for this task than the rest of the people they interviewed didn't give much of an explanation for the little kid's problem etc if the rest of the story is compelling i don't care about details like how afforded all the fancy electronic equipment and underground chambers or why the fbi wasn't checking to see if he owned any other property or had access to out of the way places while they were waiting to see if the whole entering the killer's mind thing would work but i do like to have a sense of what motivates the serial killer in a serial killer movie when he kills in such a complex manner
<START> zeppelin is my favorite band so when i heard that this double dvd was coming out i was understandably excited i'll just cut to the chase here and say that if you are any kind of zeppelin fan you must run out and buy this right away it's absolutely spectacular it blows 'the song remains the same' completely out of the water why this material was never released before is beyond me the footage presented here really shows at the peak of their game which i never really felt that quite did jimmy page is the best ever without a doubt and these performances make jimi hendrix look like a chump be on the lookout for the live jam 'white whew br br viva jimmy page br br viva led zeppelin br br 11 out of 10
<START> surface from the day its teaser first showed in the summer of 2005 was a tossup on one hand it seemed so high concept and plot driven that to the it felt like it would work out better as a motion picture or several plus it felt like it was nbc's attempt at a lost killer on the other hand one may have realized that the story was too expansive to tell in a movie or two and fans of lost seemed intrigued br br so after one and possibly only season on nbc the show is on an indefinite hiatus that could either put it in the vault on sci fi or filling a gap in nbc's lineup in the summer or fall of 2007 or beyond its ratings were some of the better on the network which isn't saying much but the show has been taken off the air with no real official announcement of its future br br so is it worthwhile yes br br surface follows a continuing story format driven by plot with next to no filler episodes almost everything that happens on the show is important to the plot much like a motion picture no filler episodes which put a pain in your side when you missed an episode yet the show's double edge helped made up for that big things seem to happen every episode but since it feels like a movie you end every episode feeling like little happened and you're left wanting more that trait of the show though shows how great it is the cast is solid the three main leads including the beautiful lake bell as laura put in a solid performance every episode each driven by their own reasons for finding studying the creatures the supporting cast including ian anthony dale and the brief performance by rade serbedzija fill out the cast well the story is slow to start my one regret it doesn't really pick up until a 3 4 episodes in to the short 15 episode season but the latter half of the season makes up for it the visual effects are stunning one's jaw will drop when you see an overhead view of one of the creatures 'attack' a ship as well br br many of the show's problems can be remedied by purchasing the complete first season and not having to wait a week or three to watch the next episode br br in short if you've missed the first season and you're curious go back and watch it it's no twin peaks in terms of quirkiness but the high concept nature of it puts in in league with that lost and other similar shows with a flair for action and adventure enjoy it
<START> hollywood is one of the best and the beautiful things that had occurred in my life i admire and am very much fascinated by the way hollywood generates ideas and implement them it makes me wonder about the scope of human brain i saw a long time back but the story direction cast and of all acting is still fresh in my mind the story begins with our lead actor sutherland saying during sunrise what a beautiful day to die for all of us it's a story which shows emotions that are sometimes withheld in our mind during our entire life never able to understand few things in life it shows us to get motivated and to improve our quality of life anyway i suggest it to all that watch it once
<START> this was by far one of the worst movies sandra bullock has starred in ben affleck should stay behind the camera and continue writing scripts this is definitely his forte and acting is not i actually lasted 54 minutes into this movie before i was so bored with it i felt compelled to leave the theater it's a bore from beginning to well 54 minutes into the film anyway the premise of guess what happened to me on the way to the has been done over and over to death somehow there just doesn't seem to be anything funny or romantic about people cheating on each other parents should be aware that this may not be a suitable film for your teenage children especially impressionable ones that may view sandra as a hero there is a scene where the writers producers directors thought it would be nice to show how acceptable it is to smoke a joint while driving and then have no consequences at all when caught i'm no prude and i smoked my share when i was younger but i guarantee you i won't take my teenagers to see it and they're solid a b students if you want to see a good sandra bullock movie rent the net or hope floats which i believe are two of her best works
<START> as i was reading through the comments i was surprised to come across one that said this movie was not very profound i have to has to be one of the deepest and most thought provoking films i've ever seen yes the acting and the music were excellent they have been praised over and over in the reviews however i also praise the heart of the movie it resonates with deep meaning and is a story of redemption it is about two very different and very flawed characters beaten down by life but too strong to lie down and die it is about a man seeing more value in a girl than she saw in herself it reminded me strongly of the book redeeming love by francine rivers which has a similar story of redemption yes the images and themes are messy and sometimes shocking but if you look close enough you may just see yourself in these characters sometimes the truest things in life are not pretty but they are real
<START> i bought this film from e bay as part of a lot of about twenty horror flicks all about a dollar a piece when watching this my first impression was that it probably was from the late 80s later on i began thinking the linkin park posters on the wall and everything else seemed to hint that i was dealing with a more recent film realizing that the flick became an unbearable torment the last 3 minutes were the longest in the movie history the film just refused to end is there a genre such as horror for children in that case this film is definitely it if there are parents perverse enough to want to introduce their offspring to horror i suggest this would be perfect for kids of about 6 8 the only thing i really liked was greg who was much too good an actor for that kind of nostalgic retro bottom part of a drive in double bill
