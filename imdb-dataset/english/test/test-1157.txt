<START> to say that this is a good show is not to say anything at all after all this show is made by the same crew responsible for airplane and other hilarious and brilliant movies writing is superb even though the show is built on one liners they don't become overbearing or annoying leslie nielsen is flexing his comedy muscle to the full extent as if saying you ain't seen nothing yet the format was definitely polished to introduce naked gun when watching these movies notice how many are taken from the tv show the brilliant part is that they don't have to be changed too much the show was truly a testing ground for bigger and better versions to come later
<START> i'm surprised with the questions and issues this documentary has brought up in the reviews here specially because they're indeed interesting questions surely the ones who could best address it would be the makers of the film themselves nevertheless i think i can shed some light upon something that i think has been overlooked which is in my opinion the purpose of the film what it is about and what it's trying to convey what's its message after all at the risk of pointing out the very obvious i'll start saying the filmmakers have an intention they're trying to tell a story extract meaning out of it and get a point across with this in mind we can shoot down many of the criticized points particularly the ones involving what people expected in contrast with what the filmmakers were really trying to show causes and consequences of violence the film is not about that it's not enlightening non brazilian audiences about the brazilian issue well who wanted to do that is this or that and supported by whom it doesn't matter in this context not enough women in the film for your tastes it's not about equality or the feminist cause every little detail about anderson's life mother son family and all the aspects and the workings of the movement well don't be so picky because it doesn't matter there's just so much length a story can have before it can't become a film anymore if the authors were to show everything everyone is expecting they'd have to make a 6 months tv series instead if you are expecting all that you approach the film the wrong way br br the film is actually about two individuals who started a movement two individuals full of ideals two individuals who thirst for change two individuals trying to do something about all the wrongdoing going around them individuals who went rock bottom and wanted to get up again it's all about finding purpose in life drawing inspiration from misery changing the destiny and becoming something else than what they were destined to be criminals and drug dealers for that matter it's about achievement and hope and not about the cruel reality of violence in rio de janeiro though it's an integral part of the film given that's what the characters are constantly surrounded by unexpectedly and not without a reason the film ends up centered much more on anderson's course through difficulties in life this is because they were faced with anderson's accident while they were shooting the film i'm not sure about this but they may have even seriously considered ending the filming right there leaving behind all effort spent but anderson wanted to keep going and so they did risking to lose in having a film with a bit of an identity crisis considering the sudden change of course but gaining in showing someone overcoming such a devastating happening it's very evident for who watches it that the film begins about and winds up about anderson it's very unique in this sense the shift of the story line maybe their only sin is not making it evident upfront which may initially rise expectations that will go unfulfilled br br as for the importance or ordinariness of anderson i'd say not everybody wants to change the whole world end all violence feed all the hungry be like mahatma ghandi be as known as mother teresa or whoever other known personalities there are it's much easier to relate to and draw inspiration from someone who is such as everybody else in fact trying to transform his or her own harsh life raising problematic kids coping with permanent injuries or diseases and even managing to pay the bills by the end of the month to understand the movie you have to see that's about leaving behind a past of involvement with drugs and crime making up for it and trying to persuade others not to go down the same troublesome path though you can criticize if the way they chose to do it is effective and doubt the ideology of the method you cannot deny their intentions br br also the perception that anderson is special or a chosen one may have partially something to do with the fact that the filmmakers became very involved in the lives of the characters they were depicting as much as becoming friends with them there's no way it wouldn't tint the whole movie with a more favorable light over anderson if a dear friend becomes paralyzed in an accident it's not just a fact you make a big deal out of it and this is not necessarily bad it's not much that they treat him like a chosen one as much as they go to great lengths trying to show him as a seed for transformation and source of inspiration br br in conclusion don't watch this documentary for the scenes of the reality of poverty and crime it contains watch it for what it is much more an inspirational story br br nike ad like seems just damn good and professionally made to me and doesn't affect or detract from the intentions of the film romanticized speculate on its credential as a documentary if you will but why not when it's supposed to cause reaction and inspire isn't trying to better people's lives through music and dance the essence of what the subjects are trying to do romanticizing the very own reality pardon me but showing just the plain facts is what reporters do and you can watch it on tv every night br br if i wanted to become a filmmaker i wish my first film would also be this great
<START> it was so disjointed it seemed to jump from place to place and the thief was obvious it was a poor man's not to mention high school less than zero i would pass on this movie as it has very little to add so many issues are left unresolved and that's okay but the fact that it jumps around to the point where you wonder what's exactly going on is terrible the voice over is needed because the movie doesn't work on its own avoid this movie and watch something else about rich teen angst i'm sure there are plenty of others to watch don't waste your time on this
<START> this is a beautifully filmed movie that questions the future of all indigenous peoples especially nomadic tribesmen focusing on the of tibet the film moves at pace that may make some western viewers uncomfortable for some peoples life still proceeds at the same pace which it has for thousands of years this film follows a group of tribesmen on their annual two month quest to get salt their tribe lives its life in a traditional manner slowly by modern standards and always accounting to their many gods this is a remarkable film one which will preserve a piece of what may unfortunately become history well worth the time don't be in a rush when you see it
<START> i readily admit that i watch a lot of really bad movies but there are very few that i can think of that are quite as bad as when women had tails it's a stinker of epic proportions what should have been a sexy comedy about a group of cavemen discovering a woman for the first time is instead a dull lifeless affair without a single laugh to be had the comedy is extremely weak i suppose if you think bashing someone in the head is funny you might find a laugh or two the guys in this movie make the three stooges look like high art and there's just not enough of a plot to hold the thing together it seems to drag on and on and on br br well you may be asking yourself if it's as bad as you say why haven't you rated it lower than a 3 10 good question and i've got two answers first the movie is not without its curiosity value i do find a bit of interest in an italian spoof of movies like one million years b c with raquel welch i'll give when women had tails a point for its historic value the other two points are for the mere presence of berger i know it's not much of an explanation or reasoning for a rating but what are you going to do it's the best i can come up with
<START> this movie had lots of potential beautiful women cute guys a beach beer a hot tub a mansion on the beach a swimming pool a sexy maid who hates her job and really nice cars however the movie had one thing that doomed it to failure a full length script and a bunch of sexy women who want to give acting a try because they think it would be a cool idea br br let's put it this way br br if you find yourself at a party and you have a choice between watching this movie or a childs potty training video from the 70s choose the potty training video
<START> i'm proud to say i'm a student at milwaukee where parts of the film were shot yep i recognize mitchell hall where i took a film class possibly the same course as fellow student smith br br that's where i learned about american movie our professor told us about it shortly before its release to be sure i was intrigued but for some reason i put off seeing it for several months it must've done pretty well if it was still playing at least in milwaukee br br when i finally got around to seeing it i thought it was an entertaining documentary it's not a masterpiece it goes on a bit too long but i find mark's passion and commitment inspiring i hope this film signals the beginnings of bigger and better things him maybe his forthcoming northwestern will propel him to fortune who knows br br rating out of br br 108 min released by sony pictures classics
<START> this bittersweet slice of magic realism had a checkered production history director writer replaced and tanked at the box office but it's a helluva film br br elijah wood and joseph are pre teen brothers whose flaky mom lorraine bracco shacks up with a mean spirited alcoholic adam baldwin during his drinking bouts baldwin physically abuses and manipulates him into remaining silent about his situation but when wood on to what's happening the boys put their heads together and hatch a solution to devastating dilemma br br i love films that mix fantasy and dark reality they are rarely successful financially lawn dogs is a similar example but they are usually original and intriguing br br the drunk baldwin is shot from a low child's perspective and his head is deliberately lopped off below the top of frame this device allows us to judge him purely by his actions and as a totally beast both wood and are excellent and they pull us effortlessly into their dark frightening world br br the radio flyer of the title is a small red wagon kids transport their belongings in here it transports a dream br br seriously interesting stuff
<START> death camp opera right here right now br br ten years ago i read that a very special movie had been directed about the polarization of our society a certain peter was the author his picture was acted by some non professional actors citizens like you and meÂ and others the violence of the atmosphere was described as extremely realistic was it a movie a documentary both actually br br over the years i realized how hard it was to find it maybe i would by coincidence anyway it's yet an old story i saw it a short while ago totally impressing my very favourite peace of art punishment park is its name i love this docu fiction this this what ever after all the shock movies i saw i reach the best with this strong and intense i found a masterpiece there is enough on the net to know many things about the movie it is even to buy on dvd with additional stuff the only words i want to add is about my own experience with this film i can only trust such a sincere and engaged peace of art about people and for people those who direct act or watch a cinema which is simply a real human experience within an art or the opposite br br so i'm not talking about all the we can see on tv especially the show' whom the concepts of people playing them selves are interesting but used in a stupid and perverse way in punishment park we can see some real individuals living as they are we only put them in a very specific context with a few lines to follow and we let them be what they want to be it's a kind of therapy a way of for those inside the movie and also for the active spectators in front of screens then to end the director's touch edits a short and sweet apocalypse movie a desperate scream a 'death camp opera' where some folks are on the run after virulent trials punishment park is for those who want to grow see this film and have the opportunity to choose your own morality grow up and yourself with it if you can feel it if you can see it in my case punishment park is stuck in me for ever with all my love consciousness and will
<START> this is one particular stooge short that actually uses satire in conjunction with slapstick a rarity as mentioned the title and concept for this short was borrowed from a feature film from the same year with clark gable called men in white it's basically about the trials and tribulations of interns and their sacred cause for duty and humanity i saw this recently and almost treated it like the stooge version because it does take itself a little too seriously in any case men in black is so well written directed and not to mention original it didn't borrow a thing from chaplin or any of the others that the motion picture academy nominated it for an award as the best short comedy of 1934 some stinky short called la cucaracha outdid it though and stole the award some producer's brother in law must have been on the academy's voting board men in black pokes fun at the whole concept of the medical profession much in the same way that the marx bros always did at this time may not be a fair comparison but i can see the marx bros in this short in fact in their feature a day at the races there is a scene where there's medical things going on and they cause anarchy as usual my guess that this particular short was judged along those lines and hence why it was nominated in the first place try this in fact watch this short first and then watch duck soup or day at the races with the and then see if there isn't the same great quality of comedy
<START> this movie was really well written and was very entertaining there was great acting in it too luke perry did a very convincing job like he always does if you are looking for a eventful movie to watch this should be at the top of your list there is a mixture of comedy drama and action you can literally feel what the actors are feeling at points i was very impressed by this movie the special effects were very well done the whole movie was very convincing this movie is one of my favorites what happens is north america could be torn apart and jack and his team have to try and to stop an eruption by destroying north america it was a very cool and creative idea i loved this movie and i know you will too
<START> a heroic young trail scout leads a large party of pioneers along the big trail to the west with indian attacks natural disasters romantic complications all part of the adventure br br as sweeping magnificent as its story raoul walsh's the big trail is a wonderful film as entertaining as it was more than seven decades ago with very good acting and excellent production values it lives up to its reputation as the first epic western br br john wayne pulled from obscurity for his first important movie role looks impossibly young but he immediately impresses with the natural charm masculine authority he brings to the hero's role he quietly dominates the film with the attributes which would someday make him a huge star marguerite churchill is fetching as a lovely southern belle who slowly warms to the duke's attentions dialect comic el is great fun as a swedish immigrant beset with mule mother in law woes his appearance in a scene signals laughs for the viewer br br looking sounding like a human grizzly bear tyrone power sr vast repulsive makes a wonderful villain slick ian keith is a sophisticated bad guy his famous physical similarity to john gilbert is very apparent here silent movie character actor tully marshall is impressive as a wily old mountain man who helps guide the wagon train corpulent russ powell as a friendly fur trapper puts his vocal talent for making nonsense noises to good use sharp eyed movie mavens will spot ward bond as one of the missouri settlers br br what will surprise many modern viewers is that the big trail was filmed in an early wide screen process called grandeur more than living up to its name the picture looks marvelous with walsh showing a mastery of the new technology he fills the screen every portion of it with action notice during the crowd scenes how everyone is busy doing real work which adds so much to the verisimilitude of these sequences walsh deserves great credit for being one of the first directors to use wide screen in addition the film is blessedly free of the rear projection photography which so many older films it should also be stressed that it is only natural that the soundtrack sounds a little primitive talkies were still in their cradle that walsh was able to use a microphone at all with most of the scenes shot out of doors is more kudos for him br br the big trail was not a box office success in 1930 william haines' comedies were the big money makers and the public was looking for fare other than intelligent westerns most of the cast slipped into obscurity including wayne it would not be until 1939 when john ford rescued him in stagecoach that john wayne's legend would begin in earnest and despite its grand sweeping vistas it would be another 25 years before wide screen caught on with hollywood largely as an answer to the economic threat from television
<START> i had the pleasure of seeing live before seeing the video version of the show while nothing can compare to actually being there the people behind the video did an amazing job of capturing the flavor the feel the sensation and so much more the wonderful performances of stunningly amazing troupe are beautifully captured throughout the video flows as smoothly and artfully as the production itself a wonderful experience
