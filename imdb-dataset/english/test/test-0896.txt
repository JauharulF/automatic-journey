<START> the 20th animated disney classic is often criticized by many people as mediocre or poor in quality but it is a great movie br br too bad that the aristocats doesn't get the deserved credit i personally see it as one of my favorite disney classics br br despite being extremely underrated it is one of the funniest disney classics it is full of hilarious some of them hysterical moments br br edgar the greedy butler is the villain of the movie but he is a perfect comic relief he's one of my favorite disney villains because he is so funny br br every scene with edgar and the hound dogs napoleon and lafayette chasing him are among the most hilarious you'll ever see especially the one when edgar drives his motorcycle into the river and around the bridge with the dogs chasing him that is hysterical br br but the classic humor doesn't just come from edgar or the hound dogs other characters have their moments as well br br about the quality subject it isn't perfect but remains on a high level even after walt disney's death those artists knew how to keep faithful to walt's spirit and the aristocats is one of those examples they don't make them like this nowadays br br as usual legendary disney actors voice the characters in this case we have phil harris sterling holloway paul eva gabor and pat br br the characters are cool in general thomas duchess and her 3 kittens the mouse the alley cats the english geese the hound dogs and the horse the human characters are included as well the eccentric and kind retired opera singer madame adelaide the comic old lawyer georges and edgar himself br br about the soundtrack it has some nice and catchy songs such as thomas theme but i can't remember its name everybody wants to be a cat and the aristocats sung by maurice chevalier for example br br this movie takes place in paris france in the year of 1910 above all this is a joyful nice and very pleasant movie a timeless classic which is often underestimated and forgotten but very worthy br br this should definitely be on top 250
<START> an apt description by spock of an all powerful fop into whose clutches fall the crew of the enterprise this was one sector of space our starship should have avoided first sulu kirk simply disappear off the bridge a landing party follows them to the surface of an unknown planet and encounter a seemingly aristocratic man dressed in attire from an earth of many centuries past but he demonstrates abilities of someone or something far beyond human and doesn't register on mccoy's medical the officers manage to escape back to the ship but like some bad cosmic penny keeps popping up he brings them all back including some female companionship to continue his games the dilemma now takes on elements of 'the most dangerous game' out in space and there's an exasperating even infuriating aspect to the crew's utter helplessness before such unbridled power br br what really makes this a great episode is the memorable performance by guest star campbell as the overpowering but not all knowing alien his character is obviously an early version of q who was introduced 20 years later in the pilot for the tng series confrontation scene with spock stands out among all the strange drama which unfolds as usual kirk quickly begins to look for possible weaknesses in his new nemesis despite being quite outmatched the answers to exactly what or who is are right in front of us the whole time so when we do learn the truth it makes complete sense in view of campbell's pitch perfect acting he indulges himself constantly preening before some unknown audience remarking on things with a flair which is infectious but not quite right we can't quite pin it down at first but there's something missing here every few minutes his tone becomes sinister and the crew now appears to be in serious danger in a way you can't take your eyes off him always waiting to see what he does next actor john de lancie captured that similar tone as q on the next generation series
<START> i love this young people trapped in a house of horrors movie not just because i'm a huge linnea quigley jill fan but because it is a lot of fun and actually scary at times br br the special effects are awesome especially scene with the lipstick and towards the end when almost everyone is dead and possessed br br plenty of nudity provided by linnea and jill plenty of humor cool soundtrack high body count etc by the way if you have never seen this one try and buy watch the unrated version which has more gore and some scenes the rated version is missing
<START> i'm a collector of films starring ms weaver so i bought this only because of her being in it i find it really odd that her early career is filled with so many awful movies she started with incredible promise in alien but then had a slew of bombs these bombs include this movie deal of the century one woman or two and half moon street she also appeared in the year of living dangerously which was not a bomb but her performance was less than notable in the time between alien and it's 1986 sequel aliens the only movie she did that was worth anything was ghostbusters before the release of aliens i'm sure everyone thought this woman was on her way out luckily she wasn't br br back to eyewitness though the film is boring it doesn't create any suspense william hurt seems like a cardboard stand in and the atmosphere is just to dry sigourney is decent but nothing worth remembering br br watch this movie if you must but don't go in with any expectations of a decent movie watch better movies with these two stars like accidental tourist and working girl
<START> the producer matt stumbled upon the film's subject anderson sa leader of the music movement when on a hewlett foundation trip to rio de janeiro was so moved by story that he called his friend nyc filmmaker jim zimbalist who quit his job and joined in brazil to work on a documentary on sa favelas and the culture of violence br br the first part of the film shows you the culture of violence in favelas shantytowns where the poor live via footage of police raids and assaults on the residents the footage is graphic and shocking br br rising from the negativity of the favelas is the charismatic anderson sa who overcame a possible career in drug dealing to start the movement which combines elements of afro brazilian culture reggae ska and other elements into a fast paced percussion heavy style of music which has since spread to other parts of the world you can't help but be carried away by the music especially when you see the local children get involved in school which he founded to keep kids out of drug gangs the rest of the film follows meteoric rise and his positivity changes many of the children's lives to seek a life beyond drug running spoiler just when the filmmakers thought they had wrapped filming an unbelievable life changing event occurs of which the resolution has to be seen to be believed the film then continues and you are gripped in your seat until the end br br this film is a response to city of god and a worthy one at that the bleak situation portrayed in that movie is countered by a real example of how dwellers can overcome the dire situation they are in and use their resources to constructive ends you can't help not liking and rooting for anderson sa to succeed br br this film is terrifically shot fast paced and is quite absorbing judging by the overwhelming response of the audience at last night's screening the film should get domestic distribution in the us and the thumping soundtrack should be released as well keep an eye for this superlative documentary it is excellent
<START> this film was basically set up for failure by the studio one anne rice author of the book offered to write the screen play but was refused by the studio two they tried to stuff 2 in depth novels in to a 2hour movie br br i maintain the only way for these two books vampire lestat and queen of the damned to work in a live action form would be through a mini series first off the the vampire lestat alone takes place from the 1700's to the 1980's and has a plethora of character vital to the plot understanding of the main character lestat the entire book vampire lestat sets up the events of the second part queen of the damned without that full understanding the premise of a movie is destroyed br br lestat was not cruel and vicious to all he was not wanting to go along with plans marius did not make lestat lestat did not love jesse or make her lestat could not go remain unscathed by the light marius was not after david nor the other way around every character was completely represented wrong basically same names different story br br if they wanted to make a vampire movie fine even if you wanted to be inspired by these novels fine but don't back into the theaters off the success of rice's great novels and characters just to destroy what her loyal readers have come to love br br if you haven't read the books you won't understand the film really if you have read the books you will be insulted that being said i am such a huge fan i had to see the movie knowing full well this was going to be the case and still went for it catch 22 must see it will hate it
<START> this should have been a short film nothing more the length of 1 5 hours is much too long because after 10 minutes you have seen almost every joke it's getting more and more on your nerves untill you finally kick out your brain to endure that movie br br to do yourself a favor don't mention to see that movie
<START> this is an excellent little known movie tom selleck does an outstanding job of acting in this movie with the japanese i'd love to see if this movie has come out on dvd yet there are some spots that clearly have been cut tom's love interest has clearly had some parts chopped it would be interesting to see more of japan in the film the baseball sequences are far and away the most realistic of any baseball movie i'm quite sure most of the actors were current or former baseball players i love loading the tape of this movie at least once a year best scenes involve the lack of hat tipping after tom gets in the big game and an intensely sensual scene of tom having a hot bath with dennis haysbert also does a great job it's good to see he's finally getting some recognition not just in baseball movies he was also in major league
<START> after watching avalon which was decent only because of the very nice digital fx and several anime films written by oshii including jin roh which is fantastic i decided i should check out the oshii cinema trilogy box set being that the red spectacles and stray dog are related i will comment here on both and let me tell you it was one of the biggest wastes of money i have spent in a while i first watched stray dogs and then the red spectacles i am sad to say that these films are quite possibly the most boring two movies i have ever seen for only about 10 minutes in each film do you get to see some action between the the characters who are only dressed in the cop outfits for a few fleeting scenes the rest of the time you will see some very drawn out scenes filled with boring dialogue in some less than impressive locations i really don't understand the motivation behind these two films at all i love the wolf brigade outfits and the idea behind the plot but the films themselves leave much to be desired i would suggest not watching these films and certainly do not buy the box set like i did unless you enjoy wasting money oh and if you are wondering what i think about the 3rd movie in the set talking head i couldn't even bring myself to watch it before i purged the box set from my dvd collection via ebay at a 20 loss if you want cool japanese live action check out or ichii the killer or the series
<START> teenage exorcist is one of those god awful films to video that makes the viewer give up any expectations of decent entertainment for low brow sexual antics adolescent humour and empty writing this film delivers exactly what its was trying to deliver it is about a girl moving into a house where a baron de sade hmmm once lived and finally being drawn to him through her own inner demon her sister and brother in law along with an irish priest her boyfriend and a pizza delivery boy try to save her and exorcise her demon well not much here in way of horror or suspense in fact one line from the film pretty much sums up what to expect mike the girl's brother in law has tied her the name is diane by the way and she is played by brinke stevens up after trying to chainsaw her sister he removes a gag from her mouth and says something like this won't be the last gag we see tonight indeed it was not the special effects are cheesy and poorly crafted and the film makes use of this by playing on its comedic appeal some of the lines and situations are funny robert quarry old count yorga himself really steals his scenes as an irish priest he hams it up wailing biblical verses and crooning irish songs you know you are in trouble however when eddie gets top billing does his schtick and has a couple nice moments as well but the material is just too threadbare than to be anything more than teenage sophomoric time filler michael berryman from the hills have eyes also has a brief but interesting cameo in the film as for the other thespians well they are all pretty good at being pretty mediocre stevens is lovely in fishnet stockings and french cut panties but beyond that don't expect too much more from her her sister is played by elena and she shows a bit more than brinke a very lovely young lady by the way and out acts brinke by miles her husband played by jay richardson shows off his ability to act and be funny amidst mediocrity again not a bad film to waste a little time that involves no thinking on if you are a robert quarry fan watch it for his performance at the very least
<START> you're dead is an indescribably awful attempt at a british gangster film it has not got a single original idea in it being an atrocious copy of various elements of lock stock two smoking barrels the usual suspects and pulp fiction the acting and dialogue are absolutely excruciating the plot is ludicrous and utterly predictable despite constant attempts at plot twists and contains nothing but one dimensional stock characters and clichÃ©s it has some good actors in it but they are off form and unable to do anything much with the dreadful material they are working with it is absolute torture to sit through this drivel
<START> that this movie has been stapled to the wall of a chapel as proof that god is truly dead am i the only one that really saw rather through this film this is the only movie i've ever seen in the theater that i regret not walking out on and demanding my money back it was just that dull and i even saw highlander 2 the at the local cinema from beginning to end gibson and downey have absolutely no chemistry as two cast together by circumstance who eventually work together as best buddies the action what little there is is goofy and as dull as the of the writer thank whatever deity is down at us as it observes our cinema that there's no chance for an air america 2
<START> this was on odd film i liked the adventure of it though it seems to be aimed at children spoiler ahead ironically the main character murders a federal official then he's a fugitive on the run they later blow up his house and then he finally commits suicide seems like they should have just made it a film for a more mature audience or made it more family friendly br br this was on odd film i liked the adventure of it though it seems to be aimed at children spoiler ahead ironically the main character murders a federal official then he's a fugitive on the run they later blow up his house and then he finally commits suicide seems like they should have just made it a film for a more mature audience or made it more family friendly
<START> this movie was great don't understand the disrespect it get's i first scene this in like 87 88 and it was actually scary if you are an 80's horror fan you should have no problem with this film it has everything that makes 80's horror great i got to meet a few of the actor's and they were cool what is not great about a creepy old house demons crazy party horny good looking young people the dialog and the special fx made this movie a classic this film also took care of one of those classic rumors about horror the black guy does not alway's have to die in the end even though this movie was great there is one thing that remains undiscovered to me what really happened to the old couple at the end was it on purpose or not that little side story thing alway's had me puzzled
<START> stars robert mitchum as a world weary private eye probing the case of a missing industrialist mike connors he is hired by jaclyn smith the anxious wife of the missing man what jaclyn fails to inform mitchum is that she knows full well her husband's whereabouts after all she was the one who helped her lover james franciscus dispose of her wealthy hubby br br what more would expect from a rotten slasher film with robert mitchum mannix goes western monkeys are abused models lean against classic cars and smith is constantly upstaged by sybil danning until a giallo style wrap up brings the whole sorry mess to a bitter end this is bad cinema and this movie is sooooo poor it makes it look like halloween mixed up with trick or treats avoid this br br rated r for graphic violence nudity and sexual situations
