<START> this without any doubt is the greatest spin off to jackass ever made hell it even blows jackass out of the water br br picture this you have a group of guys who just didn't want to grow up throw in a ton of money and some seriously cool stunts and you have viva la bam br br this show it's such a family based one and it's not just the gang running around being complete jerks like in jackass for example parents april and phil are in every episode with appearances of obese uncle don vito to boot the reason why the family makes us laugh is simple somebody in our family can relate april the woman who wants to live life by the book and follow tradition phil the guy who tries to be a good father and finally bam that son that never grew out of high school br br the pranks and jokes in every episode will give you a guaranteed laugh and buying the dvds is definitely recommended another thing which is surprising to see is how casual is over the whole thing he's said in interviews that for the majority of episodes he isn't acting and is just acting off instinct br br what i liked the most about the whole thing however is the amount of influence has over mtv he wanted slayer to play in his backyard mtv did it he wanted to hang with dani filth for a day and have a cradle of filth concert in his backyard it happened br br add to this his passion for the love metal and debated as emo band h i m and his brother's garage band and there's a whole lot of head banging going on br br if you liked jackass you'll fall in love with this i borrowed season 1 from a friend last year and i would give up my legs to meet the viva la bam crew you will not be disappointed and i can promise you'll be in stitches by the end of it all
<START> it is always great to see a movie that teaches us about history in africa as they are definitely too few however the movie depicts as a political leader who wanted the new independent country to be the same as the old colonialist one i felt it hard to sympathise with this kind of leadership yet the movie is somewhat like a homage to the man there was too little content explaining how the man got to rise in the first place and the whole context of belgium letting them go so it is certainly worth going to see as the acting and photography are excellent especially himself i would just have liked a better political analysis
<START> first off i am a huge fan of tolkien and as one i will base most of my critic on his books br br the movie is a standard adventure movie well made with nifty special effects nice sound track and fine acting now if this movie was called something else than lord of the rings the reviews wouldn't be half this good as they are here br br the problem of the movie is that it takes the basic story line from tolkiens books but then it goes and hollywoods everything it can numerous scenes from the book are missing or changed quite a lot the characters are changed from the book also a thing that i think should be punishable what the movie lacks is deep insight of the characters in it i know that it is almost impossible to make a good film out of a good book and it didn't work here mostly the motivation of the characters is left hazy at best br br as a adventure movie it would rate 7 10 as a adaptation of tolkien it rates 2 10 br br i mean honestly what on earth was arwen doing at rivendell ford and as for the comments that this movie is the best ever i can only say that you are very young or you havent seen good movies br br peter jackson should have called this movie an adventure movie based on the lord of the rings
<START> this movie is brilliant br br i don't remember this movie even being in theaters so thinking it was a straight to dvd i have fairly low expectations even though i am a big fan of mike judge it has some of the same kind of comic future satire as brazil and demolition man but taken to the next level br br then i saw the cast luke wilson maya rudolph and dax shepard who were all brilliant in their roles br br needless to say this movie won me over in the first 5 minutes where it shows above average people having fewer children and the poorest stupidest trashiest people having lots of ignorant children and how this is leading to a kind of reverse evolution it takes that concept and then shows where we are headed with this pollution of the gene pool br br sadly i don't think it will take the 500 years as depicted but probably only about 50 i already see the shocking rise of mild retardation in the general populace media and culture people who like classical music and art are ridiculed instead of respected the lowest common denominator seems to rule especially in hollywood and on tv eg jackass the movie and any reality show where they make you eat something disgusting or humiliate yourself for money br br all of the political social satire aside this movie is also just laugh out loud funny and i don't say that lightly few movies make me actually lol but this one did br br a lot of the best jokes are word sight gags in the background so you really have to pay attention to get some of them i even had to pause and zoom in for a few of them like when joe got his government id and for hair it said yes and for eyes it also said yes also the prison has engraved on the front house for particular individuals since the cops in the movie much like real life cops call everyone individuals instead of people etc again this was on the screen for just a moment this is one of those movies you can watch again and again and dissect it to get through the layers of funny br br also i normally watch movies with the subtitles on and that clued me in to some jokes that might pass by your ears in the dialog mix for instance the police constantly talk about people instead of escaping and there are many other mis pronunciations that just cracked me up but again i might not have picked up on them just by the dialog mixed with music sound effects it is very subtle but still hilarious br br additionally the special effects were really good for a sci fi social satire br br i could go on and on but overall i think this is one of those movies that if you don't think it's funny it's probably making fun of you i plan on recommending this to many many people
<START> watch this movie just to see shahrukh khan say i love you k k kiran it's both heartbreaking and frightening at the same time when he says this from the beginning to the end this movie made him famous and i totally recommend it d it's highly entertaining the music's wicked and you will laugh right along with shahrukh here you'll genuinely feel scared for the hero and heroine and oddly enough you will identify with at least one of the characters you will feel sad and happy and relieved and afraid at the same time go see this classic bollywood movie with your good buddies and some lovely food and have a day in and after you see the movie have the songs and scenery playing in your mind forever
<START> i just saw the big trail in vienna's filmmuseum for the first time immediately i was astonished by both the pictures optical high quality and unusual format and by its beautifully detailed story who has ever seen such a documentary style western with john wayne and there is so much time you can actually look around on the screen there is so much to see one is ever grateful that the scenes are often static because every single shot is so well composed and you want to take it it even the acting is good and fits in well the long running time of the picture is wonderful you don't want to miss a minute of it
<START> this movie is way too long i lost interest about one hour into the story saratoga trunk tells the story of ingrid bergman who is an the child of a prominent new orleans man and his mistress after her mother dies in paris bergman comes back to new orleans to her father's legitimate family and to blackmail them she meets gary cooper who is likewise seeking revenge against the railroad tycoons who cheated his father out of his land in texas she draws him into her schemes and the movie climaxes at a saratoga resort long and boring but worth watching if you are a bergman or cooper fan the midget provides the only bright spot in this meandering story

<START> i too was fortunate enough to see checking out with peter falk at the phoenix film festival this is an extremely sweet character driven film that leaves the audience enthralled in the plight in life more than funny each character in the family contributes priceless comic relief that not only spurs laughter but inspires a few joyful tears as well peter falk was born to play this role he plays a 90ish young father of three who brings his adult children together in what could possibly be one of the most important times in his and their lives the 2 day journey that the family takes though the delightful backdrop of new york with carefully selected characters not only leaves the audience wanting more but nourishes ones own sense of family checking out is a must see film not only for all those who cherish family but also all those who don't my thanks to the director who took the chance to bring this gift to its audience robin sly scottsdale arizona
<START> at what point does a film become so bad it's good compelling in it's awfulness darkhunters stands out as a shining example of c p cinematography and for that alone probably deserves some kind of award br br the plot revolves around the age old battle of heaven and hell for the unclaimed souls of the recently dead in the case of darkhunters the representatives of good and evil manifest themselves variously as a herd of cats a hooded grim reaper figure with a face of flickering flames similar to a coal effect electric fire a philip marlowe a like with a seriously bad manicure and a female psychologist who appears to be on day release from kwik save br br the protagonists are competing for the soul of a newly dead teacher who spends most of the film running around a foggy field and bizarrely a boarding in an attempt to evade his pursuers br br the plot is spread thinner than a sandwich with no character development or attempt to build suspense the acting is laughable comparable to a school play although that would be an insult to many educational establishments and the dialogue oh how my sides ached with the unclaimed souls of the dead being described as life's unwanted by the flame glow demon you wonder whether hell really is a mcdonalds br br but is is bizarrely compelling you find yourself watching just to see how bad it can get at just over 80 minutes it's worth the time spent for the unintentional giggles
<START> the thing which makes fire even more appealing to watch apart from its magical artistry is its touch of and rebellion to my mind the very character played by shabana azmi is a symbol of the indian feminine protest against the indian society the name of the movie and the scene when radha walks through flames in her kitchen are of hindu lord wife walking through fire for the proof of her as per the same narrative which appears in the film too the film could be a great inspiration for women particularly those in the to search for their liberties and to attain control of their lives
<START> i am a music lover and was excited to see this movie unfortunately i was disappointed i was ready to walk out half way through the movie i didn't identify with any of the characters which meant that i didn't care what happened to them and lost interest in the story completely on the good side ed harris looked exactly like beethoven and the 9th symphony is always a pleasure to hear so that made part of the film bearable also the parts where they talk about the bridge almost redeemed the entire movie but it couldn't sustain me through to the end the actors did what they could with what they had to work with but the screenplay just wasn't adequate to make it even remotely interesting the bit about wash me was utter rubbish i wonder how many takes the actors had to do on that one i wouldn't be able to say those lines without bursting into laughter anyway such a shame it could have been so much better
<START> jaded takes on the complex question of abuse the perpetrators and the victims in lesser hands it would have degenerated into an erotic thriller made for direct to video this director however has managed to pull off a textured multi layered study with a decidedly different point of view br br given the fact that the director writer is a woman and the main detective and d a are also women this could have turned into a very anti male film it is not to be a sexual predator is gender neutral the nudity of this film is not erotic the rape is brutal not sexual we are looking at victims and not titillation br br the gifted cast rings true for a film that is so little known i was surprised at the quality of the performances they are good carla and are incredible br br somehow this film got lost perhaps it is too smart for its own good it is a should see highly recommend a thinking person's sexual thriller
<START> adam sandler's movies are my favorite comedies the silence of the lambs is my favorite horror movie the matrix is my favorite sci fi movie anywhere but here is my favorite drama br br perhaps the single most valuable asset that this movie has is it's acting br br susan sarandon is absolutely amazing by the end of this movie i felt as if i knew her character better than i knew myself she did a simply amazing job br br natalie portman also did a great job i recently rented her first movie leon 1994 in which she played a 12 year old girl i believe that she is a contradiction in terms she was a good kid actress well 5 years later she is still just as good an actress in fact she's much better br br not only did sarandon and portman portray their characters well but they also worked perfectly together i mean even now i can hardly believe that they are not actually mother and daughter in real life as well as in this movie br br this movie is about a 14 year old girl portman and her restless mother sarandon that leave their home town in wisconsin for beverly hills br br at first portman hates her mother for taking her away from her cousin and friends and the two begin a very tumultuous relationship that goes up and down over the course of a couple years usually down might i add br br although this explanation is a little vague the plot can only be summarized vaguely but when you see this movie you will see that the plot really is not so vague or weak for it is actually very deep what i am saying is that the plot is outlined weakly but then they focus in on it to make it strong br br and it is very strong but also the plot sequencing is great and there are a few brilliant scenes that i hope will someday be seen as classic br br i loved this movie i laughed i cried and although admittedly there are a few loopholes it's still a stellar movie and it really comes together in the end
