<START> hong kong the 1920s a young man from poor beginnings dreams of being a hero and spends most of his time training and learning about kung fu and bodybuilding much against his father's will he helps a servant girl escape from a ruthless businessman whose goons then come after them and terrorizes the young man's uncle's noodle restaurant the uncle turns out to be an old reformed triad assassin who now helps the young guy become proficient in martial arts it's all out karate kid style with wash the wok instead of wax on wax off the kung fu villain is the ruthless businessman's son who has a trademark scorpion style that looks cool although it is quite silly and surely completely unrealistic br br but the story which develops over time has an epic feel good characterization great kung fu and is generally very entertaining the young hero is very sympathetic and provides a good protagonist to root for the romance dimension remains undeveloped though which is a bit disappointing otherwise a great movie br br my rating 8 out of 10
<START> anyone can make a movie these days budget production value or experienced crew don't have to stop the self described director from realizing their dream these days br br respect for the craft of film making or even just respect for any film aesthetic are no longer prerequisites for actually executing a film br br director bill must have thought he struck gold when lion's gate decided to market his original film as a sequel to a film he had nothing to do with br br i personally find lion's gate far far more in error than in regard to dark harvest 2 being made available to the public lion's deceptive marketing of this film should be investigated by the state attorney general's office and lion's officers should be in sulfuric acid and kerosene for their utter disregard for film film making and good sense br br as for the film itself it's not even worth commenting on
<START> i thought choke had potential but i thought it could have been a much better film it had some interesting twists and turns but some of them seemed kind of pointless when showing background on the two main characters some of that really seemed to go awry most of it was sort of useless and didn't help the movie at all this was also not dennis hopper's finest hour however the main saving grace of this movie for me was michael madsen his performance was excellent in this movie he almost makes mr blonde look like a nice guy all in all it was watchable still i was left thinking some things could have been done differently these things would have made the movie much better in my opinion
<START> this parody is cleverly done from the songs express yourself becomes expose yourself like a prayer is now party in my pants and vogue is now vague to the fake interviews of the cast of the show this movie is hilarious remember madonna saying she didn't know about the rain season in asia in this one she doesn't know about the volcano season it is a precious jewel they got a lot of money on that spoof and it pays off highly recommended
<START> this is 1 hour and 24 minutes of pure boredom br br in this 'action' movie even the gun baldwin uses hk sucks it was sent to recycling by armed forces worldwide in the mid eighties and is now only used by terrorists bank robbers and military museums br br if i had known this movie was this bad i would rather watch 10 episodes of macgyver saving the planet br br no groove no drive and no feel watch the channel Â it's more exiting than this sorry excuse for a movie this movie doesn't deserve a on the scale better luck next time baldwin until then i'll sit here watch my toenails grow Â that is far more exiting than
<START> some of the reviewers of this film were extremely generous with praise i personally was disappointed because due to those reviews i was optimistic as the opening credits began to roll br br the all too familiar story line goes like this deformed boy and his father live out in louisiana swamp local boys ridicule and torment him local boys start oh sorry i mean victor cabin on fire with him in it dad attempts to rescue his son formerly known as eddie munster meets the elephant man but accidentally puts a hatchet through the kid's head instead victor becomes a murderous ghost who hunts down unfortunates who enter his domain oooo scary br br one thing i appreciated about hatchet was that it never took itself seriously and some of the gags even made me laugh the thing is i've grown tired of the hollywood polished b horror slap sticks i like to laugh and i enjoy a good scare but this film didn't deliver a solid dose of either as for crowley being the next michael jason or freddy pumpkinhead has a better chance
<START> for some inexplicable reason jerry's movies often seemed to come in for diatribes from certain quarters although they were rarely box office disappointments it's one of life's great mysteries to me because his films have always had a 'feel good' factor about them for me but this film is not only not bad it's an exceedingly good and clever comedy to those who may be tickled by 'modern' crude or cruel humour don't see this film there's nothing in it like that and you'll be wasting your time br br i've only seen this film once on the television i've waited ever since to see it again and that's been quite a few years you'd think the idea of an arrogant millionaire businessman heading off to win the war against the nazis with his own small private army of subservient employees would be boring wouldn't you well only jerry lewis would dare try such a plot for an out and out comedy and it works i have to say brilliantly br br i think that as with 'the nutty professor' and most of his other films this movie is testimony to his comic genius both in concept and execution i think buddy love might have said you know true comedy can not only make a six year old hysterical it'll do that for his dad too maybe a few nutty nazis generals with and a limp would dislike this movie honestly if you only see one more comedy in your life see this one be careful though you might die laughing and i'm not joking
<START> early 80's creature feature concerns a long abandoned gold mine that some intrepid miners are determined to check out naturally they find no gold down there but one very hungry monster that slithers along in search of prey br br while i have to be honest and admit i found it dull at first i personally prefer the thematically similar the boogens it actually grew on me as it went along now the characters aren't too interesting nor the actors either the closest to an interesting character is morgan played by keith hurt in any event female lead terri is quite good looking and rolf makes his domineering jerk an easy person to hate the writer played by effects man mark wears thin quickly br br it begins in a comfortably predictable enough way with a nighttime set piece in which two victims are claimed to get things off to an acceptable start the monster itself is intriguing for its design as you can imagine it gets revealed a bit at a time until late in the game and for being the product of stop motion animation when this process was no longer used very much director melanie anne phillips directing under the pseudonym of david michael hillman and crew deserve some credit for their creation of atmosphere they manage to make the film look quite claustrophobic and gloomy and their use of lighting works well the film does build in intensity towards a pretty good ending suffice it to say they do the best they can on their low budget br br an obscure little item worth looking into for die hard horror buffs br br 7 10
<START> i was fortunate to attend the london premier of this film while i am not at all a fan of british drama i did find myself deeply moved by the characters and the bad choices they made i was in tears by the end of the film every scene was mesmerizing the attention to detail and the excellent acting was quite impressive br br i would have to agree with some of the other comments here which question why all these women were throwing themselves at such a despicable character br br alert i was also hoping that dylan would have been killed by william when he had the chance end spoiler br br keira knightley did a great job and radiate beauty and innocence from the screen but it was sienna miller's performance that was truly oscar worthy br br i am sure this production will be nominated for other awards
<START> when i was very young my mother had a series of four looney tunes merrie melodies shorts on tape and i watched them all several times a coy decoy was one of these shorts and i was truly shocked to read in another comment that it had been banned when i was young i probably did not even understand the black beauty gag to begin with still this is probably why it was banned though until i watched this on a video site i did not even remember the gag upon viewing the video i did remember certain shots in particular the shrinking of hat and eyes becoming as the decoy him in the lake i was not bothered by the gag that was most likely the reason the gag was banned instead i was flooded with childhood memories of watching this short because of how much i liked this short as a child i rate it 7 out of 10
<START> rare and auspicious are the moments in film making when greatness stands as a defining monument for the rest of the industry to measure themselves against and for us to immerse in that glorious moment br br some stories transcend their time and aspire to the lofty reaches of a classic and the stuff of legends throw in the refined skills of an ensemble cast of thespians who are at the very top of their game br br where has all the originality gone it is here as this story and it's cast through a plot and story that will not only educate but also entertain even the most seasoned of shakespearean action love story connoisseurs br br i cannot begin to imagine where the writers dreamed up this extraordinary tale where do geniuses get this kind of inspiration i now have hope for mankind knowing that this kind of talent still exists gives me hope that we will make it to the stars and beyond perhaps to the very gates of heaven br br i have like others before me dreamed of greatness though i did not write this movie i did see it and because of this movie's noble greatness i feel as if i have been elevated to a higher level of being a higher level of spiritual wholeness br br it is no wonder this kind of glory eludes most of us what would become of our world if we all could attain this level of magnificence we would probably be consumed in a white fire of super nova glory as we evolve into trans dimensional spiritual beings capable of omnipotent creative power br br the most important thing to know with all your heart and the very essence of your being is that is nothing like what i have been talking about is the antithesis of all i mentioned it could very well destroy our world for as some reviewers rate a movie on a star system i e 1 through 5 stars or even zero stars i'm going to rate a black hole br br i am willing to donate money to a cause that will put a stop to these kinds of atrocities that as of late seem to be running amuck at box offices i'm not even adverse to the use of nuclear weapons it must stop how much more of this can we take before aliens from outer space come down here and blow up our planet because we have so many stupid crass vulgar unimaginative and degrading movies spewing out of hollywood i'm not even going to dignify this movie by mentioning anyone's name that starred or produced it i'm not even going to waste my time describing the story since we've seen it a ba zillion times and all of the past versions were at least a ga zillion times better br br by the way my head nearly imploded during this movie but with supreme selfless effort and lots o luck i survived to warn the public you have been warned
<START> each guy liv tyler meets loses their head over her not of course without some small encouragement from liv liv is at her beautiful best with matt dillon tops among the paramours interesting initial premise to tell story from perspective of each dupe degenerates into sitcom style finale not unlike blame it on rio with which it has more than a few similarities worth watching nonetheless
<START> i had a bad feeling when i saw the cheap title work it only took a couple of scenes to confirm that this movie is a real stinker the only enjoyment i got out of this was to laugh at the technical flaws example the background car sounds audio just disappears during the scene with danny and dog in dog's car production shows a total lack of imagination example slow motion machine gun fire repeats many times sandra bullock plays essentially a bit part completely unnecessary to the plot to say that this movie actually has a plot is doing more justice to the writing than it deserves the antique computer hardware is kind of interesting this film was released in 1982 not 1987 as the imdb database indicates and then current high tech was an amber screen on a 4 8 ibm pc with floppy drives maybe the pc was the real star of the movie at least it was interesting br br we got this on dvd for a couple of bucks in the bargain bin at walmart as the other reviewer notes we paid too much
<START> jason connery is not an actor he is the son of an actor his macbeth is the worst i have ever seen oh yes he murders king duncan but he also kills william shakespeare his wife is even worse please give me polanski's version on dvd so i can forget this monster jon finch orson welles laurence olivier there you have actors
<START> from the beginning of the film i found myself laughing trying to keep quiet so i did not wake anyone in the house this didn't continue so much throughout the rest of the film i didn't find everything completely laugh out loud funny but still i found certain things quite funny at the beginning i had to hold in laughter when he drops the very crafty looking hand grenade down his sleeve then there are scenes where you will just smile like when the barber falls through a roof into someones apartment i can see that being quite funny but in todays days and time that has been done quite a lot it didn't feel original though at the time i'm sure it was i loved hitlers bursts of raging german with the nice subtle english translation br br the final scene is wildly discussed because well it's absolutely true and so very intelligently constructed though the film is sixty eight years old the final scene is still relevant today if this doesn't show how great a writer chaplin is then i don't know what will the acting in this scene in particular was quite good the barber transcended the message perfectly and makes you realise the serious nature of the film at the same time enjoying the humorous side br br another element about this film is the fact that this was such a brave film that almost feels ahead of it's time of course chaplin did not know what was going to happen after 1940 he was not aware of the holocaust obviously he's also gone on record as to saying if he had of known he would not of made this film the fact this film is so anti hitler is interesting it's more interesting that it wasn't anti germany which would be very easy to have done back in those times chaplin could of easily made this a propaganda film but instead did something more he made an honest film br br i recommend anyone remotely interested in this film to see it as well those who has studied or is studying hitler and wwii to watch this film it's entertaining to say the least it doesn't have an annoying out dated feel that some films of the time did unlike most comedies this film actually has a message it tries to bring to you watch this film you will be better off for having seen it
