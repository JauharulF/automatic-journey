<START> this short movie intends to focus on one issue sociologically known as cultured shock the film presents the condition of average romanian in democratic romania who finds out that the life and the problems are not different from communist period and if you want something you must bribe around to get it br br so our main character is fired after a long while he is around 50 and needs to get a similar job but the only job available is one inferior he is forced to take it because the lack of money br br my opinion is that you have to live in romania so that this movie can be as real and tragic as it seems
<START> i enjoy watching robert forster that was the main reason that i rented this movie i also wanted to see a story take place out in the middle of nowhere where the characters could work off of each other really well with no distractions br br i found the movie to be dull i couldn't get interested in the characters i couldn't get interested in the story which seemed to meander nowhere br br after watching this movie for an hour i turned it off i will rate the movie 4 out of 10 this falls well below the mandatory 7 rating that makes a movie worthwhile to watch
<START> nico banned movie was quite disappointing in my opinion the movie is about a couple who go to a greek island to kill of all perverted people apparently you know you got something pretty sick when one of the first scenes include a guy having sex with a goat and then killing it off br br but things only get worse from that point as all scenes pretty much look alike they meet some people so they either kill or have sex with them preferably both br br the ending is ok allright when the couple turn out to be brother and sister and she is just letting him rot somewhere but overall one would have expected more no substance here i'm afraid br br 3 10
<START> once again mr costner has dragged out a movie for far longer than necessary aside from the terrific sea rescue sequences of which there are very few i just did not care about any of the characters most of us have ghosts in the closet and costner's character are realized early on and then forgotten until much later by which time i did not care the character we should really care about is a very cocky overconfident ashton kutcher the problem is he comes off as kid who thinks he's better than anyone else around him and shows no signs of a cluttered closet his only obstacle appears to be winning over costner finally when we are well past the half way point of this stinker costner tells us all about ghosts we are told why kutcher is driven to be the best with no prior inkling or foreshadowing no magic here it was all i could do to keep from turning it off an hour in
<START> what can you say about a short little film filled with secondary actors and no stars with absolutely no bad performances not one poorly delivered line of dialog and with the cold violence on one hand being balanced by the warm heart of the protagonists in the story br br it's a jewel a diamond a little valuable gem of a western that evokes the spirit and legend of the american west a west not settled by grand heroes like hickock or cody or masterson or earp but by the spread of the everyday man and woman farmers and ranch hands merchants and miners and whores and and entertainers of the day some looking for riches some for peace and quiet some for religious freedom br br it is perhaps a very spiritual story though not promoting any particular religion for even the non mormon cowboys portrayed by ben johnson and harry carey jr act in kind and noble ways toward everybody in the story regardless of religious affiliation and beliefs and go out of their way to promote tolerance and charity when the wagon train comes upon the stranded medicine show people and in true biblical fashion like david and goliath or samson and the philistines they are the guardian angels sent to the wagon train who eventually have to go head to head with the evil incarnate clegg clan likening them to the serpent in the garden of eden and regretting what it is they have to do afterward it's a sweet folkloric tale of the west that hits every target john ford takes aim at br br nowadays i have a western santa claus whose red outfit is covered with a denim coat whose red stocking cap is replaced by a brown who carries a burlap bag of presents and a coil of rope to my santa i added a winchester rifle with a sling to put on one of his shoulders and a colt revolver to tuck into his waistband when people at the office ask why my santa has to carry guns i simply reply snakes after all isn't the spirit of the christmas season one where everybody should get what they deserve br br fifty five years later especially post 911 the philosophies and attributes demonstrated by the characters and story of this movie are still as relevant today as they were back then
<START> dogmatic as another reviewer described this film is a fitting word the director's idea was to present bach without plot acting fun theatrics dialog narrative or drama mission accomplished monsieur pretentious yes cinematic no way this is anti cinema no one moves hardly anyone talks the camera holds static shots for 10 12 minutes at a time very very occasionally the camera will dolly in you may catch a glimpse of gustav fingers moving over the keys that's it br br if you like the idea of staring at the back of a head for 7 minutes at a stretch while listening to bach this is the film for you i'd rather listen to bach on my stereo with my eyes closed
<START> darr was a super hit film which was loved by many peoples it tells the story of shahrukh khans innocent obsession for juhi who loves sunny deol honestly it was a entertaining movie but if you look carefully its not too realistic shahrukh khan keeps phoning juhi and tells her that he loves her too bits he gives an announcement in college that he loves her and gives her some nice surprises like beautiful photos of her unfortunately instead of being flattered that a guy loves her too bits she gets very very scared i personally know 100s of people that get pranked by someone and these people enjoy it cos they play a long yash chopra gives us a good film that does entertain widely because of shah rukh khan's character sunny deol is suppose to be the main actor but darr belongs to shah rukh khan delivering a superb performance shah rukh khan is literally the villain of the movie but i would of been happy if he got the girl because he loves her so dearly sunny deol gives a decent performance but he beats up all those guys on his own and survives a brutal knife attack juhi chawla is cute as ever in a fairly good performance some good songs including tu mere being the best
<START> whoever cast this movie was a genius every character in it is perfect for their part and they all do an absolutely excellent job in their parts this is a good glimpse of what life was before during the civil war the difference between the wealthy the average whites and the black people the story gives you some insights as to the real issues of the era and the difficulties that were inherent in everyday living back in those days the storyline is compelling and the drama keeps your attention through the entire movie there are characters you will fall in love with there are characters you will hate and you will find yourself emotionally involved br br both my wife and i loved it and we will watch it again in a few years i'm sure
<START> technically this movie would have had it all decent actors a nice landscape no obvious sights of a lack of budget a celebrity like richard attenborough the plot summary also sounded promising suggesting a satire on silly bureaucracy and common people it br br however it never delivers the plot is simply too illogical throughout the whole movie not one person does a single sensible thing mad politicians ridiculous soldiers brain dead villagers all just hustle from one incredible situation to the next what they all do never makes sense in a context beyond the current scene br br of course this kind of movie has to be absurd and exaggerated however it's also supposed to have at least one instance to point out the madness behind splitting a city in the middle actually there are at least two attempts which unfortunately fail the main character who doesn't seem to have a clue about what's happening to him and the writer who occasionally cracks jokes from the off that might be considered funny by an audience consisting solely of 12 year olds br br what i found most impressing is that the movie tries to be funny all the time but didn't made me laugh once i've seen several bad funny movies but until yet every single one of them featured at least 2 or 3 good laughs so in this sense is really remarkable br br if you want to see a great movie with a comparable plot check out brazil don't waste your time on
<START> the texas revolution of to 1836 including the periods preceding and immediately following is depicted in this mediocre 3 hour made for television film whose only redeeming value is bringing light and paying homage to stephen f austin the so called father of texas whose life story had long been overshadowed by that of the legendary sam houston the rest of the film is simply the usual santa anna is a tyrant storyline and with a weak attempt to show the mexican perspective with a fictional hispanic character displaying stereotypical latin machismo combined with short low budget battle scenes such as the and san jacinto this film is recommended only for real history buffs who who do not come from mexico to its credit the mexican uniforms look accurate and the romantic subplot another love triangle doesn't take up too much screen time overall this movie depicts the violent secession movement by texas' anglo saxon racial minority to be a positive and just revolution against mexican tyranny as personified by the general antonio lopez de santa anna the so called napoleon of the west
<START> we screened this movie in a club as an example of how classic literature can become twisted into some of the most awful movies of all time just the fact that the back of the box proudly proclaimed the plot to be set in the techno futile future should have been enough of a hint i think that word describes the movie itself because no matter how much technology they tried to use to save this movie the effort was completely futile not to mention that our club advisor told us that it allegedly couldn't get a distributor for two years br br this cinematic failure is littered with cheesy cliche dialogue that's worse than angsty teen poetry beowulf's character changes halfway through in a way that is in no way credible and whenever he's in an action scene he's constantly flipping like a hyper gymnast there is even as they say a token black guy whose attempts at humor are completely out of place and of course the daughter of the leader of the outpost grendel is terrorizing is a total vixen a vixen whose breasts are exposed throughout the entire movie a vixen who wants to fight the creature yet she never puts on armor and her weapon of choice is a little carving knife and despite their dire situation she still dresses up for dinner in a dress with a see through skirt that exposes her short shorts underwear there are a couple scenes that could pass as soft core pornography and in the second scene they even reuse footage from the first i thought the portrayal of grendel was bad enough but then came the end of the film which featured a display of cgi that might be decent for the 80s but is totally ridiculous for a late 90s venture i could go on but you all should watch this film for the fully laughable effect yourselves br br the other club members and i did manage to have fun watching this by taking a cue from mst 3k and mocking it the whole way through i'm still reeling from an extra's weapon a perpetually spinning pizza cutter on a pole
<START> jeff film is filled with heart and laughter as in curb your enthusiasm his screen persona is hilarious but in addition we get to see both warmth and a sense of emotional vulnerability that makes the story universal while the film chronicles his character's dreams of love performing success and weight loss it will appeal to anyone who dreams of a better life the supporting cast brings the frustrations and joys of his life to the screen in funny and heartbreaking ways the simple joys of food friendship and trying once again once life has disappointed us are all themes the use of music is creative and adds to the many pleasures of this film any fan of jeff tv appearances must see it
