<START> one of the worst movies i have ever seen excruciatingly slow moving boring and stupid lots of juvenile bathroom humor drawn out into painful tedium i like jeff daniels but he should stick to acting and forget writing i am amazed this is rated as high as it is i call it a turkey
<START> john carpenter's brilliantly suspenseful flick is a great fusion of sci fi and horror adopting the classic body swap theme and taking it to the extreme a remake of the howard hawks produced 1951 original carpenter keeps the cold war themes of paranoia and trust as a backdrop of alien takeover and impending doom amidst madness and the isolation of the antarctic setting carpenter's direction as always is excellent as his camera glides through the lonely world of the characters whose environment is about to be corrupted by the primordial fear of body takeover but here and much like the work of david cronenberg carpenter doesn't hold back on the incident as through some fantastic special effects we are witness to some insane moments of surreal gore however he never loses touch with the human side of the story as in the face of everything shocking happening in front of us we are left with perceived notions of trust and suspicion br br 9 10
<START> webs starts in present day' as four electricians dean richard grieco ray richard sheldon jeffrey douglas junior jason jones are about to disconnect the electric to an unused building scheduled for demolition as they search for the relevant cables stuff they come across a set of doors that according to the buildings blue prints shouldn't be there being nosey all that they force the doors open to have a look find a room full of computers scientific machinery as they mess around with some buttons a portal to a parallel universe opens dean junior accidentally 'fall' in with ray sheldon following soon after in search of their friends unfortunately they've all ended up in an exact parallel earth that has been taken over by a mutant spider thing that either eats people or turns them into mutant soldiers with which she uses to protect herself do whatever she wants them to really in a desperate bid for survival they team up with a few of the last remaining humans including the original inventor of the portal dr richard colin fox who says that with the help of our electrician boys he might yeah might be able to build another portal to take them back home br br edited directed by david wu i thought webs was pretty crap it's as simple straight forward as that really the script by case robinson young is preposterous to say the least has plot holes in it you could drive a tank through for instance is this film really trying to suggest that a few mutant spider things no bigger than a couple of people in size took over an entire world how did they do this if this parallel earth was the same as ours where the hell was the army the police all of our weapons a few fragile looking spider things against literally billions of humans the whole flawed stupid downright naff concept constantly bugged me throughout the entire film lets not forget that there is a inter dimensional portal to a parallel earth in the basement of most buildings that have sat there undisturbed for decades remain in perfect working order right then there's the nuclear reactor the size of a briefcase the fact one electrician can make it work perfectly purely by accident as he randomly presses a few buttons in a room that probably had spread over dozens of pieces of equipment what about the wonderfully thoughtful guy who sets an explosive bobby trap in his base without telling anyone what if one of his mates had set it off found themselves blown to pieces by their mates homemade bomb you wouldn't be best pleased would you what about food do they grow their own in little vegetable patches i could go on on all day long about how flawed ill conceived poorly written webs is but i can't be bothered the character's are clichÃ©d annoying as is the film as a whole which obviously doesn't help the only half decent thing i can say about webs is that it's short it moves along at a fair pace but when all said done it's still crap br br director wu has to take a large of the blame here for a start the film looks cheap the editing that he is credited with is terrible there's lots of annoying inappropriate slow motion shots that come from nowhere the action scenes are almost identical become incredibly boring very quickly he uses that highly annoying quick cut technique along with a bit of the old jerky camera movement now i don't know about anyone else but i hate this editing style as it just looks a complete incoherent mess in fact i don't know a single person who does like this sort of thing i'm puzzled as to why filmmakers think people do forget about any gore just a few shotgun wounds to the spider zombie soldier guys they don't have red blood anyway so it doesn't relate to reality in my mind br br webs was made for tv the american sci fi channel i think it looks every bit as cheap low budget rushed as you would expect it's all so bland forgettable flat dull the special effects are far from special the spider thing lacks imagination when finally revealed the acting was ok considering everything else was so poor i still can't believe the sweater grieco was wearing in this br br webs is crap i can't really say anything good about it other than i've sat through worse films that's the sole reason i'm not giving it 1 star a quick glance at the imdb user ratings for webs confirms what i already knew in that it has more '1' votes than any other there is very good reason why
<START> this isn't a bad tv movie is short for which means penal such were formed due to the increasing demand for soldiers as the soviet union was taking heavy casualties all through out the war these consisted of convicts and dishonored soldiers who were given the chance to clear their names by proving themselves in combat they were looked down upon as scum and were expended easily during combat without much regret or much honor on the part of military they were often sent on suicide missions and suffered extreme casualties the ones who refused to fight were executed on sight needless to say their lives sucked br br there were some very nice performances by the cast especially by who played aleksandr who played and roman who played major however the series isn't really that addictive in part because it's too long it could've a lot shorter and as effective br br although it's about war has very mild violence and pretty much no gore it relies solely on the actors to make it work and after all it's a tv series so the producers didn't want to scare off the viewers and the sponsors br br explores the cruelty of the soviet regime and why so many men chose to fight the nazis instead of joining them personally i'd rather be a fascist then a communist given the circumstances presented in the film one character explains that the soviets stripped his farm clean and his family died of starvation out of anger he burned it down which got him arrested for destroying property and he ended up in the penal battalion as a criminal reminisced on how his mother killed her youngest son to feed the rest of the family both men explained that they fought for their motherland rather than the for the soviets br br the penal battalion had one marine naval infantry who raped a girl killing his comrade in the threatened his other comrade to keep his mouth shut about both ordeals and then feigned injury when it came to fighting on top of all that the girl committed suicide due to shame i imagine if enough marines watched this movie they'd pick up banners and riot on the streets calling for a boycott or an official apology from the producers br br to say the least i'd recommend it to anyone with the slightest interest in the former soviet union or world war ii i don't think i wasted 500 minutes of my life
<START> for weeks i had been looking forward to seeing this movie only to find myself hugely disappointed after wards in my opinion the only good thing 'river queen' had going for it was the amazing scenery used as backgrounds the story line was all over the place samantha's character sarah was very difficult to understand and what on earth were all the many close ups of her face for it brought absolutely nothing to the story if there was one at all a better actor for the part of boy could also have been selected to me it sounded like he read his lines straight of the script while shooting his scenes overall a real shame as it could have been such a good movie
<START> 2001 a space odyssey br br is it a sermon an account of the history of mankind an exploration of man's futile attempts to advance technology only to have technology destroy him is it about the fragile balance of time and space a lesson in evolution or is it just a spectacular effects show a film kubrick made only to show us the limitless possibilities of the motion picture and present to us the truth that images are exceedingly more powerful than words br br 2001 a space odyssey is all of these things one of the most films ever created it's almost more fun to dissect and discuss the ambiguous plot design and events of the film than it is to actually watch but it's left open to discussion intentionally if kubrick had explained the meaning to his wondrous 1968 classic ranked 22 on afi's list of the greatest 100 films ever made my personal 21st favorite and nominated for 4 academy awards director original screenplay art direction and visual effects which it won for it would have lost half its fascination all of its complexity and a good portion of its cinematic worth we would only be left with the technical ingenuity which in itself is worth praising br br because every shot is worth taking the time to look and there is plenty of time 2001 is very elegiac and also coolly distant detached the emotional remoteness and slow pace pay perfect tribute however to the unique visual experience 2001 begins with mankind's ape ancestors who upgrade from scavengers of the planet to hunters and after discovering a giant monolith in the midst of their desert home then in one of motion picture history's most inspired jump cut edits as a bone is tossed into the air and becomes a satellite jumping forward a couple thousand years into space where astronauts have discovered a similar object on the moon and next the film following a crew of space mission as they follow the signal through space accompanied by their untrustworthy computer hal who attempts to sabotage the shuttle and kill the crew before finally the lone survivor is launched through space and time in a flurry of drug induced colors that probably gave hippies an epileptic shock back in the day to grow old die and be reborn a star child whew br br this pacing and emotional is also in sharp contrast with the film's most ironic scene the destruction of hal as the crew's final explorer shuts the machine down bathed in the holy aura of red light kubrick has always used as a repeat motif hal singing a lovely tune it is a strangely emotional experience and it's all genius br br other notable aspects of kubrick's masterpiece is the memorable voice of hal a calm somehow sinister douglas rain the minimal use of dialogue kubrick was wisely trusting of his images to propel the film giving only banal unhelpful lines to his actors the most famous being open the pod bay doors hal satellites dancing around in orbit to unorthodox music and that first awe inspiring shot of earth slowly revealing the glare of the sun in front of it played to the sound of blasting triumphant horns br br 2001 shall always remain a mystery and will forever be a testament to the cinema's strongest point visuals are more powerful than writing it's all from one of film history's most legendary and best directors whose unique vision was always his own 10 10 br br open the pod bay doors hal 2001 a space odyssey
<START> here we go another pop star breaking in to the grand tv land and from my observations from her pop careers directors saying yeah your great gwen you could be a real star maybe some day you'll be in the a list movies they would do anything to expand the show there just not a pretty face but have an acting ability as well almost overnight gwen has some how found the ability to act by watching actors like james dean or clint eastward please give the real people in the world that have to sit behind that box and have to suffer pop stars effort's in trying to act please gwen stick to your pretty pop videos with your jap posse and don't insult the british with your efforts as an actress anyway i'm going back to my working class job and think to myself god i could do that but yeah remember i'll be working till i'm 65 if i live that long and yeah you put your feet up girl with your royalties every three months pah marry into money right xxx
<START> probably the worst creature feature ever boa vs python was a million times better then this that wasn't great either bad acting bad effects guess what the dvd is one of those one with 3 hours of previews before the main menu probably the least scary movie ever no blood or violence people are stupid and keep using pistols when they have no affect on these animals the only cool part was the radioactive leeches that was pretty cool i name of the island is just a rip off of jurassic park boring tiring not worth even looking at but i suppose the characters stupidity is pretty funny so it would make a good comedy film but definitely not a thriller
<START> i watched the first show of each series just to see and what a waste of time the girl from emmerdale she was fat so yeah she should be in fat friend but no one every lost weigh br br like itv made a big mistake with this br br bad girls is better br br i feel that the whole show was just about large people trying to loose weight but never did then they tried to have love storyline oh my god what a a waste of time and also air time this show has not been repeated on 3 4 yeah thats how good it is br br i would say do not by th box sets just a waste of money br br beware
<START> rush in rio is simply an amazing dvd this concert is one of the peak moments of the history of rush and they deliver their music brilliantly and with more power than ever br br i was lucky enough to actually be in this concert and not only that i was in the very first row grabbing the gate that separated the audience from the stage it's the first and only time i've seen a rush concert live and it was a dream come true for me i have no words to accurately describe this experience but i can tell you it is one of the highlights of my life br br some people complain about the sound of this dvd saying it is not very clear and polished but the sound you listen is real true to how it was in the concert it is raw and powerful and so authentic that every time i watch it i go back and re live that beautiful moment many artists record live shows and then they make a lot of tweaking so the final product is far from what the actual concert really was sure you can achieve a very sophisticated and polished sound this way but you don't get the real thing this is not the case with rush in rio this is the real deal i admit that i enjoy those fancy sounding concert dvd's i love music and the sound is a very important aspect but it's refreshing to listen to a concert that is so honest you listen to rush just the way they sound in a live performance no tricks no tweaks this is a real live concert dvd br br i highly recommend rush in rio the set list is fantastic and the performances by geddy alex and neil are mind blowing not to mention the crowd you can see how much they love rush and sing along to every tune even which is an instrumental i actually appear singing twice in tom sawyer i sing always hopeful yet discontent and in i sing only reflect it's just a few seconds but i simply couldn't believe my eyes when i saw myself in a rush dvd awesome i hope you enjoy this magnificent concert from the greatest band on earth
<START> truly a great leap forward in the perfection of painful cinema br br everything about this film is bad acting if it can be called that lighting sound script if there was one editing direction camera work it is all atrocious there is not a single element that is done well if i thought that this was intentional then i might give the film some credit but i can not believe people would set out to make such a film br br this film is worth buying and screening to your worst enemies
<START> this movies made me suffer and i loved it loved it it haunted me for days i think erika is the kind of character you simultaneously loathe and lament the most terrifying sex scene ever caught on film this is the best of haneke's work so far he is the only living director to redefine pace since kubrick the violence in this film is gorgeous in a word the film is about self hatred in a sentence the film is about trying to find love in order to stop hating yourself and finding that that is a hopeless hope
<START> i remember when i first heard about jack frost i was in video at miranda with my family on a monthly video hiring tradition it was at this time that i worked up the courage to venture over towards the horror section of the store browsing the various titles i finally came across jack frost the cover was enough to convince me that the film was beyond my viewing pleasures years later the film disappeared only to be replaced with the inevitable yet unnecessary sequel i once again ventured to the horror section and picked up the case only to come to one conclusion the film would be but not intentionally br br jack frost 2 revenge of the killer mutant snowman quite a title follows off where it's predecessor left it sheriff sam is seeking counseling after his ordeals and jack is now in the form of anti freeze to escape his past sam and his wife head to an island hotel where he is in the company of a wide variety of slasher film stereotypes including busty female models thick headed sports jocks and caribbean staff however jack is released from his liquid grave and is back to his icy methods he heads over to the island and proceeds to kill anyone that would prove to have an awesome death only sam can stop him br br let me just say that this is a straight to video film so it's bound to be bad but this is terrible even in the eyes of other over the top films the camera work is poor using a camera that would make a soap opera look majestic half the actors look like they've come out of a porn shoot and the other half look like they've come out of a retirement home but in actual fact they've actually come out of an asylum there is an extensive use of special effects used in the film which tends to alternate between bland puppetry and cgi that can be bettered by an infant and the death scenes are mostly off screen showing us little of what has happened to the hapless yet deserving victims but the film is most memorable for it's killer one liners such as there's something that needs a little christmas stuffing and i know pronounce you officially f ing dead ultimately the whole purpose behind a film like this is to make a popcorn flick for those friday nights of boredom and even it fails at that to make a sequel to a film that was a poor slasher with a concept that a child would find unbelievable must've taken some nerves of or a total frontal lobotomy to director michael thanks for wasting my time to everyone elseÂ avoid like arsenic
<START> in sri lanka a country divided by religion and language the civil war between the pro government and the liberation tigers of tamil a organization has claimed an estimated 68 000 lives since 1983 human rights groups have said that as a result of the war more than one million people have been displaced homeless or living in camps the impact on children and families caught in the conflict is sensitively dramatized by acclaimed tamil director mani in his 2002 film a peck on the cheek winner of several awards at the national film awards in india while the civil war is merely a backdrop for the story of a young girl's voyage of discovery the human cost of war is made quite clear and gives the fighting a universal context pointing the finger at global arms traffickers as the source of wrongdoing br br beautifully photographed in southern india by cinematographer ravi k in a setting mirroring the terrain of sri lanka the film tells a moving story about an adopted 9 year old girl who sets out to find her real mother in the middle of the fighting in sri lanka played with deep feeling and expressiveness by p s in a memorable performance is brought up by a loving middle class family with two younger brothers after her natural parents nandita das and j d were forced to flee when the fighting broke out leaving her in a red cross camp in a loving flashback we see adoptive parents father a prominent tamil writer and mother indra a tv personality marry to facilitate their adoption of the darker skinned little girl br br young has no idea that she is adopted until it is sprung upon her abruptly on her ninth birthday according to the parents' prior agreement while she is playing tells her almost in a matter of fact tone that you are not our daughter and the response is predictable distraught she questions who her father was what her mother's name was why she gave her up and so forth but few answers are forthcoming runs away several times until her parents agree to go to sri lanka to help her find her true mother now a fighter for the tamil the family's immersion in the reality of the civil war leads to some traumatic moments and difficult decisions handled mostly with skill by though a sequence where the family was caught in a crossfire felt amateurish br br a peck on the cheek is of course a bollywood style film and that means tons of music and melodrama the melodrama did not get in the way because of the strong performances by the lead actors however i found the musical dramatizations of songs by a r rahman counter to the mood of the film with their slick high production techniques and fast paced music video style editing yet the compelling nature of the story and the honesty in which it is told transcend the film's limitations tamil cinema has been criticized by many even within the country as being too clichÃ©d and commercial yet a peck on the cheek is both a film of entertainment and one that tackles serious issues that it successfully the line between art and commerce is not a rejection but a tribute
<START> i loved the movie i loved timothy dalton and joanne whaley the movie had many different locations in it i really liked when ann hampton realized she could not make rhett love her and when scarlett and ann where together and ann apologizes for taking rhett and scarlett just told her not to worry she would get him back it had a great story it told you just can not compare it to gwtw it just has so many great scenes i love both scarlett and gwtw of course do not forget to have a hankie handy
