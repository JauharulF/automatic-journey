<START> this is a brilliant series along the same lines of simpsons following a family as they go through life and problems etc slightly less realistic than simpsons talking baby and dog anyone family guy goes where simpsons or futurama dares not reaching past into the sicker jokes and more racy gags and believe me it works almost all the gags hit the mark and they'll have you in stitches especially the random frequent flashbacks when my brother first showed me this i wasn't hooked but after a few episodes i was hooked you will be 2 10 10 for a truly brilliant show congrats to seth for bringing this show to life
<START> i saw this at the festival friday amid an unsettled crowd of people not helped by a poor decision by the of the event who chose a totally inappropriate short film to precede the movie and it really threw the audience when modern love came up after a light whimsical short name i forget br br people it was really silly to mix this short with modern love which is a serious drama movie a film film br br so the audience gets the teaser which is a comedy and then modern love hmmmm modern love despite my reservations strange ending a little too tangential needed a short film that was commensurate with it's oddball strangeness so my advice to the programmers for next year is to take more care planning the show br br the folks watching modern love really just didn't know what had hit them they were led up the path and this is not their fault br br modern love has some superb performances which play well against the tangential meanderings of the film a film that its maker seems to have out loud' rather than executed in the normal way a film is scripted and shot br br too bad the audience was wrong session placement wrong short film wrong approach by the well intentioned programmers who despite good efforts need to see a lot more films and travel to some other festivals
<START> i did something a little daring tonight when i watched this movie i attempted to wean myself from silent movie scores sure when this film originally was distributed a piano score was probably played with it oftentimes the director would choose the score himself charlie chaplin often composed the scores of his later silent films but most of the music you hear on vhs tapes over silent films is in no way the same music that was supposed to be played when the film was first released and then again there were plenty of silent films that were played without a score i do not know the history of potemkin's score so i decided to watch it for the medium this piece of art was produced within film br br soon after i turned the music off or should i say by the musical interpretation of the emotions on screen i became utterly attached to the film visually it is easily one of the most stunning of all films eisenstein was a master of composition the editing possibly the cinematic technique eisenstein is most famous for montage is extraordinary the mood of this film is anger and it stirred my passions violently br br it takes a lot of effort to enjoy a silent film especially a drama but films like battleship potemkin prove that this effort is entirely worth it come on you owe it to yourself to watch this film your education is incomplete without it
<START> this is a delightful film elizabeth taylor does a wonderful job as does mickey rooney the film just makes you feel happy it's inspirational and even though some parts are a bit overly sentimental that is easily forgiven i could watch this movie again and again the race at the end is exciting every time i see it highly recommend this film
<START> i would give this movie a good strong 7 while it isn't the greatest movie or even one the best movies of it's kind the killing fields is better it does at least attempt to tell a necessary story br br i think the method of introducing laura into burma was a bit contrived first of all burma isn't exactly the easiest country to visit especially in the late 80's secondly if you did make it burma your passport would not get lost a sane person would make darn sure they knew where their passport was at all times with that in mind i'm sure the screenwriter knew that was weak but needed something patricia arquette's performance was understated and i just didn't buy that she was a doctor however at least she didn't overact the role which often happens in movies like this u ko was good but also understated the end is hard to follow since most of the dialogue is in burmese with people translating for laura it would have been difficult for laura and is difficult for the viewer as well another plus is the strong se asian scenery in the film which was enjoyable to see
<START> james franco is totally cool in this movie not just handsome and charismatic but genuinely open and vulnerable in a sincere kind of way at the tristan screening some folks were on his back for being pouty and sullen and doing the whole james dean thing but i don't think this true blind spot is proof positive of his tremendous talent in this film he carries himself with a different sort of weight entirely it's a unique performance bittersweet and really moving the lines from his journal cut you like a knife you sense a sharp intelligence of observation behind his words the tone is everything he carries it through the action and suspense as well as the grim bits of gallows humor i like the other two actors a great deal too the blonde girl is totally gorgeous and the man is hysterical in his twisted tough guy stoicism some of the thugs seemed a little sketchy but this is a mini point really the film is totally solid and franco is way cool all around
<START> the plot line is an expose of the under belly of american politics while the theme seems common what makes the movie is the unconventional way the story is told br br the characters are played with conviction you feel the innocence of the lead and his innocence lost the politician is the prince of double talk a real snake br br the camera work is impressive it affirms the nuances of the acting and dialogue ditto for the music br br the story uses a parable style with where the message is filled with double entendres a very canny strategy by the writer director the tension in the storyline is carried through to the last scenes br br the movie was like a good mystery book something was afoot you knew it was bad you didn't know exactly what it could be you had your suspicions and when the evil was revealed you let out your breath you hadn't noticed you were holding in saddened shaking your head br br a story well written and well told 3 cheers to a young writer director
<START> the most hardcore bad film buff will be surprised by the overall ineptness of this grade z film mary woronov a clever actress best known for her roles as mary bland in eating raoul and miss togar in rock 'n' roll high school is by far the best thing about this tripe this film is almost too bad even for mst3k honestly
<START> it is sad to have to say that a film is truly awful and one tries to find ways around saying this however this is a dreadful film gene hackman wastes time and one suspects many dollars on re playing his most famous and oft recreated role as gene hackman otherwise television actors are given the chance to become film stars and successfully resist the temptation patrick swayze has a minor part and went on to greater things for which he must be eternally thankful br br i watched this film as a result of someone else's review and i felt that another point of view was merited you may not agree with my review but now at least you have been warned
<START> when i saw this movie at age 6 it was in the childrens' section at video because it was animation we watched it and it was a whole different ball game a very violent story and graphic deaths are very entertaining and compelling but not for children avoid for family viewing my mom nearly had a heart attack and ripped the video apart
<START> the film itself is only a compilation of scenes which have no inherent meaning to someone living outside of russia i won't deny that some of the images and techniques were quite revolutionary at the time filmed 1928 but the problem with the film is that it has no interest to the intellectual or common man we are merely watching an arranged form of pictures ranging from a one arm man beating a horse to a toothless soldier in the war everything in between is awkward haphazard and quite unnecessary it would have been possible to invent a forum which kept the viewer interested but this would not be it although the method of the director is quite brilliant br br in all one should view this if they are an art student on hallucinogenic drugs or a student of pre cinema
<START> this film is remarkable in how unremarkable it is this is the true story of one woman and one man and their quest for happiness amid the dull rote life of a housewife and man of the house it could be any couple any family in any town but that's what makes the story so moving it touches each of us in some way and reminds us of someone we know and love or of ourselves i laughed i cried i couldn't stop thinking about it and what more could you ask for from a film really especially a documentary this is an excellent film and one that i highly recommended to anyone who enjoys documentaries stories about families like yours stories about love life parenting loss expectations soul searching yearning wandering through life and finding your way or not
<START> all monster congregation in the final film in universal's renowned cycle of classic horror stories count dracula an intense dapper john carradine calling himself baron comes to dr onslow stevens asking to be cured of his affliction naturally this is just a ruse then coincidentally larry talbot lon chaney a k a the wolf man shows up and of course he really wants to be cured br br as others have noted the monsters don't get equal screen time the frankenstein monster glenn strange gets thrown in at the end just for the purpose of including all of the universal monsters stock footage and library music are re used here as well the film spends maybe a little too much time with the dracula part of the story although carradine gives an impressive non hammy performance in the role of the count the film is mainly a showcase for stevens who goes through a tragic character arc of his own and does an excellent job the women are gorgeous and i have to say that i loved jane adams as the luminous nurse who happens to be hunchbacked br br of course it wouldn't be complete without the inclusion of angry villagers br br competently professionally made chiller is just for my tastes not really scary at all but entertaining regardless it's a respectable series entry overall br br 7 10
<START> a gritty australian film with all the elements for success two hands represents the ability of australian film makers and actors to produce top quality popular material the film has a fresh angle and uniquely incorporates drama suspense and comedy br br i found this film thoroughly enjoyable on so many different levels but can also appreciate that it might not be everyone's of the film carries a distinct aussie humour as it portrays the seedy underworld of sydney and explores the lives of a young man ledger and young woman byrne swept up in the local crime scene br br two hands deals with the theme of good and evil both on an interpersonal and personal level and looks at the issue of consequences for actions br br the camera work is snazzy and the dialogue humorous with bryan brown who plays and heath ledger as jimmy battling it out on screen in the most bizarre situations this aussie film is certainly not short of acting talent br br this subtle action comedy has become somewhat of a cult favourite and one of mine also
<START> back in the day is an interesting but flawed effort ja rule stars as reggie cooper a honest but sad man trying to cope with the death of his father he meets his old friend j bone ving rhames who tries to force reggie into a life of crime reggie also falls in love with ali who is the preacher's daughter now he has to choose love or crime br br ja rule does a competent job as reggie at least he's trying to act ving rhames is perfect as j bone he brings a lot of energy and menace into the role joe morton as the preacher is his usual excellent self but he doesn't do much the same problem for giancarlo esposito as reggie's dad he needed more screen time i don't want to say this but pam grier is pretty awful as mrs cooper she overacts every scene and brings the movie down tia carrere and frank langella are in it but don't do anything substantial for the plot br br in the end you should see it for the skilled performances of ving rhames and joe morton and the grittiness of the writing and directing
