<START> spoilers i am a fan of 60's 70's french cinema but not necessarily of the more modern so to be honest i watched this because of bellucci she is very young here extremely beautiful and on top of this supposedly this movie is where they met with cassel so it gives it some extra importance br br the movie begins with a very nice style reminiscent of depalma then suddenly we are thrown to flashback and the back and forth goes on which gets tiring i don't mind one flash back but do it and get it over with man anyway the movie is still interesting to me until a point when the first and definite hole in the plot that allows for the rest of the story never lets me enjoy the rest i can allow for little holes here and there but not to base an entire plot on hot air this is the story of a man who is literally searching for an old flame this is the main plot i will go along when the story at some point will convince me that there are really mysterious things going on but in this story there's nothing really mysterious bellucci cassel are a couple then bellucci urgently has to leave for some job in italy not the farthest place on earth from paris and she leaves him a message which for reasons later explained he doesn't get ok so what don't these people have phones supposedly she was away for not a century exactly and wouldn't she call her boyfriend in paris to see how he's doing of course not instead even after she gets back she forgets all about him and thats fine but later in the movie she tells her friend that it was her greatest love and was ready to commit for the first time in her life yet she failed to give him a call for and then never tried to get back with him and what about cassel's character he was supposedly unable to locate her in italy really hard to find someone in italy its probably like siberia especially an actress who is probably listed even in the arts papers and after when she would be back really hard to find her and ask for an explanation one thinks she wanted to avoid him but no we find out they simply couldn't meet so hard to meet in paris ok i don't need to go further because this is the incident where the entire movie is based what is even worse bellucci is not really the star of this movie but this other girl is
<START> i won't say the show is all bad because there are some funny parts like spencer and a few random incidents but other than that let's face it it's just another dry sitcom that kids are buying into br br miranda cosgrove was cute and funny as megan on drake and josh honestly she is mediocre in and is just not as funny as she tries to be the actress who plays sam seems to be half asleep most of the time and her antics are so clichÃ©d that i would think of them they're not funny just annoying and freddie is okay but not that interesting br br of course the situations are unrealistic but it's not all bad some are bothersome though here are a few br br 1 the girls are 14 and have a web show that gives away too much personal information with a weekly audience of 27 000 wtf with little to no advertising and they can still go on about their lives not being attacked by crazy people br br 2 their web show gets too much praise 100 000 yearly to advertise sneakers a free trip to japan plain white ts performance and so on honestly anyone over the age of 6 would not find their comedy entertaining br br 3 how is it that they are so average yet they own a three story loft spencer does hardly anything and can still afford many basic luxuries and they have all the equipment for a web show 4 all of the adults are idiots all of them br br 5 no 5 foot high girl no matter how obnoxious and tenacious can take down trained cops unless she's muscular sam is skinny and petite br br 6 no one can fall down 9 stories in an elevator and live br br 7 kids can handle finding out about criminals better than cops br br the show is stupid really it seems harmless but making kids think that they can be obnoxious to their elders live alone in seattle when they're only 14 with an irresponsible moron and give out personal information is just wrong br br i'm disappointed to say that my cousin who is 3 enjoys the show what happened to the cartoons when i was her age
<START> where to start i think only three other films have led me to post a review on imdb and all of those were positive as for this br br mind blowingly hideously tragically embarrassingly catastrophically stupidly irritatingly completely and utterly beyond awful br br i am stunned this got made never mind given a theatrical release i think i am literally in shock br br i'm no snob i didn't expect beautiful film making or intense character depth but this is truly beyond a joke we simply must demand more from the films we see br br avoid like the black death
<START> one of quite a few cartoon scooby doo films scooby doo and the loch ness monster turns out to be entertaining exciting interesting funny and also does a surprisingly good interpretation of the highlands of scotland one annoying aspect of the film is the voices of many of the characters american people trying to sound scottish in this film are unfortunately not succeeding all that well although some people do better scottish accents than others br br daphne has come to the highlands to see her cousin shannon and the highland games at blake castle gravely shannon tells the gang that she believes to have seen the loch ness monster when yet more chaos arises the mystery inc gang have another mystery on their hands br br good for scooby doo fans and for people who want to find out more about scotland enjoy scooby doo and the loch ness monster
<START> the only reason to see this film is sung hi lee the stunning model actress from korea who plays miki give me a break in this otherwise crappy movie br br she is given a fairly substantial part in this film and seems to handle it well though none of the parts is really interesting or well written even for a national lampoon's movie it's really stupid stupid humor is one thing but just stupid is another i may have laughed once and that was probably just me being polite br br warning watching this movie may be bad for your health on two counts 1 it like totally sucks 2 sung hi lee is so freaking gorgeous she just might blow your brains out of the back of your head upon first sight br br so don't say i didn't warn you
<START> pretty bad prc cheapie which i rarely bother to watch over again and it's no wonder it's slow and creaky and dull as a butter knife mad doctor george zucco is at it again turning a dimwitted in overalls glenn strange into a wolf man unfortunately the makeup is virtually non existent consisting only of a beard and dimestore fangs for the most part if it were not for zucco and presence along with the cute anne this would be completely unwatchable strange who would go on to play frankenstein's monster for in two years does a lenny impression from of mice and men it seems br br 1 2 of four
<START> jeff powers lou diamond phillips young guns 1 2 a cop with a history of roughing up criminals is recruited into an elite clandestine lapd division this doesn't sit well with jeff's newspaper reporter girlfriend kelly chelsea field who's looking for a story on the squad soon enough jeff's conscience gets the better of him which puts him at odds with dan vaughn scott glenn the hunt for red october the leader of the unit br br this is a fairly routine dare i say mundane cop action drama that holds no surprises thanks to a cookie cutter plot that's content to go strictly from point a to point b the acting is all right for what the actors were given to work with however that's no real reason to watch the film kinda sad seeing as the six previous mark l lester directed films right before this one from class of 1984 to showdown in little tokyo were all highly entertaining vehicles br br eye candy chelsea field gets briefly topless br br my grade d
<START> this derivative erotic thriller remains watchable most of the way mainly because a viewer is casually curious about how it will turn out and because the director peter hall manages to stage a pretty hot and quite bold sex scene but the finale though unexpected is preposterous and the whole plotting complete with childhood traumas and multiple personality disorders reveals itself to be unbearably cliched especially as far as motivation is concerned 1 2
<START> this was on tv last night i painfully forced my way through it and barely made it through first of all except for leroy hilary and possibly coco none of the other students we are supposed to care about have any discernible talent it's like had no standards just sign on the dotted line and you're in br br the story lines were grating and obvious doris was just impossibly awful the gay guy was such a thrown away clichÃ© funny how that school had only one gay guy right i liked the leroy character but calling your teacher an obscenity and then vandalizing the school should have sent leroy packing lisa looks like she'd rather be anywhere else and since she wasn't any talent i wonder why they kept her br br i would have rated this one star awful but the music wasn't that bad and i did like the premise it just would have worked much better if the students had been attractive and actually had some talent
<START> the comparisons between the 1995 version and this are inevitable sadly this version falls far short br br the casting is uninspired and the acting wooden one gets the impression the director did not read the book so did not understand the characters br br sir walter elliot is portrayed as pompous but his inadvertent silliness which redgrave brilliantly captured in the 1995 version is nowhere to be found br br the musgrove sisters are so unlikable one doesn't understand why wentworth or anybody else would give them a second glance br br the relationship between wentworth and anne is devoid of feeling br br in the 1995 version hinds and root managed to convey the depth of emotion the two of them felt towards each other with their body language and facial expressions in this one it is hard to understand anne spent years mired in regret unless one has read the book br br this production does not capture the emotional complexity of the main characters' relationship br br in the scene where wentworth walks in on anne and mary having breakfast it seems to the viewer as mary thinks they are only slight acquaintances br br in the 1995 version when wentworth walks in the first time he sees her in years the tension is thick resentment is coming off wentworth in waves while anne is almost overcome br br in this version while wentworth is courting it is as if he is truly invested the undercurrents are missing in the 1995 version the viewer sees wentworth's anger at anne he is flaunting his courtship in front of anne as if to say see what you gave up i don't need or want you anymore br br yet he still cares if she suffers as the scene where he asks his sister and the admiral to take anne back to house illustrates in the 1995 version the viewer feels anne's shock that he would care if she was tired we also feel wentworth's discomfort that he does still care in this version he just walks on with as if nothing happened br br the pivotal scene where anne is conversing with about who loves longest man or woman is totally botched the actors are just reciting lines with no emotional investment br br when anne reads the letter from wentworth it is as if she is reading a grocery list br br contrast this to the 1995 version where the viewer feels anne's joy at her second chance we are there with her as she reads the letter the director had both actors reading the letter and you hear both their voices wentworth is full of frustration passion and hope while anne's is at first incredulous then evolves in to joy br br this production has more scenes after the revelation probably because it was needed to explain to the viewer what just happened the 1995 version didn't need to explain we knew and rejoiced for the characters the only thing this production has in it's favor is it kept the mrs smith sub plot intact while the 1995 version did not br br the 1995 version however did include part of austen's original ending the scene where wentworth is commissioned by the admiral to find out if anne and mr elliot will want to move back to her house which he mrs croft are renting after they marry br br this is a production to avoid at all costs
<START> this movie is george c scott at his very best bernard hughes at his very best and diana rigg at her most pithy and of course paddy writing at masterpiece warp there are also very brief snippets of future biggies like susan sarandon stockard channing etc who have one scene lines that you don't necessarily spot until your fifth or sixth time watching nancy marchand as a young to middle age nurse supervisor is also superb as well as practically every face in hollywood of 1970 br br it is one of the few movies that gets better the more times you see it watch for the surprise scene ala wait until dark this is one of the few movies i have ever bought on dvd it is that superb
<START> what you need in the run up to 'what you need' every episode since 'the had been a winner to some extent this episode is the first major failure since the serling script is again based on someone else's a short story by lewis as with 'and when the sky was serling altered the content significantly removing a scientist and his machine and inserting an elderly peddler br br 'what you need' works best when it is being sweet the opening half in which the peddler provides customers in a bar with objects they will need in the near future has a gentle charm about it that may have worn thin throughout an entire episode but works well in the time frame it is allotted sadly the main plot which it sets up is full of gaping holes the minute steve performance as a two bit thug becomes the main focus the episode falls apart part is an underwritten stereotype and his flat performance highlights this flaw his exploitation of the old peddler is dull and predictable and the revelation that he will murder the old man is totally unconvincing making the whole slippery shoes scene seem completely false ernest is good as the peddler bringing a magical mysterious but warm edge to the character but he's not good enough to help the floundering script br br to make matters worse the weak script is also full of inconsistencies for instance we learn that the power to provide people with what they need stems from an ability to see into the future so how exactly does this allow him to produce a pen that will magically pick winning horses that seems like it should be a little outside his realms of power also for a man who can see the future the peddler certainly acts surprised to find the thug waiting for him in his flat there are many more holes that can be picked in 'what you need' but it's hardly worth it when the episode is so thin that you can see through it anyway
<START> a party hardy frat boy's sister is brutally murdered by a street gang sending the young man into a sudden psychotic rampage he and his buddies massacre half the city to bring his sister back to life br br savage streets was released a year after this film and was more entertaining linnea quigley who has a costarring role in this film as the sexy and briefly nude girlfriend of one of the guys also starred in savage streets br br this film is subpar though it delivers enough escapist entertainment and gratuitous nudity to please its intended audience me br br mpaa rated r for strong violence nudity language and some sexuality
<START> greetings br br i never thought i would see the day when i would be so disgusted by a movie that it would be a burden to finish it i was always a fan of horror movies and c's included but in this case it's hard to describe how a movie could fail to qualify for any letters in that scale br br the movie is centered on a poorly developed back story a mix of folklore with an after taste and to top it up the performance of the actors is questionable horror b movies usually fall in two categories 1 a gem that was under looked and under funded 2 so bad it's funny laugh or your money back well this movie falls in between i wasn't scare didn't laugh so i guess if you really need to see it you could but i recommend you don't
<START> this show is what happened to the screen after g4 got its hands on it taking it from a useful source of computer related information to a show that had as its high point the shoving of a miniature web server up someone's posterior br br as ratings plummeted they moved away from their original target audience gamers to generic hormone driven young men adding eye candy to the staff and a sex advice segment now even the gamers who applauded the show initially are turning away in disgust i look forward to the show's and the network's overwhelmingly overdue and well deserved demise
