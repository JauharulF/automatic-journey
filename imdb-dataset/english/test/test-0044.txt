<START> i would give this movie high marks for the cinema photography and performances i just read a user comment concerning the performance of the actress who plays a conniving courtesan who the lead character i remember a mini biography of this actress following the movie the last time i saw it apparently she was a holocaust refugee discovered by a french husband and wife in the movie industry who were taken with her extraordinary beauty she died very young and under tragic circumstances gene tierney is also outstanding in this film like other neo biblical films of the 1940's and 50s the egyptian reflects the morals and values of that time but is still great entertainment because the performances are terrific and the story so well told
<START> i am still trying to figure out what the target of this movie was 1 whether to show how stupid disorganized unprofessional and arrogant the police is i surely could add various adjectives here but i think my point on this is clear 2 whether to show how a twisted minded crook that does not know what he wants from himself can create chaos 3 whether to show if a persistent detective will solve a case just by asking the criminal the same stupid question over and over again till the criminal answers 4 or was it just to show that any 90 minutes of filmed material can still be called a movieÂ br br this was one of those movies that in a way did not disappoint me from the first 10 minutes i kind of figured out that this movie will not be nominated for the best movie award and surprisingly enough Â this was consistent throughout the whole time it was stupid enough to be worth the wait to see how stupidly it will continue and end Â and i was not disappointed there either br br was it a complete waist of time yes which raises your question Â why did i watch it throughout well i was trying to fall asleep and i thought this was a great candidate for that but unfortunately i had too much coffee before thatÂ
<START> really this has to be one of the most stupidest attempts to get people in my age group's attention it's about some preppy girl named and her friends that attends boarding school boring all she ever does is whine and complain and acts like a spoiled idiot i remember this show came out in 2005 i was 13 going on 14 and even then i thought it was pointless the only episode i ever liked was when the boys hid a camera in the girls dorm that's it anyway i just don't understand why nickel oh my bad nick feels the need to syndicate this sorry poor excuse for entertainment serious this decade is becoming a joke every year and it gets worst and worst what's with this generation br br anyway r i p nickelodeon 1979 1998 2005
<START> this is a finely crafted movie with moving sequences humor and best of all a love story anthony quinn is wonderfully casted and after seeing several of his movies this has to be categorized as one of his best performances besides zorba the movie makes you really wonder if its filmed in romania which apparently is not the case it is sure to fool even native romanians with its authentic like landscape costume and ways of life according to imdb it is actually shot in france and yugoslavia hmmm the story is compelling making you want to watch the entire movie over to see if you missed something it provoked me into researching to find out if this is a truth based movie but to my disappointment it is a novel based film seemingly fiction it seems a bit far fetched to have happened for real but one never knows the one problem with this film is that it doesn't seem to cast any romanian actors and it is a film about a romanian character there are probably many romanian fill ins in the beginning but maybe not it is filmed elsewhere the author of the book was romanian at least thats all fine and dandy overall a masterpiece in cinematography
<START> yet another cookie cutter movie about a hardened adult who meets an adorable street smart kid cop and 1 2 gloria etc and once again it is not funny or interesting for anyone to watch kids or adults i'm sure some people might find this movie amusing but i have no earthly idea why once again i feel sorry for the poor kids who were forced to work in this movie so that everyone else and their parents could make some bucks at the price of a cheesy cheesy movie
<START> i acquired this film a couple of years ago and on trying to find some info about it i found that even the mighty imdb didn't have it listed that should have been all i needed to know br br with friends like these is an anthology that plays like a collection of second rate twilight zone outer limits episodes all linked together by a bus journey that never really seems to tie in with the rest of the film of the three stories the only one that i gleaned any entertainment value from was the second episode in which a man of sorts grows out of the bacteria in a guys fridge this episode wins points for a few spots of humour and it's bizarre premise other than that there is an episode with a talking car bland and directionless and an episode where a girl visits a very unique dating agency my dog guessed the ending of this one br br as has been mentioned in other comments the 18 rating is entirely unwarranted there is nothing to offend here if you're after a good horror anthology check out asylum or the creepshow films instead
<START> now i did watch this when it first came out on vhs and all my friends and i thought it was a pretty good movie but then again we were teenagers but honestly not that good of a movie in retrospect sort of a hair metal version of carnival of souls but a bad movie does not exactly mean it is unwatchable however this one seems to lack the charm a lot of the regular mst3k fodder usually contains but if it was on cable and i was bored and drinking beer sure i'd watch it again but then again i've watched howling vii about five times now so maybe you really shouldn't be listening to me br br anyone else think it kind of sad that the director supposedly commented on his own movie and why did he feel the urge to use caps lock so much
<START> what's the point of this messages if not to discuss and share thoughts about the next season here is my forecast 1 the hatch was indeed blown but somehow everybody inside survived buts lets see about that 2 the episode at the end with the tent is an observation team monitoring the tracking device installed on boat by penny now that the magnetic shield around the island was lifted the signal was picked up by the observation station and they are going to send a rescue mission 3 after the destruction of the hatch the island is not isolated any more and other ships airplanes are going to arrive 4 the others are finally going to share their secret with us poor observers br br was it actually confirmed that there are going to be 4 seasons of lost br br cheers mike
<START> wow kiss the bride wasn't that bad but it wasn't that good either it sure was no later day saints the movie sags in the center perhaps cutting out about 30 minutes would have made a more enjoyable film but the film gets bogged down again and again by annoying subplots and throw away scenes the whole gold outing sequence comes to mind br br even though kiss was made for theatrical release it looks and sounds more like a made for tv movie every scene is lighted like a department store so many characters are so throw away br br and dear tori is actually a pleasant surprise she steals every scene she appears in br br one scene really annoyed me it was the rehearsal dinner in this larger room with scores of tables all decorated but only 5 or 6 people in a room for 250 where did everyone go br br gay cinema has sunk to a new low but not as low as the horrible films being produced and shown on the here channel
<START> beyond is one of the most emotional and intense films ever made superbly directed by john boorman and acted by patricia arquette this film can easily be called one of the best films of the 90's the story and vivid characters just grab the audience from the very opening and never lets go after seeing the film the viewer will never be able to forget beyond the film made little money at the box office and is little known but should be high profile watching it you can tell that it was meant to be seen by a large audience it is a very important and moving film and should be seen by everyone br br
<START> this was easily one of the weirder of the ernest movies especially in regards to the production design what was up with the pink guard uniforms sadly this film probably destroyed the ernest series turning the series into a straight to video series however jim varney gave one of his better performances by playing nash his criminal alter ego a misstep in the series but wasn't too bad in most regards the electro man routine was classic
<START> jude law nicole kidman and renne they are all horrible especially the star jude law br br it's directed by the same guy who did the english patient and its based on a best selling novel of a man risking all to get back to his lover but unlike the wonderful english this movie sucks it is really bad br br worst dialogue ever but we've only know each other for a moment but they were a thousand moments like diamonds in a bag br br or br br in some cultures you just have to say i marry you 3 times and you're married lovey dovey i marry you i marry you i marry you i marry you br br i'm ashamed i sat through it all br br the whole movie was awful horrible no words i'm sick br br 1 10 the one is for the really loud bullet sounds the sound crew did a good job
<START> almost no cinema experience can beat a good thriller with a sense of humor geena davis is a schoolteacher housewife who suffers from amnesia even on the pta but then an auto accident awakens the woman she used to be and it's hot samuel l jackson is hilarious as the low rent private eye who tries to help davis find her past only to find out he's in way over his head davis has some hilarious lines too and the interaction between her and jackson works surprisingly well br br look for brian cox the original hannibal and david finally managing to shed his st elsewhere tv image the film is directed by davis' husband who almost seems to have built the whole film around her but it works br br i pull out this dvd and rewatch it often i still love the makeup scene is geena hot or what
<START> quentin tarantino's partner in crime roger co writer on pulp fiction ventures out on his own q t goes exec prod this time for this over boiled french thriller br br eric stoltz is zed safe cracker extraordinaire who has drifted over to france from the u s at the request of an old friend there he teams up with a motley crew of drugged out hippies who with little or no planning think they can knock off a bank vault full of gold bullion on a french national holiday br br has reworked the robbery gone wrong theme that tarantino developed so well in reservoir dogs only killing zoe is not good enough to survive on the strength of this alone so has thrown in a rather beautiful distraction julie delpy is zoe a student come call girl who entertains zed on his arrival in paris a stunning distraction she certainly is but nothing more br br i guess our director wanted to add a different angle to this basic theme but sadly the move did not help to add the depth his shallow plot so desperately needed there was never a story in this idea which was nothing more than that an idea even the surreal journey into the seedy dives of paris is uninspiring i figure one would have to concede that there was never much of a movie in the story of a bunch of gangsters shooting each other up over a botched jewellery heist either that is until you add intricate characters and snappy dialogue reservoir dogs had it killing zoe did not br br stoltz's strong interpretation of the doubtful zed and jean hughes mad portrayal of the obsessive ring leader do nothing to lift proceedings in short has unsuccessfully attempted to conjure entertainment out of nothing br br friday september 15 1995 astor theatre
<START> simon west's remake of the 1979 horror classic is a pathetic attempt to bring old school thrills to a contemporary audience starring talented teen camilla belle when a calls fails to even elicit a shocked or even surprised face poor attempts at scaring the audience range from blurred coats that look like people to building the tense music up for a cat running out of the shadows the plot follows jill johnson belle a teenage girl that has to pay off a bill to her father via babysitting she is invited to work for the night at a house by the river and thinks it a perfectly easy way to make cash but little does she know a stranger lurks in the house and constantly harasses johnson via the phone a pathetic excuse for a film
