<START> follow up to 1965's my name is barbra and shot in brilliant color color me barbra has la streisand alternating nostalgia clowning comedy feminine romantic angst and beguiling seriousness for a crazy quilt hour of show biz razzle dazzle she's a cut up and a femme fatale a sprite and an enigma with her egyptian eye make up and ever changing hairstyles she's also a chameleon her voice is rich and moving even if a few of her songs are not one kiss yesterdays the circus sequence isn't as intriguing as the museum trip with the conceit of barbra becoming the images in the paintings an idea which works better than you may think the circus medley built around songs featuring the word face is girlishly cute without ever really becoming enchanting still this is a lively jazzy special not quite as emotionally tantalizing as my name is barbra but certainly a sterling sophomore effort
<START> much as i really like catherine zeta jones i wondered once again why remake a good movie this version lacked the tension and passion of mostly martha it was a clear rip off was more convincing as a hurting child who healed with love i couldn't believe abigail breslin martina owned this role unfortunately zeta jones should have found another one that she could own she has other roles she does own sergio castellitto was good as a vulnerable but joyful italian aaron seemed passionless in comparison this version was pleasant but bland br br the love between mario and martha was perhaps predictable but satisfying the therapist added an interesting bit of color that didn't seem important i liked it when at the end he said he'd be back but the movie was over before he returned i have mostly martha at home every now and then i revisit it
<START> i think the best way for me to review this title is to split it into its pros and cons br br pros they turn into wolves rather than plastic cartoony monsters the chase of the wolves through the forest cash machine by hard fi being played br br cons some parts of the script makes you cringe for example the terrible part where the woman escapes the of the fortunate five boys and there's about half an hour of dear cousin and a round robin of yes see we know gabriel's law the diving transformation is ridiculous the obvious and ridiculous ending aiden being told thousands of times to leave and then goes if you cared about me you would have left me the obvious characters the unnecessary the completely unnecessary slashing of the arm by aiden cringey speeches by gabriel br br you see what i mean br br i adore werewolf films and i tried watching this a few times to see if i'd like it better but it just made it worse i think i'll just read the book and see how i get on br br don't bother with this unless you have a 12 year old brother or sister into spooky things anyone over that age may suffer and want their hour and a half back
<START> gargoyle starts late one night in as a peasant girl daniela travels along in her horse cart minding her own business when from the moonlit clouds above a living gargoyle swoops down attacks her she manages to escape the gargoyle happens upon a castle of some description where an angry mob of local villagers a priest are able to put an end to the gargoyle or so they think cut to present day bucharest where two cia agents ty griffin michael pare jennifer wells sandra hess are about to negotiate the safe return of the son of a rich american ambassador from his kidnappers in pursuit of one of the kidnappers griffin loses him on the roof of a building but finds a large pool of blood no visible signs of what happened to him meanwhile dr christina durant kate her colleague richard barrier jason are renovating a church when the church labourer gregor informs richard that he has found some ancient relic the two investigate find a cave with lots of slimy cocoons one very angry very much alive gargoyle who wastes no time in killing them both griffin wells are on the case when they are reported missing soon realise that local legends of monstrous gargoyles are true with a local priest named father soren planning to flood the world with them br br co written co produced directed by jim wynorski under his usual pseudonym jay andrews gargoyles is yet another masterpiece wynorski can add to his credits not the script by wynorski ion a g lawrence bill munroe is crap is unexciting dull is as simplistic as you can get for a start i would like to know if there was only one gargoyle left who laid all those eggs because i'm pretty sure it couldn't have made itself pregnant how did it survive in that hole for 500 years what did it eat how did the priest know it was there why has no one else ever figured it out why did the priest want to flood the world with them to rule it the gargoyles are hardly going to take over the world then let some priest just rule it like a king if they did what would be left to rule much like the guys who wrote gargoyle i don't think he thought it through that well did he whichever way i look at it whichever way i approach it from whichever angle i try to figure it out from no matter how many times i try to square the circle gargoyles just doesn't make any sense they story has huge plot holes lapses in logic isn't that great to start with anyway the character's are dull clichÃ©d the action repetitive unexciting while the film as a whole is a real bore to sit through people do illogical things everything that happens is far to convenient like when the priest is try to convince griffin that exist one just suddenly shows up attacks them the cave full of cocoons is such a rip off of aliens 1986 it's embarrassing the ending was lame the bit on the large ferris wheel at the fair was funny though when the guy mocked the boys fear of heights forced him to get on it br br director wynorski cuts costs steals footage from other films in fact the best scene from gargoyle is a car chase through bucharest but it was taken from the jean claude van damme action film maximum risk 1996 there are no shocks scares or atmosphere the special effects are terrible the cgi gargoyle looks like it belongs in a computer game has little interaction with any living cast members there are lots of scenes of people looking up to the sky trying to appear scarred there isn't even any worthwhile gore to make the thing watchable there is one awful decapitation that's it br br technically the special effects are awful but otherwise it's passable the romanian locations look suitably romanian gargoyle went straight to video it shows with a pretty cheap look feel to it the acting isn't up to much personality bypass victim michael pare makes for the dullest of dull heroes br br gargoyle is a crap film it fails at everything a decent creature feature should strive to achieve a total waste of 90 minutes as far as i'm concerned one to avoid
<START> nero is the second movie of the series of six productions named i have already unfavorably commented the first one augustus this second tv movie produced and broadcast last weekend by the italian state owned network has the same defects in addition contains a considerable number of historical errors some examples nero is a child and calls him nero nero at that time is name was claudius he was named nero after his adoption nero did not meet when he was young as in the movie but after his marriage with octavia and his nomination to emperor when becoming emperor his sons where not adults is one month old and octavia one year old and many many more if you are fond of ancient roman history you can find yourselves other examples series will continue with four more movies titus marcus aurelius and the fall of the roman empire finally
<START> basically the first two critters movie were already silly ones but in a good and entertaining way this movie is way more of a b movie that is silly but for all of the wrong reasons br br this is the first sequel that doesn't really follows the plot of the first two movies basically all of the characters are new and there are no bounty hunters this time well as good as none since the bounty hunter in this movie shows up far too late and the budget for this one obviously went down again to save even more costs the movie got shot back to back with part 4 which i imaging will be just as bad since it directly follows this movie and got made by the same people involved as with this one br br it's just a typical b genre movie that doesn't really have any originality in it or brings entertainment it makes critters 3 a real redundant sequel you can easily do without granted that things could had been way worse for this movie but it just ain't exactly a good one either the movie just falls flat as a science fiction horror comedy br br also kind of strange to notice how the critters has suddenly changed in this one they are about double their usual size this time without giving an explanation for that and they are even more gremlins like in this movie than was the case in the previous one br br the movie is only made interesting because this was the feature film debut of leonardo dicaprio he was about 17 in this movie and of course looking baby faced like he still does now i like watching this well known actors in their early roles it's fun to see how they act and if their style has improved and changed over the years of course dicaprio got only better but he already was kind of delivering his lines in the same way as he does these days br br really a too silly and lame movie br br 4 10
<START> 2002 a turkish film shown in the u s as distant br br was directed produced written and filmed by bilge br br br br this movie is a gritty and somber version of the clash between a city mouse played by and a country mouse played by br br both men are superb actors and the plot allows them to demonstrate their acting skill tragically died in an automobile accident shortly after the movie was completed br br in most country cousin city cousin tales the contrast between rural and urban life styles is portrayed in a humorous fashion in this film there's little humor or even warmth both men br br have lost touch with human society 's work as a br br commercial photographer for a tile company gives him no satisfaction he has divorced a woman he clearly br br still loves and has no satisfying human relationships br br has lost his job because of a factory closing in his small town and doesn't have the skills or the energy to find work in the city his human interactions are primarily confined to silent observations of the other people who cross his path he's clearly a warm and caring person but can't express these qualities in an urban environment br br the cousins don't relate well to the world and they don't relate well to each other neither makes an effort to act in a way that would provide an opportunity for bonding or closeness br br in a sense this film portrays an opportunity wasted br br conceivably each cousin could have provided at least part of what was lacking in the other's life instead they steer parallel unhappy courses the two men are distant throughout which is a situation suggested by the film's title br br one of my friends mentioned the masterful way in which builds detail upon detail these details ultimately tell us more about the characters than we might have learned by simple exposition br br was shown as part of the rochester labor film series it's not a labor film in the traditional sense of that genre it is a labor film because it demonstrates the harmful effects of unsatisfying work and unemployment br br this is a quiet absorbing dark film although it doesn't make for happy viewing i walked out of the br br theater realizing that i had seen a truly creative and br br important movie this film is worth finding and seeing
<START> what can i say this movie has it all romance break ups rich kids punks and preps this is my all time favorite movie that i can recite line for line i remember when it first came out i was 14 and couldn't get in so finally got to see it on cable i was hooked wanted to move to california and be a valley girl hey i even remember the song by moon zappa do you tried in vain for years to get the never produced soundtrack now you can find it on rhino records
<START> i watched this cooking show for a few times before i wanted to pull my hair out just one question who can't cook a slapped together plain meal in 30 minutes when everything you need is at hand already bagged sometimes pre chopped and you have very little else to do except chop a few greens also almost every cooking show on tv is 30 minutes and most of these chefs do all of their prep work except for sandra lee during their show oh and yep they do full meals too br br love the comment by the guy who hated the comment add de to my list of stupid tag words br br then you have the obvious a loud gregarious woman who is truly her own best audience she laughs at her own lame comments mugs too many times for the camera because she wants to convince us that she's as good as the thinks br br no she ain't the cutest thing she's a 40 something year old woman who isn't de
<START> ok it was a risky move to rent this flick but i thought i had nothing to lose well i was wrong this is next to the worst horrormovie i have ever seen crappy actors crappy technical output crappy story and so on the soundtrack though isn't to bad that is why i give it a 2 on the vote and not just a 1 and of course the cats are a positive surprise by far the superior actors in this movie do not rent or buy it stay away from it and hope that this horrible horrible film will vanish to some obscure existence and not become a cult classic it most definitely do not deserve any recognition
<START> stephane is the eponymous heroine of this beautifully measured study of a small danish community towards the end of the last century two beautiful and musically talented sisters give up their own prospects of happiness and marriage in order to look after their ageing father one day a french woman babette comes to work for them after some years she wins the lottery and is determined to do something for the sisters who have taken her in her solution is to prepare an exquisite and sumptuous feast which changes the lives of all those invited this is a film about human and cultural interaction reflected in the changing language of the dialogue from danish to french and especially between the dutiful sobriety of protestant northern europe and the sensuousness of the catholic south it is also about human needs and how warmth and kindness can be expressed and stimulated through the cultivation of the senses a profoundly uplifting film
<START> right the hospital scene with holly and shannon was done brilliantly it starts off with piper on a gurney looking very badly injured the docs race her into a resuscitation room they move her from the gurney onto a bed and holds her hand from that point on it is obvious that piper is having a lot of trouble breathing and her lungs are failing as she turns to beg of to not leave her side she gaps don't go i love you and then her pulse drops and she goes into cardiac arrest the monitor shows a clear flat line the nurses go into full out trauma mode bring in a steps back from the bed in horror as the doctors desperately try to shock her dying sisters heart but there is no response and she is tragically pronounced dead well great scene well done girls
<START> i totally loved this movie tried to buy it and can't find it a must see a movie you can watch again and again funny but also a tear jerker in one really good album for the movie it's a really good 80's movie i wish i could find a copy to buy this movie cause i would the actors in it acted really good there's a lot of people out there that probably could relate to this movie that's what makes this movie so good so go out and try to rent this one you won't regret it it's an older movie but it's worth watching i would not be surprised if they made a remake of this movie soon but i'm sure it would not be the same anyone who hasn't seen it go rent it
<START> this show started out okay but then it turned into a nightmare the worst part about it was the contestants most of them were weirdos they did stupid things for a living and they also did strange hobbies in the second season one guy said he that he talked to his pants that is sick and repulsive also no one cared about winning money all they ever wanted to do was make alliances like it was survivor or something the men were always afraid that the women were going to team up together the women were the same also i just couldn't take it anymore i had to stop watching it it was truly one of the worst shows ever
<START> so i got this from the rental store where i work before it was released release is 8 21 just watched it today and now i'm speechless they could have had a decent movie here but they screwed it up in some painfully obvious ways br br first of all the parts with john were funny and are the only reason i gave it above a 3 but they are broken up by bad acting and terrible serious reflections on life between the main character andrew and his girlfriend the annoying lacy chabert it would have been much much better as a straight comedy ala lock stock and two smoking barrels br br i wanted to like it because i think is funny and want to see him do well the story wasn't bad either just not very original but the directing and a lot of the acting was terrible i swear they had trouble keeping peoples faces in the shot and just went with it anyway br br their carelessness is showcased when the gun expert corrects another character and says that a dirty harry gun is not a 357 magnum but a 45 it was as everyone knows a 44 magnum br br so see this if you 1 really like john 2 like to watch low budget and poorly directed movies or 3 have too much time on your hands this is me
