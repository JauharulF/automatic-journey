<START> this really is a great movie i don't think it has ever gotten the recognition that it deserves i have bought this movie on vhs and dvd the special effects were ahead of its time the story was way cool the pace was very steady if you haven't seen it you definitely need to check it out on dvd if possible
<START> if you never have read the book and never intend to read it in the future go on and watch the movie 6 10 it is a nice fantasy movie with well done cgi nice acting a beautiful environment and an above average fantasy story br br if you have read the book like me about 10 times or more and really love it don't expect too much or better don't expect anything at all the story is totally different from the original book this may explain that the movie is voted 1 10 from people around 40 or more like me and much better from people who most probably never read the book before and thus expect nothing br br most of the differences between movie and book are not really necessary and change the setting in my opinion much to the worse br br the magic in the book works with rituals for classic magical effects changing weather creating illusions transform into animals in the movie the magic is more like jedi school for the middle ages tm wooden sticks instead of lightsabers that the devil is looking like emperor palpatine after part iii doesn't make it really better br br the mill in the book is not totally cut off the world like in the movie in the book the story is set near dresden which visits one time with his master and also he visits some nearby villages for festivities this part might have been changed to cut costs i also don't understand why in the movie the mill is located in the hills while the nearby graveyard is set in the high mountains br br the whole surrounding is the average run of the mill fantasy medieval style lots of mud everywhere dirty faces not an orderly kitchen only very rough houses the book never suggested such an environment br br in the book the master tries to make his successor but rejects is somewhere between admiration distance and silent rejection in the movie rejects the master always openly like a stubborn schoolboy br br the movie is set in instead of around this makes it impossible for the master to tell some stories from his youth probably around ok the stories are missing anyway in the movie br br also some explanations given in the book would have been helpful and would not cost so much minutes br br in the book all work done at day is effortless and work in the night is like normal work this explanation is missing in the movie sometimes the boys are sweating and sometimes they are happy br br the book explains why only a few try to confront the master if the master dies by any mundane reasons the are free and keep their magical powers if the master dies at the confrontation all will lose their power forever
<START> apparently a b movie b must stand for better acting and a better message than we get in big budget a pictures today modern day movies aimed at young women surely aren't designed to encourage depth of character over shallow self serving behavior or increase the self esteem of young girls who don't conform to feminine standards after all criticizing the fake and flashy like this movie does ain't gonna help sell more products that depend on girls not being satisfied with their natural attributes or inner beauty br br laraine day is lovable as a mechanically inclined tomboy who bounds into rooms and confesses to an inability to flirt she bonds with robert cummings due to similar interests a shared sense of humour and her honesty loyalty and good friendship which he gradually comes to value over the superficial charms of her selfish glamour girl sister who only brings out his own selfish reckless playboy tendencies br br although laraine is outwardly beautiful as well it's refreshing to see inner beauty valued more and the depiction of true friendship leading to the most fulfilling romantic relationship i wish young girls and guys were getting this kind of down to earth message today br br maybe if hollywood returns to making b movies again with modest budgets and tries to be content with modest profits what am i saying sacrificing the blockbuster mentality to create something sincere on a smaller scale would be like expecting a guy to give up the shallow sexpot for a sweet girl who really cares about him that's crazy talk br br please somebody invent a time machine already i belong in 1940 br br i'd rate this movie higher but the ending is a bit too abrupt and perhaps lacked sufficient indication of robert change of heart i like the fact that b movies are short snappy not bloated self indulgent but this one might've needed more than 70 minutes also found it somewhat unrealistic that a widow and young children would be so unaffected by a sudden death in their family or be so forgiving of the one who caused it i mean i guess it's nice but a little more grieving or bitterness would've been only natural maybe a deliberate choice to make this family act lighthearted about their loss to lessen the impact of the tragedy and make sure we forgive those involved in the death since it's just a plot device anyway not the real point of the film still strange though
<START> alleged scream queen debbie rochon and her group of frontier prostitutes travel west to the title location and encounter grisly killings that turn out to be the work of a cult of ex confederate psychopaths attempting to resurrect the south through pointless massacre br br action and suspense take a backseat to loads of boring dialog and uninteresting character development br br billy drago is good in the thankless not to mention pointless role of the town mortician but everything else about this wannabe slasher western is extremely poor including the town and the fort both of which look like modern made western tourist traps and costumes that look like they were bought at party city br br do yourself a big favor and watch ravenous instead
<START> i love cheesy horror movies i think dead alive and bad taste are great and i think slumber party massacre ii not even related to this movie are hilarious but this movie absolutely stank i didn't laugh i didn't even enjoy it you can see all kinds of mistakes that aren't even campy the best take of the scene where the woman leans out the window is the one where she smacks her head on the sill give me a break br br don't rent this thinking it's related to the slumber party massacre series it's awful and i don't even have a clue how it got any distribution rent it with a fake name and burn it do everyone else the favor
<START> i'm an action movie fan but until today i've never seen a preview or an ad for this movie in italy so i went to see the long kiss goodnight on pay tv hoping for nothing special br br but what a surprise this movie is great the only problem i found is the presence of some holes in the plot but the rest is the most entertaining intriguing and funny action movie ever made br br the transformation of samantha charly from ordinary wife teacher to cool blooded agent recovering from amnesia seems to be a good idea the action scenes and the stunts are the best i've ever seen samuel l jackson adds some of the best lines i have ever heard and his chemistry with geena davis is good br br and what about geena she is wonderful she plays the best action heroine ever seen and does strong convincing acting and fantastic stunts br br so i think this movie had weak performances at box office and bad critics because most reviewers and some kind of public have a hard time with strong female lead roles br br 9 10
<START> this movie is extremely funny and it also contains the best looking girl this young man has ever seen tiffani amber is a great actress and she has the looks that stop traffic tiffani completes this movie which contains funny scenes put on by shore
<START> this movie is very silly and very funny you can't ever criticize it for taking itself seriously if you've heard their previous album or seen their hbo videos from the album you can imagine the extremely foul mouthed rocking good time that is this movie which tells the fable of how the group tenacious d came to be formed br br full of cameos it not only gives a fictional account of tenacious d but is a send up of musical history as well the humor reminds one of something about mary in that they often go places you'd thought they wouldn't but it lacks the scatological humor of south park this movie contains no nudity except for mooning
<START> i have not watched every jackass episode it was mildly entertaining if nothing else was going but after watching jackass 2 i was fond of bam and dunn they had a nice attitude in the movie jackass so i figured i'd tune in on viva la bam boy was i mistaken seriously you could pair a bunch of provide them with the same budget and i bet they could knock off something more creative on the screen i mean c'mon mtv at 23 where most people are tuned in you give us this rubbish br br everything seems so forced you don't know the characters because there's no attitude at all you can't appreciate bam or dunn or anyone for that matter if there would just be a tiny tiny doze of thought anything we won't forget as soon as next shot goes on br br they finally manage to create a good shot and you like whats going on you sit there just waiting for their reaction and then some jerk closes the scenes with two lame sentences and bang was that the close for that shot or what please if i had been there i would freak out and laugh do some insane stuff and have my adrenaline pumping but these guys just scripted stupid reactions br br yes they get a few chuckles of the audience by cheap gross jokes or gigantic jokes which in my opinion are such a waste of cash br br many many normal humans which was not taken under the jackass wing could in a heartbeat write a far funnier script or impress with visual camera work even spontaneous wannabe cool guys without a script would pull of a better job mtv could in a whim bring more soothing material on the screen you just need to fire the writer of this stupid show br br some scenes actually require a bit of courage and therefore 2 stars
<START> the only reason for me for watching this little known irish film was the question could mike myers have played a normal dramatic character well he could and his acting was pretty good but unfortunately that was probably the only good thing that i can say about this film in the beginning film follows life of twelve years old orphan mickey who lives with his brother and sister with their somewhat eccentric grandma despite some strong language it looks like a family film but after a while it becomes clearly that pete's meteor is a hardly suitable for young audience drama and the worst is that it is a drama with so much ridiculous and even totally implausible plot one preposterous story line turns into another and all the time there is no much sense in the events on screen i suppose when a life drama needs a meteor or what is more something that looks like even more ridiculous spiritual content that's a really bad sign the characters are not much better than a story despite all his troubles young mickey by no means is not a likable character but it's clearly was somehow we were supposed to care about him and even feel strong sympathy to him it doesn't work the same thing with other characters they are mostly as ridiculous as the story itself with the title character although he wasn't the main character as the only bright spot towards the end of the movie i still had a strong hope that there is something behind of all that improbability and absurdity unfortunately even if the writer of the story had such intentions and i'm sure he had in the film they are hidden and practically under such a weird script br br grade 3 out of 10 those of you who are interested in seeing mike myers as a drama actor can watch pete's meteor for that reason but the rest of viewers most likely will be bitterly disappointed
<START> love is hard to find in this fast food society that we live in so man called hitch makes it duty to help men find love with women that they are beyond madly in love with his rules are that he only helps you find love and not just some casual sex which seems like a great deal but soon word begins to spread around and people begin to get the wrong idea about what he does which begins to complicate the relationship with woman he just met that he is madly in love with br br i have to say it's really nice to see will smith in a movie that doesn't have him trying to save the world from aliens or robots there are no jaw dropping effects nor is he showing off his beefed up body he's just a normal human being in this movie which was really nice he doesn't necessarily stretch his acting muscles in this movie but then again the story doesn't call for that but all the same it was nice to see him relaxed and not showing off his ripped body to make those of us without six packs jealous his character here is as with all his characters likable witty and very charming which is something that almost all the characters in this odd love tale seem to share the kevin james character is just a regular guy that needs help hooking up with the girl of his dreams which really makes you feel for the guy and root for him every step of the way the only character that was a sore spot for me was the mendez character because she's so cold and calculated that it's hard to believe that smith could fall for her he must love a challenge i guess br br now this is the part of the review in which i'll make a joke about how i would never need hitch because i'm such a player but i just got through writing about 16 reviews for another web site plus i'm still working on a little project so i'm a little jaded right now whiles the movie is packed with enough charm and likable characters with funny lines it slowly but surely falls into the sea of formulaic romantic movies in which after the big scene where the terrible secret comes out everyone is forgiven and the relationship is even better than before but hey there's like 4000 movies about the underdog overcoming adversity so i guess one more movie having a predictable ending that's been done to almost death doesn't cause much harm i really like the message of the movie as well because in the end you don't need a formula to get the right girl just be yourself and all will fall into play which is theme of the movie and why it works so well i'm sure if it had turned out that the james character gets the girl after following everything that the smith character said then it would have being a pretty empty movie but as it stands it works really well br br despite being predictable this is a perfect date movie it's sweet it's funny and it's romantic so anyone that watches this movie on a date should be getting some after it's over and by some i mean sex
<START> it doesn't happen very often but occasionally one man can make a difference a big difference br br george 2003 best seller charlie wilson's war is a fascinating and eye opening account of the most unlikely difference maker imaginable a relatively obscure congressman from the second district of texas good time charlie was known more for his libertine lifestyle than his libertarian legislation likable and licentious even for a politician charlie wilson served his well since the good folks of only really wanted two things their guns and to be left alone it's easy street replete with his bevy of beltway beauties known appropriately enough as charlie's angels br br when asked why his entire office staff was composed of attractive young aides his response is a classic you can teach 'em to type but you can't teach 'em to grow tits no argument there br br but even the most rakish has a conscience lurking somewhere underneath and for charlie wilson the unimaginable atrocities being committed in afghanistan moved him to muster his entire political savvy toward funding the utter humiliating defeat of the russian military and possibly to even help hasten the end of the cold war as a result fat chance huh br br under the skillful direction of mike nichols and a smart snappy screenplay by adam charlie wilson's war is a sparkling sophisticated satire that chronicles the behind the scene machinations of three colorful characters comprising charlie's team br br the on screen team is composed of three marvelous actors with four 4 academy awards and nine 9 nominations between them charlie is beautifully portrayed by tom hanks in a solid slightly understated fashion that is among his best work in years he's aided abetted and by joanne herring a wealthy houston socialite played by the still slinky julia roberts hey why else have the bikini scene than to let the world know this by all accounts ms roberts looks good and holds her own but the screenplay never gives us even a hint why kabul and country is so important to her character maybe the two afghan hounds usually by her side know but we as an audience never do as for the third member of the team philip seymour hoffman steals every scene he appears in as gust a smart street wise i e non ivy league graduate cia malcontent who knows the score both in the agency's boardroom and in wilson's bedroom br br for the to succeed the most important assistance the u s can provide is the ability to shoot down the dreaded mi 21 helicopter which rule the skies this takes money lots of money and eventually charlie's team covertly coerces those in congress to fund the effort to the tune of 1 billion dollars for advanced weaponry to arm the afghan rebels this includes top of the line state of the art anti aircraft and anti tank rockets as well as other highly sophisticated killing devices nasty nasty stuff br br that this kind of multi billion dollar illicit activity can and does take place behind congressional doors is truly alarming every american should see this movie or read this book because it reveals a truly frightening aspect of the business as usual political scene rarely seen outside the walls of our very own government oh momma i wish it weren't so br br even though the initial outcome for team charlie was an unqualified success the unimaginable unanticipated final result is that these sophisticated weapons are now used against our troops by the taliban and others since the funding was entirely covert the young generation in this part of the world has no idea the fall of soviet oppression and the end to russian was the direct result of american intervention yes once the russkies left so did our aid zip for schools zip for infrastructure zip on maintaining meaningful relationships with the afghan people as a result the overall consequence is an unmitigated disaster it's like the forerunner to mission accomplished br br as film so pointedly points out the ball you've set in motion can keep bouncing even after you've lost interest in it mike knows this eva longoria parker knows this little lateesha in lafayette knows this but the typical american politician doesn't so we go from good guys to bad guys because we couldn't let the world know we were the good guys talk about a catch 22 another mike nichols film br br perhaps charlie wilson said it best we f ked up the end game br br again
<START> i made it about 8 minutes into steel frontier before i turned it off then glutton for punishment that i am i watched some more the next day today i had to iron a pile of clothes so i decided to finish the movie and that was its own punishment here's what i don't understand robert rodriguez and shane each spent 7 000 on their debut features and created two remarkable movies yet here we have two directors with arguably way more money and they churn out a huge steaming pile of crap let me see if i can figure out the logic it's 'road but it's like a future western we'll get the cheapest 'actors' we can find we'll have my mentally challenged cousin write the script and we'll spend the budget on a bunch of explosions we can't lose br br seriously i don't think even the mst3k guys could improve this but if you insist on watching it i recommend getting very drunk first
<START> my girlfriend as we walk in the cold london evening in leicester square after the movie says if they didn't speak english and they didn't show the stadium you could have thought this was the slums of a south american city or some other slum anywhere in the world not queens in nyc br br ramin is right now my official hero because he seems to have devoted his work to show not the other face of american but the real face of america br br ramin movies are like di or anno zero or roma aperta chop shop is reality turned into a movie is more realistic than a documentary in fact i think ramin movies are more realistic than documentaries this is a great movies but don't expect any car chase or shooting this movie is about tragic lives on the margin of the wealthiest richest country in the world
<START> jerry lewis was marginally funny when he didn't write his own material and had a good director like frank tashlin when he started writing and directing his own films what little talent he possessed was overshadowed by his egomania whenever his films would fail and deservedly so in the american market they made money in france lewis always blamed everyone and everything but himself for example he blamed the failure of this film on the fact that it was according to lewis released on a double bill with the porno feature deep throat if anyone should have complained about that situation it should have been the producers of deep throat this is an absolutely idiotic comedy about the world's richest man lewis who is rejected for military service during ww2 and decides to outfit a special squad to go to germany and capture hitler himself besides the many faults this film has the script is mind numbingly unfunny lewis' direction is nonexistent the film has the look of a cheap home movie lewis apparently thought that surrounding himself with no talent over the hill borscht belt comics like jan murray and sidney miller was a good idea he must have figured that they would be so bad they would make him look good he was half right they are embarrassingly bad but he comes out even worse than they do for a comedy lewis' character is sullen angry and pushy the way he heaps abuse on his underlings makes you wonder why they would ever follow a bullying jerk like this on a dangerous mission like trying to capture hitler the fact that this movie took in any money at all is astounding it is by far the worst jerry lewis movie i have ever seen i've heard that slapstick is even more pathetic but i can't bring myself to see if that's true or not and is to be avoided at all possible costs
