<START> having seen the movie years ago and been disappointed by its squandered potential when i heard that it was becoming a tv series i flatly refused to watch it my best friend became a rabid fan immediately and knowing my love for horror movies could not believe that i wouldn't watch a single episode i told him that the movie had scarred me for life as far as anything buffy was concerned and he told me to forget that the movie even existed he insisted that i give two episodes a shot once more with feeling and this one br br both of them are why i am a buffy fan today he was right i was hooked immediately i have never seen a show with the guts to dare try an episode that has next to no dialogue and nothing else could've pulled it off with the panache and the pure creativity of buffy i think x files might've gotten away with it if they'd thought of it first but i'm glad that buffy did it instead br br it is a credit to everyone involved that you are riveted for the entire hour sometimes hanging onto the edge of your seat and when it was all over i craved to know more about every character so i went out and bought the season one boxed set and the rest is history br br i guarantee you that if you've never seen it either you'll want to see more if you make this episode your first br br the only reason i'm not giving it 10 out of 10 is because i'm reserving that score for once more
<START> it's hard to imagine in this day and age how popular and how much of an impact a norwegian immigrant and would be chemist had on the american public and how much of a national tragedy his sudden death in 1931 was viewed but was an extraordinary individual who both revolutionized and popularized college football and put a small obscure catholic college on the map br br i've heard clips of famous pep talks and it is uncanny how pat o'brien got the voice and the inflection perfectly in what turned out to be his career role pat o'brien captures the integrity and fighting spirit that was is assisted by well by gale page as bonnie stiles who complained about her home being a training camp for notre dame but never threw anyone out of her house br br first impact on football was as a player with notre dame not a coach one fine day in the second half of a losing football game against heavily favored army and team mate gus played by owen davis used the forward pass as an offensive weapon before that football was simply a game where you just got bigger guys for your side and ran through the defense didn't invent the forward pass but he popularized and football became a game of strategy as well as brawn after that br br knew how to work the media also those well publicized pep talks of his were not just to inspire his players they were well publicized and it was in a lot due to him that college football became a major sport in that golden age of sports in the roaring twenties br br playing a small but key role is ronald reagan as george the first player coached to achieve greatness reagan not only got a good performance but forever after a name that was handy in his subsequent political career that deathbed scene which swore was accurate became a republican battle cry as many a gop underdog went out to win one for the br br i still remember a widely distributed photograph in 1981 that was one of the first of recovering president ronald reagan at notre graduation with his old friend pat o'brien reagan always credited o'brien and dick powell of all the warner brothers stars of the period as the ones who were the kindest and most encouraging to a young player on the lot trying to make good br br notre dame itself owes its prestige to it's quite possible that notre dame would be an obscure small catholic college without the reputation that football brought to it br br though george and the later famous of the four horsemen certainly had their place in the sun it was who had the reputation it's no accident that warner brothers was able to get amos alonzo glenn warner howard jones and william contemporaries and coaches with great reputations in their own right to appear in all american it was there way of honoring the guy who was number one in their profession br br i think more than football fans will enjoy all american though you might become one after seeing the film
<START> i don't mind some adult humor but this feature was just downright dirty the first 10 minutes consisted of pryor swearing at some guy taking pictures followed my even more profanities i don't know what happened between that time the the last 5 minutes because i walked out after seeing this i never looked at richard pryor the same way again and to think that he actually went on to host a childrens' show br br if profanity and tasteless unfunny dirty jokes make you laugh then you'll probably enjoy this but if you're an old fashioned type then don't bother
<START> i love this film khan's portrayal as a k a shut up robert was so hilarious whenever he got hit during a fight scene you could hear him squeal viju is the dumbfounded robert a k a rabbit i love that shakti kapoor a k a crime master gogo paresh double role is so awesomely hilarious for his portrayal as ramgopal raveena tandon and karishma kapoor are out of this world my brother does a really good mimicry of saying relax please relax i love the scene in which aamir khan puts a laxative in salman muscles khan's food which caused the irregular bowel movements forcing him to use the toilet umpteen number of times
<START> i watched this movie with no idea what it was about beforehand i was intrigued for the first whole hour it was shaping up to be a great thriller a very talented cast and good dialogue then it all fell apart for me at the sight of the first vampire i couldn't believe my eyes a great thriller was flushed down the toilet the rest of the movie from that point was totally awful br br i gave it 4 stars for the brilliant beginning alone i think that's a little generous but i was entertained for a while i'm not a fan of vampire or zombie movies at all if you are then you may disagree with my opinion
<START> first off i hate sci fi stuff and although this movie got a little sci fi at times that's allright because at least it focused on andre toulon in the last 3 andre seemed to have kind of been mentioned but the stories never really focused on him which made me mad what also makes me mad is the amount of 0's it got on the voting chart give it a rest people if you saw this movie and liked it please vote for it please what i loved about this movie is that it went back to where it all started when andre first learned the secret to life i would recommend renting this if you have seen a puppet master movie before and liked it but not renting it if this is your first time viewing one from the pm collection mainly because you might think all the puppet masters are as dull as this one
<START> john and his wife emily accompanied by their child edward venture from the comfortable environs of suburbia to the village where the husband spent some of his childhood there has been a death in the family and john must begin proceedings to take control of an old ramshackle cottage situated by the seaside and once inhabited by an old man who has apparently committed suicide br br sceptical about the circumstances of the death john divorces himself from his family and from reality puts his own life in peril and puts on the clothes of the old man who is now dead br br the film now changes nothing is what it seems the people of his past appear in full gothic hillbilly glory his wife worries about his mental state and his son disappears into the reeds br br john finds that the old man didn't commit suicide that his death is far more mysterious and strange in a spine chilling finale we learn that the events of the film actually never happened and that the entire narrative was imagined by the little boy edward who is struggling to come to terms with his parents' divorce proceedings br br modern love is a macabre piece of high art cinema a puzzling and perverse piece of pretentiousness full of vague suggestion and unexplored red herrings it is humourless and seemingly unconcerned with current indie trends which both validates its creators but also renders it passÃ© br br but the weaknesses of this australian film are fully outweighed by its sheer muscular cinematic vision its bloody minded and uncompromising precision and its oddball euro horror the of script norms and lack of slick dialogue pales into insignificance against a backdrop of noir and a lead performance that needs to be seen to be appreciated br br one of the most aggressively weird australian films in years
<START> this movie reminds me of harry potter not the style but the marketing strategy there may be part 2 part three until one day the product life cycle of course on the condition that the part one has a commercial success so many things seems to be hidden and thus the story looks quite incomplete the action design is boring set design is ok but not fine perhaps edison chen would be a big star one day he really looks charming even on big screen the most impressive is still anthony wong 4 10 br br
<START> i viewed the original outer limits in real time when first broadcast and have since viewed the entire original series again and again in re runs and complete on dvd i find the new outer limits well more than just a remake of old retread episodes as some of the more adolescent commentators have suggested br br with seven 7 years of programs versus just the two 2 years of the original series the producers and writers have certainly added considerable new original stories and philosophical lines to a much longer running and very well produced cable tv series plots are intelligent scientifically accurate projections of the unknown possibilities of the sometimes frightening and imminent future br br while most producers and directors in hollywood ignorantly view sci fi as indistinguishable from horror and fantasy this series returns to the origins of science fiction in the logical moral and philosophical projections of current new technologies into their possibly fearful near term realizations this series does this very well and remains unique in its avoidance of the shoot em up video game monster mentally of much of the current generation it has brains history a message and good entertainment it is an adult series without unbearable teenage know it all fantasies hurray br br now if we can only get mgm to release the entire new outer limits series on dvd instead of just the six poor teaser discs and the 1st season now only available
<START> i really like ryan reynolds and hope davis and i actually had high hopes watching this last night on dvd mainly as i try to avoid reviews until i watch something myself and form my own opinion big mistake my 2 10 is for the first segment which in fairness is actually quite decent and if they had made the movie about the characters in section 1 alone it may have risen above the 5 10 mark once it moved into tv 'reality show' territory it stank to high heaven ryan reynolds captured the essence of an actor on the edge wonderfully but as a gay tv writer and famous games creator devoted family man he was definitely less effective from the blurb on the box i expected a flashback thriller along the lines of unfortunately this is nowhere near that standard of movie
<START> story about a widowed father claude rains bringing up his four daughters emma gale page is loved by big hunky ernest dick foran thea lola lane is romanced by an old but wealthy man kay rosemary lane wants to become a singer ann priscilla lane is a romantic drop dead handsome felix jeffrey lynn a business associate of their father comes to stay with them all the sisters fall in love with him then tough cynical mickey john garfield enters the picture br br very entertaining movie was a big hit and nominated for five academy awards it's beautifully directed by michael curitz has a pretty good if predictable script and a very attractive cast especially lynn also this was john garfield's first film and made him a star this was so popular there were three or four sequels which i never saw this is an engrossing entertaining big budget soap opera well worth seeing
<START> i like a lot of myrna loy movies this film was produced before her character actor personality was developed it would be an okay short film but seems to go on forever in it's complete form br br myrna loy it seems is told what to do with her acting and does the job that is about all you can say about her br br her gypsy character is shoddy and the film has many flaws such as the jewelry shop scene br br this film will probably be interesting to myrna loy fans but even as such is something of a disappointment
<START> mikhail the cranes are flying is a superb film winner of the golden palm at cannes film festival it has an excellent cinematography and performance by the only russian actor ever to win an award in cannes for a performance she plays veronika a teenager in love with her boyfriend happy and without preoccupations with plans of getting married her life will get upside down when world war ii strikes and her boyfriend volunteers to the army the film depicts the effect of war on a teenager love and on the people that stayed and saw their loved ones go and fight waiting for a letter or other information it is a portrayal of lost innocence does a magnificent job and her character transformation will break your heart the camera movement is fast with a lot of close ups it is a dancing camera the first scene in the stairs is fantastic but it isn't the only one there is later a scene when veronika attempts committing suicide and another in my opinion one of the most powerful scenes in movie history the bombing of house when she runs the stairs in the middle of fire to find her apartment completely destroyed simply great 10 out of 10
<START> just saw this at the madison horror film festival and was disappointed a few shocking funny moments the hollow carla a urinating harpy in the dreamland and two competing interesting premises similar to new nightmare with belief bringing a mythical character to life and also lost highway with a man living out a fantasy in his head but had long stretches of no movement and incoherent plot development just because you use the framework of dreams or a mental fugue state doesn't make it lynchian you need the compelling visuals and creepy performances br br positive things dr maitland had real comic timing and all the girls were very cute carla's father and ingrid pitt looked like they were having some fun and tom savini at least looked like he had his lines memorized and we couldn't see if he was just reading cue cards br br i get the hammer references but it looks like the director realized the script was a snoozer and just added some shocks to try and get some laughs out of whatever footage he could put together but they don't work because they're too few and far between and create an inconsistent tone condense this to 30 minutes of all the fun parts and you could have a surreal goofy short but at feature length skip it it's not so bad it's good it's just so bad it's boring
<START> ok i don't want to upset anyone who enjoyed this film but it was a really bad movie just the way the scenes were edited and the acting it made me cringe at some points i really tried to enjoy it but it was like a student film they must have had the smallest budget i really liked the story line to an extent and the characters were likable but the film on a whole was just awful also why is it that in almost every film with lesbian characters one of them has to either commit suicide or die or turn straight this is so sending a wrong and unrealistic message i gave it 3 stars and everything considered i think that was very kind of me only watch this film if you want to laugh at how bad it is
