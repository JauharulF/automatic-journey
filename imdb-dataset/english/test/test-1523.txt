<START> upon a recommendation from a friend and my admiration of philip baker hall i rented the first season disc of the loop it's a typical tv comedy with all the clichÃ©s that the genre employs with the wacky scheming brother sully ditzy blonde lizzy token unrequited love interest piper sarcastic asian helper darcy which reminded me of arliss as if anyone needed to be reminded of that show the plot deals with various bad luck usually by sully that befalls sam that puts his job at the airplane in jeopardy only to have him save the day with ensuing in the middle i didn't a certain episode i described them all to a t therein lies the problem as what seems like it might even be passable entertainment at first just gets uselessly stale when watching episodes in a row and growing bored beyond belief at the endless repetition sully will do something mimi rogers will say something overtly sexual russ will tell about his gay son darcy will do her impersonation of sandra oh on arliss blah blah blah blah blah the only positive is the lack of an annoying laugh track but don't let that fool you into thinking it's any good go watch a far better comedy arrested development always sunny in two name two off the top of my head surprised that this one is still on the air oh that's right fox only cancels the good shows i forgot needless to say i don't trust my friend's taste in shows anymore br br my grade d
<START> i have watched this show from the beginning and i am a 45 year old man to me this is so much more that a show that appeals to women this is the story of a family possibly an unusual one but a family none the less it centers around a mother and daughter and rory gilmore two bright attractive and in their own ways successful women makes her home in fictional stars hollow ct a small new england town with a sense of history and a population of people that may be unusual but acts as a dysfunctional family the show also throws in the relationship between and her parents richard and emily gilmore old money dar wasp people who do not approve of choices in life though doesn't care the relationships story and through line are what makes this show in my opinion the finest on the wb network soon to be the cw watch this show
<START> this is an absolutely true and faithful adaptation of 'the hollow' it could be argued that the actual mystery here is not one christie's best but what makes 'the hollow' special is the characterisation and i found the actors here more or less without exception were perfect in their parts in such a uniformly good cast it's difficult to select stand out performances but i have to say that sarah miles is just perfect as lucy what is extraordinary is that she not only conveys lucy's tactlessness and her more lovable qualities but she also manages to pull off the underlying truth that in fact lucy is not really all that nice megan dodds is also very good as henrietta and claire price very affecting as gerda john is really quite an unlikeable character but jonathan cake nevertheless manages to make us see what his women see in him br br as i said the script follows the story quite faithfully the only disconcerting thing i found was that midge and edward's relationship really comes out of nowhere and i do believe that some of it must have ended up on the cutting room floor theirs a secondary story however and the primary story is very well done the whole thing looks beautiful as well really capturing a perfect english autumn br br its a beautiful film in every respect and well worth seeing
<START> this is a great compendium of interviews and excerpts form the films of the late sixties and early 70s that were a counter movement to the big studio films of the late sixties directed by ted demme it is obviously a labor of love of the films of the period but it gives short shrift to the masterpieces of the times br br many of the filmmakers of this period were influenced by truffaut antonioni fellini bergman and of course john cassavetes unfortunately the documentary logging in at 138 minutes is too short the film is rich with interviews and opinions of filmmakers some of the people interviewed are martin scorsese francis coppola robert altman peter bogdonovich ellen burstyn and roger corman bruce dern sydney pollack dennis hopper and jon voight br br bruce dern has a moment of truth when he says that he and jack nicholson may not have been as good looking as the other stars that came before them but they were interesting this summarizes the other areas of this period of film making in american history br br the filmmakers were dealing with a lack of funding from the studios because they were expressing unconventional attitudes about politics sex drugs gender and race issues and americas involvement in overseas conflicts like the vietnam war br br there is a great interview with francis coppola saying that he got the chance to make the conversation because the producers knew he had been trained by roger corman to make a movie with nothing so they bankrolled his film br br another interview is with jon voight who was directed by hal ashby in coming home a clear anti war film about a crippled soldier immersing himself back into society after his facing battle voight talks about how his working methods helped him achieve an emotional telling point when ashby said that they were doing a rehearsal take and it ended up being the take used in the film it was better because it was so un rehearsed and not drained of its freshness by being over rehearsed br br there are also many fine excerpts from al pacino's break through film the panic in needle park and interviews from dennis hopper on the making of easy rider and interviews from sydney pollack about making films br br all in all the documentary is a fine jumping off point for any film lover who wants to see great examples of what the new voices in film were like in the seventies many of the sundance folks where this film made a big splash are unaware of just how much the independent film maker today owes to the films of john cassavetes milos foreman william friedkin and roger corman br br rent it from your favorite shop it will at least perk you up to some films you may not have seen before and can enjoy today amazon com has it for as little as 11 50 if you want to buy right out
<START> i am so disappointed after waiting for 3 years for repeats the dvd of the original masterpiece series darkplace i couldn't wait for this series the first episode just ended and i am appalled everything that was great about darkplace has been erased here pretty much worst introduction canned laughter this takes the original point of it away and just renders it nearly unwatchable one joke about eyes the audience was good the rest i can hardly remember it feels like a poor quality knowing me knowing you i hope this improves as the series goes on otherwise i shall be seriously disappointed back to darkplace br br you are the most compassionate man i ever known and i know god
<START> guess a few upscale film directors were sitting around sipping their or jungle juice some night in the 80's during the cannes or other film festival and one said hey guys let's do a movie where each of us creates a segment around a world class aria it kind of sort of worked clearly someone was smart enough to select some of the best recordings of the arias chosen for example nessun dorma so if you were blind and lying on the floor just listening to the dvd you got more than your money's worth not every director succeeded but more did than not and the flick seems to improve with each viewing over the years my favorite is the eerily beautiful love duet from die okay a young naked elizabeth hurley is eye candy but her husband singing to her his wife's ghost is incredibly beautiful with the love music second only to and desdemona's gia nella notte in all the operatic repertoire could the flick been better sure what couldn't not have been but it's well worth a view especially of you're in a hyper romantic mood
<START> a group of adventurers travel to the 'dark to try and locate a lost heiress named diana who disappeared years before in a plane crash and who is now believed to be living with a savage tribe that consider her to be their goddess br br once again my search for sleazy european cannibal movies has taken me deep into jess franco seemingly endless cinematic wilderness swarming with sub par scriptwriting crawling with crap camera work and abundant with awful acting franco regular lina taking the prize this time for her pitiful performance as an ailing elderly woman it is here in this hellish place that i finally stumbled upon diamonds of an abysmal jungle based exploitationer so stupefyingly bad that it took me three successive evenings to finish watching it br br tawdry and unrelentingly dull even by franco's standards this wearisome piece of trash fails on almost every level the story is a dreadfully dull derivative of edgar rice burrough's tarzan albeit with a feminine twist the film appears to have been filmed in the local gardens although grainy stock footage is poorly integrated into the film in a pointless effort to convince viewers that the action is really taking place in africa and the death scenes are virtually bloodless franco can usually be relied upon for some splatter but despite initial appearances this isn't a cannibal movie and it isn't that gory br br where the director does succeed however is in his casting of sexy young katja as jungle jail bait diana running and leaping through the in nothing but a skimpy loin cloth her curvaceous bod belying the fact that she was only sixteen at the time this nubile beauty makes quite an impression franco also throws in some further nudity courtesy of mari carmen as treacherous traveller lita who gives us a glimpse of her untamed regions and aline mess as topless warrior woman thus narrowly avoiding getting yet another rating of 1 10 from me although i'm sure he'll be receiving plenty more in the have loads of his films yet to see
<START> generally speaking i'm a an admirer of jess franco's film making but for some of this movies i really have difficulties understanding the motivation behind them or even their reason of existence like this sick puppy for example sadomania has absolutely no cinematic value it's poorly made without any sort of plot and featuring some of the most ill natured sleaze footage ever captured on film this is another filthy women in prison film where rape lesbian action and violent torture games are daily routine the guards are crazier than the prisoners and the institution is protected by an impotent governor who only gets sexually aroused when he spots a girl having sex with a dog the girls are all very beautiful and naked throughout the entire film yet you can't really enjoy this sight with all the perversion going on the dubious highlights include a barbaric hunting game you can guess what he prey is a duel to death between a guard and a prisoner and the image of a poor girl having a needle injected all the way through her nipple avoid this sick mess and you'll save yourself the trouble of taking two baths in order to wash the filth off
<START> rent this only movie if you're in the mood for laughs for sheer stupidity as this movie wouldn't scare a bunch of at a halloween party the trouble is there is too much gore for kiddies so definitely don't put this in your vcr for the toddlers it starts off with a little bit of promise giving you the impression that the box cover artist may have actually started watching this film before designing the cover but then descends quickly into epic stupidity the killer scarecrows are clumsy oafs that are about as scary as the one in the wizard of oz but not quite as smart if they'd only had a brain i got this movie for 1 20 at a local discount close out store and even so i feel somewhat ripped off i think with all the other comments posted here if you actually pay to see this you can only blame yourself
<START> i first saw this movie about 3 years ago i was shocked at how stupid the fbi was not to prevent such a tragedy it could have been easily prevented this movie was just unbelievable br br now seeing it after september 11th i am appalled and can say that this could have been prevented more easily that most people would want to know br br this film is 100 true br br in the final scene of the film when the mastermind of the 1st attack is being taken to prison by helicopter and flies over the towers he makes a spine chilling remark that was laughed at when he said it next time we'll bring them both down this was actually said by yousef after his arrest br br this movie reveals the shocking truth about how the first attacks were carried out right under the noses of the fbi and nypd it shows how the 1st and 4th are partially to blame for the attacks br br i watch this movie now and know that both attacks could have been prevented
<START> blake edwards' legendary fiasco begins to seem pointless after just 10 minutes a combination of the eagle has landed star oh what a lovely war and edwards' pink panther films darling lili never engages the viewer the aerial sequences the musical numbers the romance the comedy and the espionage are all ho hum at what point is the viewer supposed to give a damn this disaster wavers in tone never decides what it wants to be and apparently thinks it's a spoof but it's pathetically and grindingly square old fashioned in the worst sense audiences understandably stayed away in droves it's awful james garner would have been a vast improvement over hudson who is just cardboard and he doesn't connect with andrews and vice versa and both andrews and hudson don't seem to have been let in on the joke and perform with a miscalculated earnestness blake edwards' sob isn't much more than ok but it's the only good that ever came out of darling lili the expensive and professional look of much of darling lili only make what it's all lavished on even more difficult to bear to quote paramount chief robert evans 24 million dollars worth of film and no picture
<START> i have no idea who these others are but this movie is plain awful they have to prop up joe pesci when he is a minor character bait and switch movie just like the studios did with adam sandler and jim carrey etc the dvd i watched states this obscure gem revolves around joe pesci's mob character who is a hothead that start a war etc etc joe plays the part of joe he does not even carry a gun plays a character and gets spoiler whacked so much for the movie revolving around pesci the only halfway memorable scene was a bad attempt at comedy when they passed gas while waiting for a score if you watch this movie after reading this i warned you please stop and do not lose 87 minutes of your life
<START> first of all i must say that i love this film br br it was the first film that i saw from director micheal haneke and i was impressed that how good the direction was good br br haneke surely knows how to direct actors what i found intresting is also haneke's scenario at first you saw a woman who is very straight and seems to be a good piano teacher and very well loved and respected from everybody in her entourage then you realise that she has a mother who is a freak and is too much present in her life now you know that she is deranged that she has emotional problems but you don't know exactly what and then you fall into her dark side but her dark side is only reveal when a student fall in love with her she can't herself anymore br br the roles are very and difficult to play but isabelle huppert is marvellous in her role and she deserves the recognition she had at cannes festival benoit is very solid too but a little bit eclipse by huppert's performance br br there is one thing that i found strange in the scenario is how the character played by is not very credible he is too talented it is rare that a person is a piano virtuoso but pass the most of the his time to play hockey and study it think that it is a weak point but only a minor flaw br br i just saw the movie once so i can't do a very complete critic because i didn't the movie i like what i saw so i give the film a 8 5 10 br br oh yeah as for the end haneke showed that he really wanted to shock his audience a motivation that don't think is necessary to make movies but haneke does it with style and precision that is why his film is better than baise moi for example br br vince
<START> as an early representation of the turmoil of the 1960's that followed diane arbus nicole kidman can be excused as an early flower child the film itself deserves no such latitude the lack of character development motivation and justification for the character's behavior makes the movie very disappointing i sat watching and waiting for some explanation of the bizarre actions only to find that was letting me peek into a story that must have been someones inside joke that the few facts presented did not match diane life very much did not help to clarify things either br br the washed out art direction in diane's 'normal' life was nicely contrasted with the brilliant colors in her life with lionel and the trap door stairway was a nice demonstration of diane's attempt to inject her new life into her existing family however i don't see how that trap door in the ceiling of her dining room could directly connect to lionel's apartment which was two flights of stairs up from her's br br maybe my analysis is a little too literal in looking for some character development and relationship understanding that goes beyond one sentence or one comment i also would have liked to see at least one of diane's photos as well i won't wait for the sequel
<START> before i forget let me say the artwork in here is outstanding from garbage cans to the huge cruise ship the drawings are beautifully done if this wasn't animated critics would be the direction in here because it's really good br br to the story sylvester is picking through the garbage at the shipyards but the are slim while brooding at the dock next to a big ship in a he spots tweety in his cage tweety spots him too and you know his first comment the same one he always makes when he spots the cat anyway sylvester runs over opens the and says hello breakfast tweety slams the window on his face and says you bad old peeping tomcat the cat falls into the water br br the sylvester quickly sneaks back aboard ship into cabin grabs him and is ready to leave when wham there's granny at the door with her umbrella sylvester takes a beating as the old lady protects her pet bird once again but gibbet says granny i've dropped my glasses i can't see a thing without 'em heavens to where are those cheaters br br now sylvester has the upper hand and the normal cat trying to catch bird shenanigans are on again like granny's glasses sylvester's most clever act was to take her glasses and paint a picture of tweety on them so when she woke up and put them on she'd see the bird and think it was okay br br overall a very entertaining animated short that was a lot of fun to watch as you can tell by the quotes i love the dialog in some of these old cartoons
