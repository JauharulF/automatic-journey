<START> it's one of my favorite movies as much because of the location and music as the story line don't matter how many times i watch it it doesn't seem to ever get old i can almost say all the lines along with the characters now the movie is supper funny and really sweet
<START> director park chun wook returns with what must be one of the and at the same time most serious vampire flicks in movie history br br trusting the latest hollywood fad vampires these days are supposed to be rather asexual love lorn instead of the evil rampantly sexual blood sucking mind manipulating man beasts of yore this is the film you want to see if you want to remember the sticky thrills of the past well at least in the second half br br starts out with a lengthy character exposition culminating in a slightly different love story the vampire transformation of a priest is over quite some time sidelined by the romantic and sexual aspects of the story which makes for some awkward viewing but the last 40 minutes or so are surprisingly gory well maybe not so surprisingly if you know and 'i'm a cyborg but that's ok' but i guess it's fair to say that beats park's earlier films in terms of in your face violence br br all in all be warned that this is neither art cinema nor a horror flick it may be too disgusting for many and too tame for some is original entertaining and fortunately a little less weird than park chun earlier endeavors
<START> i saw this on a screener dvd a couple months before it was released br br i liked the main characters and the overall story but some scenes are pretty sloppy and confusing the sets were fitting but a few just looked like left overs from freaks geeks or reminded me of a cell phone commercial shot in a middle class home definitely not what the dvd cover claims destined to be the next stoner classic hardly br br wardrobe and hairstyles are done well and yes there are some really pretty girls in this always nice to see a good looking cast br br almost every scene contained guitar that just droned on and on sound design was a bit poor i think less would have been best
<START> ok this doesn't compare to the explosive tempo of the first part's opening sequence nor to its visual shock value nor for that matter to the melancholic suspense of the second installment no it's surprisingly and refreshingly different apart of course from the two main actors the tongue in cheek futuristic scenario drives the characters towards each other across genres and languages with an almost gravitational force the moment of impact conclusion is your choice of a shakespearean metaphor of life and humanity in a cartoon costume b sublimation of violence into homo c humorous detonation of an impossible buildup everything up to then is even less unequivocal br br highly recommended to indiscriminate movie buffs who don't mind following gras with a hot dog caution to those with more refined palates
<START> first the current imdb plot description seems to be misleading the movie is about a group of girls who pick up a misogynistic hitchhiker who plans to kill them all they stop at a small motel where he holds them hostage but develops an intense attraction for one of the girls violence ensues br br i picked this up by mistake thinking it was the other 2007 movie the hitcher not that the hitcher is any better and i was looking for a crummy movie to watch anyway but this was almost unbearable at times i think i could have vomited on a piece of paper and come up with a better plot than this br br i can't even count how many movies i've seen with virtually the same storyline so this was almost painfully predictable at times but what really made it awful were a few scenes that well let me give an example at one point a door is covered in what is very obviously blood and two police officers at the scene because of a 911 call are looking at it from 30 feet away see a man also covered in blood walk out of the door agree that it looks suspicious but decide to not investigate further br br but however ridiculous it may be the movie was never boring was well produced directed and acted complete with good special effects gratuitous nudity and violence i probably would not recommend actually spending 90 minutes of your life sitting down to watch this movie but it turned out to be perfect to have on while i cleaned my basement also highly recommended for fans of crummy movies and would be a good movie to watch with friends when you plan on doing more talking than watching
<START> this is a charming movie starring everyone's favorite cartoon chipmunks in this feature we follow the band of rodents on an unforgettable balloon race around the world although there are lows including an orphan penguin all in all it's a great family film
<START> shame to see an interesting story diluted into standard vietnam made for tv fare usually hbo movies are a substantial cut above tv bill paxton was a pretty good choice for the lead role but wasn't given much to work with
<START> i'm going to be generous here and give it a 3 only because i live in huntsville and it was great to see how well the city was filmed that said this movie was pretty bad it's like they started off with hardly any script and the director just told the actors to stare at each other meaningfully with a lot of music playing over it and billy d williams looked like he'd rather be anywhere but in this movie it's just a mess i think i could write a script better than the dislodge for this film and i'm no writer br br there is one thing i've seen mentioned throughout the reviews and message boards everyone is under the impression that the movie begins around world war 2 and actually it seemed more like it was supposed to start out in the late 1950's early 1960's while the military was not segregated by then i'm pretty sure that any troops waiting to board a train would still be segregated in a place like huntsville al if the beginning of film was supposed to be the 1940's then billy d lesley ann rae dawn would have to have been in the 70's and 80's instead of their mid 50's or early 60's br br don't waste your time unless you really really like the actors because the story isn't very interesting
<START> an atrocious offense to the memory and genius of welles this senseless assemblage of self indulgent improvisation on a grand theme should have been locked up in storage along with a number of other unfinished welles' projects no one has ever seen now we know why to add additional insult to prior injury the appalling english language dubbing by amateur america dubbing actors and even the great man himself only heightens all the sloppy mistakes in story telling and construction it's as if every weekend some good hearted spanish soul gave orson a few a 35mm camera and some short ends of negative film left over from some other production and told welles to drive out to the spanish countryside and just keeping shooting anything and everything until the film stock ran out it's true that if orson had really shaped this film himself instead the notorious jesus franco he might have thrown out 85 of what he shot but we will never know as welles never took the time to edit his own work here and somewhere along the way he or his heirs sanctioned someone else to do so he is not entirely blameless for the debacle those who wish to prove that in his early days welles was the luckiest of young men because he surrounded himself with the likes of john houseman herman greg bernard hermann and robert wise need no better proof of his adult inadequacies than this mess of a film in his sad old age welles was capable of doing anything when he needed a few bucks or including selling his artistic soul the devil certainly got his due with this one
<START> the movie was great and everything but there were a lot of mistakes in the soccer scenes i wonder if any of the guys who were working on the movie have ever seen a soccer match before first of all i don't understand how she wanted to try for the boys team in soccer boys and girls cant play in the same team and these are the rules and don't get me started on who when they found out that she was actually a girl they let her continue to play second of all players cant paint their faces with colours and play like that again rules not mine br br and don't get me started on the way they scored goals its was ridiculous completely unrealistic and all the players seemed like they didn't know jack about soccer br br and when duke was training viola why did they only concentrate on shooting what happened to passing and dribbling or was shooting her only problem and why the hell were all the posters on the wall in their room were for players from don't they like any other players from any other teams it was like this was the only team they know but other than that the movie was good and i enjoyed the rest of it just the training and the game scenes were unrealistic for me they really should have consulted some one a bout them
<START> killjoy 2 is the same as killjoy 1 bad acting bad characters annoying clown bad lines you name it honestly i'm not all that surprised that more people haven't seen this movie the only reason i watched killjoy 2 is because i wanted to think that the filmmakers learned from their mistakes they didn't this movie is just as bad if not worse than the first one that clown that goddamn clown i hate him i hate him so much and i don't hate him because he is a good villain i hate him because he is annoying beyond belief i hope that the filmmakers realized after trying and failing again that this movie is the last thing we need is a killjoy 3
<START> first a warning 'how to marry a comes prefaced by an apparently random five minute orchestral performance of 'street scene' a gershwin lite piece treated with the full pomp and ceremony of well gershwin sitting through it takes some patience if you have the dvd rest assured you can skip forward you won't miss anything br br the film itself is one of the perpetual disappointments of 50's hollywood a movie so bolstered by major star power opulent mise en scene and perfect high concept that failure seems inconceivable the title alone is perfect generation after generation however are forced to ask themselves how is this so limp the script is an albatross about the production's neck a dead smelling thing that chokes everything and everyone before they can really spark to life there are no comic situations just isolated moments that play for laughs whenever an actual comedy scene threatens to develop the movie quickly moves on to other less interesting things a case in point the scene where the three leading ladies each bring a date to the same fancy restaurant one of them short sighted refuses to wear her spectacles out of vanity one of the dates is married a classic hollywood farce set up surely complete with mistaken identity angry wife and probably a pie in the face for somebody well no instead we cut between the three dates as the ladies react to things their partners say hit the punchline and cut to the next limp joke if in doubt have marilyn walk into a wall where's billy wilder when you need him br br the three stars are almost a perfect diagram of the life cycle of the classic hollywood screen goddess this was one of marilyn monroe's breakout films and the camera just eats her up even though the script gives her nothing to do she's so luminescent she almost seems newly hatched lauren bacall on the other hand had been a major star for nearly a full decade and she knows how to dominate the screen even when in frame with monroe she gets the only thing passing for a real role and delivers the few good lines with a cynical snap given the right material she could have brought this thing to life she's a curiously ageless actress when she lies about her age in the film and claims to be forty it isn't instantly ridiculous and far less girlish than her co stars giving her a convincing authority betty grable was far from ageless and had a good eight years on her co stars putting her near the end of her hollywood career there's an air of desperation about her at times stranded on screen with nothing but a toothpaste smile and a few scraps of comic timing unable to play her real age but fooling no one as a contemporary of this new sharper generation of actresses relying on the same old schtick that had served her throughout her career for marilyn doubters seeing the two juxtaposed in this movie helps to throw monroe's subtlety and yes intelligence into sharp relief she's also lumbered with the dead wood in terms of male co stars although all of the men even the great william powell are guilty of lazy performances she's unable to strike any comic sparks off them better to have given her role to the under utilised monroe who could be funny all by herself and left grable with the repetitive mr magoo routine br br that the movie is as enjoyable as it is can be put down to the luscious hollywood production the sort that renders even the twee likes of 'by the light of the moon' watchable but somewhere buried beneath the flabby jokes and professionalism lies the rough outline of a sharp cynical comedy about the business of marriage that bacall could have made sing and new generations of movie viewers will sit down with 'how to marry a in expectation of that movie ready to be disappointed all over again
<START> one of the most boring movies i've ever seen three immature young people have sex and talk about very little except their love of each other they don't seem to be interested in much but each other and only passively so i was left feeling shut out most of the exterior scenes take place at night so one can't even enjoy well lit sights of paris i gave up after an hour and ten minutes
<START> this film is about xavier an erasmus exchange student from paris who spends one year in barcelona during that time under the influence of all the new impressions he changes and grows upon return he has a much clearer view on his life and finally takes it into his own hands br br this is one of the most moving films i've ever seen and the reason is probably that i've been in a very similar situation i'm from germany not from france and for me it was madrid not barcelona but i can assure you that this film is a completely accurate depiction of what an erasmus semester in spain will do to you from what i hear the story is autobiographic and that's probably why it is so realistic br br let me give some examples mild spoiler alert xavier shares a flat with other students from italy denmark germany belgium spain and england the flat looks exactly like all the erasmus shared flats i've seen in madrid the main characters are nicely developed and some funny scenes arise from the usual stereotypes the spanish landlord is also 100 accurate the story of xavier and his girlfriend martine who remained in paris is also very typical about 90 of all relationships break up during an erasmus semester or shortly thereafter there's a wonderful scene in which xavier tries to convince wendy his flatmate from england who is kind of uncool to go out with all the others he finally succeeds and wendy probably has the night of her life br br another great thing in this film is that it's truly the students in the flat speak spanish or english and xavier speaks french with his mother and girlfriend there are subtitles so that everyone can understand what's being said i surely hope that this film never gets dubbed anywhere br br i can imagine that for non erasmus people this is simply an entertaining comedy but for all my fellow erasmus i can only say this is your film if you haven't seen it do so but be prepared for some feelings of nostalgia br br 10 10
<START> i went to see this movie at a book signing in lexington ky last night after a wonderful night that consisted of a few brief words with mr bruce campbell you have to say it all not just bruce or mr campbell d friends while the books were being signed and a session with our favorite killer the lights dimmed br br so as not to spoil anything i wont go into detail but i loved the movie mr bruce campbell did a wonderful job keeping the classic b movie feel the characters were classic 'b' characters the place was refreshing what movies do you know of that are based in bulgaria and the setting was both near original and fun on top of that the humor that is throughout the movie that kept the audience laughing through much of the movie br br while this movie dosen't have as great of a general appeal to people as some it is a beacon of fun and laughter in a season of as mr bruce campbell put it 'b movies' that are listed as 'a movies' bewitched dukes of hazard charlie and the chocolate factory come on guys
