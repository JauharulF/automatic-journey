<START> i rented this tv movie version of and out of my library last thursday and simply could not believe my eyes where should i begin no effort was made to make the play look remotely like it was about the trojan war all the actors were wearing elizabethan dress moreover most of the actors were too old and horribly miscast with his white beard looked older than nestor was at least 30 hector looked like a spanish pirate ajax was badly played anyway and was a transvestite br br likewise the action is poor the duel between ajax and hector is short and amateurish the camera angle focuses more on face so we can only see what is going on in the background which is frustrating in itself nor is the at the end given it's due respect we do not see and fight nor anyone else for that matter paris and menelaus just seem to mud wrestle in front of even death was omitted all this was a major disappointment considering i waded through a very dull 2 and a half hours of bbc costume drama to get to that point br br nonetheless it wasn't all bad i thought the incredible orlando as and john as hector were well played even if they didn't look quite right i'd say the same about kenneth haigh as achilles since he didn't have the striking countenance and was a bit dry at times spoiler the climax at the end the death of hector was perhaps the best part of the film achilles' dialogue here is excellent and sums up the attitude of a cold seasoned murderer however the gruesomeness of the scene when achilles stamps on what was head sets it apart anyway br br charles gray as was delightful as a sleazy old pervert and i thought the actress playing did an ok job the war mongering however was annoying and i think that the play would have been better perhaps if he had been murdered by achilles instead of a like hector br br conclusion ok but could have been better if it had had a younger cast and costumes that at least attempted to look ancient not to mention the lack of action 5 10
<START> don't you just hate them slashers that never seem to get started it sometimes takes them a full hour of lame red herrings before some real action takes place tourist trap isn't like that if it's typically gruesome slashing you want than it's typically gruesome slashing you'll get plenty of it and constantly from start to finish this movie contains what is probably the greatest opening sequence in 80's horror cinema when a teenager on a stroll after engine trouble is trapped in a deserted house and assaulted by a creepy collection of wax statues four other lambs to the slaughter arrive at the house and encounter an utterly insane maniac that looks somewhat like a mixture of leatherface from texas chainsaw massacre and one of those mad from old wax museum movies tourist trap is exciting horror entertainment with some genuine suspense grisly images ultimate weirdness morbid humor and terrific make up effects the plot twists aren't always original and the acting is pretty lousy but seriously who cares the fast pacing and the groovy killer icon caused this tourist trap to earn a spot amongst my 5 favorite slashers a bit surprising is the total lack of nudity though too bad because all the girls look ravishing and after only 10 minutes the obligatory line who needs a bathing suit is spoken
<START> much of the commentary on this board revolves around debating the validity of some comparison to r dogs made on the dvd cover forget about all of that this film er home movie is utterly horrendous how can anyone with a shred of credibility claim this as being 10 10 there is no plot none i couldn't believe that i spent money to rent this more on that later and that i had fooled myself into believing that this based on box cover art and some sort of film fest award blurb had potential the only thing i do really remember was that unbelievably one of the annoying main characters was supposedly offed with a bullet to the head and he ends up surviving the wound and making it to the final credits alive wow and killers has a sequel double wow br br true story i actually was in so much denial that i had wasted my money and life force on this rental that i kept the videotape for what must've been six months i kept telling myself that it never actually happened the video on top of the tv was an illusion a mental symbol of my self loathing after someone pointed out that is was indeed real and that i needed to get a grip i decided that i couldn't just leave it there i thought how many others have i denied the suffering of sitting through the viewing of this masterpiece by hoarding killers all to myself i had to do the right thing and return it back to the hell from which it came br br so as i imagine most of the populous of imdb would do in a similar situation i mustered up some major courage and drove to the video store at 2am after making sure that no one was around i got out of my car still running of course slipped the movie into the drop box slot and booked the hell out of there never to return br br i guess i expected that some goons from hollywood video corporate would come looking for me the bill must've racked up to something like 1 67 by that time so i moved away from the area however coincidently much like the killers storyline nothing ever happened
<START> i love the book it's full of passion romance tension and the movie drags along taking two spunky stars with it kylie minogue was already a major star in australia having starred in neighbours and releasing her first single the decision to cast her in the delinquents was surely a marketing ploy for me it didn't pay off br br kylie may have been great in neighbours but she was far too sweet and innocent to play the feisty lola and she wasn't of asian descent as lola was charlie schlatter was an excellent brownie but there was no chemistry between him and kylie br br by and large the movie was boring it dragged on it lacked the passion of the book it focused heavily on kylie and in general was completely disappointing
<START> i knew full well when i rented this dvd that it could very well be one of the worst movies i've seen in my life but to say that it was one of the worst movies i've ever viewed would be putting it lightly i'm wondering if there isn't some legal action that can be taken against the individuals that allowed this film to produced i mean the financing had to come from somewhere someone had to put up money for this to be produced br br i'd pinpoint several production values that led to the failure of this film but this film violated every production standard in the universe i couldn't make it thru the entire movie as i started getting dizzy the from horrendous filming techniques i also can't tell you how many scenes i just ended off during because of the inexplicably horrific dialog br br i feel like i've been permanently scarred for life if you viewed this movie before getting this warning you should think about starting a support group with me for the poor people who did view this monstrosity
<START> there is a version of nevsky that is shown with a live symphony orchestra chorus soloist and the movie if it's ever performed within a day's travel of you see nevsky done that way the oklahoma city philharmonic did it with the choir one of the finest anywhere a couple of years ago i think i cried through the whole thing it was one of the most emotionally powerful movie experiences of my life i'm listening to nevsky on the radio right now and it still tears me up there are movies that i love and classical music pieces i love but there is no combination i can think of that comes close to the impact of nevsky performed in real time
<START> i really liked the idea of traveling between dimensions and i even liked the wade quinn tension in early episodes some of the worlds they created gave the main characters extremely interesting backdrops for their stories however as the show went on there were more silly disputes among the friends and less of a true bond there was less wonder and excitement when they were involved in other worlds and more condescension and every world had one of the characters falling in love the writing just got boring and everything was way too over the top too bad it would've been nice to have a closely knit band of friends a la star wars traveling to different dimensions on tv for several years rather than a tired band of knit pickers
<START> 42 100 often referred as tarzan with clothes on but it's not at all in the same league as his far superior tarzan series basically the jungle jim series became a tarzan replacement for johnny weismuller after he started getting too out of shape for a loincloth in jungle jim he is fully clothed it can't compare to the tarzan series in any way not in acting screenplays or quality of production it's pretty hokey stuff this one is the first the best in the series and that isn't saying much too much stock footage is used and it is so obvious the score is overdone and the plot is lame and the production is so poor it makes it hard to watch at times
<START> i rented this movie because the dvd cover made it look like it was going to be a ridiculous college comedy like van wilder or animal house i took it to my friend house to watch for movie night we ended up stopping it 15 minutes into the film and watched copper mountain instead i don't know if any of you have seen copper mountain but it isn't great either however i would have to say that the alan thick jim carrey duo made it a more enjoyable watch br br i later finished puddle cruiser this movie was slow and the humor was forced this movie reminded me of some stinkers that i saw in some of my earlier production classes in college i was left wondering was this the film that enabled broken lizard to make supertroopers also how could this movie suck so bad supertroopers was good and club dread was decent don't see this movie
<START> when i found out there was a christmas vacation 2 i couldn't wait to buy the dvd i sent off my money and watched it as soon as it came through the letter box i love all the national lampoons films with chevy chase in it and i bet he was glad he wasn't in this one i couldn't believe how bad this was you would think it was impossible not to laugh at a national lampoons film but believe me it is this film probably looked like a good idea on paper having cousin eddie as the main character he started to get on my nerves from early on in the film and became totally unfunny by the middle of the film and by the end of the film i had gone brain dead and couldn't remember what had happened
<START> sorry for any spoilers that this contains but if you want to read on anyway i really wonder why so many people are so high on kevin williamson let's just take a quick look at his work as a screenwriter shall we there's scream 1 and 2 plus the story for the next one which i think are pretty funny but very overrated besides by making scream into a franchise it ceased to become a parody of horror movies and simply became another one then there's i know what you did last summer which is essentially the same movie again he co wrote halloween h20 but even he had the sense not to take credit for what he did on that monstrosity then comes the faculty which i can only say was god awful lots of fun to make fun of though don't even get me started on the ridiculous soap operatic dawson's creek i could rail about how bad that is for hours so then we get to teaching mrs tingle first of all there are tons of little implausibilities in this one for example in most high schools that i know of the valedictorian is not the only one who gets to go to college this idea that katie holmes's character would never go anywhere unless she was valedictorian was absurd haven't you ever heard of financial assistance damn it also i don't think you get expelled from high school or don't get into college because of cheating on one test there are a bunch of other ones but i'll skip to the big one now the ending really bothered me they committed a crime but it was ok because the teacher was a bitch great do you know how many of my teachers i could kidnap based on that logic i'm sure the police never took any statements to find out the whole story either that sure wouldn't be necessary helen mirren was good she added some nice flair to a character who as a previous commenter noted had no reason for anything she did and has anyone else noticed that katie holmes absolutely can't act her self righteousness became incredibly annoying you wanted me to fail blah blah blah her last two scenes with mrs tingle were the worst the only reason i don't regret losing 8 25 on this disaster is because she got beaten up a bit no wait i do regret losing the money it wasn't real and she survived mr williamson if you're reading this you've made the same movie some violence and or scary stuff offset by wise ass kids who make sarcastic jokes and references to other movies just a few too many times now i count 6 so for not including scream 3 and whatever follows it and i would really appreciate it if you would stop otherwise i might just have to kidnap you and threaten you with a crossbow ok
<START> the worst part about this film is that it did not have to be so terrible br br they had a nice budget though so do many films they made it look slick and pretty and best of all they had the 21st century lesbian savvy audiences who would embrace a lesbian positive film and yet the writer and director went out of their way to lift every single redone film bit about lesbian torment and confusion at boarding schools you know the place all lesbian love lives and dies br br this is a theme that has been done again and again and again in film but something that viewers if one uses this voting forum as a clue cannot seem to get enough of br br every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through the lead characters say it all the crazy abandoned genius rebel lesbian tough girl well they took a super pretty femme like piper perabo and tried to rough her up but it didn't stick much seduces pretty rich girl who is destined to betray her br br watching them every step of the way is character 3 a dopey well meaning wide eyed good girl observer i say 'every step' because she shares her every thought with the audience via the stiffest most inane monologues br br her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk hearing them make love with their noises was um you know like well okay she says about her 2 wanton roommates who roll around in the bed next to her br br later she asks graham greene the accomplished native american actor who is completely wasted in a roll as a gardener is it wrong to care what people think br br sorry but is she a teenager or is she age 7 br br granted piper perabo as polly the tortured dyke others do an okay job for the horrible lines they are forced to utter perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera she would do well in a decent project so this is in no way a criticism of the acting br br but this story is shameless in perpetuating every single stereotype about lesbians all rolled into one character they couldn't stop with her polly being an angry crazy passionate secret genius who finished math problems for the speechless teacher oh but that's after she argues with the teacher who dares accuse her of gabbing br br that's a word they males use against us women she says stomping out of the classroom br br is this all the writer could come up with or maybe we should ask why stop there br br poole and co went on and made polly a poetic dark child who communicates with wild hawks by screaming their name in the woods br br cue the slow motion sci fi xena atmosphere br br then we have her writing to her birth mother most lesbians are love starved orphans in case you were in the dark br br then we have two teachers one uptight one a zany type with loose neck ties who hover around all of the action the school looks awfully big for just 2 teachers and give dark child seductress bird girl tense looks hmmmm i wonder if something well you know um funny is happening between these two teachers br br there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done heartbreak happens but surely the writer and director know that lesbians exist in much more sophisticated times than this schlock br br i cannot reveal the ending out of respect to those who force themselves to sit through til the end but if you are not laughing i can only guess you are crying and not for the right reason and i don't mean the wimpy make out scenes
<START> with all of the r movies out today it's hard to find something you can take the whole family to see my kids loved it it was good clean fun i would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to take the whole family out for a nice evening at the movies
<START> minor plot spoilers ahead br br how did such talented actors get involved in such mindless retreaded br br drivel robert deniro plays a dumb hollywood version of the standard br br violence prone tough cop i e he beats up the bad guys and rolls his br br eyes at cops who prefer to stick by the book and eddie murphy plays a br br not so tough cop who would rather be an actor i e he screams out br br freeze police and has his tough look down pat naturally they br br are partnered when bobby's loose cannon tactics get him in hot water br br with the media and he is essentially blackmailed into starring in a br br cops like reality show take a breath cuz that's as funny as it br br gets br br no energy was put into the script it feels like a pale retread of br br every copy buddy movie tossed into a blender with 15 minutes starring br br yes deniro himself as pretty much the character he is playing here br br the jokes fall flat the action feels listless and no one seems to be br br having a good time it's dead on the screen br br please don't waste your time even if you have an affinity br br for one of the actors avoid it and do them a favor if this br br makes money these kinda of scripts will be perfectly acceptable br br for actors of their quality br br and to mr deniro you used to make serious films i remember them br br they were good you were nominated for awards for them remember how br br much fun that was now after analyze this which was good meet the br br parents which was also good and the adventures of rocky and br br bullwinkle which was not good i think we need to see you parodying br br yourself less and being yourself more casino feels like a long time br br ago and no i don't count 15 minutes as serious bobby anyone who br br took that media satire seriously must get their weekly world news
<START> received this dvd from the accent range which is a label which specializes in art house flics they released irreversible and a range of bergman's opus br br the thing that struck me about alex strangely titled film modern love is that it is an impeccable film that breathes with perfection and vision a film that takes us into the mind of mr joe average replete with voices in the head visions and madness it's set in rural redneck australia the film doesn't trivialise or praise the folks like so many australian movies ie our films are full of loveable rogues or people with hearts of gold etc etc etc br br not in this film the spirit of stanley kubrick looms large here it's not flawless but has a mesmerising attention to details a romantic streak and a mood that is bracing if not embraceable br br minor quibbles the transfer looks faulty front credits were sliced they don't fit in frame br br also one of the short films is corrupted it stops half way
