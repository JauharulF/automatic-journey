<START> i'm a big fan of the first critters movie the second episode is good but it's not as good as the first critters the third episode is a little bit boring but lovely and what is this what a crap it's stupid and really really boring it's the worst of the series i can't watch it again because i felt asleep at the first watch and evil side that's one of the most horribble moments of the movie in the first 50 minutes we can't see the little furry monsters that's the reason why the audience fell asleep at the beginning of the movie br br it could have been much better br br 2 10
<START> all the pro comments about this movie claim that the movie is balanced that is their main justification to give a high rate to the movie but a movie is not balanced when the main perpetrator analyzed is given the last world in every single subject the director herself admitted to this at the first san francisco film festival showing she justified it by saying that she couldn't waste the chance of having access to that might be true but by showing so much of take on the issues makes the movie clearly pro and unbalanced i dare any of the other commentators to prove this wrong tips 1 claiming harvard professors intellectuals and latin american diplomats agree with you does not help your argument use logic tip 2 disagreeing with the director doesn't help your argument either the director says she thinks is charismatic and patriotic and therefore she portrayed him that way
<START> we saw la last night the chicago international film festival we were both immensely moved by it this is a haunting tale of loneliness missed connection in which the longing for intimacy conflicts with our fear of revealing too much about ourselves to another the three leads as valeria brigitte as flavia andrea as massimo are all excellent and the dynamic between them is very surprising br br after all the movies which older women it's wonderful to see flavia who is a law professor at a university in rome presented as beautiful sensual as well as seductive powerful we're conditioned to believe that when a younger woman enters 'the mix ' the older woman will become jealous of the younger woman the man will leave the older woman for the younger woman etc etc in this film however emotional truth is considerably more complex highly recommended
<START> this movie is a fascinating drama about the making of a movie the actor and the actress really can't stand each other but we build up to a scene in which they are to have sex she for the first time per script the actress shows little emotion on or off camera in the plot aside from she is freezing in the early scenes on a beach the actor is self absorbed and increasingly defies the direction of the director jeanne i could not help being drawn in to the drama of 'how are these two possibly going to act their way thru a sex scene ' that drama in itself becomes more exciting than the actual nudity and foreplay performed for the cameras not that mesquida isn't lovely and worth seeing naked however there is a pretty young stage hand who walks thru a few scenes as an extra i think that is her in the far left edge of one of the pictures 2 of 9 here in imdb i don't even know if this girl is credited but when she walks by fully dressed of course in confident indifference with her short blonde hair she is sexy who is this girl
<START> one of my favorite movies i like horses i like happy endings and i like walter matthau i miss him and am glad to have a great film like this to remind me why he was so wonderful watch it with your kids or your horse br br the story of an old hard boot horse trainer with kids and down on his luck if you have ever had or appreciated horse racing you will appreciate the rags to riches storyline it may be a little below but not a lot the story is the same one except it is the quarter horse version well acted correct racing terms and equipment and nice racing scenes don't take my word for it get it and make up your own mind
<START> i'm the type of guy who loves hood movies from new jack city to baby boy to season from the b grade to the hollywood but this movie was something different i am no hater and this movie was kinda enjoyable but some bits were just weird well the acting wasn't to good compared to the shockers performance in hot boyz quite good and ice t in new jack and svu great the scene where corrupt ice t kills the wanna be jamaican dude he says something and lights himself on fire burning both ice t and the other dude this kills the jamaican however ice t is unharmed very similar to ice's other movie urban menace which stars both of these actors were snoops character is supernatural however after this there is nothing suggested that corrupt is like a demon when mj gets stabbed at first he struggling but after that he fights normally and was stabbed in the thigh with out blood and when mj confesses killing a cop cos the cop was beating up his friend benny was weird benny isn't introduced in this movie and the scene isn't in the film it does hold weight to the fact why corrupt wants to kill mj but is still makes u scratch your head wen jody writes a letter to miss jones character explaining what happened to them afterwords doesn't mention what happen 2 other main characters mj and lisa the film did show the horror and poverty of the ghetto which plagues the lives of latinos and blacks word wide was a good part of the film even though the clip of the projects was re used thousands of times and the scene where miles kills the latino brother by crashing his bike at full speed not wearing a helmet and running into my latino brothers car would of killed him the movie was similar to the film urban menace and half the actors were in both of these movies as well as the production team it was ok tho but me being from poverty i love hood films however if u don't love em like i do don't watch it only thing saving me from walking out is it reminded me of the first movie i made which was made with 100 dollars and my love of the genre br br nathaniel
<START> hello people br br i cannot believe that shades from that thing you do took this role i don't think cory feldman would have taken this role this movie was a fuming pile of dung save your money and time and see every one of the top 250 i swear i wanted to slap the lady at blockbuster silly for permitting me to rent this stay away br br mr

<START> i accept that most 50's horror aren't scary by today's standards but what the hell is this when you see a title like this you expect to see blood and a blood thirsty beast instead we get no blood at all and a beast who either wants to take over the world or live in peace on earth yeah which is what the people wanted br br the overall story is fine with the astronaut coming back to life and being one with the beast but the title really kills the movie night of the beast would have made the fans more happy because there really isn't any blood to speak of br br i like how the 50's movies had endings that left room for a sequel but wisely never made one this movie isn't the worst i've ever seen but its almost up there br br 2 out of 10
<START> hypothetical situations abound one time director harry ralston gives us the ultimate post apocalyptic glimpse with the world dead left in the streets in the stores and throughout the landscape sans in the middle of a forgotten desert one lone survivor attempting to rekindle his sanity takes food from the city to his bungalow in this desert all alone he hopes for more but with nobody around he is left with white underwear and a passion for a local indian tribe Â until the discovery of a camera which opens up new doors and breaks the barriers of human co existence alan a man of the book is left on earth after an unknown disaster thinking he is alone he begins living life his way Â until jeri ryan appears like she would in any dream out of the woods disheveled and unhappy to find the final man alive to be well like alan anyway they try to co exist fail get drunk and before creating the ultimate dystopia they run into redneck raphael played by newcomer Â dan montgomery jr bonds are torn confusion sets in a couple becomes a third wheel and the battle between physically inept nerd vs brainless jock even with nobody left on the planet it becomes a truth that even the darkest of human nature will arise br br using a variable film technique ralston gives us a mediocre story based loosely on another film entitled the quiet earth which i will be viewing next oddly which he never gives any credit towards with a borrowed story i guess he does a decent job of it his punch seems to be lacking at the beginning while ralston tries to find his stride borrowing yet again from other film director's techniques to attempt to find his own he opens the film interestingly enough but fails to answer any direct answers sure the final days have arrived but could there be a concise answer as to how or better yet why these select few survived a beginning would have led us stronger into a comical film the juxtaposition would have been like shawn of the dead but instead left us feeling like we were watching a made for tv program listening to the audio commentary i have respect for ralston because he worked diligently to get this film made and his passion nearly sells the film but you could tell from his interaction with the cast that he wasn't as happy with his overall final product there were mistakes ones that he pointed out and others that he was ashamed to point out while this does make for decent independent film making it sometimes feels cheap and in case it was the latter br br i must admit david portrayal of alan hooked me he played that wimpy school nerd adult role very well he was funny to both watch and listen to and thus he became sympathetic to the viewer he was a key player in keeping the film together alas i cannot say the same for the rest this was dan montgomery's first film and it was obvious Â i mean Â really really obvious there were scenes in which i thought the cue card was about to come out and read the lines for him perhaps even giving us a more realistic performance but alas it wasn't the case then there was jeri ryan she pulled into her character near the end of the film which to me was the culmination of the entire piece of art she goes from estranged unknown to bitter cranky insane girlfriend by the end confused again she fell into her character by the end giving us just a glimpse of what she could have probably done as her acting matured even as the commentary progressed all that she contributed was a laugh giggle or ohhh look at that color moment while her beauty may sell tickets one may want to consider knowledge to be just as beautiful this was her first film so can i be too harsh br br overall this film felt like it was missing something i though the idea was strong Â the premise that even with only a peppering of people remaining on the earth the evil of human nature still exists jealousy cannot be killed by bacteria or bombs maybe because it is consumed by and we as a race will always want what we cannot have ralston is not a surprising director his techniques are flawed and pre used but he does know how to make a low budget comedy i think our idea of funny is different so that is why i couldn't find myself laughing at many of the bits he found hysterical his actors provided the level of acting needed for this film which was lower than average his film was loose meaning that there were elements never quite explained or tackled i e anything with wings survived which overall harmed the intensity of the film this was a comedy but it could have been much darker and much much funnier for those thinking that roger avery was a huge element to this film as we learn from their commentary all he was there for was money Â the was in essence the bank for the last man don't get your hopes up for any classic avery moments br br don't expect more from ralston Â and that is how i will end it br br grade out of
<START> alright so this episode makes fun of al gore i'm sure it pisses a few liberals off the thing is south park makes fun of everybody much like the simpsons did if you get offended that a politician you like is made fun of then maybe you need a better sense of humor and are taking the show too seriously with that being said this episode is hilarious and one of the best al gores portrayal is hilarious scheme goes terribly wrong and the results will have you rolling on the floor laughing it is basically everything you would ever want out of a south park episode and it is easily one of my favorites i'll won't comment too much further on the plot because i don't want to give anything away
<START> i think it is saying something that the bollywood bride and prejudice stayed more faithful to the source material than this 2005 hollywood version did i also laughed more at the bollywood version mr priceless if you have read the book or seen the 1995 bbc version and liked them you will be in for a nasty surprise going in to this film then my friend however who had seen neither was mildly amused by the film if you are a jane austen purist though or even a film goer who dislikes historical inaccuracies it will be painful to sit through this br br ugh the script the script was the biggest problem i imagine the actors wouldn't have fared half so badly if they'd had a decent script perhaps penned by somebody who actually loved austen's work br br what were committed well you'll be forced to endure such incredulous lines as don't you dare judge me lizzy and leave me alone for once in your lives not only are such lines far from anything that could come from jane austen's eloquent pen but can anyone honestly believe words like that spilling from the mouth of a genteel young lady from the regency era the usage of modern colloquialisms is one of the many irritating ways that the screenwriter butchers the book the writer also decided to give characters lines that in the book were said by a completely different characters and all for no apparent purpose worse of all when they do try to stick a bit closer to the book's writing the screenwriter has a nasty and unnecessary habit of rearranging austen's phrases and substituting awkward synonyms for her already perfect words it was as if the screenwriter sat down with the book in one hand and a thesaurus in the other when writing the script stick to austen's words she did it better than you i assume all of this was done in a revisionist spirit and in an effort to distance this film from the iconic 1995 bbc version however for me it also made a travesty of the true spirit of austen's most beloved work br br the casting did have potential though it was quickly dashed away once the script kicked in but keira giggling excessively and baring your crooked teeth does not equal charm and and i think mr though i find him tolerably handsome enough his script and was under the impression he was playing heathcliff and not the formidable mr darcy i really did enjoy brenda blethyn kelly reilly and the actor who played mr collins their interpretations were really rather refreshing br br oh but donald sutherland somebody described his performance as seeming like a hobo who had accidentally wandered onto the movie set and i must say it is an apt description and can somebody tell me why they fashioned after legolas though he was in the movie for under two minutes i daresay and without his impressive archery skills to perk up the movie br br on a wardrobe note i would kill for miss bingley's dresses because they were sumptuous and would fit in more with the modern century a sleeveless regency evening gown please more versace than austen that is sure and poor keira all of the budget went to her salary and not her wardrobe oh and i'm sure they eventually caught the bastard who stole the one from the movie set unfortunately they didn't catch him soon enough to comb the actresses' tresses before filming rolled br br in short with this new hollywood version bid adieu to austen's eloquence subtlety and wit because you'll be getting the complete opposite
<START> this is not a serious film and does not pretend to be but it is not as bad as some of its reviews it's title and the first ten minutes lead you to expect br br the plot is very silly but this adds to the light hearted fun and enthusiasm which runs through the film the characters are played sympathetically and while they do engage in typical teenage angst they generally avoid the sickly sentimentality usually to be found in this film genre br br unusually set in london sympathetic to geeks this is well worth a watch if it happens to be on if you want some tongue in cheek silliness and don't mind suspending your disbelief
<START> if the ending hadn't been so fantastically unexpected i don't think i could rate this movie so well br br this movie has a lot of uncomfortable distressing marriage falling apart character interaction that sort of thing is not my kind of drama so the pace seemed to drag for me br br in addition the main characters are difficult to relate to and thus care much about the husband alan rickman is rather bitter and cranky and the wife polly walker is aloof and a little haughty the acting was just fine norman reedus was very alluring but the characters themselves were perhaps a little too realistically flawed for me br br the setting was nice and appropriately isolated and a little spooky the cinematography had something to it that seemed a little old fashioned to me somehow br br but the last 5 15 minutes of this movie are so ingenious that every uncomfortable scene awkward conversation and inexplicable character behavior absolutely worth it i guessed every typical plot twist except the one that occurred br br the ending definitely makes this movie worth watching the intrigue and the drama not quite as much
<START> often considered argento's last great film this entry into the giallo canon is unquestionably better than any argento film that has followed it though i have yet to see mother of tears but to call it his last great film might be stretching it a bit br br the directorial and stylistic flourishes the hallmark of all argento films is indeed present with some of his sequences of suspense ranking up with his best the peephole sequence is especially memorable and the cinematography by ronnie taylor is outstanding the fluorescent lighting is beautiful br br however the narrative which is hit and miss in all of argento's films is missing here there is indeed a potent sense of mystery and intrigue but the plot resorts to what is essentially a string of murder sequences with one following the another leaving no real time to fully construct a right focused mystery to be solved all of this results in a climax that is well anti climatic as the film did not invest enough interest to make us truly care br br regardless this is recommended simply due to the masterful direction and beautiful imagery that argento evokes i wouldn't' recommend this as a starting point for argento's films however for that i would recommend either deep red or suspiria but if you enjoyed those or even any giallo then this is a very good addition to your viewing repertoire
