<START> it is sad that schwarzenegger was the best thing about this production especially considering the fact that he had not yet come into his own and was still as stiff as cardboard in his dialog delivery br br actually this isn't as bad as some critics say but it isn't good either it is amusing and does play like a poor country cousin of the conan line making it a conflicted uneven poor work and speaking of poor the quality is terrible due to the era in which this was filmed but that is not the only reason br br the story herein is inferior even to the conan line but moreover it loses itself in the red sonja must be dominated by big strong schwarzenegger ploy and entirely forgets its purpose if it ever had one br br it's entertaining but in a low budget guilty pleasure b kind of way br br it rates a 4 2 10 from br br the fiend
<START> i first saw this in the theater in 1969 when i was 9 and immediately fell in love with it i'm sad that sony has not seen fit to release this on dvd but one day one day i recently obtained a vhs copy of this on ebay and sat down to watch it 39 years later i'm happy to report it still stands the test of time the acting is spot on john williams' orchestrations are lush and leslie songs memorable when i am older you and i fill the world with love london is london are just a few of the standouts and not enough can be said about peter o' toole clarke michael redgrave and michael acting terence rattigan deserves an a for his update of the james hilton story there really is nothing not to like about this film it's a good cheer me up selection glad they have released the original soundtrack as a three cd set with lots of extras wish sony would hurry up and do the same with the film
<START> this film was not great cinema but definitely a good film to see with your family especially children from 10 15 there are good topics of discussion brought up in this movie such as bullies the environment and working to make things right jimmy music was a plus and the scenery was wonderful the young actors were excellent and this is a movie i would expect to see on the family channel or the hallmark channel except for a few words in the dialog a middle school could show this film to start discussions in the classroom hopefully it will be shown in drive ins this summer so that more people get to see it it did follow carl book well and it was fun to see him in a cameo performance
<START> well let me put it this way i have always been one of the hardcore brothers i've always loved rock music and especially heavy metal that's why this movie is like a gift from god i believe this movie is one of the best movies ever well except from neverending story and star wars of course it's great to hear all the classics like long live rock and roll dio ted nugent songs by jon bon deep purple ac dc and several other legendary rock bands heavenly absolutely gorgeous wonderful i hope they will make more movies like this otherwise it's just crap movies like that ac in da usa or what they call it and 8 miles bulls well i strongly recommend this anyway everything i'm missing is a couple of songs but except from that it's one of the best movies ever ten out of ten
<START> jack lemmon was one of the finest actors that had ever graced the screen he could effortlessly switch from dramatic roles to comedic with ease making most of his peers green with envy while his performance in save the tiger is oscar worthy i feel it was given to him as he had missed out on his other opportunities to win the award due to other better roles that had preceded this current one br br this is also one of those pretentious movies that comes out to basically showcase the talent of the cast or in this case one particular member it's too bad the screenwriter's output didn't match that of lemmon's don't waste your time with this one
<START> david suchet is agatha christie's mustached detective hercule poirot in after the funeral produced in 2005 anyone who has heard david suchet speak with his own british accent knows what a shock it is because his accent as poirot is so perfect and organic to the character suchet is the poirot of agatha christie's books and although i confess a love for peter ustinov in the role his portrayal doesn't have that much to do with what christie wrote br br in this episode poirot is asked by a solicitor friend to investigate the possible murder of one of his clients on the train the solicitor recounts the events after the death a strange will the expected heir and the pronouncement of the man's sister that he was murdered when poirot meets the family he discovers adultery lots of secrets another will and murder br br the story is excellent with rich production values and a wonderful detailed depiction of the time period all of the acting is superb particularly from monica dolan who plays miss gilchrist poirot here is without hastings his beautiful office or miss lemon but he's effective nonetheless br br i had the privilege of seeing david suchet on broadway in amadeus breathtaking what an actor when he's playing poirot all i see is poirot
<START> my wife and i couldn't even finish the film truly it was rather painful br br first the historical accuracy is compromised not so much by the events themselves as the ridiculous one dimensionality of the characters for instance augustus takes the burden of power only with great reluctance indeed he is portrayed as if he's some sort of great humanist and believer in democracy br br second the camp my lord the dialog is horrifically bad i recall the soap opera my mother watched when i was a child having better dialog than this the constant exposition and pontificating grates upon the ears like fingernails on chalkboard ugh okay i exaggerate a bit but the dialog truly is bad the hbo series rome is superior for no other reason than that its characters were at least believable regardless of their historicity br br rome was also wise enough to know they couldn't stage epic battle scenes the creators of this film did not when caesar attacks the battle scene is practically farcical br br i will grant that the costumes are perfectly good the sets are fine though their cgi backdrops can be a bit jarring at times the sound is bad in terms of the music the foley work and the dubbing of so many of the side characters br br anyway it's completely not worth renting as a history major i was hoping for an alternative approach to augustus than hbo's rome which i feel failed to capture his overall feel quite as well as they did caesar or antony instead i should have just stuck to my reading
<START> both jackie and candice are terrific in this movie they are well suited to their roles and have several chances to shine in particular the way candice pronounces the words puerto rican is very funny as she is being kind as she can be but condescending at the same time i had seen the original of this movie called old acquaintance starring bette davis and miriam hopkins they allegedly did not get along so because the movie is about female friendship that might have been a problem here the actresses clearly admire and respect each other hart bochner and meg ryan have supporting parts and are both excellent in particular bochner who never got many decent parts in movies as far as i am concerned george cukor did not make another movie after this so this was a good one to go out on
<START> i suspect there are several cuts of this doco doing the rounds the copy i saw focused heavily on joe's erotic films and referred to his horror output in passing there are numerous x rated films presented in their x rated glory and emmanuelle in america's legendary snuff footage the breasts being cut off is given generous screen time br br the interviews with the highly likable joe are informative and candid he is an unassuming articulate gent and discusses his interest in shocking audiences why he wanted to mix erotica with horror and how he may have been responsible for one of his performers turning gay br br his friendship and working relationship with indonesian beauty laura gemser is touched on as is his indifferent attitude to shooting hardcore br br joe d'amato personifies an incredible period in continental cinema that has now passed it is great to see a documentary dedicated to him and his fine unique work br br rip joe
<START> snake island is one of those films that whilst one sits and watches its amazing level of stupidity makes one wish the film camera had never been invented the real reason why plan 9 from outer space will hold onto its honoured title of worst film of all time for a while to come is not so much because of how bad it is it is because of the fact that it is the most entertaining bad film you will ever see snake island is the other kind of bad snake island is just so bad that it is excruciating a stupid premise combines with a script that was written by monkeys tapping one key typewriters onto transparencies that were then overlapped in order to resemble dialogue to make the most obvious problems here filmed entirely on location in south africa the environments in which the film takes place are about the only element that can truthfully be considered well realised many shots involving snakes consist of close ups so surreal in appearance that one begins to wonder whether said snakes are cgi puppets or real snakes that have been fed really hard drugs br br william katt stars if you can call it that as an author traveling to an island resort on what appears to be a river ferry coming along with him is an assortment of very generic poorly defined characters it is all a matter of random screen writing as to who survives to the end but katt certainly appears to be contemplating firing his agent the rest of the cast seem to be from the home and away acting school where any contemplation of an unpleasant plot point is accompanied by open mouthed gaping and darting one's eyes about in every direction the foley effects are often worse with one memorable scene where a double barreled shotgun sounds like the rather flat sound effects that used to accompany gunshots in such games as meanwhile snakes continually explode or jump about at random it would have been more accurate to call the film snake holocaust br br of course no z grade horror or sci fi film is complete these days without gratuitous scenes of nubile women in a state of undress as every woman in the cast almost gets their clothes off the film starts to become less snake island and more snake island orgy but like all the worst piles all there really is in this case is a lot of setup with no real payoff the sex scenes never eventuate and the deaths of characters are so flat so uninteresting that the entire film becomes pointless unless you consider watching william katt running through a muggy forest wearing ill fitting cricket gear and smashing snakes in all directions with a cricket bat a payoff for the record i don't i used to think that anaconda was the worst film ever made about predatory snakes i was so very very wrong at least anaconda had a snake one could be afraid of if they suspended disbelief for quite some time some of the snakes shown killing the human cast are no bigger than the from some pairs of combat boots i have worn br br so we so far have the checklist for bad horror films running along nicely the unrecognisable lame cast are accounted for as are poor audio and visual effects the dialogue is so wretched so ill timed that i have seen better writing and delivery during some of the school plays i have acted in many moons ago unfortunately where snake island falters in this respect is the area fatal to all bad films in essence it forgets to be so bad that it is funny it is so bad that it stops being good after the opening credits and becomes painful the second that the cast start to speak compared to william performance in snake island jon voight's performance in anaconda was as oscar worthy as russell crowe's in gladiator not that voight or katt are necessarily bad actors but with material like this you're hard pressed to say a single word naturally listening to some of the lines here was like being the victim of a violent crime one's mind tends to blank out the experience primary as a self defense mechanism br br because of the aforementioned failure to be entertainingly bad i gave snake island a two out of ten my special score for films that are so bad they cannot possibly be good but not bad enough to entertain it is all just so boring or pointless that one might as well be watching the test pattern the proper way to spell crap is s n a k e i s l a n d
<START> sorry randy i love your comedy but in this case you really laid a 'golden egg br br the plot was thinner than a single layer of my skin the acting more wooden than a giant redwood and i think the direction was non existent br br there certainly appeared to be pathetic attempts at take offs of other films jaws and european vacation to name but two br br if memory serves me right eric idle played the same type of character in nat lamp european vacation but much better br br i am wondering if chevy chase and beverley d'angelo were approached to make this sequel if so they certainly knew what they were doing when they turned their parts down br br in my opinion no one can better chevy and beverley in their roles as the griswolds and randy quaid complemented them admirably in the earlier movies br br randy quaid should have quit national lampoon whilst he was ahead
<START> i usually love these movies give me a good old b movie any day but this one was simply awful the acting was terrible almost to the point of my turning the movie off completely i thought i saw the all time worst but this one is right up there with attack of the killer tomatoes in all honesty it was the acting that did this film in for me br br i found the actor's to be clumsy and the lead male female were extremely dull this movie had absolutely nothing going for it i may be asking a ridiculous question here but why the nudity and sex scene did the producers think nobody would watch if they left them out i think they were probably right oh where is price and the tingler when you need them
<START> there are movies that are leaders and movies that are followers br br meatballs was a leader and here's one of its followers br br party camp is about as interchangeable as any of its brethern who plumbed the depths that meatballs the original had so successfully mined of course that one had bill murray so what does party camp have br br i'm glad you asked that question br br jewel sheperd has made these flicks her bread and butter and what a side dish she provides even as an innocent wink wink girlfriend to a rich twerp she provides that sultry steam she gives to all her parts and yes guys she shows if you know what i mean and i think you do my gosh that smile of hers could melt through titanium br br what oh yeah the movie nothing special as i said every cheap joke is aimed for and hit at about crotch level and eternal teen jayne is good for a laugh or two but instead of a sense of humor there's just nudity lame sex jokes more nudity a soft core dream sequence a sex symbol nurse simply for clothed leering purposes even more nudity br br hmmm maybe it's a good idea bill murray wasn't in this br br two stars for jewel naturally plenty of camp but not much of a party
<START> how many reviews of this film will i have to write before i get it right tom conway fully inherits the mantle of the falcon from his real life brother george sanders with this entry decked out in beautiful double breasted single drape style suits and cruising in gorgeous 110 steel cars with huge fender skirts and suicide doors that come up to your armpit conway travels from new york to miami to keep a formula for industrial diamonds from falling into the wrong hands his client is lovely virginal louisa who has got gorgeous hair but will let you only kiss her for the first two months along the way he runs into the type of colourful array of characters only a b movie could provide his sidekick in this outing is perhaps best among falcon sidekicks edward brophy as goldie locke who is given some really funny lines he runs into sinister dish doris blanding the type of '40's chick that you know puts out her cohort is benny played by steve brodie who twenty years later was a presley punching bag in two paramount king movies they both work for cold fish and yachting cap wearing kenneth sutton ready to do what it takes to get the formula as he cruises his yacht to brazil saddled with the falcon pursuing cops ever this entry still reigns supreme forget those 120 minute melodramas give me a 1 hour falcon movie any day i got a wife and two kids who's got time for a two hour movie shake up some dry martinis and forget your troubles with this great falcon movie but if you didn't tape it off local tv in toronto like i did 17 years ago you're out of luck
<START> ok so this film is well acted it has good direction but the simple fact is that it undermines what all gay and lesbian people have been fighting for all these years the straight man deciding to be gay and the gay man deciding to be straight i did enjoy it up until the last 20 minutes after that i got really offended as what usually happens in these films the straight actors play the main parts and the out gay actors play the secondary straight roles the leads are played by handsome men but don't let that distract you from the fact that this is a a film that leaves you feeling unfulfilled all the romance and relationships you hope would happen do not unless you are a priest that is in which case god bless straight woman who cure our homos
