<START> don't even try to figure out the logic of this story but do ride along with 10 year old gus on the most bizarre road trip ever witnessed more weird characters and implausible situations than a twin peaks reunion nothing makes sense yet it's impossible to stop watching now where can i find that 'r'
<START> so many literary adaptations are disappointments there are many reasons for that but usually it is the need to cut down a complex novel to the size of a screenplay the dead is unusual it had to be as the short story itself is a tiny relatively short gem it may in fact be the finest short story in the english language in beautifully spare language it tells of the realization of gabriel conroy that his life and the lives of so many around him are controlled by memories of the dead even his own wife of many years loved a man now dead more than him br br to bring such a short story to the cinema was always going to be tricky john huston did a magnificent job he never gave in to temptation to play it up or use fancy technique to expand on the story it is simple and true with outstanding acting the only slight miss step is the use of music to accompany the devastating final soliloquy br br its rare indeed for a movie version of a literary masterpiece to be itself a masterpiece but i think its fair to use this term for this movie its not a bravura piece of film making but it is simple and pure i always think of ozu's movies when i think of the dead its at that level of purity and simplicity and deep wisdom
<START> not being the least bit familiar with the characters from the comic book series i expected this film to merely accomplish the basic introduce me to the characters and their inherent characteristics present a plot and end with the destruction of the main adversary and perhaps hint at the possibility of a sequel and that's exactly what this movie happens to deliver br br however unlike with most other comic book movies i felt that this one did it with a bit of class risking a more limited audience with strong language and graphic fight scenes blade presents a very modern believable and dismal world whose little nuances effectively managed to elicit a sense of dread as minor as it may have been from a viewer who rarely ever becomes involved in a story unless an emotional i e sappy aspect is concerned br br yes the movie has innumerable plotholes and preposterously unrealistic situations such as a standard female doctor being astute enough to contrive what no one else has been able to for several thousand years but when you have an enemy as cool as the one in this movie and fight scenes with involving and exciting camera cuts and special effects such as this what else matters it may run a little long but for what it sets out to do blade stands out in sharp relief among most other movies in this genre
<START> this is a very modest very lovely movie with a great score by carmichael and frank loesser with a standout number we're the couple in the castle that is totally evocative of the period and harks back to penthouse serenade just as the opening premise coming may well have inspired fred and yip opening woody's coming in rainbow six years later i totally agree with those posters who have noted that were the name disney appended to this it would by now have achieved 'classic' status rather than have fallen into neglect it's wonderfully inventive never more so than when objects barely noticed in the 'real' world assume a much greater significance both pro and con in the insect world actually it is a classic albeit a minor one
<START> i am sitting here watching the film tango and cash it led to a discussion about other great late 80s movies the ridiculous and hooch connection came up br br granted i have never seen and if i still value my life i never will joshua quotes this as his movie of the year wow wow i am utterly astonished that this movie exists but so much more than that the fact that joshua likes this move disturbs me to the core i think joshua is one interesting guy br br br br
<START> this movie was hilarious it occasionally went too far but isn't that what we expect from them the theater roared with laughter and at all the incredibly crazy stunts it's rude crude and occasionally frighteningly intense the whole gang is back and even more out of their minds which in turn provides for some great entertainment i don't want to give anything away but the little snippets of clips going around the net are nothing compared to what comes after br br this is a great movie to go see with friends try to see it with a big crowd you will not be disappointed just don't go with anyone who can't take it see above it will not go over well you can be sure of that but that's pretty obvious in the first place if you enjoyed the first one you will loooooove this one
<START> what i hoped for or even expected was the well known stop motion imagery and extreme slow motions extreme zooms and all embracing fish eye takes in short the art of a finding interesting visual events and b capturing them in a way the human eye is not capable of to be replayed so that the human eye can see the stuff that made the other hits br br i just wondered how the creation of the whole would fit the title br br having watched the movie i got the feeling that the focus in this third part was on the message and not on the wrapping that's fine especially since the message is so valid but i already knew the message and it appeared there was nothing else left for me more then half the film was or colorized or or transformed through some other filter it looked a lot like the effects your video camera does but you never use a lot of the images would have been prettier without the filters like the giraffe and zebra chase you could say that or whatever human based malicious source disfigured our beautiful nature' but why use these seventies effects to symbolize that at the point that there had been more than 10 minutes in a row of this cheap looking effect i was ready to leave the hope that the rest just couldn't be that bad made me stay but then there was the slow motion slow motion is good because it gives you time to analyze the moving picture but if there are no more than 24 or maybe 50 or 60 frames a second then there's just not enough motion to slow down please record the motion to be slowed faster like was done with the beautiful shots of the foaming and splashing water some of the laughing people and the drill song singing soldiers i acknowledge that archive pictures can't be redone but i had already seen a lot of that footage anyway it could have done without it it must have been a lot of work to search through the archive footage and the effects can't have been that easy to apply and arrange as well on top of that a lot of the work was mixed with each other it shows that the creator wasn't out to lengthen the movie or to spare himself but i didn't like the mixed stuff one bit the idea behind it was sometimes nice or even clever but the implementation was insufficient the computer generated images didn't bother me that much however out of date the streaming along circuits in the first part of the film looked more recent and were nice is always fun the mountain was less i was pleased to hear a cello playing a major role in the music a little less vibrato at certain moments would have been appropriate with glass' music but that's a matter of taste as is all of the above of course i do hope that there will be another story to tell soon where computer imagery will have a less significant role and that will inspire somebody to get into the field again br br
<START> god i never felt so insulted in my whole life than with this crap there are so many ways to describe this piece of crap that i think that if i said everything that came to mind i would get banned by this site br br how do i begin well for one it doesn't take knowledge of the original series to know that this movie is a slap to the face of people who've seen it the biggest butchering of a theme song ever made is here from a metal version to a freaking rap version what were they thinking how does underdog and a electronic heavy musical style match the story is so basic that i will do something i don't usually do and not even give a summary just think this a dog gets superpowers fill in the rest that's how predictable this movie is and then comes the jokes please kill me now this style of humor that might not even get the kids laughing it's that bad well expect that punch line after the sneezing that was slightly funny br br but what surprises me the most is why jason lee ny name is earl patrick warburton emperor's new groove and jim belushi according to jim are all here in the shows movies i mentioned the actors in my opinion do a good job and excluding lee are the best actors in this movie but that says very little the rest deserve golden nominations for this crap i am very sad to see such good actors buried by this disaster br br all in all this is just as bad as which i reviewed as well and again my head would explode if i saw anything worse than this
<START> i rented this film out of the local video store one day you know the kind of movie with box art that just reaches out and tells you to me' well if you see this dull film in your video store walk on by fight the urge rent a porno because this film is despite the interesting opening the film lapses into repetitive murders and a hardboiled cop stumbling around dealing with the usual problems wife bastard of a boss etc wondering if the fast forward function on your vcr works rent this film and put your concerns to the test
<START> this was a flick doomed from its conception the very idea of it was lame take a minor character from a mediocre pg 13 film and make a complete non sequel while changing its tone to a pg rated family movie i wasn't the least bit interested then came the trailer not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and i'm not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer it's like a 3 minute cliff's notes version of the flick so obviously i wasn't gonna pay to see it but once it hit dvd i thought sure i'll watch it for free maybe steve carell can save it br br nope br br i'm still baffled as to why he signed on for this he must have owed someone a favor the jokes were all so flat and obvious and the director obviously asked him to go for very broad comedy style like the original bruce jim carrey but it's just not funny the studio obviously tried to cash in on the success of 40 year old virgin complete with several of carell's past co stars a reference to the flick on a theater marquee and another musical closing credits sequence but even the talented carrell can't save this his co stars don't fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted wanda sykes isn't wasted she's just a waste in anything she does and her horrible one liners and reactions just make you wish people would stop giving her work br br the story itself is just predictable and lazy it pounds you over the head with obvious foreshadowing like evan's disregard for the environment drives a gas guzzling humvee opts to use wood from endangered trees for his house hates animals and by the end it's just over the top preachy on both faith and the environment br br why the movie was made at all is puzzling enough but i really don't understand how it reportedly became the most expensive comedy ever the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious blue green screen work i've ever seen maybe the rental of the live animals on set cost a fortune who knows but whatever it was that cost them so much it didn't translate to quality that's for sure but hey it wasn't the worst film of the year by far there's still plenty of worse duds like norbit and death proof
<START> do not see mr magoo it is one of the worst movies i have ever seen leslie nielson was not funny in it he has not been funny since the naked gun movies well it won't take long to figure out that this is not a naked gun movie the movie's plot is ridiculously foolish nothing in the entire movie was funny the first few minutes of the film were animated to look like the old magoo cartoons i wish the movie would have stayed that way
<START> within the first 5 minutes of this movie i knew i was in for one of those pick at the faults kinda movie the acting was terrible the script was even worse who ever let these people write write such crap for a movie need to be feed the themselves with russian jets posing as u s air force jets and pistols that can miraculously shoot 50 60 rounds rapid fire without reloading is poor detail to any story in one scene komodo are killing special forces troops at night while in another they are explaining how the and cobras are cold blooded and don't come out night also with fantastic special effects available in today's movie industry they were only average even for this low budget movie br br all that being said i did watch it to the end curious as to what other wonders bad film making could produce shame shame shame for producing such rot br br this movie should have been left on the cutting room floor
<START> because while i thoroughly enjoyed this film it seems from other user comments that i'm in the minority maybe not one for the philosopher eek there are some wonderful scenes here particularly the techno and the great life adventure story originally portrayed go see for yourself
<START> this can hardly be called a good movie actually it's not even close but i have to say that there was a few things that made me not laugh not giggle but something like that the dogs parody was one of them the rest are not important enough to be remembered br br to be honest i was a little disappointed by this movie the plot sounded like an idea but it quickly fell to the ground the whole thing was just to messy and the actors where not good for the characters most of them simply overacted there was also a whole lot of sequences that was a total waste of film i do realize that it would make the movie about 20 min shorter but it would only make it better br br now with the good and the bad things lined up let's go to the conclusion two out of six toilet seats up for this one
<START> the c class cast and poorly transitioned scenes complete with terrible acting have led me too believe this would make a good tv only release such as the fx presentation of a smallpox outbreak at my local blockbuster however about 9 copies are held on the shelves none of which were checked out when i rented the title i wonder why anyway this title was almost ridiculous in the fear factor the director was going for the whole death count on the bottom of the screen completely contradicted the plot at times such as when the chopper was going over angola and the toll was speeding at a breakneck pace from 23 million to 24 however as the movie ends possibly several hours or even a day or so after the chopper has landed the death toll counter is reset back too what it was at the moment the chopper was approaching the area the movies end left a huge whole in th entire plot and god knows nobody is waiting for the sequel anyway do not rent this i only advise watching this if you have obtained the title with no monetary loss and you are in the mood for a cheesy suspense movie
