<START> this movie is simply excellent for some reason it wasn't a success at the box office in india in new york however i have yet to come across a person who disliked this movie this is definitely the funniest movie to come out of india everyone gives a good performance amir khan however just takes over and puts the movie over the top
<START> i absolutely positively loved the movie i just saw it and can't wait for it to come out on dvd it is a beautifully well drawn masterpiece i am always amazed with the intricately drawn work of ghibli studios br br others have commented on calling risa by her first name he never calls his father by his first name unless he is speaking about him to someone else i didn't get the impression that risa was his mother it was never even mentioned or implied by anyone it is quite obvious that she is his step mother that is why he makes her promise to come home and why he gets so upset when he finds her empty car his mother must have died when he was an infant because he mentions being nursed by risa this coupled with his father being out to sea a lot is why he has abandonment issues everyone also talks about how mature he is this usually occurs when a child loses a parent
<START> this is just a long advertisement for the movie the death tunnel although it is an interesting history of the waverly hills sanatorium the whole ghost theory is up to your interpretation more ghost orbs which you can duplicate with dust in front of a flash camera and the mist is just someone's cigarette smoke lit up with the camera flash i couldn't see any shadow people until they drew an outline around the blurry distortion of the image no scientific explanations were suggested for the phenomena only paranormal perhaps these are only events one would have to see to believe so be sure to make plans to visit the sanatorium on your next vacation in louisville kentucky
<START> when i saw on the voting panel that some people had given this film a score of 10 i assumed they were unaware that the score wasn't out of 100 this is a disaster movie in the real meaning of that term poorly written and weakly directed with so called actors unable to act but able to grimace when ordered to for the first 60 minutes the story appears to be going in one direction then it changes tack and gets involved in a power fight with extremely poor special effects unable to work out an intelligent way for the hero with limited powers to beat the villain with super powers the writer cheats it is obvious that the father was added to the so called story line because it was easier than working out an acceptable denouement not that the write would even know the word denouement some movies go directly to dvd this one should have gone directly to the dustbin
<START> the original story and funny compelling characters went over well for a teen girls slumber party movie 2 times now i loved it it was fun and moved quickly no boring drawn out scenes it is violent and has a little language though most of it is covered up its a great movie david strickland was a terrific actor ron eldard gave a wonderful performance i watch it with the girls every time
<START> ed harris and cuba gooding jr where cast perfectly in this film it's a heart warming story that reaffirms the belief that we can all make a difference if we just care i think there was a lot of realism with the characters the screenwriter didn't incorporate racism in the film in a way that most films do which i thought created a more realistic story line br br writers tend to inject incidents of racism in an attempt to create realism but usually go overboard br br there are so many towns like this one where people of different races live harmoniously ed harris should have been nominated for an academy award because he was great as a leader and coach realistic as a father and showed a warm caring side when helping radio
<START> pretentious horror film that looks like a soap opera gone goth about a drug that send you to a fantasy world where strange creatures lurk the film has some good imagery but its odd mix of whats real and whats not doesn't go anywhere worse are the vague pronouncements in voice over from one of the characters it seems to herald a more serious more meaningful film but i don't think they even got into the serious or meaningful territory to begin with so trying to over sell the meaning comes off silly there isn't a great deal to say people talk take drugs have visions they talks some more its not bad so much as pointless and dull the dull is the sin here and the reason you'll want to avoid this
<START> i saw this movie by accident while in paris i went into the wrong theater by accident and by the time i realized it wasn't a preview or a short film i was hooked br br does a phenomenal job of holding your attention with her acting i can't say enough how impressed i was with her portrayal of this real femme fatal the rest of the cast performs very well too don't get me wrong this is not the greatest film ever made but given i knew nothing about it i was left with a lasting and very positive impression br br finally not speaking french in france paid off for once i didn't stop talking about this film for 3 weeks after seeing it
<START> bears about as much resemblance to dean novel as jessica simpson does to a rocket scientist if you've read the book i suggest you put it as far out of your mind as possible before watching the movie br br watchers is your typical boy meets dog dog turns out to be super intelligent government lab experiment dog and boy are pursued by super intelligent and emotionally disturbed monster created by same lab and oh yeah did i mention the shady government agents pursuing the monster pursuing the dog movie br br corey haim is the boy barbara williams is his mother michael ironside is one of the evil government guys and sandy the dog is well the dog named here einstein in the book br br the monster effects are ridiculously cheesy much of the dialogue is laughable the script rarely makes sense or is believable a good example is haim's character's acceptance of the dog's intelligence as if every fido off the street can type messages on a computer keyboard or bark once for yes and twice for no hmm it's gotta be the puppy chow right haim's performance is enthusiastic but shaky as he carries off the stupid dialogue with the least amount of skill ironside has been the highlight of many a bad movie and this is no exception he easily gives the best performance of the movie although i'm compelled to add that the dog who's a pretty darn good actor himself comes in a close second br br all in all an atrociously dumb movie and yet and yet i watched it three times within a week and yet i can't help liking it hey what can i say i have a taste for junk and michael ironside not that i've ever actually tasted michael ironside i'm sure there are laws against that but any movie that can make me laugh that hard yes even unintentionally can't be all bad chalk it up to a guilty pleasure a yes i know it's insultingly stupid but i like it anyway movie br br it's tough for me to rate this on a normal scale i'm forced to give it a d but on my own personal cheese scale it gets bumped up to an a br br yeah i know i'm weird like that
<START> it's a male bashing bonanza i saw this on sci fi a while ago and the idea seemed interesting it could have been a good movie and the plot itself i don't see as male bashing but certain specific references to men get really annoying i might still watch the movie again though because it does at least try to redeem itself by hinting that maybe the women in the movie aren't really as non violent as they claim but it still doesn't compensate for the really tiring male bashing i mean i can understand a little it's part of the movie's plot but come on it gets really tiring after awhile not only that but to assume that the majority of women in the world would accept becoming homosexual that easily and that the few remaining heterosexuals would be such a minority as to go in the closet it's just too unbelievable there are far too many women out there with cultural or religious restrictions that would balk at this it is totally implausible i mean i know its sci fi and i love sci fi but the best sci fi has at least a hint of it being possible and this is too implausible the phrase truth is stranger than fiction came about because fiction has to at least seem plausible to be welcomed but truth isn't always this movie is not that other than that the movie does have some good acting and the eventual morals of the story that something like what happened was wrong do redeem it a little but not enough
<START> just like most people i couldn't wait to see this ocean's 11 sequel but it really stinks i must say it stinks because there's simply no good screenplay it was just cheap i hope the producers donate all the money this movie has made or will make to the tsunami victims in asia so this movie will have at least one good reason to exist it is so bad i even can't write a decent comment about it but i still advise the creators of this thing to make ocean's 13 ocean's 13 will be about the same thieves who are trying to steal a screenplay well hidden somewhere in hollywood the 13th member will be a foreign maybe russian screenplay writer who knows all tricks to write a copy of this well hidden screenplay so they can replace the original they'll have to steal or they need to find at least 13 people to write a decent screenplay for a movie in which not only julia roberts plays herself but even all other star members of the ocean's films 13 people because it's the lucky number of andy garcia's character
<START> first let me say that i find films like shawshank redemption and green mile and most of spielberg to be absolutely horrid and stomach turning although national velvet on the surface would seem to be in the same genre and has what should be cringe worthy moments i thoroughly enjoyed it laughing and bawling throughout the film br br the premise of the plot a young girl with an unknown horse from a small village entering the grand national is certainly as implausible as could be but it is the only thing that you have to accept for it to work as a fairy tale or allegory the characters have depth and grow throughout the story ann revere gives an absolutely stunning performance as one of the wisest women ever depicted in an american film her interaction with the good hearted donald crisp is funny and sweet while liz taylor tries a bit too hard to be even cuter than margaret o'brien she succeeds btw her passion and love for her horse shines through her face mickey rooney gives a beautifully nuanced performance of the trainer br br this is far from a perfect movie some of the situations and scenes are a bit corny and dated the kids' antics and rooney's scenes at the track and in the pub for example but it doesn't matter the plot remains true to the characters and leaves quite a bit unsaid we don't have unnatural overly dramatic and preachy moments sometimes more is less the final scene is a great example of this the emotional dialog is left to the viewer to fill in br br strong understated performances rounded characters pithy dialog intelligent and internally consistent storyline we believe in the characters and are moved by their story yup they just don't make them like this any more
<START> i thought this be totally different than just another teen slasher well i was totally wrong there's a liquid nun coming out of the toilet seat and something really odd i know that spanish culture is a bit different and their movies too but i didn't expect to see a fake hollywood film they certainly faked it pretty well though why'd they make a movie without any new aspects this is just plain boring and it'd been done totally without any imagination br br i thought that having a nun as the bad guy in the be something really original it turned out to be a teen slasher if been done ten years ago then it'd have been something new br br i can't recommend this movie for anyone but it certainly has some comedy value it's like a horror parody in some points
<START> i and my brother are very big asian movie fans so when finding this movie hidden in a shop i bought this one on dvd because it sounded very promising and i couldn't wait to watch it so i watched this movie with my brother and i must say in the beginning it was very promising both of us really loved this brutal ball scene in the first scene but i guess that was all there are some interesting fights but it is not a action movie as it claims to be instead it's a love movie with the clichÃ© of love so extremely played over the top even shakespeare would vomit on this title sorry for my language by the way the characters act like being picked up from the street and given for playing in this movie br br well i and my brother watched it to the end because we thought it can only become better but heck it never did this movie challenged place 1 on my and my brothers worst movies ever seen list only followed by fantasy mission force do not watch this either
<START> i put in the dvd expecting camp perversion from the creators of society and re animator and was quite surprised to become involved in an authentically suspenseful tale acting was top notch nice to see vosloo in a protagonist role after a long string of villains the storyline involving and the few twists fairly surprising i figured i would fast forward through much of it to get to the abduction scenes but instead watched it through only being let down at the very end br br maybe i'm being too lenient but as i stated before i wasn't expecting much more than alien sex of course if you are looking for some hot alien sex you will be let down it was mostly quick cut exam table nonsense with a blink and you'll miss it glimpse of an interesting alien
