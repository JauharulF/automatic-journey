<START> and now i'm up to episode 7 i really was hoping it'd be over by now not to mention canceled once everything connected with the show including the actors had been dumped along with some toxic waste in the middle of the ocean somewhere never to be seen again because this series really is dire br br to have this program listed under the genre of 'comedy' is at best misleading it's so hard to believe ben elton could write something this bad maybe this points to a lot of input from the other writers in everything he's been connected with before in some episodes i haven't even laughed once br br oh and i can't believe o'hanlon actually stopped doing 'my hero' started doing this instead his decision making skills were obviously impaired that day perhaps he simply can't read and didn't realise just how poor the scripts for were don't get me wrong 'my hero' is not masterpiece but it's a million times better than this piece of junk br br and just to annoy me even more i bet this gets a dvd release as well when there are so many great tv series' that aren't getting released
<START> this film grabbed me right from its start where a sweet looking teen aged girl is shown visiting a grave alone then elton john's powerful song friends starts playing while she's shown walking alone through the streets of paris carrying a suitcase naively unaware of the car theft and prostitution going on around her the entire film is a beautiful dreamy romantic collection of scenes of young love holding hands living in the country wild horses running around freely fields of sunsets toasts of wine evenings by the fireside having fun and general innocence all set to romantic music by elton john it's magical br br somehow i missed seeing this film when i was growing up i'm sure it would have left a strong impression on me if i had seen it then i remember the radio advertisement for the movie in 1971 talking about how it was a special movie with music by elton john and with the chorus of the theme song friends playing in the ad friends for the world to see but i never heard anything else about it in those days and never got to see it until i rented it 35 years later from a video store by then it had been edited censored and all kinds of unhappy people with angry political agendas were using all kinds of ugly words to describe the film what can i say the world has gone insane since then br br the story is that a 14 year old girl is forced to move in with her cousin in paris after both her parents die it was their grave she was visiting in the opening scene one day while visiting the zoo alone she meets a 15 year old boy they hit it off and agree to meet the next day the next day while riding together the boy accidentally drives his car into a lake in a freakish solo car accident it was his father's car he can't bear to go back home to face his father's wrath so the two teenagers begin living in the french countryside together with the mutual background that they both hated their lives at home they settle into an unoccupied cottage the boy takes odd jobs to support themselves their supposed friendship turns into romance the girl becomes pregnant and they successfully have a baby at home all the while the boy's father has the police attempting to locate his missing son on the 1 year anniversary of the couple's flight together the police finally locate the boy's employer by an in person inquiry and are told they can see the boy the next morning when he comes to work the next morning the boy is shown leaving his cottage to go to work saying a sweet farewell to his girlfriend wife and happily doing cartwheels as the scene freezes on his girlfriend waving goodbye at least that's how the video version i saw ends it's an unexpected though well timed ending presumably depicting the last moments of bliss before the boy is taken back to his parents' home and his happy life with his wife and baby is shattered br br as beautiful as the story and images are the plot is awfully unrealistic and highly contrived i think it's better just to enjoy the movie as a young person's dream come true fantasy and to go no further in analysis because all logic and believability quickly fall apart when the story is examined in more depth why would a fully furnished and stocked cottage be left unattended with the door unlocked and for a full year what did they plan to do when the owners returned why would a girl trust a car thief enough to get pregnant from him didn't they think it was unethical to use other people's homes and food how could they ever hope to get needed dental care or other emergency medical attention while living outside of society how could the boy have a car accident on a country road with no collision and no other cars around where are there places anywhere near civilization where wild horses run free how is it that a teenage male would not have sex as the primary thing on his mind when he picks up a girl at a zoo the elton john song lyrics just don't fit why would they take off clothes when sleeping outside at night when it's about to get cold and so on the scenes of wild horses are contrived to appeal to girls as is the unrealistic theme of friendship before romance and all the back washing and tickling scenes with their predictable outcomes the running through flower fields towards each other the haze filters the scenes shot through in the foreground the baby ducks and so on it works but it's definitely contrived br br still this is a movie about youth and freedom and that ideal hasn't changed since the 1970s young people today are still treated as belongings or as lost pets to be recovered by the police instead of treated as mature human beings who have the same needs of romantic love and freedom as does the adult world and the ability to be responsible when given that freedom therefore the message is universal it's clear why a sequel wouldn't work this story is about a magical year long reprieve from the real world such a situation could never have been extended indefinitely assuming that it could even happen in the first place and a story about real life afterward would lack the magical appeal of such an unreal state of existence i really hope that no teenagers took the film seriously enough to try such a foolish stunt but i hope equally well that teenagers who were impressed by this film in the '70s learned something from it and have since then made attempts to make such a magical world a more attainable reality for others instead of perpetuating society's various hatreds and repressions especially on their own children
<START> the stooges are back and funnier than ever brideless groom in my opinion was probably the best shemp flick br br shemp has the opportunity to inherit 500 000 which was probably more than a million dollars compared to today from his dead uncle but there is a catch he has to marry someone that day by 6 o'clock shemp is a bachelor with not too many admirers except for one high pitched aggressive annoying singing student of his but he doesn't want her he wants someone a little more on the victoria's secret model type of women but obviously he has no choice since he's no collin ferrel himself but when it is printed in the papers that he is to inherit all that money if married his ex girlfriends are on the i want my man back attack br br what a great stooge flick this is up there with of all stooge flicks br br 9 10
<START> loosely based on novels by earl 20th century fox's charlie chan series proved an audience favorite but when japan attacked pearl harbor the studio feared audiences would turn against its asian hero this was a miscalculation actor sidney toler took the role to poverty row monogram studios where he continued to portray the character in eleven more films made between 1944 and his death in 1947 br br 20th century fox had regarded the chan films as inexpensive b movies but even so the studio took considerable care with them the plots were often silly but the pace was sharp the dialogue witty and the casts which featured the likes of bela lugosi and ray milland always expert the result was a kindly charm which has stood the test of time monogram was a different matter chan films were b movies plain and simple little care was taken with scripts or cast and resulting films were flat mediocre at best virtually unwatchable at worst br br thanks to an adequate cast and a few interesting plot devices the shanghai cobra is among the best of the monogram made chan films but even so it barely manages to achieve a consistent mediocrity in this particularly entry chan sidney toler is called upon to investigate a murderer who kills with what appears to be a cobra like bite at the same time he decides to make certain that a government supply of radium tucked away in a bank vault of all places remains secure do these two seemingly unrelated plot lines come together well could be sidney toler is always enjoyable as chan but most of his monogram performances seemed phoned in and that is as true of cobra as it is of any monogram chan film as usual the really enjoyable performer is mantan changing times have led us to look upon brand of comedy as demeaning to african americans but he was an expert actor and comic and taken within the context of what was possible for a black actor in the 1940s his work has tremendous charm and innocence br br fans of the 20th century fox series are likely to find chan a significant disappointment and newcomers who like the monogram films will probably consider them third rate after encountering the fox films like other monogram chan films the shanghai cobra is best left to determined collectors four stars and that's being generous br br gft amazon reviewer
<START> right this may be the wine talking but this could be the best movie i've seen in a very long time granted i spent much of the first half an hour wondering what the hell was going on but once i had accepted that i would never understand everything from the subtitles i was able to enjoy the film br br can you really hate a film where a staff turns into a flock of birds that defecate over the enemy what does character development matter when faced with a lesbian alien princess whose people built the pyramids why does buddha wear seriously diamond earrings does any of this matter when faced with the sheer sumptuousness of the visuals and the sly humour of the characters any battle for my heart was won once i saw the main protagonist dressed as spider man awesome many people will complain about a lack of story cohesion but for a fun movie to laugh about with a bunch of mates you can't do better especially if you do an alcoholic shot every time someone says i will love you 10 000 years
<START> 1st watched 4 30 2009 4 out of 10 dir john waters corny waters like comedy musical with some funny scenes and good parts but it didn't make a whole worthwhile experience john waters directed this music filled spoof of the fifties scene with johnny depp playing the title role this movie is very similar with what he did with the 60's spoof entitled hairspray but this one is not as effective some of the tunes are catchy some of the characters are interesting in their quirky waters like way and the portrayals are fine although sometimes overdone the storyline is similar to the movie grease where there is a good group and a bad group the guy from the bad group cry baby a girl from the good group the good girl then joins the bad group but once cry baby hurts her she falls back to the good group this just sets up the ending where cry baby tries to win her back now one difference that is expected in water's movies is that the bad group doesn't appear all that bad all the time and the good group acts like they have a pole up their you know what i definitely saw this in hairspray as well the wacky and goofiness isn't really all that much fun in this movie though and it just leaves us with a feeling like the movie could have been much better the prime appeal of the johnny depp character is that he's able to make one tear roll down his cheek thus his namesake at various times and makes the women fall all over the place for him this is overused and the basic bottom line is that the movie is ok but not that great
<START> the city story is a brutal hard hitting docudrama about what was once dubbed the town in america the film documents the events that led up to the murder by the city crime syndicate of albert patterson an alabama attorney who made a bid for the state attorney general's office as a way to clean up the vice and corruption plaguing his hometown his son john patterson picked up his father's mantle after his death and won the post making clean up of city a primary item on his agenda br br director phil created a film that has the ability to shock even today the grimness is so relentless that the film is actually difficult to watch we see the crime syndicate beat and kill in order to get what they want the beatings and killings include women and children and one scene in particular revolving around the death of a little black girl is especially disturbing it's not exactly an enjoyable film because there's very little payoff at the end to reward the viewer for sitting through the infuriating events leading up to it but it's a well made film full of an intense and angry energy br br a 15 minute prologue includes a series of interviews with the actual inhabitants of city some of who are then portrayed by actors in the fictional portion of the film it lends the film a quality of urgency that carries over into the narrative so that we feel like we're watching a documentary the entire time a feeling that's helped by choice to film on actual locations br br i'm glad i saw this movie but it's one of those films that fills you with a sense of righteous indignation and then makes you feel helpless because you can't do anything about it br br grade a
<START> this movie is stunningly free from storytelling it's a pure experience where the music overshadow the visual impression words cannot of course enough express what should be expressed but it is the requirement of the chattering classes that chatter is put forward entered into production lines of mediocrity and therefore a necessity in order to express any sensible thought or opinion about something which should not need to be degraded by chatter therefore these elaborate opinions are put forward to satisfy those empty minds which need to be filled by noise that you will not find however hard you try in this movie
<START> was certainly not the best movie i have seen however i cannot describe the way the movie made me feel while watching it and how i felt as it ended and also how i feel about it now very few movies have such an effect on me i like them or i do not i look at as a work of art we all see something in it and it may remind us of something or it may instill fear or fun etc this movie had me in not the best mood in fact it left me feeling empty somehow i guess because the lives these two persons led were so empty in so many ways they had no direction their only direction was to have no direction they had many problems to deal with and i guess needed to get away from what could not have been a happy life but on the way things really only got worse a steady decline from where it started it was sad as it was so well acted and i guess we have all most likely seen someone in some situation that may in some way resemble the situation these folks were in they might have had a good life if they had any idea how but it wes clear they did not know what to do so they kind of rambled to someplace they had heard about no real goal they had no idea how to have a goal they had no idea how to overcome the life that was set before them i felt bad but could not stop watching the movie only good actors can make me feel so much about a movie that i would not like if just anyone played the parts these two did a great job to the point you just did not see the acting i am very impressed and want to buy the movie when it is available on dvd you know it left me feeling a little like leaving los vegas did but again it is in a class of its own not a great movie but well worth an hour or two on the right day if you are a person who has problems i would not suggest you watch it it could depress you it depressed me and i have not the conditions these folks had
<START> this movie was an all around uninspiring film it was a non moving story that definitely does not get you thinking anything other then where is all the strong moving material the other critics say about the film the 3 main actors are good and there is a few laughs but once again it becomes another movie that you keep watching in hopes of it getting better and it just doesn't i watched this movie last night and wished that we hadn't wasted our precious time while baby is sleeping watching this film br br i plan not to recommend this to my family and friends as well as obviously anyone looking to rent it i was pretty much non impressed with everything about this film
<START> originally i was a tenacious d fan of their first album and naturally listened to a few tracks off the p o d and was rather disappointed after watching the movie my view was changed the movie is pretty funny from beginning to the end and found my self engaged in it even though it was really was a stupid storyline because of the attitudes that and portray in the movie br br much more entertaining and enjoyable than movies i have seen in the theaters lately ex saw iii dull and dragging casino royale way to homo erotic which in prior installments i have really enjoyed br br if you enjoyed borat you will enjoy the tale of the greatest band on earth
<START> i do not like himesh i do not like his singing too but his songs are a craze in india especially among commoners now when he ventured to become an actor Â that was a big joke what guts he has to reap as much as he can in his prime time i did never want to see this movie but one thing changed it the movie becoming a super duper hit after 2 weeks aap ka has raked box office collection of 14 crores Â compared to that has collected 7 crores in the same 2 weeks if i can sit through and absurd sivaji Â i should give this movie also a try to understand what stuff this movie has got that made it such a big hit the story is about the real life singer himesh hr who has gone to germany for a concert and falls in love with a german lawyer ruby mallika loves himesh now himesh is arrested for a murder the mission of himesh in last 40 minutes after he runs away from jail is to prove himself innocent and find the real murderer br br let me say that himesh has nothing in him to become a hero he tries hard but fails miserably he is pathetic i was thinking what could have made the movie click so much let me find something positive br br first the saving grace of the movie is the script till the point himesh runs away from the jail but after that the movie nose dives into unbearable stupid limits second the songs of the movie are good catchy crowd numbers third mallika Â she looks gorgeous and acts well too as the second lady i can imagine fans of mallika coming to see the movie just for her fourth the cinematography of the movie is pleasing Â especially the german locales are a treat to watch for the eye fifth the major portion of the story is a love story between himesh and Â with clichÃ©d dialogues that would probably connect to young crowd sixth the director prashant chadha has done a decent job in covering the pathetic acting skills of himesh as much as possible with shots that don't need himesh to act much br br the heroine looks like a small budget film heroine raj is wasted in a small role overall the movie is a below average br br i was thinking throughout the movie Â what if the same movie script was done with salmaan as the main lead i think it would have had been a much better affair may be then i would have given the movie 6 out of 10 but stars 4 5 out of 10
<START> this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo sub genre set in rural italy there is a serial killer of children at large add to the mix an array of characters familiar to fans of giallo cinema Â a madwoman a newspaper reporter ineffectual police a sexy siren a priest a mute girl a mentally retarded loner etc this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70's br br unusually for a giallo the victims in this case are young boys which makes a change from the more typical women in peril angle the fact that it is kids who are the target of the maniac only serves to make things a little more uncomfortable fulci is pushing the envelope a bit here and he goes even further in a gloriously outrageous scene where a young boy is subjected to the somewhat inappropriate attention of a sexy naked young woman barbara bouchet who he is tasked with delivering a drink to she displays herself openly and actively invites the youngster to ogle her ultimately asking him if he wants to go to bed with her although she is clearly playing around with him it's still quite an unusual scene admittedly there are one or two unintentionally funny bits of dialogue here but it's very nicely photographed and barbara bouchet exudes high levels of confident sex appeal a standout scene even if you might feel slightly wrong watching it br br along with barbara bouchet the other standout performance is from florinda bolkan who plays a madwoman who is accused of murdering the children she is not directly responsible but it is left to the viewer to decide whether her black magic may or may not have kicked off the subsequent killing spree irrespective she is hunted down by a lynch mob and chain whipped while a car radio blasts out rock music this scene is very strong and unpleasant its viciousness indicates the path fulci's career would subsequently go br br despite the visceral impact of the above murder it's maybe a little surprising that the other killings are either bloodless or committed off screen the only other death scene comparable with the lynch mob is the demise of the killer at the end of the movie although this sequence is kind of silly the plot is convoluted and awash with red herrings although personally i found the identity of the killer a little predictable this weakness is less problematic on subsequent viewings though Â like most gialli don't torture a duckling is eminently re watchable br br technically the film is well made with impressive camera work solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani Â particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like it's coming from a distant hill fulci obviously went on to make more graphically violent horror movies but here he shows a talent for slightly more restrained material it's still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema
