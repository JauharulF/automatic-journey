<START> for every fan of coming of age tales this 3 hour adaptation of the br br sarah waters novel is pure fun cinematic nods to baz br br kinetic style as well as to all those prim and proper period pieces br br ever present on the bbc where you're likely to have seen almost br br every prominent member of this cast it's rather bawdy and over br br the top in spots but that's just what the novel called for the cast br br is appealing and in the cases of anna chancellor and hugh br br bonneville perfect in the case of rachel sterling as our heroine br br nan you simply must overlook the fact that she's far too pretty to br br ever be mistaken for a boy and run with it it's a fantasy after all br br some fans of the novel may be put out by the various changes in br br character particularly that of may's character florence but br br the changes all work toward the greater good of this teleplay and br br provide an overall high quality entertainment value
<START> yeah what did i expect i thought this would be a film about young adults at their turning point in life something like or american pie which i liked a lot i wanted to see a funny film perhaps with an ironic look on idyllic and what did i get br br attention spoilers ahead br br this film starts with a lengthy dialogue which gives you a good hint of what will inevitably follow more lengthy dialogues sometimes i thought moritz bleibtreu might have forgotten his text and trying to hide that fact by improvising and just repeating what he was saying before but as i think of bleibtreu as one of the better german actors i believe that this effect really was intended i think the author wanted to show how boring talking to close friends can be especially when they are stoned but really i don't need cinema to be bored by stoned friends' talk boring dialogues make up most of this film br br but okay that's one thing i can cope with that i have seen nice films with abominable dialogues just think of schwarzenegger's life's work but the next thing is that characters are cheap and flat and that the storyline is as foreseeable as anything just one example spoiler why do you think does someone take a garden hose to his plants deep in the forest to water them of course not usually you don't find water pipes deep in forests do you the only reason this water hose is there is that a hunter who happens to come by while the two protagonists are harvesting their dope can be drugged and finally filled up with three bottles of i truly hated this scene because it's really violent usually i don't mind violence in films slapstick comedies are full of it but in that sort of comedy there is a silent agreement between the film and you that people don't get hurt if they fall on their faces or get beaten with chairs or things like that but if that happens in a film which is otherwise realistic enough slapstick scenes also seem real in this particular scene in i really thought that this hunter must be badly injured if not dead the final scene really invoked in me the impression that he is left to die there totally filled up with more booze anyone could handle and the protagonists just walk away it would have been otherwise if the author had consistently followed one style the scene could have been quite funny br br talking about being consistently that's what i missed most about this film the whole film seems to be a listing of small episodes that came to the author's mind things just happen without a apparent reason yeah i know that's life but that's not cinema because cinema is meant to tell a story not to show boring episodes without any significance i found myself asking where's the point all the time characters besides the two main ones are not elaborated you never get to know why the protagonist's sister wants to sleep with his best friend kai in fact she tells you but i could not buy it not at all i think she just was there to give kai an opportunity to act this childish aids test sketch which you sure have seen a thousand times before and mostly better the protagonist's girlfriend you meet once then she leaves germany what you don't even see and the guy doesn't seem to care and finally it is mentioned in one sentence that she has met someone else in america and splits up with the protagonist it seemed to me that the author wanted to tie up a few loose ends he actually didn't you never really get to know what's so bad about studying law being daddy's son daddy fixes everything in the end and serves coffee in the middle of the night which to my mind made him one of the nicer characters in the whole film and living in beautiful even the dinner with daddy's layer friend which maybe was intended to show how horrible it is to have to live up to dad's expectations seemed flat just another nice dinner with the family's friends except for the trip the guy is on later but i think showing that eating dope before you dine with parents isn't healthy was not the point of this scene if there was any i have experienced far worse dinners in my life than this one and still finished my exams i couldn't understand one single character in the whole film they just seemed flat and implausible br br all this made it a not so good film but not one i wouldn't watch again on television it really had a few good scenes most of them were not new though like the one with the nice and understanding policemen some were really funny some dialogues were nice and i like play although he repeated his well known stereotypes again this time not good not abominable that's what i thought after the film was half over br br but then came this incest scene and this i really found repulsive incest simply isn't funny i don't even know if this was intended to be funny some people in the audience laughed so it could have been meant this way this scene spoiled the whole film for me i couldn't feel sympathy for the protagonist any more i can't feel sympathy for anyone who f a helpless person to me this is rape and rape isn't funny so it might have been a hint of drama or so but the incest is never again mentioned although we thought this could have been one reason for the protagonist to leave germany in the end but as it is never mentioned again we don't know it is even totally unnecessary i almost expected the sister to become pregnant in the end which would just have added the finishing touch to this tasteless story but not even this final cliche is fulfilled just as nothing is really solved or thought through to the end in this film it isn't really funny it isn't really a drama it isn't at all a road movie a la tarantino despite desperate tries on violence it is definitely not enjoyable br br skip this film watch final fantasy that's also bad but at least with beautiful pictures and not that tasteless
<START> a fine romantic comedy errol flynn shows what a deft touch for comedy he possessed a talent that probably shows some of his true prankster self the comedic writing on this film is excellent eleanor parker does a nice job as flynn's ex wife whom errol is trying to win back eleanor is also easy on the eyes the sets exude 1940's glamour and style where appropriate br br flynn's comedic timing and wit are displayed to full effect here watch his double takes his ability to verbally counter punch with a snappy comeback or act the straight man and his total believability and sincerity where required this guy could act it is a shame errol did not get a chance to do more roles like this throughout his career he was multi talented to the extreme if you enjoyed it happened one night with gable and colbert or some of the william powell and myrna loy comedies you will enjoy this br br well paced and lots of laughs a lost diamond of a movie
<START> i didn't expect much when i decided to watch this movie so i was surprised to find myself thoroughly enjoying it a couple of scenes had me laughing almost uncontrollably the characters were engaging no pun intended however the story is predictable the fun of it comes from watching crawl shore's character a ditzy yet wise california dude a country college girl brings home for thanksgiving trying in his awkward yet endearing way to fit in to their lifestyle i was also surprised that in all this there was a message if you have a chance see this movie
<START> i am currently watching this movie and i have absolutely no hesitation in reviewing it now the acting is ridiculous half the cast must be retired porno actors and to get kicked off pornos you could imagine the quality of acting br br the graphics are unlike anything i have ever seen i think there are puppet shows with more believability they can't even afford blanks for the guns they shoot at the pathetic excuse for monsters perhaps i should also note how incredibly impressed i am at the number of their pistols can hold br br if asked to summarise the movie i would say that someone had up a group of complete no hopers at the local county fair slapped them on an island added needlessly intense music and let a 6 year old do the editing br br i can honestly not formulate any possible explanation for why this movie was released recorded on dvd and costs 6 from my local video store for one day if anything i have received the benefit of knowing that i am a lot smarter than all parties involved in this film br br i hate this movie with great intensity why i wish i knew captain i wish i knew
<START> i didn't really concentrate on the larger genocidal aspects of the story although the horrific images at the beginning are very powerful i was really taken with the human story of the girl and her family imagine living your life not knowing if you have a time bomb ticking away inside you i was really wrenching to see being rejected as tainted by the bomb the image that stays with me most is when stands before the mirror combing her hair silently watching it come out in
<START> a wonderful film a charming quirky family story a cross country journey filled with lots of interesting oddball stops along the way several very cool cameos great cast led by rod steiger carries the film along and leads to a surprise ending well directed shot a really nice movie
<START> newly released on dvd in the us just stay far away from it br br i usually give plenty of room for stupidity in horror films i'll settle for nearly anything remotely suspenseful supernatural spooky or even just a vaguely interesting concept this one simply stank i knew there was trouble when sara's best friend in college who had considerable screen time wasn't even listed in the credits on imdb i wasn't surprised not recognizing any actors but that character or day glo or whatever her name was apparently didn't even exist br br i'm so embarrassed that i actually paid a rental fee for this garbage deeply deeply ashamed
<START> oz is an old tv series released by hbo it shows the life in one security prison called oswald but the main plot is focused on emerald city which is one of the prison levels br br oz have an amazing plot and an outstanding cast there are many of characters and almost all of them are very interesting basically they are divided in groups gangs the the black people the aryans the gays the latinos and many others who doesn't have any specific group but deal with many others like ryan o'reily the irish br br the plot is very well built there are a lot of conspiracy inside a lot of fight for the power but all of this is not just exposed in form of violence all is very intelligent and smart nothing happens without a reason all is connected and very interesting to guess i really love this series and who wanna see something intelligent very well produced with a very good cast and performances must see oz
<START> this movie was just so utterly horrible that i couldn't get through the entire thing without turning it off it was just that bad when i was watching it i kept thinking it looked like some really cheap film made back in the 60's or something with those terrible looking special effects but then i realized that this was just made in 2001 br br the dialog and the acting were really very horrible and the plot was almost non existent i didn't think anyone would go back to making films that look so cheap and old i'm not sure if they did that on purpose or if they really didn't have any budget for this movie at all it really looks like it was shot on someone's camcorder at a local person's house or something maybe they thought they were being retro or something but it just comes off looking really cheesy br br i really don't know how anyone could ever actually enjoy watching this br br 0 out of 5 's
<START> terror 2 10 it was the navy seal team that tipped the balance from bad cheesy movie to just bad up till then there was a lot of bad movie baggage but the they are wearing bicycle helmets painted black you know the ones with air holes that make every adult who wears them look like a complete tool of course the bass fishing boat they took to greet the cruise ship might have been another clue it wouldn't make it across tampa bay let alone an ocean Â and their tactics wouldn't pass muster on an 3rd rate xbox game br br does director john have photos of john rhys davies in a compromising position with a hobbit because i can't think of any other reason he would be in this movie the other actors have a great excuse they are talentless unattractive hacks that couldn't get hired for an infomercial the plot is that two men try to smuggle the mythical love saying that name aboard a cruise ship and it gets loose br br the sets consist of horrible cruise ship fakery complete with the size of a small apartment the monster killings are bottom of the barrel there is no nudity and a lot of really bad actors refuse to finish their death scenes of particular annoyance is a gigolo character from a 60's doris day movie br br the cast bleeds ketchup while the bleeds day green glow in the dark blood why a goat eating mexican mammal would bleed anything but red is beyond me br br every b movie has a tipping point that makes it a fun time hey it's a lesbian shower scene omg that guy just ate is own eyeballs or not so fun did they just call those forty something overweight guys wearing and bicycle helmets navy seals falls into the not so fun b movie side with a thud
<START> i hate to admit it but they were right to sack schrader the opportunity is here to build an atmosphere to draw an audience into a movie it wasn't done the characters are weak the story was weak the directing was very poor schrader was out of his depth and it shows i've watched it several times now in the hope that there will be at least one redeeming feature but no nothing the next stage will probably be a remake of the original or hopefully it will be left well alone anyone wanting to know what the best sequel to the exorcist was should read 'legion' penned by blatty it has to be the best follow up to an original piece to be committed to print sadly it did not translate to to screen very well and i doubt if it ever could be as for dominion beginning avoid at all costs
<START> i am surprised people after such lousy movies getting to be in the top 250 or just being in the 7 0's i thought more people would get a kick out of throw momma from the train this was a great comedy by two terrific comedic actors billy crystal and danny devito together they made a great duo of insanity and obsession billy is a man who just lost his million dollar story to his ex wife and repeatedly wishes her dead danny has an insane and senile old mother who just abuses him when billy gives some misunderstood advice to danny danny offers a proposition to billy if he kills his ex wife billy has to kill his mother this is a crazy and funny story that can always get a good laugh please sit back and enjoy this movie people it's a good one br br 7 10
<START> i normally don't comment on movies on imdb but in this case i feel like i should i love movies and i want to make them and this movie is a perfect example of fine filmmaking br br this is one of the few movies that i have seen on the small screen originally seeing it air on amc i believe and then on the dvd i just watched that made me get that feeling in the pit of my stomach that little gnawing sensation that the director would hope you feel while watching his thriller br br jack lemmon's performance is a fine one and jane fonda and michael douglas follow i felt so much empathy of lemmon who's character jack only wanted people to listen to his warning br br but what impresses me most about this film is the lack of a score and this is also what makes it beautiful to me apart from the opening titles there are no background music to increase the tension because none is needed and while the credits run white on black in silence it drives the point home br br i use the movie as an example to anyone who says music makes the movie i think the movie should make the movie and the music should only amplify that but for the china syndrome music is not necessary to get across the realism and the urgency depicted here the characters portray all of this far better than the music ever could br br i highly recommend this movie it is one of my favorites if you like movies you won't be disappointed if you like movie soundtracks more you might not want to give this one a go
<START> today being president's day my wife and i had the notebook dvd checked out at our local library it's a movie released in 2004 that fell beneath our radar as we are big movie goers i'm a published author with hopes of screen playing my first book i'd noticed references to the notebook in reviews of other movies which is why i brought it up about us watching and this morning provided the perfect opportunity we both really liked it it made my wife cry we could relate to many things in it with our own continuing love affair and even i fought back choking up br br this afternoon after lots of chores yard work and eating we decided to actually catch a matinÃ©e when we got to the theater having seen most of the current batch of films playing we elected to see victoria day which for some reason was not at the theater even though both imdb and my phone movies showed it playing there so instead we looked at the poster for dear john and that it was written by the same writer as the notebook making it the obvious choice as we enjoyed so much br br what a disappointment first the characters did not have the same believability or sense of empathy as and we kept commenting throughout all the similarities two dozen or so quickly causing us to realize this movie was nothing but as another reviewer commented a poor man's notebook it had a real feeling meaning the sparks simply threw a story together based on the exact template of simply to make a quick buck not only that after the improbably 'dear john's john' for the wimp cancer patient we ridiculed the movie with each passing soapy stupid line all the way through to the end there were only about 6 of us in the theater during this 4 monday matinÃ©e and my wife even told me to keep it down so i wouldn't ruin it for the others it was so bad br br seeing this on the heels of ensured that the rip off similarities were vividly recognizable and sparks blatant cheap attempt at template writing painfully obvious we only wish we could've seen victoria day instead no matter how bad it might've been after seeing this poor entry to cinema and oh for the last 30 minutes i kept saying don't give that cow the coins don't give that cow the coins
