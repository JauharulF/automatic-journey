<START> oh gawd i want to time travel back to monogram studios and throttle someone in their 2 room front office for this sloppy musical it is one watt above flat lining for 60 of its 61 minutes and then actually shows for the one thin minute spread in second across the hour that there is real life talent being badly photographed i just don't see the point of going to some trouble to actually make this film that could easily be energetic and actually funny and allow lethargy to be the main thing on view the weird storyline shows cranky vaudeville trouper grace hayes her blowsy way into a college where her rat bag son is rich college clown she's gonna fix his playboy ways no matter what her real life son weird looking peter hays plays her screen son his real life wife plays her secretary talk about nepotism i suspect this talent package was almost the raison d'etre for monogram financing this back lot musical produced by resident schlockmeister extraordinaire sam katzman as with other monogram musicals it just looks more like a reason to film recent new furniture purchases and light in order to show off to other studios that monogram pictures are in their b grade ways have a ghastly look at swing parade of 1946 for genuine evidence of this they just constructed this gigantic nightclub set then found an excuse to film actors and musicians running all over it story none anyway zis boom bah is more bah than boom where was gale storm and mantan when monogram really needed them probably standing at the boom gate of prc pictures wondering if it looked safe to enter there junior jive roland dupree springs to life to tap his teen legs around two wobbly dance numbers especially in the 'big show' finale set in the new and expanded malt shoppe club set the usual crumpled curtains are loosely hanging on the back wall and the stage set of mis matched drapery even has one dark main rag that is yanked back and forth as each amateur sequence elbows past the previous one the chorus girls and their very plain looking partners in this finale just look like monogram office staff borrowed from typing and carpentry for the morning of filming they have absolutely no dance talent and are so ordinary on screen all the girls look like they are all called joyce there is even a costume calamity where they wear frilly hot pants on one leg only it is all so awful and crummy and actually annoying when one more tweak up by all concerned would result in zis being actually fun the one strangely interesting thing is the dialog delivery between grace and her son daughter in law it is so casually delivered that it actually works in spite of the script and logic she has a very life like presence which is the only thing that allows the ridiculous story to be slightly compelling the dupree kid is the real star he can actually do something in spite of looking like a tubby liberace tap dancing teen you read that right
<START> i believe to be the best piece of work that has come out of the steven seagal factory in a long time this movie was the first one i have seen since that fine film preview my point he is done every movie is the same maybe he will be good in machete because he won't be the star we can only hope br br p s thanks for speaking to ucsb when i went to college it was an amazing speech you really influenced some people out there br br so i have to write ten lines about this movie umm i like the smoker guy who killed a bunch of fools whenever anyone smells look out because there could be a killer with a silenced glock and another loud one who wants to kill you br br is that ten
<START> a great story although one we are certainly familiar with meryl streep proves that she is truly the best actress in film today very entertaining and just what i expected don't go see this film unless you are prepared to be used and manipulated emotionally but if you have that expectation then you will enjoy the ride
<START> but quite dated today otto preminger made this movie without the certificate of approval that was needed then it was enormously courageous and risky as he could have lost his investment and future br br the film is not true to the wonderful book and is unfortunately hollywoodized br br frank sinatra and i've never been a fan playing frankie machine is astonishing in his performance one forgets it is frank up there the level of realism he brings to the role of a jonesing drug addict has to be seen to be believed br br kim novak eternally gorgeous and talented does not disappoint in the role of the devoted outsider always there for frankie br br supporting roles particularly a young handsome and talented darrin mc gavin are faultless br br eleanor parker playing frankie's wife is hopelessly inept she swings from irritating to melodramatic and is far too over the top a forgettable performance br br the stagey cheap settings are appalling as if a firm gust of wind would blow the whole tacky painted cardboards over the horizon almost laughable at times in their tawdry cheapness br br the music was irritating poundingly so at times as if each nuance of the script example when louie is getting frankie his fix out of a drawer had to be underscored at a high level br br 7 out of 10 sinatra truly deserved his oscar nomination worth seeing
<START> it is truly saddening to see a once great director such as deodato delivering such a second rate giallo such as this this movie was so terrible it effectively put an end to his movie career the box lies this is no erotic thriller hell during the film's 97 minute running time charlotte lewis barely shows us one nipple i thought it would pick up once william burger showed up in one of his last roles but his character is killed off rather abruptly and lamely this movie fails in pretty much every way claudio simonetti's music is little more than noise and the plot made very little sense at all for some reason lewis is terrorized by ghosts which attack using phones by the end the characters all seem to have forgotten the previous 90 minutes of hell they went through and casually laugh as they sick the evil spirits on someone else lewis's ex boyfriend what this movie did little for me besides anger me and bore me half to death for genuine 80's deodato fun watch the barbarians or the atlantis interceptors let this one rot on the video store shelf argento could make a better giallo than this
<START> some said that this was a nose candy glorification flick but short of the original dr hyde's concoction no drug has yet been developed that can provide this effect if viagra was the slime mold stage that white sparkling powder is the stephen hawking evolutionary rung or at least the pharmacist idiot savant branch this reality show is really about the sacred cows of medicine seen as was the emperor without clothes few of us want to question the health field both because most of us would not have lived to our current age had we been born before modern medicine and because our subconscious hopes that we will continue to live on if we have faith in the helping professions so the geniuses who produced this movie made jokes out of those calcutta giving us the sugar that allows us to swallow the modern institution of medicine the timing was right and many were able to see the business side of the healing companies behind the curtain of oz a decade before when george c scott ranted through the movie the hospital my wife and i were sitting in the packed premiere in oklahoma city just as in jekyll hyde's remake we were almost unable to keep from falling out of our seat and laughed and howled uncontrollably for the duration the hundreds of other audience members were deadly silent they were shocked that doctors nurses the hospital institution were being mocked it was as if the pope billy graham and gandhi were were sitting in the animal house beer stained tee shirts and all competing to see who could tell the funniest god knock knock jokes between had the hospital been a slapstick comedy rather than a satire they might have been able to see what was being shown to them unfortunately they were like republicans at a screening of michael moore's 9 11 perhaps smaller golden would have been given to the corrupt medical corporation leaders health insurance companies would have had a tougher time denying medical care and health providers would have been earlier if george c scott had tap danced in a tutu while delivering his terrible truths but forget everything i just said watch the movie be consciously made as happy and joyful and full of laughter as the best ever saturday night live skit and let the subconscious soak in the documentary of the underlying reality just don't blame me when got to got to got to got to becomes one of your sayings or when hyde's got nothing to hide occupies that portion of your brain now paralyzed by its a small world after all or when you start calling your local hospital our lady of pain and suffering instead of our lady of eternal construction even were changing their favorite terrible boss wishbone winner from piss on him and leave him for dead to body in a pit you in it the smell of death it's gone chicken sushi mary mary
<START> no surprise except in how quickly abc reacted to the dismal ratings according to published reports variety the show garnered the worst ratings in the history of the abc television network br br and i quote abc's music talent competition the one opened tuesday night to cancel me now ratings br br the article went on to say that the show received a shockingly low 1 1 rating 3 share in adult 18 49 and 3 08 million viewers overall br br that makes it the weakest premiere for any reality show on any network and also below all series bows in abc history br br from the first moment i saw the commercials for this i knew it would fail we don't need another american idol clone but abc should have given this show a fair chance to succeed
<START> to those of you who've made comments on this film earlier and hoped to see it again i hope you did it was broadcast today nov 28th '04 on lifetime movie network i subscribe to dish br br karen arthur directed william petersen and barbara hershey in this southwestern gothic like tale expertly the lighting editing and dialog contributed greatly to the film and hershey and peterson were perfectly cast for the roles both playing sensitive bold and intuitive characters the screen play was excellent as well the supporting cast br br not having known ahead of time i guessed correctly the story was based on truth and now that i know it i must make the sojourn as santa fe is a hop skip and a jump from tucson br br as an engineer i was fascinated with the theme of the unique construction of the staircase and the man who designed and built it who was he an angel but the storyline and it's several plots of how it came to be is what most captivates you you certainly get a strong sense that god in his heaven was in every detail of this entire drama in history for you who have seen the film you know what i'm talking about for those of you who haven't i won't spoil a minute of it br br bon holiday br br bob shank jr missile systems tucson az
<START> i usually much prefer french movies over american ones with explosions and car chases but this movie was very disappointing there is no way to write a spoiler because nothing really happens this french couple has been living in lisbon for years and they return to paris for a friend's wedding they announce to another friend they are having dinner with that they are going to split then nothing much happens they don't seem to know whether they want to separate or not i don't necessarily think that their make for a bad movie it is very human to hesitate before making such a decision for good but this could be treated in an interesting manner giving some flesh to their desires and their relationship but that does not happen one gets out of the theater unsure of why these two got together or want to split the only piece i enjoyed was the conversation with the drunk that was true to life
<START> frankly i'm amazed to see that this movie is getting relatively good reviews i'll be completely honest and say that the only reason i even got through it is because of ryan phillippe and not for reasons particularly connected with his abilities as an actor though i think over the last years he has proved himself to be a better actor than his first major roles in the late 1990's indicated br br as far as action suspense movies go this movie fails in nearly every respect the acting is ok i guess but the script is absolutely horrible and makes very little sense a fact which the filmmakers try to cover up by adding absurd references to chaos theory as if it would convince anyone that the film is actually 'clever' but then again judging from other reviews some were don't be fooled the script is a boring derivative mess and no other element of the movie makes up for it wesley snipes has probably never had a less interesting role in a film and statham is a thoroughly dull actor br br not recommended
<START> following is a little known 1998 british film which was made with a budget of and has a running time of 70 minutes when watching it you'd never expect its director to go on to make it in hollywood and become one of the most acclaimed and celebrated directors of the 21st century Â well everybody has to start somewhere i suppose br br the director of following as you probably already know is englishman christopher nolan who directly after following would go on to direct the critically acclaimed independent film memento a few years later he would be hired by warner bros to direct the new batman series which further brought him acclaim and so on and so forth my point is everybody has to start somewhere Â even if it's not in the most astounding debut Â and christopher nolan introduces himself to the world in 1998 with following br br when watching it i couldn't help but draw resemblances to another directorial debut avant garde auteur david lynch's eraserhead following is not a surrealist psychological horror film in that sense but the similarities are noticeable most notable it's shot in grainy black and white and has an atmosphere about it that makes it unique it's hard to describe in words but it loosely resembles the smoky atmosphere you'd find in the film noirs of old hence it can be said that following is a contemporary film noir or a neo noir overall it's an amalgamation of that and a psychological thriller and the story is most appropriate to these two genres br br the main character is nameless and the movie's title stems from an early obsessive compulsive trait he possessed Â randomly picking out people on the street and following them sometimes even for hours on end during one of these expeditions' the main character becomes noticed by one of the people he is following and is confronted turns out that the is a man who is willing to befriend our narrator and he introduces himself his name is cobb and he's a petty burglar who invites the narrator to follow him on his burglaries br br from there the main character becomes swept up in world and he becomes embroiled in crime passion and violence as he gets more and more intimate with cobb following is not so much a character study but instead a film which follows the tumultuous relationship between these two main characters and the devastating ramifications it has on our narrator nolan succeeds in making the film resemble a film noir and emulates the respective atmosphere well br br as a thriller following is taut and atmospheric however as a film in general it's somewhat of a disappointment if not that then one could definitely call it underwhelming the entire film is shot in a non chronological and non linear fashion and it makes the story and film experience unique to some extent Â this style has been done so many times now it's almost commonplace technique Â and the story itself is unique to some extent br br however following is ultimately underwhelming for the entire film and is disappointingly unspectacular the story calls for more Â more action more suspense and more thrills Â but it becomes too embroiled in its own storyline and instead focuses on creating an intricate story following does succeed in doing that but without any other elements it's a film noir that doesn't quite work out it's got a sense of emptiness which isn't enormous but still noticeable nonetheless furthermore the film's shocking revelation at the end Â almost a mandatory convention in film noirs Â is one that makes us feel cheated it's unpredictable and comes out of nowhere but in relation to the story it's disappointing as it essentially makes the preceding scenes and the entire film seem like an enormous waste of time br br but the positives far outweigh the negatives and in the end following turns out to be a flawed but satisfying film yes everybody has to start somewhere christopher nolan does it with following and he does it in a fine manner a quiet meek but fine manner it's not the most astounding movie and it isn't quite worthy of the accolades the director would go on to receive in the following decade but it's still a good film nonetheless when singling out following you find a well made taut and atmospheric thriller one which lacks noticeable nuance or innovative style but still manages to grip audiences nonetheless
<START> this has to be one of the worst movies i have seen i tried to like this movie but they managed to mess up practically every individual aspect that pertain to this film cheap dialogue no character development no tension not enough story to pull you in no action apart from some really cheap scenes it seems they tried some things on the set and said to each other hey this looks rather cool why not put this in there after which the director probably said yeah yeah this is genius and got back to snorting coke or something when it comes to acting i think the only person that tried to make the movie worked is but in the end it is all for nothing cause this movie sucks 2 10
<START> this sickly sweet and laboriously paced 5 reeler is definitely not among harold lloyd's better films gags are sparse and mostly uninspired saccharine melodrama is abundant the setup takes forever as lloyd the unconventional but impossibly kindly country doctor makes his rounds bringing a little sunshine into the lives of children the elderly and puppies it's like a 1922 version of patch adams ugh 4 10
<START> psycho criminal pure by carl who is active in hollywood like mrs soutendijk george and are stealing the last peace of they are too able how can i get calm into a lift next time
<START> oddly enough the independent film channel showed this film a week after it showed karate bear fighter even though the bear film was the second in the trilogy and this film was the first what were they thinking while all three of these films are supposedly based on the life of this great karate master you can't help but think that they must have embellished the story quite a bit especially in this first film sure the guy evidently did fight and kill a bull and later a bear in fact he fought and killed many bulls during his career but in this film set in the early 50s at the end of the film the hero actually fights about 60 guys and kills many of them brutally i just can't imagine that this really occurred so i did some checking and found that while many of the details are correct some of this film is pure bunk yes he did kill a man in self defense and yes he did follow the widow and her son and spent a year working for them trying to get them to forgive him but the end of the film is great to watch but hogwash seeing one of his opponents get a staff thrust through his head and all the other gory details couldn't have happened or else the japanese government would have locked oyama up to protect society the film is entertaining and the fighting is excellent there are no complaints about the action or acting the only minor complaint is the camera work which is a tad sloppy during some of the fight scenes despite this minor complaint this is a most enjoyable film in many ways the wandering karate master theme is pretty reminiscent of the zatoichi films which are also lots of fun to watch but many of the exploits are truly impossible br br fyi there is an dubbed version of this film entitled champion of death and i just saw it as well it's not a bad dubbing and it was letter boxed a big plus but still i prefer the subtitled version
