<START> i enjoyed this series but felt that the whole thing was let down by the sound recording mixing br br for whatever reason they've had to employ an awful lot of what's called adr where the actors replace the original location sound with a re recording of it in a sound booth br br the reasons for doing this are usually due to problems at the location or because somebody screwed up somewhere in the sound production chain br br it wouldn't be so bad if the adr was done well but at times it's just plain distracting it's not just the adr that's the problem the sound mix just doesn't match up to the quality of performances and the pictures br br i'd be curious to know what went wrong
<START> i personally found the film to be great i had it on pre order for a month and watched it twice the day i got it in the mail and several time since yes the time lapses may be a bit much but the rest of the movie clearly compensates for it all amature cast yet the acting was right on for each part the plot itself is just haggard there's no other way to describe it who makes a movie about someone getting f bam thats who genius simply genius two thumbs up i would be honored to work with him any day any time on any thing
<START> i can't explain it but i find this movie not only funny but so enjoyable i feel compelled to watch it over and over or at least i did when i had cable tv i always felt it was a really poorly made movie but perhaps that is because i watched it on cable i plan to get a dvd of this movie to really take an honest look at at but more importantly to just have a good time watching it i liked the plot and the idea of the movie and i especially liked the cast i always wonder if the cast enjoyed making the movies they are in and this is no exception this film deserved a better fate than it received and kelsey grammar deserved at least one love scene with ms holly who wouldn't the characters in this movie were the kind of guys i could identify with when i was in the military and the zaniness was exact nice going troops
<START> caution potential spoilers ahead br br steven spielberg presents tiny toon adventures was always one of my favorite cartoons growing up heck it still is and this movie perfectly captures everything i love about the show and puts it in full length form br br beautifully animated by the tokyo movie studio wb outsourced every tiny toons project and this was the best studio to handle the show the movie starts at the end of the school year at acme the renowned cartoon college where buster and babs bunny no relation and their teenage toon peers learn from the masters of animated lunacy the looney tunes after the final bell the movie splits off into five different plots buster engages babs in a water gun fight that culminates with a bursting dam and a tidal wave sending buster babs and dog byron downriver on an overturned picnic table in search of adventure in the deep south plucky duck talks pig and his family into letting him come with them to the happiest place in the western hemisphere but he has to put up with an excruciating car ride and the threat of a chainsaw wielding hitchhiker cat furball finally runs away but she isn't not when there are plenty of to play with at the acme safari park fifi la fume devotes her summer to hunting down her heartthrob movie star johnny pew in the hopes of getting an autograph of course the hotel he's staying at is nearly impenetrable and shirley sets up a fortune telling booth on the acme acres boardwalk and lets her guard down on her day off when takes her to see the horror flick br br all these story lines are hilarious and some of them even overlap in the end the only complaint i have with this movie is that it doesn't make full use of the tiny toons roster dizzy devil and mary have only one scene gogo dodo only appears at the beginning and end of the film and montana max sweetie calamity coyote and little are nowhere to be found still they're excusable flaws in an otherwise perfect film this movie is pretty rare today since it's over 12 years old and has never been released on dvd to my knowledge but i highly suggest you track it down anyone who's a fan of warner bros animation either classic or contemporary needs to see this movie
<START> this movie stinks majorly the only reason i gave it a 3 was because the graphics were semi charming it's total disregard for a plot and the lack of even insubstantial surface character development made it seem like just a bunch of nice drawings this is by far the worse anime that came out of japan i can't believe they actually put their names on this garbage what a rip off selling this thing for 20 if you haven't seen this don't bother if you have i pity you
<START> the whereabouts of al capone br br who shot jfk br br cynthia lands the part of gypsy in the tv remake br br these are some of the great unsolved mysteries of the 20th century how else can i say it except i thought she was awful mannequin mannerisms poor reactionary acting ie that blank stoic stare while he co star in the scene speaks and a singing voice that most voice coaches would rate mediocre but she is stunningly gorgeous and after all wasn't that what the gypsy character is all about cashing in on her looks she didn't cut the mustard in the talent department br br as for the rest bette is fantastic whether or not she's playing herself or playing mama rose it works either way and i for one thought rosalind russell was as exciting as drywall in the original peter as herbie is the perfect understated foil to bette's over the top mama and he's the medium temperature porridge between midler's hot dish and gibb's stone cold mush is right br br one final holler to the man responsible for decades to come of cher jokes bob drag queens would kill for the glitz and glamour on display here everything's coming up sequins and bugle beads br br
<START> aside from the fact that this movie was filmed mostly in ma which is a beautiful town where my mother once rented a small storefront and i spent many a pleasant summer as a child it is fun and cute little film br br i must admit that i had no desire to actually see this movie even though i have a for romantic comedies i don't know why the trailers i saw were not appealing the cast did not look that interesting and i had no idea what the plot would be about in the end i found it to be an interesting meditation on relationships and family i thoroughly enjoyed myself and must admit that i thought that this film was one of the most overlooked gems of last year i am disappointed that so few people seemed to have enjoyed the very human ness that this movie presented the viewer with br br i have read many bad reviews of this film and must admit a certain level of shock at the cynicism that is prevalent in them as a grad student i consider myself to be quite cynical but this was a beautiful little film that deserves much better than it got
<START> the child actor certainly deserves a lot of credit it was a pretty weak field for best picture that year i think apocalypse now should have taken it but the academy probably felt it was too violent and strange plus vietnam was still too recent meryl streep was tremendous as always playing a very unlikeable character i don't usually compliment directors but i really liked that bit with the elevator doors grade b
<START> this is the first movie i ever owned on video and 14 years later i still have the same copy elizabeth taylor was as radiant at twelve as ever later in life mickey rooney gave real dimension to mi taylor and donald crisp was solid as ever as mr brown the amazing anne revere as mrs brown seemed to be the wisest woman in the world after nearly 60 years the warmth humor and excitement of this film still affect the viewer we still laugh at the jokes root for the pie and love velvet for the spirit and capacity for love that she displays i love it as an adult just as i loved it as a child a must for every family video collection
<START> i'm a huge zack allan fan and was disappointed that he only got one scene in the movie this was also my favourite scene where he confiscates a character's weapons and directs her to down below unfortunately unlike thirdspace river of souls most of the action took place off station i didn't care much for garibaldi after the first three seasons and think sheridan is okay but no sinclair i like lochley but she only had limited screen time if you like crusade or space battles you should enjoy it personally i can only give it 1 10
<START> this show has everything you could ever want from a prison drama there are twists and turns all the way till the season finally the characters are very strong and it gives the show a lot of power when watching the show you feel for not only the prisoners but the prison staff the actors who play prisoners on this show have done a very good job portraying a prisoner also if you like law and order svu or law and order criminal intent there are many actors from this show that appear in those shows the only problem with oz is that it was not long enough this show could of easily had nine to ten seasons without getting old even after the season finale i sill find myself watching oz all the time on dvd this show is easily one of the best shows on television don't be a fool go watch oz
<START> cool flick enjoyable to watch hope to see more from fred carpenter soon i really like the location setting with all the new york references it was interesting the way it all unfolds in the end the suspense factor was effective and the acting though kept simple was also effective in portraying the characters there are a bunch of neat little tricks incorporated into this film that make all the better i think the supporting actress did a great job in her role the casting and directing in this film seem to be sewn together seamlessly and the quality of the shooting is quite impressive the movie is not without its soft moments either which gives it a nice sense of balance
<START> a bunch of sorority girls make a new pledge spend the night in a creepy mausoleum of course the recently deceased don't stay deceased for long and all hell breaks loose one dark night is an enjoyable 80's horror with some ghastly dead bodies floating around that are being controlled by the spirit of a dead psychic there is no gore and nudity but the atmosphere of a mausoleum is very eerie the acting is solid but the script takes too much time to develop the characters until the final 20 minutes that finally breaks out of his grave the cinematography is impressive and the the mausoleum is a great location for the climactic events the film takes so long to get going and this is its major flaw 7 out of 10
<START> excellent movie in many aspects vicente has succeeded in depicting the time 1830 with meticulous care the light the places the feeling are perfectly perceived from the very start of the movie and along with it in opposite to what happened to mad love la a rather episodic historical movie all of this beautiful photography music clothes is wrapping a very fluid screenplay that reaches its climax in the only possible way br br concerning the actors paz vega as carmen is outstanding liar seductive totally sexual so beautiful carmen is a little less convincing the audience about his instant mad love for carmen but he succeeds in conveying the proper tragic mood to the whole movie i recommend it to everyone the best spanish movie of the year
<START> even though the story is light the movie flows so beautifully and its visual so tranquil and poetic that it could almost carry the whole movie br br the film consists of four interconnected stories all about different aspect of attraction between man and or woman and how it frequently is ethereal their true desire seems to be always something that they cannot hold onto it will flow out like a handful of sand br br i thought the most intriguing story was the last one where the more unattainable the woman was the more the man desires her it parallels her deep love for god who is infinitely out of reach but never closer to her heart br br a very good movie 7 10
