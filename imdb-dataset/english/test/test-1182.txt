<START> this movie was horrible and the only reason it was even made was because the story appealed to the far left i consider my self a moderate so i was able to see this film as the pile of garbage it was while i'm not a bush fan your dislike for gw is not enough of a reason to see this movie br br to start the movie was shot on such low grade film that it comes off as cheap rather then artsy additionally the characters are seriously lacking in depth chris cooper's character was a poor parody of george bush better suited for saturday night live then a dramatic film the rest of the characters are walking clichÃ©s and are poor of other characters from much better movies br br avoid this movie at all costs
<START> love the but this was a lame episode didn't have the same feel that the series or the movie has looked like it was put together in a hurry i didn't enjoy it at all the so called acting was awful the cast appeared like they knew this was a money grab of an episode to get to market quickly i hope we don't have an easter special next because that will be it for me the writing of this episode was definitely mike worst in the history of this show the direction left a lot to be desired and i almost felt bad for the cast and crew of this weak attempt at a christmas special like i said i love the but this one goes to the trash bin
<START> this film by the well known czech director and writer collaborator petr is remarkable for its but annoying and distracting in its details taking its theme and title from a robert graves poem it deals with a woman with several men and some obnoxious relatives in her life who's trying to survive and protect her two children 15 year old lucina and little blond asthmatic kuba adam the poem is much in evidence but the theme it gets a little lost br br anna the beauty and roman have lost everything in the prague floods of 2002 and have nothing left it seems but good sex which they go at with such a vengeance in their tiny apartment that lucina and kuba in front of the telly must hold their ears against the noise relishes such explicitness and skates on the edge of embarrassment or shock there's no good explanation precisely why but financial desperation has led to processing stolen cars in the big garage that his his car thief cohort drives off a posh volvo the easygoing josef has left with the keys in the ignition while visiting a large property he owns is a super nice guy but no fool his volvo is wired for tracking by satellite in cases like this and that leads the cops straight to garage and he and his cohort are off to jail br br beauty in trouble flees to the good angel on whom she can rely begins the graves poem but actually this fracas leads to when he meets her at the police station he introduces her to sushi and how to drink wine and plies her with a picture book about tuscany where he though prague born owns a lovely villa and has lived most of his life he's here to reclaim the house in prague now occupied by a couple with an ancient and infirm mother whom he allows to remain every gesture is benevolent even though he doesn't prevent from going off to jail br br in the circumstances must retreat with lucina and kuba to depend on the charity of her mother jana and the far less tender mercies of present husband the scrawny diabetic richard jiri who for the kids starting when they commit the cardinal sin of consuming his cookies proves to be the uncle from hell jiri hijacks the film at this point and never quite lets it go even in the final scene he is a figure of leering menace it is surprising that the obnoxious richard doesn't sexually abuse one or both of the children he is insistent that needs to get out on her own and when offers to take her under his wing he and richard become improbable allies improbable perhaps implausible why should like him but then what is whole story about some things the film gives too much information and about others not enough br br clearly the good angel is kind and a polished good looking older man whose manners befit his italian upbringing it's only at the end when he's pushed to the limits over his prague property by the devious occupants he proves that he is not one to won't lie down and be walked over br br also to be dealt with is religious fanatic mother jana and her interactions with and richard are something to watch but she is just another wild card that does not augment the deck br br the poem has been set to music in a czech translation and is sung on screen by the vocalist first in a tiny scene then in a more extended one staged at a prison performance witnessed by and the car thief pal if you revere as an auteur you may relish this sequence otherwise it tends to feel gratuitous also included are a number of songs by glen of the oscar award winning irish musical film 'once ' including the latter's theme song falling they feel more out of place than they would otherwise because of their familiarity from though this film came first br br people are arresting even little has his shakespearean child moments and a wealth of charm but the director and his writer seem unable to resist the temptation to digress and to over expand the property hassle endures may be useful for showing he has a tough side but such an elaborate demonstration wasn't necessary the acting is fine and there is a wonderful with quirkiness and specificity but the basic themes of love sex and money get lost in the shuffle and conflicts and how she resolves them never become clear it's fine that there is no resolution and true to the theme and to poem that still has hot sex with during a revisit to prague after moving to tuscany with and her kids but there are too many questions remaining about what to make of the obnoxious richard or of annoyingly pious mother how come all of a sudden we learn is getting letters from india purported to be from his dad who's in prison when did that come about interesting details hastily pasted in this seems a world in which you can't see the forest for the trees
<START> i've heard a few comments particularly from prisoners of war that is not historically accurate and that it is disappointing perhaps it is for those who actually had to live through this stuff and much worse but for the rest of us who really have no idea of how prisoners were treated by the japanese during world war ii is a remarkable introduction but isn't a war documentary if it had have been then the historical accuracy aspect would have been paramount it is a miniseries drama with fictional characters and fictional situations though based loosely on actual events i've heard and read about and at the centre of the story is the ideal of this group of young australian soldiers taken prisoner by the japanese and held in appalling conditions for years became mates through adversity and the strength of their friendships continued throughout their lives after the war it is also a cultural study of the differences between the japanese of the time and the western world with its music games and entertainment in part 5 when it is becoming clear that japan will lose the war after germany has surrendered in europe the japanese prison camp colonel insists that his country must study the culture of their prisoners in order to defeat a people one must defeat their culture and to do this one must understand it all in all australia continues its rich tradition of producing exceptional television miniseries and is an unrivalled world leader in this regard for the afi award with is my brother jack the adaptation of george johnston's novel and also a worthy winner miniseries in recent years include day of the roses the story of the investigation into the train crash kings in grass castles the adaptation of mary historical account of her pioneering ancestors kangaroo palace about a group of friends from a country town in australia who travel to london and change and grow apart and the somewhat disappointing adaptation of powerful novel the potato factory less recently nancy cato's sweeping saga of life on the murray all the rivers run cusack james' brilliant novel about postwar life in sydney come in spinner colleen outstanding pioneering saga the thorn birds the river kings ruth park's novel the harp in the south bodyline eureka stockade etc etc of course there have been some not so good productions for instance moby dick do or die on the beach thorn birds the missing years etc generally though if an australian miniseries comes your way make sure you see it and this goes double for a superbly directed masterpiece rating 9 10
<START> this was the first directing job by sebastian the writer of snakes on a plane and gothika anyone who has read my reviews knows that i love capers and this was a doozy a kidnapping and a woman shot in the process the fbi has emma thompson on the kidnapping case and the police chief roscoe lee browne assigns alan rickman to solve the murder which happens to be a senator's hal holbrook wife these two make an outstanding pair as they work together br br the kidnappers murderers have lovers simon baker land of the dead and the ultra hot carla sin city along with a couple of partners they kidnapped a hotshot computer mogul and they run his accountant all over town before they get the dough things go fast from there as new twists and turns are brought in the whole thing is brilliant and definitely a piss in your pants because you can't go to the bathroom or you'll miss something thrill br br now to be completely honest i would have given this movie a 10 if there had been more of the movie the security guard was watching in the opening i would have loved to see more of beverly and yvette but hey that wasn't part of the caper just icing on the cake br br thompson and rickman should definitely make more movies together one treat br br agent hawkins so fill me in detective friedman that remark could be misconstrued as sexual harassment agent hawkins agent hawkins let's get it out of the way then you've never worked under a female superior before i got to where i am by pushing paper and playing nice i've never actually fired a gun before i'm only in this job to prove to my father i'm not a coward i give decent head so i got promoted before all the worthy candidates all of them men all of them equally gifted at fellatio but there was a gender quota to fill i'm also stupid and idealistic you are hard and cynical and usually right i am secretly in love with you but i have a hard time showing it did i skip anything br br damn that's great dialog not only directs a great movie but he can write too br br and did i say carla was hot br br put this on your list
<START> strong evidences and it clearly shows government cover ups and lies very convincing documentary a little bias but it hit hard on the government i'm not very about the adults but the children it's very sad strong evidences and it clearly shows government cover ups and lies very convincing documentary a little bias but it hit hard on the government i'm not very about the adults but the children it's very sad strong evidences and it clearly shows government cover ups and lies very convincing documentary a little bias but it hit hard on the government i'm not very about the adults but the children it's very sad
<START> another popular screening for a british picture at century theatre a well crafted solid drama with an ever developing plot and ongoing in the tale' as the lies piled up a masterclass of acting by a flawless cast well by first time director julian fellowes outstanding performance as usual by tom wilkinson but good turns by all concerned including supporting actors linda bassett and john neville our audience was engrossed by this film which includes a couple of shock incidents which really make you 'jump' a good tight production at around only 80 minutes probably produced on a very limited budget but a success which should see fellowes directing again for the big screen some publicity for the film seemed to suggest it was set in the 50s as per nigel novel but obviously this is not the case recommended viewing
<START> it's a shame that someone so by many kids as well as parents should demean himself in appearing in this exploitative bandwagon jumping tripe i often wonder if mr wisdom in his later years looked back at his excuse for a film with any pride at least sally geeson had the decency to retire to doing something worthwhile after appearing in this low budget rubbish a cameo by some long forgotten pop called the pretty things cannot rescue the film from it's awfulness if you want 60's nostalgia invest in 'here we go round the instead starring barry evans and sally's sister judy instead
<START> when my six year old fell asleep at the theater during this movie that was all the confirmation i needed that this film is a stinker it was boring the scary parts were boring the maudlin parts were boring even the funny parts with two minor exceptions were boring and predictable and did i mention predictable examples 1 the gruff but loving dad indulging his brat of a kid 2 the gruff but loving dad buying the farm while singing a song 3 the brat of a kid deciding to cut and run but thanks to his friends sticking things out because they need him 4 the brat of a kid winning against incredible odds 5 and a sassy character voiced by an african american actress gotta credit these filmmakers for that bit of originality and for perpetuating that stereotype i did mention two funny bits in both cases contributed by minor characters the mouse bouncing on the farmer's pulse was funny the farm dog falling victim to his doggy weaknesses while vying for leadership was funny but the rest painful someone tried to make a hipness thru committee movie and make it even hipper by making it a computer animated film and this was the result and why make the coyotes batman villain dumb by with their victims rather than just eating them oh yeah no blood needed in this film for kids already concentrating on mock alcohol consumption destructive behavior and potty humor and the fuzzy thing in a box just what exactly was it a porcupine tasmanian devil what besides a really stupid plot device to help otis the cow win the mother of all battles barnyard is a bomb and i didn't even need to mention the
<START> i liked this movie that's pretty much all i can say about it lou gossett did a good job even though i'm still very disappointed in him after all the iron eagle movies and even if i was smiling on the inside when the first main teenager dies i won't give it away it was done in a nice fitting fashion pretty much everyone in this movie does a good job so check it out it's another one of those movies i found real cheap so i bought it and i recommend the same
<START> why is there so much angst among the imdb reviewers who hate this film it isn't a masterpiece but having viewed it twice it does come across as compelling drama set in the world of network tv robin stone is the epitome of every dan rather phillip stone and brian what's his name on nbc a mannequin of a man incapable of love who succeeds professionally but fails miserably in his personal life i worked for eight 8 years in network news and robin stone's do exist br br the supporting cast works for me from cannon who can be annoying but isn't in this film to greene who plays pathos just right to wexler who scores as the young model in love w the image of prince charming and can't reconcile that image w the true ugliness inside also of note is the ending which some imdb reviewers claim is a cop out it's not listen to the song he's moving on for clues as to the arc the robin stone character travels that brings him to finally face his issues he realizes the answers don't lay w the life he's lived and the symbolic walk away from those he's associated himself with at the end is perfect
<START> this movie is a terrible attempt at a spoof its attempts to parody various sports movies are half baked and not at all funny br br even things that should be funny like the female kicker from india who's always wearing traditional dress over her uniform aren't really funny the fact that the football team studies and gets good grades which makes the coach mad didn't get any laughs either br br the plot of having a traditional loser get one more chance by coaching a loser high school football team really had potential as a spoof it's a classic and trite sports theme but alas the screenplay was too weak for any cast to pull it off and this cast is no exception br br there is gratuitous use of women in bikinis and underwear so it's not all bad from that aspect br br but animal house or talladega nights this is not
<START> it's not often that a tv series grabs me right off the bat a recent chance download of the pilot for surface had me glued to my seat for the entirety of the episode after which i immediately set out on a fevered search to learn everything i could about this wonderful series to my chagrin i found out it had been canceled after a mere 15 episodes despite its strong ratings and extremely favorable reviews such a shame br br since then i've acquired the remaining episodes and found the first 5 or 6 to be among the best television i've ever watched just fantastic from start to finish and as another reviewer commented i loved how they ended every episode with a huge finish i imagine watching it each week i would've been screaming with tension and just captivated desperately waiting for the next episode to be released growing up i always heard that was how early serial movies used to do it ending with a huge cliffhanger to get the crowds back into the theater for the next episode br br well it seems for some reason or another the suits decided to kill this off and apparently the people behind the show must've seen the writing on the wall because after episode 6 things definitely take a turn for the worse i wouldn't say the episodes actually become boring but a lot of the plot elements become a bit more clichÃ©d and i've got to say the final episode really left me feeling cheated i just wish the show's creators were given a fair chance the only other show that left me feeling like that was the first season of stargate sg 1 which just resonated tremendously feeling very true soulful and made from the heart surface was a great series and maybe one day some well heeled tv lover will see all the outpouring of emotion about the show's cancellation and bring back this show one can hope at least
<START> a sound of thunder one of the greatest short stories ever written by one of the grandest grand masters of fantasy ray bradbury what a great story br br but what a vomitous movie br br in bradbury's science fiction short story a company called time safari offers big game hunters the opportunity to go back in time and kill dinosaurs rule number one is stay on the path a floating metallic that ensures no interaction with the prehistoric environment during a hunt a man steps off the path and inadvertently crushes a butterfly when the hunting party returns to the present the world as they know it has drastically changed though there are paradoxes in any time travel story bradbury's tale was a quick jugular stroke a parable of the ripple effect br br a sound of thunder was published in 1952 according to wikipedia the most science fiction story of all time and illustrated chaos theory darwinism and the butterfly effect which would only be coined in the 1960s by edward lorenz in bradbury's story the wonder of time travel was overshadowed by corporate greed in turn overshadowed by the mortal danger to humanity's existence itself br br while in the movie a sound of thunder directed by the uneven peter capricorn one 2010 odyssey two a clutch of bad actors goes through the time portal again and again to try to rectify their mistakes like an excrement version of back to the future the movie has nothing to do with bradbury's powerful tale except the initial jolt of the time traveling prehistoric hunting party egregious liberties are taken with bradbury's story baboon faced reptiles plants overrunning chicago's concrete time waves rippling through the city cgi insectoids for which bradbury should sue the pants and underpants and ass hairs off the filmmakers br br novice writers thomas dean donnelly joshua oppenheimer and gregory should start a big balls agency for thinking they could actually add elements to a ray bradbury story that would improve it how do these guys walk in a straight line with balls this big ben kingsley is the corporate owner of time safari with a so bad it looks like a edward burns is his lead hunter travis and catherine mccormack who was in braveheart is the scientist with the best breasts br br i can't possibly relate the hundreds upon thousands of egregious stupidities and asinine pieces of dialog but here is just one spoken by david oyelowo as some kind of scientist he refers to the pleiades star cluster the seven sisters they look like stars don't they but each of them is a whole galaxy uh no idiot scientist they're actually uh stars br br those three morons who rewrote bradbury's story forgot they didn't know anything about physics or astronomy or writing br br best part of the movie is catherine chest straining against her disheveled one size too small blouses br br review by the cucumber for movie mania
<START> stay the hell away from this one no really i'm serious i know you might think this is a fun campy cheesy hong kong action style b movie i did but trust me it's not in fact the only thing accurate about that description would be the words hong kong and then only used in a strictly geographical sense br br yes donnie yen has co directed it jackie chan has a cameo the guy ekin cheng from storm riders plays the lead it got vampires it should be good or at least fun charming and action packed once again it's not br br i could digress on why this movie sucks i could dissect it hack it to tiny shivering pieces but where to start there's so much to hate br br to make it easier and to give this hate fest some let me say that i'm usually a big fan of hog kong cinema the heavier drama stuff as well as the more lighthearted action and or comedy the really good movies as well as the really cheesy ones i can sit through hours of bad subtitling jokes lame enough to make first graders roll their eyes i can handle lovers as chaste and celibate as a convention of nuns that and pretty much anything else the average film goer would bang their metaphorical toes against on their way between action sequences also hong kong or any other origin i love it when a movie goes from just being bad to bad enough to be good br br but this arrgh it's just horrible stupid unwatchable garbage so far from being funny or charming it's actually painful so derived of action it makes a bergman movie look like the texas chainsaw massacre br br why why waste such an opportunity this could have been so much fun
