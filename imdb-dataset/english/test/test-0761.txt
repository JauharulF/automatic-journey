<START> spoilers spoilers spoilers just a few small ones br br saw this on channel missed the first 30 min of movie will keep this comment short and informative br br the movie is basically about 5 characters the acting is very bad for afew characters 1 girl with the help of another girl kidnaps 3 different people but it backfires and the 3 kidnap the 2 this is one of those types of movies where the script writers try to be thought provoking or philosophical mysterious and you get the point but do to their own personal lack in thinking they fall terribly short like one of the captives who is supposed to be some type of psychology nerd looks the part but his tongue can't speak it the writers think that if the nerd uses a lot of 8 letter words amateurishly unknowingly i believe that the viewers will be ignorant enough to believe it i wish i could give an example but i cant recall any exactly as it was said the ending was bad as well but the one female captive acted her role as an old and relatively wise lady although she as well as the rest had a lot of clichÃ© s br br so why would i give this movie a 7 stars if i thought all the above simple i give the entire seven stars to lisa keller one sexy a momma she is fine lol i am an appreciator of beauty and she is exactly that but don't get me confused because i'm not a pervert and this movie is not a porno in any way their is somethin about her i cant explain but i like it i remember the scene where a captive has broke free and as he looks for a way out bumps into keller she tries to get way but she doesn't have a chance he throws her down kneeling on the stairs and he pulls her pants down no panties now although she has an amazing ass and the this shot leaves little to the imagination for a long 30 seconds i think it was her facial expression that got me she wanted it and that look had me thinking i was behind that i would have torn that booty up after that expression i jus couldn't look at her objectively anymore i was in love lol i am glad to have seen this movie but if lisa keller wasn't playing the lead role i would have changed the channel well after i had seen the scene i mentioned above i am a lisa keller fan know but is seems that she isn't a consistent actor seeing this 2003 movie is her latest but i am lookin forward to another movie with her in it
<START> lots of scenes and dialogue are flat out goofy but when you add it all up i e daily cycle from depressing to depressing bar to depressing burlesque hall to depressing smoke filled poker games and back home again you get a weird sense that somebody somewhere is trying to give a faithful depiction of the life circa 1955 whether it's sinatra who obviously would have bumped up against this type of character growing up in hoboken and working in numerous bands or preminger who uses the soundtrack and the frankie subtext to slip the addict's interior worldview past the hays code cage you get a good companion piece to on the waterfront which was filmed almost exactly the same time sort of a faux realist work that leaves you realistically wondering how deep the drug culture is embedded in american life
<START> i watched this on tv in 1989 and regretted not taping it i was very intriguing and suspenseful it is amazing as the events unfold and this man's past catches up with him br br the acting is first rate and the story is exactly what the title claims twist of fate but no one could run away from a life that this man had at the beginning of the movie
<START> i have never seen a movie so bad it's not even entertaining enough to be a drinking game br br it's so bad i don't even want to talk about it and that's the whole point of this isn't it please don't bother to see this movie said
<START> i am 17 and a biased muppet fan and while i love treasure island christmas carol and great muppet caper the muppet movie absolutely deserves to be up there with the best of them it is enormously entertaining thanks to the snappy script by jerry and the film looks lovely with some beautifully staged musical numbers speaking of the songs i really liked them sure they aren't the best song score out of the muppet franchise but they were very nice to listen to especially never before never before is now one of my favourite muppet songs along with first time it happens and professional pirate the muppets as usual were fantastic particularly the always delightful miss piggy and the chemistry between kermit and fozzie was great and what a brilliant human cast from bob hope to orson welles from madeleine kahn the same wonderful actress who brought us hilarious movies like what's up doc blazing saddles and clue to cloris leachman from steve martin to richard pryor all of whom made memorable guest appearances if careful not to overshadow the muppets in a fantastic film 10 10 bethany cox
<START> this short is one of the best of all time and is proof just like most of charlie chaplin's work that sound and color are not requirements for quality work in fact this cartoon uses and may have started some of the gags and devices that became standard in animation in later years like caricatures of celebrities including the afore mentioned chaplin while the characters are silent they do speak by use of word balloons just like in the comics given that felix started out in newspapers as a comic strip this device is a natural the atmosphere and style of the short is completely harmonious with that of the comic strip while adding another dimension literally and figuratively and makes this short a delight to watch well worth taking the time and effort to get most highly recommended
<START> when i went to see this film let's not say that i had high expectations but merely that i had a faint hope that this full length feature would have at least some of the hilarity and wit of tv's da ali g show br br but as one might expect this cannot translate from a half hour tv show to a 90 minute film the movie had no appeal what so ever and resorted entirely to toilet and juvenile sexual humour basicaly i should have ditched it halfway through but was silly enough to think it might somehow improve by the end how wrong i was i loved the show but hated the movie this movie is only for those who find fellatio by canines amusing
<START> i was lucky enough to see this film at a festival last year and had half expected it to get a release the fact that it was shot on a digital camcorder has surely inhibited its success but as i understand it was never the intention of the film maker to make it look like film in the first place it was more about the story the characters and their relationships is that not what films are supposed to be about but it did have a quality in the texture of its visual appearance that suggests may thomas is onto something we should pay attention to for independent film makers and producers alike who have a the talent and lacking the money and drive a lot can be learned from watching this film technically it has everything going for it the use of light music etc by far outweigh that of any other digital feature film i have ever seen and therefore it is worthy of much praise the actors performances are believable to a point if not slightly under played i felt there was much more in there more depth in particular from the male lead john paul clarke but one thing that really does bother me as a film maker myself is the film being in black and white a need to cover up a multitude of sins than if it was colour do we have more to learn in the progression of digital technology or is this the future of wonderful affordable film making
<START> did this gem go direct to video fabulous art direction mood that never misses a beat the truman show meets metropolis an excellent cast i've never seen laura dern better and bill macy is always fabulous same said for david paymer and meat loaf this is just an incredible film
<START> i thought that this was actually the best vampire movie that i've ever seen i've seen a lot too the effects were great and the casting was brilliant it was an all around good movie the makeup and costumes were great too i would recommend it but not for kids it's not a children's movie
<START> i am not a fan by any means but watched this with a friend as there wasn't anything else on the box at the time thank goodness not only did we laugh from start to finish but about a week later in the pub when we started discussing it we made a right spectacle of ourselves with uncontrollable laughter does that pitch actually exist i have released my e mail here so if anyone hears about it's future availability or a repeat on the telly please let me know definitely the funniest thing i've seen on television king leek was good too another tim healy classic
<START> being relatively young i didn't know how bad anti semitism was in brooklyn where my family is originally from this movie absolutely horrified me i've seen many movies about prejudice racism and anti semitism but this seemed to hit me harder than most br br this was definitely one of the best indie films i've ever seen i had to travel 45 minutes to see it and it was well worth it nearly everything about the movie was great sometimes it was a little slow but that didn't really bother me because the movie was very atmospheric it took place in the 40s and it really did look like it was the 40s the acting was great william h macy as always was wonderful so was laura dern and i was pleasantly surprised by performance playing the vicious anti semite neighbor br br 9 10
<START> i have no idea why everyone hates this movie to call it garbage a travesty an sequel is just unfair i mean what else could they have made for a sequel then cause seriously i think it should have had a sequel rodney dangerfield says hey everyone were all going to get laid and then a little dancing and thats it thats the end of caddyshack even though the film rating on first one was r and the second one was pg it was still lots of fun br br 7 10
<START> in most parts a lethally dull venture is about this dancer choreographer who regards herself as some kind of auteur beyond the petty commercial compromises that people around her including her actor beau abhishek bachchan build their careers on nice idea only it turns out that she has the most bad concepts about costumes and dance movements stuff rotten enough to make even the forces behind those ultra cheap south indian potboilers squirm in severe embarrassment br br the story follows a yawn inducing predictable pattern dancer and beau meet and have an affair yes sex included beau gets success but she spurns his attempts to help her beau throws attitude and they walk out on each other dancer meets a most unlikely director who wants her 'to do what she incongruous effort bags even more incongruous popularity attempts to reach out are rebuffed until a climax where he bursts out about how he can't live without her d uh end br br actually i didn't really expect this film to be much good so why did i watch it because i have an fetish she's an actress with imo sufficient talent to reach grand heights provided she has the opportunity alas her role in the film looks far better on paper than in actual execution ironic for a film that's supposed to be about an uncompromising character to give her credit she puts in a game effort shining well in the few scenes that actually ask of her as an actress i just wish the movie had been more worthy of her abhishek bachchan also throws in a few good punches the last scene salvaged somewhat by a simmering turn which pleasantly reminds you of his father br br only recommended if you can sit through humongous piles of for the return of a few of good moments courtesy the lead actors
<START> i originally posted the first user comment on this movie and claimed it was crap and it didnt make sense i didnt make sense campfire tales is a thoroughly enjoying film now that im 2 years older and watched it last night the actors were famous but not too famous the acting itself was more than acceptable it was rather good i will rate the movie per segment of films br br 1 the black and white scene a k a the hook this one was rather pointless it looked good but didnt hold much grip at all the only disappointing one i dont think it was even included as a segment here is the scare o meter br br poor br br 2 the r v story honeymooners stuck in woods possibly the most entertaining of all tales the acting was good in this one too dissapointing bout the typical caravan sex scenes yet it was you think who was knocking on that door it had suspense and not too gory liked this one br br very good br br 3 internet chat tale little girl meets psycho this was a smart addition gore left at a minimal frights left at extreme although dull at times the last few minutes were most entertaining dont get me wrong it was still fun to watch real creepy and could happen to anybody so watch who youre talking to br br very good br br 4 ghost tale man kisses ghost not the best it wasnt too atmospheric for a ghost tale this one was strange the aspects were rather good playing music and the screaming but everything was too real to be ghastly although it was good it was quiet bloody and could have been better with that idea br br acceptable br br 5 the ending the 4 lost teenagers these are the 2 attractive gals and guys telling the tales through out the film the best thing about the film is the ending it set a great impression the ending was totally un expected watch it it was so well done the realism was spectacular br br top notch br br 6 the film overall campfire tales was more than i used to take it for i actually like it so much now im buying it on video cause its a truly entertaining horror movie forget the trash you see these days like many im dissapointed that this didnt really go nowhere it was straight to video to me it was better than all the hype horror you see these days overall for campfire tales br br very good br br 8 out of 10
