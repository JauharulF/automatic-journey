<START> solomon and sheba has come down in hollywood lore not for the quality of the film but for the fact that tyrone power died while making it i was in the 5th grade and well remember the huge news for days when that tragedy happened i didn't know who tyrone power was then but i learned and learned to appreciate the body of his work br br i often wonder if ty had a sense about this film and what a dud it proved he was the unnamed producer of this as well maybe he just didn't want to face the critics good thing power actually went out with witness for the prosecution although you can see him in long shots if you look close br br what we have here is a biblical stew that probably would baffle the great solomon himself several incidents described in the bible that the bible treats separately are woven together into one plot with a few additions tossed in by hollywood br br the actual story about the queen of sheba is that she went on a trade mission to the kingdom of israel solomon up a bit came back with a lot of trade goods and that was that the story of a romance between her and solomon is of legend the ancient kingdom of sheba is about where yemen is now and her people purportedly moved to the african continent which is how ethiopia was founded br br the queen never witnessed solomon's famous case involving the two women with separate claims for a baby nor was she involved with the building of the first temple nor was she around for the destruction of same for that matter neither was solomon br br and she was not involved in the dispute over the succession when solomon's brother put in a that is the heart of this film upon hearing the news that king david is dying declares himself king of course david rallies temporarily and says that god came to him and said solomon should succeed him when david hears about what did he says that's what got god all bent out of shape being greedy after that gets to plotting br br things seem to come full circle in that ty power collapsed on the set while dueling with george sanders as sanders and power were rivals in many films most particularly in of london which was power's breakthrough role if sanders is not quite the jaded sophisticate he was in samson and delilah he's still sanders the biblical cad br br when power died yul brynner was brought in to play solomon and given a wig so that existing footage of power in long shot could be salvaged brynner invests the dialog with the proper dignity but i think he probably regretted doing the pinch hitting br br gina lollobrigida is the queen of sheba and she is alluring as a biblical temptress in the cecil b demille tradition she seems not to have any real conviction and my guess is she was shocked at power's sudden demise and having to do it all over again marisa as may give the best performance in the film br br the real story with is not as elaborate as this film he disputed with solomon for the succession and gathered around a group of some of king david's court as supporters solomon pardoned them once and then asked for in marriage in the bible and here was an adopted daughter of king david in his old age when solomon hears that he decides is getting greedy again and has him killed the bible mentions someone named who was going around basically doing contract hits on supporters br br what we have in the film is a spectacular climax involving a miracle that i searched for and couldn't find it came from the fertile imagination of director king vidor who ended a long and distinguished career on a sour note it was a question of vidor trying to out do cecil b demille in biblical spectacle br br he didn't make it
<START> i remember being so excited on saturday nights when i was a kid waiting for dr who i thought it was the best show ever made then i grew up dr who went off the air and no one i knew had ever heard of it then i found out there was going to be a new series i was a little nervous about it was it going to live up to the expectations i had carried around since i was little would they screw it up would the dr suck would his assistant suck would they create a more intimate relationship with the dr and his assistant yes no no no no this show is wonderful i love the new dr i love his assistant i love the show and i find myself excited on friday nights now waiting for the new episode i'm just now seeing 2005 episodes as i live in the states so i'm a little behind the rest of you i hope the next dr is as great as this one
<START> a typical old b w film the dialogues are sometimes good but too often especially in the second half they get naive sometimes awfully naive occasionally close to the point where they are unintentionally comical the first third with its background information on ladd's gatsby shown with a series of interesting flashbacks is the best part of the movie but once gatsby moves into his new villa and makes his moves on betty field the film gets overly melodramatic the ending is yet another cop out ending i don't know whether the novel itself contains this dumb clichÃ©d ending or whether the movie's producer made some changes to it but i've always considered car accidents to be a poor way to add drama to the conclusion of a story i've seen this plot device a million times or if it's not a car then it's a fall from a horse the writer doesn't know how to end the story but he knows that he wants it to be dramatic so he adds in a car accident lame and to make things worse the accident is outrageously coincidental and preposterous both plot wise and time wise plot wise because field's husband's mistress winters gets killed by field and the fact that winters sort of rushes out from the gas station into the street as though she'd never noticed in the years that she had lived in it that there was a dangerous road right across her house and of course at the very moment that she comes out she sees ladd's car and mistakes it for field's husband's car and then shouts over here i'm here run me over and make the ending tragic that way time wise because ladd and field get involved in an accident at the very day when they are preparing to tell field's husband about their affair basically there is just too much forced and artificial irony in this accident it also doesn't exactly help this movie how husband da silva goes on a revenge mission to kill the guy who ran over his wife he basically does this by walking around like a zombie going from car to car looking for scratches and acting very badly indeed both da acting and his character's behaviour throughout the film are awful and confusing respectively br br scott fitzgerald was upset on a couple of occasions how his novels were adapted for the screen by hollywood's screenwriters and although he was dead long before this movie was done he might have been right to complain judging by this film's naive script or maybe his novels are even sillier and more naive than this film and were actually improved upon by the screen adaptations or the films are pretty much like the novels i could of course read this particular novel to find out but i just can't be bothered fitzgerald's name doesn't exactly inspire me to read any of his books and i don't mean the way his name sounds he was certainly no heller or twain more like hemingway Â a lot of noise about nothing
<START> as far as i know this was my first experience with icelandic movies it's such a relief to see something else than your regular hollywood motion picture too bad that movies like this one have a small chance of succeeding in the big world i can only hope that people watch this by accident by recommendation or other br br because it's really worth while i left the cinema feeling really sad i couldn't get the tragic destiny's of the characters out of my head and it impressed me even more when i thought of the complexity of the film not only was it a tragic story it had excellent comic reliefs and a very good soundtrack br br if you have the opportunity watch it it's really thought provoking and made me ponder a lot br br
<START> rented this from my local video store it was titled black horizon i guess someone felt this was good enough for a 2004 re release br br micheal dudikoff is not a ninja in this movie one of the major flaws of this film right off the bat another major flaw would be that ice t's action scenes are stolen from other movies particularly the first scene of his rescue which is directly from the wesley snipes movie the art of war with ice t edited in i hope they paid for that footage br br the plot is awful the special effects had little effort put into them love those wires holding them in space the acting is wooden also love those new york russian accents ice t being in the movie is pointless these guys also forgot the fact that there is no gravity in space but i guess they weren't worried about it br br micheal dudikoff should go back to doing what he's good at and make american ninja 6
<START> five medical students kevin bacon david william baldwin dr joe hurley oliver platt randy julia roberts dr rachel kiefer sutherland nelson experiment with clandestine near death afterlife experiences re searching for medical personal enlightenment one by one each medical student's heart is stopped then revived br br under temporary death spells each experiences bizarre visions including forgotten childhood memories their flashbacks are like children's nightmares the revived students are disturbed by remembering regretful acts they had committed or had done against them as they experience afterlife they bring real life experiences back into the present as they continue to experiment their dramatically intensify so much so some are physically overcome thus they probe transcend deeper into the death afterlife experiences attempting to find a cure br br even though the dvd was released in 2007 this motion picture was released in 1990 therefore kevin bacon william baldwin julia roberts kiefer sutherland were in the early stages of their adult acting careers besides the plot being extremely intriguing the suspense building to a dramatic climax the script being tight convincing all of the young actors make what is now an all star cult semi sci fi suspense who knew 17 years ago that the film careers of this young group of actors would skyrocket i suspect that director joel schumacher did
<START> this is the worst film i've seen in a long long time never mind the fact that so many useful things keep appearing on this island how convenient the acting is beyond poor from the outset its like one of those really badly scripted soft porn films on channel 5 a complete waste of time and i cant remember the lead actors name but i cant believe he still gets work i've never seen him act i've seen him in lots of films but i've never seen him act here are a few of the blaringly obvious errors apparently petrol lighters still work even when they've been soaked in sea water also according to this film you can walk into the sea naked but come out wearing bikini bottoms i'm guessing the camera man and editor were students there are plenty more errors but i'm ranting now besides its no so much the errors as the cast the script and the whole film avoid at all costs
<START> once again elmer is faced with the dilemma of who to shoot bugs of daffy he's unsure of what season it is and bunny and duck arguing help matters not though bugs proves he's the smartest once more by repeatedly using reverse psychology on daffy in increasingly subtle ways and when that runs out he does his trademark cross dressing thingy daffy freaks out and demands the bunny be shot though elmer is too stupid he is hopelessly in love with the girl bunny thing elmer really is to blame for all this if he weren't so dumb he'd know it really is duck season and just blast daffy but poor old can't believe the utter of the situation his cruel plans of misdirection have been foiled by elmer's dumbness daffy is so shocked that he even goes home with elmer to be blasted in his living room br br poor he rules
<START> i didnt know what to expect i only watched it on a rainy sunday afternoon on pay tv right from the start it drew me in the music and settings and characters were excellent i hadnt heard of any of the actors but they all were outstanding a wonderful thriller br br now that ive read other comments on this movie referring to past versions and the book i will be endeavouring to find out more on this great movie
<START> but not this one i always wanted to know what happened next we will never know for sure what happened because gwtw was margaret's baby i am a lifelong fan of gone with the wind and i could not have been more repulsed by the movie i did compare scarlett to the original gwtw because any film worth following gwtw needed to be on the same quality level as the first rhett was cast beautifully although no one will ever compare to mr gable i am also a strict vivien leigh fan she was scarlett she fit the bill not another actress in this lifetime or another will ever fit the same shoes but with scarlett the job could have been done better not enough thought went into finding the proper scarlett that was evident br br overall something to look to but if you want to know the what happened to scarlett and rhett i suggest writing it yourself or finding fan fiction this movie is not worth the time
<START> an excellent example of what happens when one central body controls everyone i liked this movie because glenn corbett also appeared in star trek as cochrane in 1967 i also liked it because i am a fan of the apollo space program
<START> this move is terrible they took gods word and made a mockery of it the acting was terrible too why bother doing a story on something from the bible when your not even going to tell it correctly there were not just a few changes but the whole thing was wrong do not see this movie
<START> i have seen this movie more than 50 times in my life and each time i watch it the movie is just as entertaining as it was the first time george berger played by treat williams leads a small group of 1960's 1970's era anti war hippies living at large in new york city this small group happens upon a young man claude bukowski played by john savage who has been drafted into the us army for service in vietnam despite their best efforts to dissuade him claude does eventually report for basic training in the army still distressed over his having left them the hippie group steal a car and travel across the usa to visit claude for a couple of hours in the words of george berger to an m p stationed at the entry gate of the army base claude is temporarily stationed at in nevada the outcome is truly touching so i won't spoil it for those who have not yet seen this fantastic movie the musical score is equally fantastic don of the rock group chicago who plays the part of woof one of the hippies is a not a key character but the movie wouldn't have been the same without him beverly d'angelo who plays sheila franklin an uptown girl who is befriended by the hippie group is sensational in her role a must see film
<START> this is so blatantly a made for tv ripoff of black widow 1987 even the insect titles are so similar br br if you want a better marrying for money movie check out black widow starring debra winger theresa russell br br these movie is cheesiness at its best i just had to watch it entirely to see how it ended
<START> i thought this was a very good tv series and i would like to see it continue it really got interesting there at the end and i really want to see where it is going from there some times we are to quick to kill a series without giving it a chance i think this one needs a chance to go on and i will definitely be waiting for it the ocean is one of the places that man knows so little about and i think that is a mystery in itself what is waiting for us beneath the waters of the world it is even said that man maybe crawled out or out of the waters many millennium ago is this a new evolution coming about are we going to move down the food chain or fight for our position
