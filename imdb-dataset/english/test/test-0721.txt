<START> demon wind is about as much fun as breaking your legs it is definitely an awful example of a film so awful in fact that i don't even consider it a movie i describe it more as a thing a monstrous thing a thing that must be stopped at all costs my friends and i first discovered this thing buried under a big box of video tapes at my friend's house it was a late night and we had nothing better to do so we decided to watch some cheesy horror movies we unfortunately picked this one well during the 90 minutes that this thing played we ended up laughing so hard that we almost threw up the thing is literally pointless in every sense of the word it's just a cheap poorly done rip off of evil dead the whole story seems to be nothing more than some guy wanting to knock off his friends by inviting them to an abandoned house and letting demons rip them to pieces i have a bet that the writers were actually writing the story while it was being filmed i've seen bad horror movies before manos troll 2 hobgoblins shudder i would have to say that demon wind could definitely contend with any and all of these films on terms of sheer stupidity watch it only if you enjoy laughing at stupid films br br fun fact this film is like a cockroach on steroids much like the board every time we try to get rid of it it always seems to mysteriously reappear kind of scary huh
<START> i reveal two 'twists' at the end of the film do not read if you want to watch this movie for some reason br br oh my this is bad and for some reason sean bean one of the greatest present day actors has sold his soul and appears in it the only consolation is that the scriptwriters must have realised that someone as ultimately pathetic as steve guttenberg could never in his life aspire to kill someone as cool as sean bean instead he is killed in what must have seemed like a marvellous twist at the end by the good guy who was meant to be be killed by bean but was actually his boss and faked his own death don't worry i haven't ruined anything for you the acting itself is spectacularly apalling with patented hey look i can pull a chuck norris face hard man stare dominating most of the two hours of hell on earth added to a plot that i could have written whilst being tortured and hung upside down with both hands cut off there is also a completely nonsensical critical error in the fact that one moment the virus will escape if they so much as look at it wrong while another moment steve guttenberg is bravely running around with it throwing catching bashing and generally abusing this which has the distinct look of a collection of those little balls of soap you put in your bath my final word if you are suicidally depressed and feel like you want to laugh manically at something that should be a bad comedy but even worse isn't tape it next time it's on channel 5 at midnight then burn it when you realise that i am indeed telling the truth
<START> eddie monroe is he is a great actor and i could be his girl anytime he's so fine i was so sad at the end i'm not going to ruin the end but wow girls are so vicious his girl was wrong if eddie was my man i would never disrespect those mobsters were spooky the moral of the story is trust no one your friends will hurt u if they can oh and eddie tell your girlfriend that yo mine she should move ova i would suggest seeing the movie why i said so it kept my eyes on the screen my sister loved it also so i am going to see it again because now my friends want to see it and its worth seeing two times peace happy new year
<START> this is a love story set against the back drop of television news the three main stars william hurt holly hunter and albert brooks create a love triangle whilst working at the washington bureau of a tv network br br tom hurt is the handsome reporter who is being groomed to be a star jane hunter is the producer who recognises that tom lacks the intellectual gravitas to be a real journalist but falls for him anyway aaron altman brooks is the man who shares her beliefs in journalistic standards is also the man who truly loves her br br holly hunter was nominated for a best actress academy award but lost out to cher moonstruck she was robbed this is hunter's film her character jane is smart ruthless and totally driven she is also hilariously neurotic her performance is perfect just watch her face when she watches the tape of tom's interview of a rape victim the scales literally fall from her eyes br br wiliam hurt's performance is less showy he plays a man who is well aware that he is a and a fraud but is smart enough to know that his rise will be facilitated by people like jane he gives little hints of a man who is extremely calculating br br the film comments on celebrity journalism integrity and the commercial pressures on news in a medium that is focused on the bottom line it predicted that news would be dumbed down that standards would slowly be lowered due to commercial pressures br br think about this this film was released before the end of the cold war and before rise of reality tv yet it predicted the dumbing down of the news paris hilton's release from jail was treated like a major news story to see how prophetic this film is just watch your evening news and note the set the graphics and the presenters tom and his clones are well and truly alive
<START> one would think that anyone embarking upon a followup to the groundbreaking naked civil servant of 30 plus years ago would at the very least try to honor the original with some kind of inspired vision but no here we have a sort of biopic of one of the most stylish people of the late 20th century that itself boasts no style whatsoever true the filmmakers have assembled some outstanding actors and handed them a chipped mug of drab gruel to work with everything in the infrastructure of this film is wrong starting with the script which is another one of those tv movie of great lives wherein every other line is a famous quote by the subject and every other scene is an in your face introduction to the next pivotal character in the subject's life we get swoozie kurtz as a pr maven who promotes crisp as a stateside entertainer denis o'hare as the editor of a gay periodical who hires crisp as film reviewer becomes somewhat alienated from him when he appears indifferent to the passions of 80's aids activists and then returns to the fold as a compassionate friend of the dying octogenarian jonathan tucker in a fine performance as a shy insecure painter of gay themed canvases who is befriended by crisp and finally cynthia nixon as performance artist and woman about bohemia penny arcade who intrigued by persona offers him a spot in her traveling cabaret act nixon is a persuasive and gifted performer but is given no chance by the script to embody the down to earth and streetwise arcade crisp spent the last 20 years of his life in a one room flat in an old tenement building in manhattan's east village he famously said that he never cleaned because after a few years the dust doesn't get any worse or something like that but looking at the depiction of that flat in this film you'd never get the flavor of that he frequented a local coffee shop on a busy avenue and would be seen pretty much each day of the week sipping tea and watching the world go by in this film we get a diner that looks like something on 12th avenue by the hudson river most of the streets of new york scenes have a sterile unreal look with no sense of the period br br the soul of this film is the great john hurt in the title role after nearly 35 years he can still grasp the essence of this peculiar post edwardian englishman and put it across to third his every line every gesture is exquisite in the later scenes he even his vocal projection to suit that of a person whose life is winding down toward death crisp wrote shortly before he left this realm that when one grows very very old one's skin takes on the character of a smelly overcoat that cannot be removed and one longs for death one senses that feeling in hurt's performance so for him and him alone this film is worth a look
<START> personally i loved movie my best friend told me about it so i rented it out a watched it it's amazing the music the acting the story lines the emotion everything well except for one minor fact absolutely no loyalty to the books at all i saw this movie before interview with the vampire and before i even knew the books existed so i was shocked to find how many people actually hated the movie i picked up quickly that the book fans weren't at all happy with the unfaithfulness not wanting to be hypocritical i hate the harry potter movies due to lack of book loyalty i stayed silent eventually i picked up the vampire lestat and understood immediately why everyone hated it it is completely different the movie queen of the damned is a combination of the vampire lestat and the queen of the damned but i still loved the movie from when i saw it before reading any of the books so if you haven't seen this movie or read the book watch the movie first or you'll hate it if you have read the book then you have every right to hate this movie
<START> a blind person could have shot this movie better seriously the director is clearly a novice he must be dennis hopper's coke dealer or something to convince him to be in this movie i felt so embarrassed for dennis br br to john the director please retire from directing your contribution is not needed nor wanted the medium of film is stronger without you you are terrible at directing stick to bagging groceries or something br br this movie should've bypassed straight to video and gone to the trashcan i'm a dumber person for having seen this movie do not see this movie if you respect yourself and respect the of film
<START> it is often hard to decide what the best film is that you've ever seen since this may vary by genre preferences for actors actresses or even the mood you're in on a particular day having said that this movie is by far in my opinion the worst movie i've ever seen i thought the acting was terrible was there any the plot was just idiotic and the props were totally fakey could a lower budget production be created without being an amateur production i don't think so even the friends i watched the movie with agreed that it was the worst video we ever rented and to this day we still joke about the night we saw this movie
<START> being a huge laura gemser fan i picked this up at a rental outlet just to see another emanuelle film boy did i make a mistake br br emanuelle in egypt has nothing to do with emanuelle laura gemser is in it along with her husband gabriele but that is the only connection to emanuelle here laura plays laura original huh a beautiful supermodel who goes to visit her wealthy friend pia annie belle in egypt in tow are her a hole photographer carlo a haggard looking gabriele and some blonde woman who is never named also living in pia's mansion is horatio the sexy but dumb al cliver a mystique who speaks nothing but nonsense arriving for the weekend are pia's two daughters one a short haired lesbian and the other a brunette lots of sex is implied but hardly shown one good looking actor plays ali the egyptian servant who gets lucky with three of the women in the mansion laura has sex with the lesbian the lesbian has sex with horatio pia and the blonde have sex with horatio at an egyptian orgy laura drinks blood and is possessed during an egyptian ceremony carlo rapes laura it all happens with so little flair that emanuelle in egypt is one of the worst movies i've ever seen far from erotic even the actors themselves look bored during their sex scenes br br considering there were two famous couples in this film laura and gabriele al and annie the number of available sex scenes are uncountable instead a film that offers a top notch eurocult cast and never delivers the goods will piss every viewer off except the hardcore laura gemser completist otherwise steer clear of emanuelle in egypt
<START> people talk about how horrible the script was and how horrible the animation was but rainbow and the star stealer really is a japanese anime aimed towards children if you look at the anime today it's done in the same style and it's immensely popular i don't think this movie was ever intended to be viewed by adults just as i don't think it was ever intended to be serious the very things that people seem to hate about this movie are the things that i love rainbow is one of the best cartoon characters ever created in my opinion she's smart she's funny she cares about the she cares about her friends this movie can teach so much to young kids my little brothers even liked this movie i have to say this movie taught me a lot when i was a kid when it came out on dvd i was first in line to buy it it's a great kids movie so what if it's not perfect nothing is really perfect when you look closely enough at it
<START> landscape after a battle opens with escaping prisoners over a snowy field full of fences in rather funny movements accompanied by four seasons a touching opening but we soon enough learn to know these prisoners as a mob and when they also treated burry a man alive the protagonist stops for a moment but is soon more engaged in finding books from the camp than caring about his neighbour br br the rest of the film is set in an american camp from where the prisoners are not released in some kind of semi freedom semi camp a perfect set for a study of war criminality american camps polish nationalism grief and human misery in general br br film makes an important turn in comes women and with them film changes light colour and temper at the same time it turns out that these prisoners were slaves in holocaust i think a main underlying political theme of the film must mankind's treatments of jews under and after the world war and not only the nazi but mankind letting it happen and even forcing them out of europe after the war on an emotional level the film is about grief and the problem with letting grief come how environment makes grief difficult and how difficult it can be to share grief for people with different experiences br br but the film is a carpet of underlying contradictions humour irony and sudden beauty a couple of times during the film a gypsy prisoner plays on an harp an emotional tune brutally rejected speaking by the protagonist that example picks up an important essence of the film's style and theme when it comes to humour its very comic how the protagonist constantly looses and finds back his glasses in crowds in hay stacks etc br br its not hard to understand spielberg's respect of when you see this film the great treatment of light can be compared with spielberg on his best the grunwald speaks for itself it only brings the film out of the camp but it brings the film to dream and eternity with profound beauty anyhow there is also another scene i can't let go without comment its the christian supper undoubtly ironical but simultaneously deeply religious we see the moment everybody falling on their knees while the protagonist is saved from isolation by the priest to serve as a comic altar boy his bells are mocking the scene but also gives it emotion and love when nina gets her bread sun light falls upon her and bells ring its the peak moment of the film br br main actors are excellent in their roles as the perfect protagonist the doubting reflecting mind unable to put all the aspects of his mind and emotion into life beautiful is with great body acting debuting in a character unable to express all her inner in her proud movements br br those who try to describe everything often are unable to take nothing in consideration this is what manages his films are either very moving deep or beautifully shot but pays attention to life's and society's a moment of joy for one is the moment of irony for a second the moment of grief for the third a moment of nothing for the fourth br br there is at least two reasons to pay attention to films of this period first is the remarkable free expression of deep political impact this country was the first to overthrow communism twenty years later second is the development of a and narrative language that kusturica has rose to grandeur
<START> ok so some of the plot points might be a bit obvious but over all an interesting idea which works towards a tight ending the acting is solid particularly lachy hulme who plays one of the central characters in this ensemble piece he certainly has a screen presence and he is interesting to watch it has a low budget feel which works for the sort of thriller horror genre four jacks belongs to the film doesn't try to take itself to seriously which adds to the overall charm the character of phil dave has to be one of the most annoying character seen on screen since rupert pupkin king of comedy worth adding to a weekend pile of dvds
<START> this movie was downright awful most of the comedic scenes seem stale and trite and possibly the funniest scene in the movie had already been given away in previews the entire premise of the movie is so unbelievable and ridiculous its hard to really get into it the actors themselves portray the most unrealistic characters its not just the fact that the movies so hard to swallow but its how they keep forcing it down your throat expecting you to dumb down and accept it the plot itself is so shallow and easy to predict boy somehow gets rejected from every school he applied to i suppose he completely forgot about attending community college and decides to create his own school for fellow rejects all goes well for awhile until the validity of his school comes into question all the while the dorky character manages to woo his beautiful neighbor into falling for him with his witty sarcasm which apparently is a skill only he possesses then comes the final struggle with the students somehow all bonding together and fighting for the survival of the school of course the main character then persuades the state board of education to allow his school to stay alive with some inspirational speech this movie would have been more fun to watch if i was under the age of 16 and still ignorant of all college matters and issues
<START> as i am a fan of hospital and medical shows i have found this one gripping and sometimes humorous especially the scenes with dr whitman which brings a bit la light relief however i was looking forward to the last episode because i expected that the bad ones would be punished and the good ones reinstated instead of that the hospital management are making even more fools of themselves in an unbelievable manner and it's getting worse and worse for the good ones you can't help wondering what the unions are doing or doesn't rob donna and maria know what unions are there for besides never seeing the outside trees grass sunlight is a bit oppressive anyone understood what the last words were i e the answer rob lake gave to mrs children question why are you telling us all that it was very frustrating not to be able to understand it
<START> even die hard john wayne fans will have to concede that this film is a mess wayne's character john tobin is after the gang that killed his parents led by half apache half white renegade pandro earl posing as a mexican br br there are almost too many silly plot points to count but those that stand out include sheriff williams jack rockwell a captured around his boot so all has to do to get free is remove his boot friend dusty george pre gabby hayes takes a thrown knife in the back and comes back good as new for the rest of the story in a chase scene tobin rides a makeshift log through a drainage trough surrounded by log walls in the middle of a desert and missing his mark chases actually walks after on foot through the desert seeks relief and drinks from a pool of water but oops he didn't see the sign above the that states don't drink poison as collapses dead tobin resumes his chase after the remainder of the gang and captures the whole lot by blowing up a rock wall that seals a secret passage into cabin how convenient br br in the closing scene the new sheriff tobin is seen on the phone talking to the new mrs tobin sheila terry daughter ruby who earlier in the film was a kidnap target of gang apparently the studio was intent on wayne's getting the girl in virtually every film they made with him as this type of ending is completely predictable for almost all of lone star's films
