<START> brian what the hell were you on when you signed to do this br br i saw this recently at a festival and it was greeted by howling laughter throughout by the time the credits rolled tears were streaming down the faces of many of the audience br br the plot is a clunky melding of r ' and 'the x files' as cynically aimed at the tv audience as is possible to get without being sued the sequences involving the abductions are hilarious both yuzna's staging of the from the and mad george's pathetic plastic aliens drew gales of disbelieving derisive laughter br br limp camp and stupid my only hope is that it was an aberration as awful as 'return of the living dead 3' was good br br
<START> in this film there is a loose plot of a man bardem who wishes to obtain financing for his construction business and marries a woman he does not love the wide eyed maria de in the process he maintains his passionate relationship with his first and true love and ultimately gets entangled in his own romantic web he never gives up his juggling act until the three main characters come face to face the film results boring with lots of free sex well both girls are really good all the reactions in the film are absurd incoherent and of course too much stupid none of the characters are believable which makes the movie a little annoying anyway the acting is surprisingly good for such a bad directed film which makes it a little interesting but if you can watch another film please
<START> there are those who gripe that this is not the opera but then they don't quibble with the film of cabaret that was not the original show either all films of musicals operas are and have to be adaptations or they don't work cabaret took more liberties with the original show than did the film of and bess and yet it kept its original integrity reworking the material and is judged an artistic success the same holds true for and bess it reworked the opera into a dialogue song libretto because audiences at the time loved musicals but stayed away from the few echt filmed operas it would have been economical suicide for preminger to produce a film of the opera it would have lost a fortune for the goldwyn studios br br that said this is a fine adaptation the acting is excellent the oscar winning scoring of andre previn is magnificent as is the choral singing and the individual vocal achievements are incredible robert dad of popular musician bobby dubbed and adele addison dubbed bess while sammy davis jr sang his own songs in the film his recording contract would not permit his voice to be heard on the soundtrack album so cab calloway recorded his numbers spectacularly for that release brock peters' bass baritone is extraordinary and pearl bailey is her own unique self diahann carroll although a singer of fine note has the small role of clara which required a high soprano so old reliable marni nixon dubbed her singing br br the gershwin estate hates the film and refuses to grant the musical rights although the dramatic rights are in the public domain this sort of hate feud held up the video release of carousel for almost fifteen years although in that case it was the dramatic rights that were in litigation and is currently preventing both and bess and annie get your gun from being released on video br br of all the stage productions given film versions it is these latter two which are the sole holdouts to video only a campaign of letters to the gershwin estate in ny might loosen up the reserve
<START> i have to offset all the terrible comments i love this movie i own the movie and the soundtrack i watch it whenever i need a pick me up granted it's not like the sound of music but it's as much fun if picking at movies is not your thing i adored the late and great bobby and james has always and will always be a favorite i saw this when it first came out in the theaters i'm a big musical fan and this one is 100 times better than twiggy in the boyfriend it's a modern musical and shouldn't be judged by all that went before it's just the best for dreamers like me who wish they could find this place no illness no wars no drugs all the bad things in life are gone this is nothing more than a feel good movie that is what all movies should be about shaun phillips title song is superb and explains the entire feel of the movie if the acting isn't the greatest who cares i love the idea of the movie peter finch a very stiff actor liv gorgeous as ever sally kellerman surprisingly good voice michael york typical and olivia hussey stunning all convinced me they were normal run of the mill people not one of them acted like actors in a movie they acted like real people the same way i would act if i found this place torn between going home and staying there in awe of everything yes there are flaws in this movie but get over it it's not citizen kane it's a feel good musical
<START> where da vinci code introduced us to dr robert langdon and his knack for solving puzzles angels and demons ups the ante by providing a huge puzzle with an 8 hour limit br br with a cast of award winning actors ron howard does a good job of directing a story that was easy to follow and even easier to accept the da vinci code threw so many angles at you in such a short time that a quick bathroom break would leave you a bit confused on return i didn't feel this was with angels and demons the plot was straight forward and the action kept the interest level peaked throughout br br cardinal strauss armin mueller stahl was easily my favorite character in the movie his portrayal of the elitist yet misunderstood rank of the catholic church was very good and combined with the victim of his treatment patrick mckenna ewan mcgregor you will find yourself choosing sides immediately upon introduction there isn't a great amount of tom hanks time as the film focuses more on story than character development and this did well with me being that i had more than enough introduction from the first movie br br unfortunately i found character to be an unnecessary femme assistant in the quest since her lines were a bit limited and seemed much like an afterthought she does play a key role in the beginning of things but she soon fades into the background of being langdon's familiar more so than a necessary partner br br the plot is as such one of the organizations that the catholic church wronged in the past there have been quite a few has sought revenge in a most artistic manner some men of the church are kidnapped and are set to be executed at specific times until an ultimate end to the church itself will happen dr robert landon is brought in to help decipher the clues and teams up with the beautiful a scientist who witnessed a colleague die at the hands of the church's enemy br br music staying relevant and the cinematography beautiful i could chime on about this menial things but what makes angels and demons absolutely work is it's conclusion it was by far one of the most amazingly surprising endings i have seen in a movie and i was impressed at how off guard i was when it hit me like anyone else i appreciate a great wrap up and this movie wraps it up quite tight and drops a pretty bow on it needless to say i left the theater pleased at the movie in it's entirety br br if you are religious and unsure if this movie will offend your catholic principles i can say that where the davinci code painted catholicism as a shady cover up group of sadists angels and demons paints them with a much lighter brush the church is shown as being a collective of good men who are made to suffer for the sins of evil and misguided men who wore their colors and even a few who have infiltrated their modern ranks
<START> i have neither read the book on which the movie is based nor the letters between vita and violet if i came to this movie with any expectations whatsoever it was maybe that the group including among others virginia woolf and which the were part of would be depicted it wasn't which however wasn't a problem for me what i am wondering about is how the people behind this movie managed to make it in my opinion so very uninteresting and repetitive and most of the characters flat in spite of great material and some very good actors the script is simply not good enough i agree with the criticism of my finnish neighbor too many pointless sex scenes but only between the women while there is nothing explicit whatsoever concerning harold's numerous love affairs too many pointless scenes in general too little information about the background of characters it seems odd considering the quality of the production on the surface it seems a really ambitious piece of work but the script holds of course the most weight and that is where this movie fails br br vita's relationship with harold struck me as unconvincing although both of them act really well especially her the way they kept declaring their unconditional love for each other in a rather sappy manner i thought well simply unconvincing it makes a lot more sense that it should have happened through letters as points out i would also have liked to know where the nicknames came from the russian ones as well as mar why ever is someone called vita given the nickname mar it might be small stuff but it matters in contributing to the bigger picture br br i watched the movie with english subtitles on and where it should apparently have said it said instead that might explain my frustration with the nicknames to some extent i could not understand why vita's should be greek while violet's was russian
<START> this was a fantastically written screenplay when it comes to perceiving things from another perspective the comedy was timely and not overdone the acting was generally terrific and the plot line served a greater purpose of generating misconception when we think about people solely based on their external appearance the plot twists as the brother sister character of amanda bynes tries to play soccer on the boys team finding instead a new love interest along the way tatum channing is where the real lies and he does a fine job of acting disinterested at first later coming to realize the most important thing in life is friendship not attitude
<START> this was a very funny movie not oscar worthy but definately the best dollar i've ever spent at blockbuster rupert penry jones is a shining star and very well might be the new jude law so if you're in the mood for a british teen flick rent it
<START> this movie was horrendous it was sorta like accidentally watching a gay porn waiting for the girls but they just don't come i waited for almost 2 hours for the damn scarecrows they just don't come instead it's just some dumb ass wandering through a dead cornfield with a camera it's a mix of blaire witch and some bad episode of the twilight zone and the best part is that as of october 23 2005 they started filming a sequel please don't be fooled by the box even though it looks exactly the same as the first dark harvest it's not lions gate bought the rights to the maize the movie and had the brilliant idea to release it as the sequel to the original dark harvest which i thought was funny the only thing they had in common was they were both shot in a cornfield this movie not scare the crop out of you like the first one so just stay away
<START> is upset that he never has a big party like all the other kids spanky and the gang seek to remedy that by giving him a surprise party unaware that all the decorations and preparations are for him sabotages everything only to find out too late that the party is for him br br okay our gang comedy works in fits and starts the bits work but i don't think it really works as a whole part of the problem is that we all know where this is going and since much of the humor needs to have some form of surprise for it to work the whole thing falls down i think in a weird way the film just sort of misses its the type of thing that had they actually thought about it might have amounted to something more than a misfire worth trying if you lower your expectations
<START> this relic from before the days of the production code and the hays office is good fun not great but entertaining br br based on a song by rogers hart that was an enormous hit at the time the story revolves around dance hall girl barbara stanwyck who is romanced by wealthy businessman ricardo cortez who was indecently handsome but whose heart belongs to her bookish neighbor monroe she and marry but keep it a secret while she dismisses cortez who still holds out hope she helps hubby get a job in cortez's company but married bliss quickly turns sour as develops a taste for the high life and steps out with a college sweetheart and gambles in high stakes bridge yup i know it's pretty funny finally he embezzles 5 000 from cortez and is about to go on the lam when his devoted wife goes to cortez and i won't reveal anything else although the ending was certainly a surprise br br stanwyck is the best thing about this movie in one of her earliest roles she's quite accomplished is the weak point he's unattractive and sniveling while cortez is amazingly suave and sexy while his performance is earnest but unremarkable br br while ostensibly a drama it's filled with laughs many as some elements of this movie have aged very poorly but there are a lot of good witty lines at one point stanwyck says to cortez my brains are in my feet while yours are in that's pretty darn suggestive for 1931 there's a lot of bawdy and suggestive stuff in this flick in the last days before the code down and whitewashed everything an amusing antique a good reminder of how far we haven't come in 70 years this story could very easily be changed to fit 2003 but could keep the basic plot with the original ending in place
<START> also known as the tormented or the or the ridiculously titled the eerie midnight horror show is a forgotten exorcist rip off which contains one of the best horror moments i've ever seen the scene is when the crucifix comes alive this great spooky scene is unforgettable and totally effective great fxs it's a shame the rest of the movie doesn't maintain the level of creepiness exemplified during that scene br br this is one of the most frustrating movies ever imagine the producers deciding to to make an exorcist copy but while making it they actually succeed in creating something truly original a possessed sculpture of crucified man which is shocking when you think about it but then completely forgets their original idea in order to make a boring and uninspired exorcist rip off had the film continued with the possessed sculpture concept with the characters trying to destroy it etc this film would have rocked but once the girl becomes possessed by the spirit of the sculpture she never tells anyone from where the demon came from she and the script completely forgets the haunted crucifix which is stupid br br if you like so called euro cult movies the first 45 minutes deliver unlike any other euro cult movies but after the scene when the girl has a vision of being crucified and she gets the remaining 45 minutes suck boring it goes nowhere fast as it tries to emulate badly the exorcist so watch the first 45 minutes of and enjoy the 1970s fashions the sleaze and the amazing statue comes alive to ravish the girl scene but after the first 45 minutes press stop and eject and might as well go clip your toenails
<START> what i enjoyed most in this film was the scenery of being greek i adore my country and i liked the flattering director's point of view based on a true story during the years when greece was struggling to stand on her own two feet through war nazis and hardship an italian soldier and a greek girl fall in love but the times are hard and they have a lot of sacrifices to make nicholas cage looking great in a uniform gives a passionate account of this unfulfilled in the beginning love i adored christian bale playing the heroine's husband to be he looks very very good as a greek his personality matched the one of the greek patriot a true fighter in there or what one of the movies i would like to buy and keep it in my collection for ever
<START> i had the misfortune to watch this last night on the bbc i expect i may have been the only viewer from the beginning there was something quite wrong about the movie after a few minutes of viewing i managed to work out what it was the movie was bad not bad in a good way like wolfpack or a seagal film just plain old shoddy bad br br why was this made into a movie i've seen a few episodes of the tv series and thought it was alright but i only saw repeats of that because they made this br br i spent most of the film trying to work out what the story was and by the end i was none the wiser i seem to remember at some point a character maybe mentions that the mod squad can get in to places regular cops can't the turns out to be a one of the toughest places to get into maybe it was student night i lost track of the plot at this point or maybe there was no plot and the movie was just chopped together from various leftovers from other tv series remakes br br was it an action comedy i don't remember any laughs br br overall this movie lacked the real scene stealing power of someone like seymour hoffman as the bad guy with him ribisi would have had somebody to bounce off
<START> lou gossett jr is an excellent and captivating actor but to have him take the role of a president and then have him act like he's james bond running around carrying a gun and entering a warehouse to uncover a plot to kill christians and then being able to escape the supposedly high security facility to live another day does not do him justice this movie has so many unresolved issues br br i will attempt to list just a few br br 1 what was the purpose of a vaccine if no one is for example the preacher could have been if the tribulation force already had vaccine on hand later buck williams' wife goes to be with the sick preacher and she herself becomes sick so was the virus therefore contagious if it was contagious then why did ray and his wife go into the church without proper protection why didn't they become sick too and when chloe drank the wine and was cured how did she suddenly know the wine was the antidote was it california wine ordinary red table wine could red grape juice been adequate and if the preacher had received communion at least every time he preached maybe he would have had anti dote flowing through his body already buck and chloe got a heavy box of vaccine that was never used what mysterious message should we see in that br br 2 the presentation of evil forces who are working with the anti christ nicolai to destroy the world as being russian chinese etc is really a relic of the 1950's and the early james bond era and shows an ignorance of modern society and of humanity are we to believe that russians and chinese are perpetually trying to destroy this planet and for what purpose mere destruction this was such a narrow minded view of this world and was so clichÃ© as to be laughable br br 3 the main purpose of this movie was the scene near the very end where kirk cameron and lou gossett jr are proselytizing the non believers in the audience by showing kirk proselytizing lou it was a movie with no meaningful storyline too many disconnects with reality and a completely inappropriate plot for a great actor br br i therefore rank this as a 1 since zero is not available
