<START> i first read about the left behind series a few months ago and made a mental note to check it out since i have an interest in the way religion is used to control people in our ever more hate filled world so imagine my surprise and joy when i found a copy of left behind world at war in my local library innocently among the big budget action movies br br now as a movie it's extremely poor the acting is straight out of an elementary school production and the special effects would have looked dated in the early 90's being the third part of a series the story would be unintelligible to anyone who hadn't seen or read about the other left behind movies and even with my prior knowledge it was still pretty laughable br br on the religious front i don't think anyone who wasn't already filled with the spirit of the lord would find anything in the movie to convince them to change their ways how are you supposed to fear the antichrist when he's got a comedy russian accent and the worst of his powers are some pitiful cgi br br however my main problem with this movie is the blatant attempt to try and dupe people into believing that it's a big budget action movie upon picking up the box and reading the spiel i immediately noticed something odd nowhere on the packaging was there a mention of the true nature of this film to someone not in the know it would appear for all intents and purposed that left behind world at war was no different from the latest tom nor on the copy that i rented did it say anything about it being the third in a series br br considering the whole premise of the series is that the antichrist has deceived the whole world i find it extremely hypocritical that the film makers tried to deceive me twice before i even got the to counter if you're so firm in your beliefs then why not be honest about it br br the simple fact is had this not been a christian movie with the built in fan base that goes with it i seriously doubt it would ever have seen the light of day if cloud ten were hoping that i'd see the error of my ways and give myself to god i'm afraid to say i would have died of boredom and or laughed myself to death before i ever had the chance
<START> the hunting trilogy of rabbit fire 1951 rabbit seasoning 1952 and duck rabbit duck 1953 should be considered the comedic high water mark of the chuck jones michael maltese collaboration while they are seldom mentioned in lists of the greatest or most important cartoons in the history of animation they are certainly the funniest cartoons i've ever seen michael maltese never got the credit that directors like jones freleng or avery got but it's his dialogue and situations that make warner bros cartoons and these three in particular some of the funniest ever made
<START> i have seen this movie a number of times and find it very compelling and sad the lack of real emotion from most of the characters is very disturbing they seem empty hopeless the story is based on a real event br br a teenage girl is murdered by her boyfriend for no obvious reason apparently he just felt like it then he boasts about it to his friends and as they don't believe him he takes them to view the body a number of times no one reports the murder there are two strong leads keanu reeves and crispen glover crispen glovers character is seriously annoying br br keanu's character matt appears to be the only one who has a sense of right and wrong this is keanu at his best a flawless performance and very believable anyone who thinks this man can't act should watch this movie matt's little brother is almost the most disturbing character in the movie only twelve and no compassion or love factor in his life it is very sad to think there are kids out there like this it really makes you grateful for what you have 9 10
<START> the only redeeming feature of this movie is steve carell like john wayne i've never seen steve carell stretch too far as an actor but it doesn't matter he always plays his one role perfectly br br as marty feldman once said comedy must have internal consistency you can have 4 men on stage sitting in garbage cans and that's fine but if you bring a fifth man on stage who isn't in a garbage can you must then explain to the audience why he is not also in a garbage can br br why doesn't evan accept his role as a messenger of god why when he does accept it is he so profoundly embarrassed by it why isn't anyone more impressed with the way that animals follow evan around they are explained away by the unthinking doubters as trained animals possibly from a circus there's a terrible flood at the end and most everyone we see hops on the ark and is saved but surely thousands of people would have been killed by the flood there is no post disaster emotional atmosphere at the end instead most of congress has finally seen the light and is about to prosecute the lone bad congressman for profiteering br br i gotta admit i also liked the fish in the aquarium reacting to the presence of evan
<START> there is not much of a plot to this movie there is a wealthy baseball team owner who dies and whose wife is going to sue the hospital for not much more than that but it does not matter br br it does not matter because you have some real actors giving their dialogue life and because of the cast you have yourself some hysterically funny scenes and even if you're not cracking up laughing you have a smile on your face br br matthau plays charley whose wife recently passed away and who finds himself the object of desire of several women at the hospital he is delighted to taste everything on the menu available to him then he meets anne atkinson glenda jackson who at first is a patient in the hospital their first scene together is very funny and then they meet up again on a television panel discussion show where they disagree on nearly every topic that is discussed br br charley begins to like anne and vice versa except that she is very big on monogamy in the men in her life her husband was a cheater and they decide to give it a shot two weeks of faithfulness br br i will not give away anything else but i want to mention the chemistry that matthau and jackson have on screen she is usually not the first person anyone would think of for a romantic middle aged comedy but her touch with comedy is very light and agreeable she is matched every step of the way by matthau who is more charming than ever he does not have to play mr sensitive or mr macho to get the girl he just has to be himself br br art carney is a riot all by himself as a practically senile doctor the scene where the baseball team owner's ashes are buried at home plate is priceless he also has a very funny scene in a parking lot with richard benjamin richard does not have much to do in this movie and more often than not is just the straight man to carney and matthau the role does not tax his considerable talents but he had to have had a good time making this comedy br br very much recommended 8 10 br br ps fyi matthau presented jackson with her first best actress oscar and jackson presented best actor to art carney for his role in
<START> and again i find myself in the minority br br i didn't like this one this is the only varney work i haven't embraced including slam dunk ernest rates the credit for being the worst of the line but this is a clear competitor for that dubious title br br this work is too rough and too base to be lovable was one of ernest's key components and this element was completely lost herein unfortunately most think this is the best of the line but if you loved the essence of what made ernest ernest you will realize to what i refer about fifteen minutes into this work it was too blatantly base to be fun br br it rates a 3 5 10 from br br the fiend
<START> the ballad of the sad cafÃ© worked hard at its image but when it came down to crunch time it was left standing in its own self created dust br br one cannot image saying this out loud but if vanessa redgrave's amelia were to fight john wayne or even clint eastwood my hard earned dollars would have to go to redgrave her portrayal of amelia was as close to perfection and consumed with more detailed dedication than most actors are willing to give to any multi million dollar contracted persona redgrave gave amelia this soulful drawl that was a blend of her own unique voice and a hard earned woman from the south to the average viewer this could be construed as annoying but as the film progressed it became her Â miss amelia transforming this stage beauty into a roughneck it was redgrave's performance as well as her interaction with the other characters that made this film stand tall Â but not the tallest the others following her performance were needed but not stellar as we moved past the murky clichÃ© image passed on by every set designer hired for the post depression south job the minor characters felt like poster board the image was needed to set the scene but the characters of the town had no other purpose take for example rod steiger's vision of some old wild spoken preacher his scenes alone will make any viewer question the validity of this off the beaten path town the main two players who surrounded amelia battled with charm for the admirable top scene stealing moment but due to the lacking direction Â it just seemed faded the most absurd of the two albeit both rank high among the questionable sanity line is cork hubbard who plays cousin who shows up randomly one night his character is never quite defined he lacks true motive and his loyalties remain uncertain he plays no vital role in this film outside of forcing us the viewers to question his sanity and honesty can you create a character simply by sticking out your tongue flicking your ears and punching your chest and head finally there is the other end of the absurd Â keith carradine callow's close ups of this tormented man build character but our lack of understanding between him and amelia causes his purpose to flounder these were the characters as clichÃ© southern as they were Â some stood forward and attempted to create an absurdist period piece and i cannot argue that they failed br br where ballad of the sad cafÃ© failed to rise above mediocrity was in the cinematography and narrative this film was about amelia and her need for other souls in her life the audience's level of comfort with the arrival of her midget cousin was entertaining Â one couldn't help but wonder if he was honest or merely a confidence man attempt to leech off a warm heart cork character is never quite understood but we do accept him with brief shots of him and amelia doing small things together it is his idea that transforms from a recluse businesswoman to a bona fide cafÃ© owner the problem is that director callow never quite takes us to that dramatic take level between cork and redgrave Â is the man crazy or does he represent all of family i needed something from callow that brought these two out of the david lynch esquire relationship that they had then our pool gets even deeper with the addition of carradine as love interest using the technique of a flashback within a flashback we see the two wed but never consummate their love Â which anger against their love drawing him into the world of madness why was amelia so angry why was there no connection between carradine and redgrave why was this even in the film with the lack of focus towards these characters's connection the eventual scenes between the two made no sense Â throw in choice and it just gets completely discombobulated while there were a few beautiful choreographed scenes that callow created the inability to transfer his characters from point a to point b i lost focus interest and my care for the characters plummeted when i didn't understand the ultimate question Â why br br overall the ballad of the sad cafÃ© began with a bang but ended with a very small crack of a firecracker my emotional feel of this film swung up and down up and down and eventually stayed further down mainly due to the lack of understanding of the motives of the characters redgrave did a phenomenal job as amelia and while the other characters outside of the random steiger tried their best i just didn't quite understand who they were their motives were so muddled that when the emotional ending finally occurred i was apathetic director callow seemed to have been lacking importing connecting scenes that would allow us to understand the dynamic relationship between all of our main players callow created some beautiful scenes where faces seemed to overlap the scenery which allowed us to focus on amelia Â or carradine but nothing was explained or developed the film played out with anger discover happiness flashback anger anger anger fade out without the comparative this transformed from distinguished period film to actors playing parts in front of camera it was a shame because sad cafÃ© had the promise it just couldn't deliver br br grade Â½ out of
<START> the game of hockey i play and watch has something called speed which the actual hockey scenes in this limp movie never even come close to capturing add to that a storyline that is clichÃ© predictable and stupider than stupid with some of the lamest '80s music numbing your senses in every scene and you have youngblood oh keanu as a french canadian yeah whatever gimme and the anytime one out of ten
<START> i bought the dvd of this movie because i am a fan of william devane and i was really disappointed about a christmas visitor the story of the movie is so boring and slow in the development that you just want to turn off your tv or dvd player after about the half of it the dialogues are really bad and belong to a daily soap opera but not in a tv movie william devane was alright in his part and he was acting quite good but he did so much better in other movies and projects meredith baxter was horrible and couldn't really bring the warm hearted mother to the viewers instead she was playing very cool and wasn't better than a middle class actress i absolutely cannot recommend this movie spare your time and your money for this one
<START> rowan atkinson's creation mr bean has stood the test of time and will be forever etched upon the memory of those who viewed it br br living alone and appearing not to have a job of any description mr bean goes around doing day to day activities in a rather comedic fashion the mistake prone mr bean induces heartfelt laughter when put even in the most simplest situations though he barely spoke any coherent words his jovial actions more than made up for this br br even when driving in his beloved mini mr bean still manages to cause inadvertent chaos not very much is known about his background but his ability to draw tears of laughter from the audience at his funny shenanigans is well known br br before he found fame nick hancock can be seen in a couple of the episodes
<START> i saw this film at the seattle international film festival in a full house of avid movie buffs and indian ex pats the film is amazingly beautiful and smooth flowing for a first film the direction is self assured especially with locals who were recruited on the fly for extras and bit parts while the plot and story line is elementary to nonexistent the pleasures of watching the performances and scenery offset the lack the soundtrack to this film is a big attraction to world music lovers if you want to see what can be done in 45 days with a different location every day check out hari om for inspiration it was not disclosed in the q a but i imagine hollywood could take a lesson in budget film making by learning from this director
<START> i really love this movie i haven't played final fantasy vii but i still loved the movie its really funny and i love the job the voice over actors have done the visuals are so fantastic and all the lines are so well done br br i have to admit i have a pretty good imagination so i was able to fill most of the gaps the movie presented and i suggest you watch it twice because lots of things suddenly make sense br br also this is pretty funny you should watch it with the subtitles on because what they say and what the subs say are sometimes completely different its really usually pretty funny but sometimes it helps u to understand what they say better br br watch it love marnie
<START> another movie from swedish hillbilly country which is always the northern part if black people were shown this way there would be shouts about racism and for good reasons br br this is a farce and you are supposed to laugh at the clever farce clichÃ©s but it's mostly tiresome a gangster comedy with the bad russians as always and the bad and stupid finns and most stupid of all is of course the norwegian according to stockholm prejudice br br andreas wilson is the only one who tries to make a performance reminding us of reality this is not funny this is not even exciting a burlesque too raw to make you interested in any way
<START> i bought this movie hoping that it would be another great killer toy movie i am a big fan of the child's play series and was hoping to see the same here boy was i wrong most of the movie was not the least bit scary plus the only time we really see pinocchio alive is the final few scenes of the film the little girl in the film her acting is so bad it's almost laughable plus the ending never showed what happened to the puppet or what made them put the little girl in a asylum or wherever she was at the end of the film so in my opinion this movie is the worst of the killer toy genre if you want a good killer toy series stick with the child's play franchise pinocchio's revenge is a waste of money and time
<START> alright we start in the office of a shrink and apparently not a very good one the main hero from the first jack frost is in the shrinks office out random rhymes about jack frost gee alright my brother is yelling it off '' anyway back to the crappy movie br br the shrink has his speaker phone on and is letting his secretary and her friends listen in on this heroic insane sheriff i suppose he is supposed to be the hero from the first movie but he looks nothing like him yadda yadda yadda they laugh at the poor sheriff yadda yadda now some people are digging up the anti snowman yadda yadda now we're in a lab with some type of doctor people i don't quite see how this has to do anything but their poking the anti freeze evil killer mutant snowman with needles heating it shocking it adding strange and bizarre chemicals to it the whole nine yards nothing alright they give up and leave it in a fish tank one of the doctors leaves his coffee on the top of the tank the janitor walks in cleans stuff bumps the and the coffee spills the tank which makes jack alive br br behold the power of mocha now somehow he is in uh i believe the bahamas but it looked more like hawaii but it couldn't be hawaii unless they spent all of their budget on the dang air plane tickets bah i wont spoil the rest of this rotten movie so you'll have to rent it and watch it your self er i wouldn't suggest doing so though sheesh
