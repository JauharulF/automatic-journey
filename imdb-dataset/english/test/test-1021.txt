<START> following which the touted update goes and shoots itself through the head rather apt considering the sorry state of this movie a sequel to a film which patently didn't need one br br what really irritates about robocop 2 is that the makers obviously didn't understand why the original was so good in the first place robocop 7 was a witty vibrant satire of bad action movies robocop 2 is just a bad action movie br br thin on dialogue particularly towards the tedious shoot out finale it attracts little interest and possesses none of the energy or spirit of the original the spoof ads now a little tasteless warning continued use will cause skin cancer seem merely there as an afterthought and calling a new designer drug nuke is nowhere near as subtle or as funny as the original's family board game nuke br br the stop motion animation Â the weakest element of the original Â is used more extensively while this humourless sequel fails to include a credits sequence which makes it look even more cheap and hurried ah humourless you might say but what about the funny mayor or the way robo is to spout platitudes yes these are attempts at light relief as is robo tightening himself up with a screwdriver we're only human for the film's punchline but none are likely to induce laughter like the rest of the film they're staid and moronic attempts at entertainment br br the third and final film in the series imaginatively titled robocop 3 5 saw peter weller leave to be replaced by robert john burke who does well in a undemanding role with toned down language and violence it was an obvious plea to the kiddie market a robo action figure much plugged throughout with it's social conscience too overstated and new found arm attachments and jetpack getting too silly the final film was never destined to be a masterpiece yet fluid direction by fred dekker and a flowing pace make this one enjoyably throwaway viewing br br robocop then is the film proper robocop 3 is the sequel which you could watch if there was nothing better on which leaves the second movie hanging in the middle an unwatchable dirge of a picture a franchise vehicle that has nothing to say save for the pound signs that rung up irvin kershner is no paul verhoven just as comic artist frank miller and partner walon green aren't the writers that edward and michael miner were a tragic waste of a good if limited concept 4 10
<START> i don't understand what is hard hitting about this movie i don't understand why high school kids should watch this i don't understand why this should have made me think about anything in the slightest br br spoiler br br when the un noticed girl is on her way to commit suicide was i the only person cheering her on the clichÃ©'d classical music long tracking shots melancholy emotion of the film by that stage had me in reversal to what was intended i would have only been happy if she walked into the room and the entire cast was in there with her holding scissors to slit their wrists up br br why br br cause i went to high school and frankly im sick to death of seeing movie after movie in australia with teenagers in it being solely based on terrible clichÃ©s i've been waiting ages for a younger person to write a movie that im able to relate to and this stereotype driven piece of emo garbage is what i got instead it was like a dark version of heartbreak high that needed a predictable ending br br why are all teenagers in aussie dramas depressed or have really weird problems that just aren't plausibly told br br on the plus side this was funnier then and i needed a good laugh
<START> i made a big mistake going to see this film that's the lottery of going to see films i guess after five minutes you just knew it was going to be a clunker and i fought quite hard to stay in my seat the old lose two hours of your life kind of feeling br br the fundamental problem is that without even mentioning the whole historical accuracy thread of reviews the script is achingly painful bad br br the first thirty minutes could have been spread out to an hour to give a plausible real plot development instead it lurched from from one undramatic dramatic event to the next having the girl cry at the start of the film makes no sense because the audience has no emotional attachment to anything at this point and that whole walking off into the sunset through the long grass field at the end what the hell was that about br br not even the excellent ed harris could save this one you could almost feel his pain at some of the lines he had to utter the most fabulously awful one was for no apparent reason he stares at the girl as she copies his work in his apartment she looks up it all goes a bit fuzzy romantic kind a lighting or am i dreaming and he says with authority in his voice br br wash me br br and she gets up and washes him with a sponge wash me wtf that's hilarious br br and then there was the music the long extended session when it was just beethoven conducting and the 9th symphony pouring out of the surround sound in the cinema and the choir waiting waiting standing there silently for what seems like forever and then finally launching into enormous sound it was spine chillingly wonderful and dare i say it it brought tears to my eyes br br so that is where the film picked up two stars the only part of the film where beethoven got to say exactly what he wanted to say br br and i believed him
<START> well we definitely did see and i and many other people were actually expecting worse it did have some good parts too it that i was not expecting it still did fail in other areas though br br first off the acting was above average i love phillip seymour hoffman in this movie and i liked tom hanks hoffman was the glue to this movie if it were not for him this movie would have crumbled and hit rock bottom his performance was by no means stunning but absolutely necessary he gave a good witty cynical performance in what most other actors could have easily made his character into a clichÃ© tom hanks really gave a nice loose performance and did not disappoint but he certainly did not impress what i could not stand was that julia roberts was involved in this movie she was as big of a miscast as i have ever seen for one she is a bad actress at least to me she was to young for her character and was to phony even for the character she was playing br br the directing was average to me i'm not really a big fan of the recent mike nichols movies and i'm not exactly impressed by this one either it was made with such a hollywoodish cartoonish touch hat i could not stand the worst part about it was that he tried make it be a really meaningful movie at the end i love meaningful movies but not when a movie tries to rush a scene or two at the end and show something that tries to justify the rest of the garbage spread throughout the whole movie that is something that mike nichols has seemed to have done a lot in his recent track record br br the one impressive part of this movie was the writing the dialog was put together very well and was able to let the story play out the writing was what was able to really able to take this movie to an above average level in so many scenes i found myself laughing in part by the writing br br well that is some of what we saw at least a lot of the scenery was good in the movie if you get what i mean but not a lot other than that i did like that this movie did not glorify everything america had done it is obvious that during this whole war in afghanistan the u s gave weapons to the people who are now against us this movie kind of show we are too blame for that it shows that what may seem good in the short term may turn into something horribly wrong in the future this movie did have a good original message but it just did not deliver it right overall though it was entertaining
<START> publicity for this film suggests that it is shocking and sensational well we opera lovers see some strange sights in opera houses so we are not shocked by the duke of urinating during his reprise of la donna mobile nor is it sensational to see gilda sing caro in the bath it is just crass and boring what stands out about this film is its lack of imagination director van sets the duke's palace in a seedy swimming pool in fact he is not the duke he is just a character named so it's difficult to see why he has lots of hangers on and his own jester rigoletto rigoletto lives in a council flat that is furnished with the orange sofa and decorated in the spotted wallpaper that is de rigeur among avant garde directors the duke's sorry heavies ride around on motor scooters yawn br br concepts imposed on an opera like this can produce unexpected and unintentional humour what can we make of the fact that gilda has a maid even though she lives in a council flat when the call goes out that is being taken to prison we see him being marched out of the swimming pool by two attendants in pink shorts one imagines that he is going to be charged with urinating in a public swimming pool br br it was common for opera films to be lip 20 years ago but there is just no excuse for it today a dubbed opera is like soft porn you don't believe in what is happening because the performers are not making enough effort the actress in role does not seem to have learned her lines properly she barely moves her lips when she is supposed to be singing when she sings caro in the bath she lies back with her legs slightly parted it is difficult to tell which the sound is supposed to be emanating from the duke later caps this by singing while engaging in cunnilingus with giving a new meaning to the phrase yodelling in the canyon br br the ambiance of the sound never seems right with the orchestra sometimes sounding as though it is being played through a radio fairly slow tempi are preferred so that the overall effect is of a karaoke in your local pub br br this is a film of a production by opera is a village in in the netherlands they normally perform in a tent in a field if i had been watching this performance in a tent in a field in i would have been fairly indulgent by filming this production and giving it a worldwide audience the villagers also hold themselves open to worldwide ridicule
<START> after seeing the movie in a class of mine and having a talk with the filmmaker i found out exactly why the film bombed the way it did the creators of the movie had no intention to call the film 8mm 2 originally the film was called the velvet side of hell but was changed at the last minute by sony pictures to 8mm 2 without letting the filmmakers have any say in the matter by doing that it screwed them out of theatrical releases and doomed it to a straight to video release with minimal advertising br br again this is from the filmmaker's mouths not mine so i really can't say what is truth and what is hype br br if you look at the film as velvet side of hell it isn't that bad it isn't great but it is not god awful it would basically just be a b movie that likes to show boobs but as a sequel to 8mm the film fails terribly
<START> the story line for this game is very jerky where it appears the game writers have tried to find ways to justify how a character appears in certain areas of the world map in tales of the soul that being said this is the only gripe i have about the game br br the beginning fmv is spectacular with breath taking sceneries and interesting new devices such as the ability to create and design your own character and their own martial arts discipline there's even a second story mode which makes up for the awkward story design of tale of the souls br br parts of the fmvs during tale of the souls is also interactive where you can decide the fate of your character to a certain degree which is an interesting feature br br with the many combinations of characters you can create the varied paths you can explore in tales of the souls and the chronicle of swords story mode this game will keep any up rpg fans amused for a while
<START> awful dreadful terrible the actors are bad the music is ridiculous and the filming pathetic i rented the dvd and had to force myself to watch it until the end br br my advice read the book it is much better and you won't have to put up with all these silly images and ridiculous dreams catherine has br br i think i have never watched such a bad movie
<START> i guess i do not have too much to add i found the comedy to still be funny after more than ten years since it came out br br the one thing that i did notice was the music during the dialogue to be distracting and often made the movie very hook than it should have been the use of songs is fine during the movie but the orchestral background is too busy too contrived and if the movie was ever to be edited for dvd i would seriously recommend that the background music be toned down to an almost inaudible level it has cheapened the overall feel for the whole film and i can see subconsciously why a lot of people have passed it up br br the film had a lot of levels working for it on the script plot and comedy level it is too bad that the producer and director felt they needed the musical schlock to enhance the mood now knowing this i find it hard to watch and i quietly curse whoever was involved with the musical editing in the film it had all the subtlety of a jackhammer
<START> i very well remember the bad press this film got because of the producers' court order against clayton moore using the name lone ranger or donning his black mask at personal appearances quite apart from any consideration of the film's quality this was the absolute height of arrogance and stupidity on the part of the producers and their attorneys and i suspect that the lesson was well learned after this film tanked which was widely perceived as some sort of karma for the jerks responsible for the court order against moore br br in more recent times it has become the custom when reviving a legendary film or tv project to invite the original star or stars for cameo appearances and rightly so show some respect you idiots and even if they turn up their noses at the prospect which has happened at least the offer was made this is proof positive that film producers studio executives and entertainment attorneys are not quite too stupid and arrogant to be taught by example
<START> mount godwin austin otherwise known as is the world's second highest mountain and if the evidence presented in this film is to be believed is the hardest mountain to climb successfully without getting yourself killed is basically a buddy flick set in the breathtakingly dangerous world of mountaineering while the outdoor photography takes in some truly awesome scenery the characters standing in front of all those glorious landscapes are a crashing bore and therein lies the fault with the whole film br br cocksure lawyer taylor brooks michael biehn and his quiet married friend harold matt craven spend their free time rock climbing during one of their trips they meet up with another bunch of climbers funded by wealthy mountain enthusiast philip raymond j barry team are in training for a forthcoming shot at the infamous a mountain that taylor and harold would both love to tackle but could never afford to do so during their training run however two of team get themselves killed in an avalanche taylor and harold put themselves forward as potential replacements despite initial reluctance gives them the nod of approval and the pair find themselves joining his team in the himalayas harold's wife cindy julia nickson soul is distraught that her husband is going to take on such a dangerous climb especially since he has recently become a father tensions in the climbing team mount as taylor repeatedly clashes with another member of the group the equally brash and arrogant dallas woolf luca meanwhile himself grows increasingly ill as altitude sickness takes its toll on his body will the guys reach the peak of or is their quest destined to end in disappointment or even death br br spends an inordinately long time introducing its somewhat dislikeable characters biehn as a foul mouthed pushy adventurous type is especially hard to like as is barry as the hard nosed mountaineering millionaire but on the other side of the coin craven is so dull that it becomes difficult to believe his wife could possibly give a damn about him going off to climb heck she'd be better off if he never came back rounding off the main characters is whose characterisation as dallas woolf is as campy and over the top as every other role he's ever played the story itself is totally tame and disposable Â just a straightforward yarn about guys trying to reach the top of a mountain there's a bit of male bonding thrown in but the whole subplot about harold and his wife amounts to nil and the personality clashes between taylor and dallas ring totally false scores its few merits solely from the stunning cinematography by gabriel Â during the himalayan sequences the scale and awe of the mountains is quite nicely captured i'm completely with critic kim newman on this one who hilariously stated in empire magazine on this evidence climbing can't be any harder than sitting through it quite true kim quite true
<START> it worked director christian duguay created a very clever action spy thriller the actors donald sutherland and especially aidan quinn gave a top performance what a pity that we see aidan quinn in others movies like this one till now he was simply the best in the role as ramirez carlos for what he should have earned the oscar the picture was very nice the scenes are fast paced from beginning to the end and the story doesnÂ´t let you a chance to get bored the movie is too underrated and i recommend it to anyone otherwise you will miss something great believe me you will not be disappointed thatÂ´s why i give it 9 10
<START> i saw this at the 2008 palm springs international film festival there are some wonderful descriptions of this film from other commenter's here and they seemed to have really enjoyed it so i won't too far into giving a film synopsis but you could see a little of woody allen and maybe a little of federico fellini in this film's collection of some 50 short sketches or vignettes strung together with no real singular plot a few of the vignettes are related to each other in their character and plot lines however and a a corner bar is used frequently as a central scene where they are always giving last call the beginning and ending scenes have a common theme too that bookends the film it took three years to film this and much of the time must have been spent on finding the and homeliest looking people in all of sweden to make the cast this is official submission for best foreign language film for the 2007 academy awards it's a nice movie but hardly worthy of an official submission for best foreign film last year official submission was the very weak and the year before it was expensive looking but dull so once again sweden will have no chance in picking up the oscar this film has it's moments and would have made a good 20 25 minute short film but it gets a little old and cold for a full length feature film roy directs gustav is the cinematographer editor anna deserves a lot of credit for the work she must have put into this benny of abba fame provides an entertaining music score it's an interesting film with a lot of dry humor and i did like it but it's nothing really special and could only give it a 7 0 out of 10
<START> in strangers on a train it's obvious from the start that playboy wastrel robert walker has singled out farley granger as an unwilling accomplice to a pair of murders granger's a semi public figure he's a tennis pro but not an especially high one high enough however for him to know that granger is trapped in a loveless marriage and would like to be free to marry ruth roman br br so when they meet as complete strangers on a train one afternoon walker knows enough that granger will at least be intrigued enough with the possibility that if the two of them complete strangers did commit homicide on parties that the other would be by their demise though granger is repulsed by the idea one of the beautiful things about this film is that you can see in the performance he gives that granger just might submit to temptation br br in fact when walker kills laura elliot granger's wife whose been two timing him and even gotten pregnant by another man he expects that granger will in turn murder walker's father so that walker can inherit his estate today walker would be called a trust fund baby and a pretty malevolent one at that br br alfred hitchcock directed walker to his career role ironically in his last complete film walker died the following year with most of my son john finished hitchcock does not do too bad by farley granger either br br of course when granger does balk at committing homicide on people who never did anything to him the tension strangers on a train is also characterized by great editing first in the tennis match in which granger has to finish the match and waylay walker before he plants evidence convicting granger at the crime scene and also in that final climax with a fight on a runaway carousel between walker and granger br br strangers on a train is hitchcock at his best it should not be missed and ought to be required viewing when film classes study editing
<START> i think this show was right on the money for me i watched it over the plane but there were parts in the movie that made me control myself from tearing all over the place br br the chemistry between richard gere and diane lane was very believable fantastic acting on both parts i loved how diane lane's daughter acted in the show too she displayed maturity and how she transformed throughout the show was easy to believe as what a teenager could possibly be like in real life br br i loved this show from start to end definitely recommended for the romantic people out there
