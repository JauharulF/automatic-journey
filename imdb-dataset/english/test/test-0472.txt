<START> on a flight back from london i watched she's the man apparently air canada has a crap movie policy perhaps that's not the best way to start a review of this movie amanda bynes plays a girl who loves soccer so much that she pretends to be her twin brother to get on a team at a boarding school across town even if you check your mind at the door on a 6 hour flight you have to the story is implausible and ridiculous there are some moments of humor mostly from comedian david cross as the principle but the intricate love polygon doesn't really inspire emotion although is is cleverly mixed with the caveat of mindless plausibility the ending is just as ridiculously mindless as the rest i guess if i was a 12 year old girl i might have really enjoyed this one
<START> i think the cards were stacked against because right from the start there was this itchy feeling like something was wrong but i couldn't quite put my finger on it then it hit me dubbed for a little while they managed most of the lines either as voice over or off screen with just a little hint here and there until it became painfully obvious this is the kind of dubbing that grates on the nerves with nothing even remotely funny about it i hate dubbing but at least however misplaced martial arts films badly dubbed tend to have a sense of humour about it br br what i wanted was a film about a hacker doing actual hacking and stuff like that maybe like a reverse side of the table of the movie hackers being about the person trying to keep them out instead about the people trying to get in what i got was some poorly written nonsensical at times murder mystery with a ton of bad chase sequences a supposedly inept hacker who was neutered without his little ego and a director who obviously didn't know how to handle a camera i just wanted to reach in there grab the camera from the guy and shoot the dang thing myself the editing wasn't much better the acting well i guess if the lead guy didn't have such a bad script to work from he'd be at least watchable the main bad guy was ok too but pretty much everyone else was a joke dubbing didn't help but the acting was pretty bad even taking that into consideration br br before i get into more bad let's perk up to a few good things well one or two despite the rudimentary graphics i rather enjoyed the stuff what little there was of it and would have much rather watched a movie mostly about in and around that than the tepid surroundings outside in the 'real world' the falsifying thing seemed kind of cool but ended up being rather useless in the scheme of things the heart gadget which reminded me of guillermo del toro's was interesting though as a plot device ripped directly from the pages of escape from new york it was horribly conceived in the long run there's one point where the bad guy is unconscious and our hero is right there why didn't he try the bad guy's thumb print then since the heart device was thumb activated nonetheless some interesting gadgets and cyber stuff if only they could have been utilized better br br now who here dares compare this movie to blade runner both films take place sometime in the future and there's some kind of off kilter type of romance in it sort of in both films there's the investigation of a murder but i've seen many a film with a murder at its center that are nothing like either blade runner or identity for instance that's about where the similarities end period there is no comparison just as there wouldn't be between blade runner and hackers ridley scott is a brilliant director with a great mind for art direction and knows some fundamentals of film making like where to put the camera is cheap and not just because of the budget it's cheap because of bad writing and because it more often than not takes the easy way out like writing in a character who barely appeared in the first place to save the girl in the end to get her to point b by herself without the hero so that he could do his thing very convenient or the attempted sympathy factor for a character we have no reason to care for or inane things like the car set up to stall them just enough for someone to get away br br it tries to be hip it tries to be exploitive it even tries a twist ending that's not the least bit surprising and it tries to be thrilling but a bunch of near identical chase sequences bad writing editing horribly shot bad acting etc does not a thrilling movie make
<START> i am a huge tenacious d fan and i think this is not the funniest movie in the world but the most entertaining it's not laugh a minute but that's not what the d intended it to be i went into the movie seeing all the hbo shows memorized both albums and that made it even more enjoyable plenty of inside jokes from past tenacious d albums and hbo shows since i knew the new album already i knew 40 minutes of the movie because it is a musical comedy i would say it has the best first 5 minutes of any movie and the best last 5 minutes of any movie hands down br br see this movie now
<START> after three hours in the cinema hall the strongest impression garnered was that their is something amiss what was clear was that the directors forgot to direct the actors to act and most importantly the script writer to write shouted without reason and made one cringe the script moved on and on with lots of avoidable twists and turns ending in now too familiar priyadarshan theory of converging actors at a single point this theory worked well in hera pheri and hungama but somehow managed to irritate this time so did the habit of every actor's incapacity to answer asked of them directly simplest questions such as what is your name would be repeated n times br br finally what was amiss was that the director forgot that his audience have something called intelligence
<START> as it turns out chris farley and david spade only made three movies together coneheads tommy boy and black sheep but this was truly the citizen kane of their pairings farley plays thomas callahan iii the dimwitted heir to an auto parts company his father big tom brian dennehy hires mild mannered richard hayden david spade to look after him big tom is getting married to a ten bo derek so everything has to be in order after big tom suddenly dies tommy and richard have to try to sell half a million auto parts to save the company from bankruptcy from then on the movie is pretty much an excuse for chris farley to do what he does best make a mess of everything br br when this movie first came out in the theaters i saw it with my grandfather he figured out early on that the bo derek and rob lowe characters were hiding something but you can completely ignore that and simply in chris antics nothing is safe around his stomach and hell hath no fury like his happy go lucky attitude the scene where he sets the cars on fire and later the deer scene make for a pure laugh riot chris farley and david spade were truly the john belushi and dan aykroyd of their era it's a pleasure to always be able to think about fat guy in a little coat time and again
<START> a rich experience is to be gained from watching this film br br this is a seemingly simple story of a gifted pupil kwok who later becomes a teacher of classical chinese poetry he is married with two sons and things at home seem normal he still loves his wife after twenty years of marriage and his sons alternately fill him with pride the elder one and disappointment the younger one br br his passion for the poetry makes him an object of infatuation for a senior student in one of his classes the student choi lam draws pictures of him during class significantly one of him with a flower coming from his mouth she teases him more with her intelligence than her sexuality although that too is an element he of course is not immune to her attention though he tries for a while to keep the demarcation line between teacher and student in place br br the reason why he doesn't succeed in the end is complicated firstly there is a real depth to the communication between him and choi lam it becomes clear that she genuinely likes him and it's mutual secondly there is a long standing problem in his marriage that is brought to light when an old friend of both his and his wife becomes ill the consequences of the wife's involvement with this friend both past and present are almost too sad to bear br br nothing is treated in this film all the characters have a vivid internal life and an easily discernible history the two leads jacky cheung and anita are outstanding as are lam as the student choi lam and shaun tam as the elder son on yin br br recommended without reservation
<START> fans of gerry anderson's productions will recognise several actors and vehicles from ufo which was made after doppelgÃ¤nger as well as sound effects from various anderson series barry gray's excellent music mostly unique to this film adds to the feeling of familiarity for these reasons alone i think any gerry anderson fan would find doppelgÃ¤nger worth getting br br judged simply as a film it has to be said that doppelgÃ¤nger is flawed it is known that there were major problems during production and i suspect this is why there is a time consuming plot thread that ends abruptly and appears to have no relevance to the rest of the story presumably time budget constraints prevented the relevance from emerging br br distractingly the special effects range from outstandingly good better than any 1960s film that i know of to disappointingly bad br br nevertheless even with these flaws main story is well told and keeps the viewer or at least this viewer engaged throughout the ending is perhaps not what one might expect from anderson yet at the same time it is typical of anderson and it is certainly appropriate to find out what i mean you'll have to watch it for yourself
<START> an unbelievable plot laughable characters and obvious errors in one scene where several grass huts are supposed to be burning a gas torch can be seen repeatedly trying to ignite one of the huts this film is a real dog
<START> my overall feeling about this film is that it was a slow drawn out wander through some of the worlds genuinely unfortunate situations with a bit of redemption and an obvious message the film is composed mostly of fairly uninteresting video footage of the countries he visits with bad reenactments all slow down to a snails pace and overlaid with depressing music certainly some of the materials and interviews contain some compelling stories but unlike what the description on the back suggests it wasn't so much the victim's story that's being told as it is the director's mr ripper and he doesn't tell it well this film could have included longer better interviews with the people themselves letting them tell their stories instead mr ripper indulgently draws the story towards himself making it some kind of personal journey and unfortunately it doesn't end up being much of one i never really got a sense of any growth as he explores the subject and he never indicates what about the subject pulled him in in the first place he just drags us from one place to the next brushes lightly on the situation and characters hangs around showing too much uneventful slow motion footage of people just walking around the streets then moves on to his next destination he does this over and over and over again without any real development i felt like this film could have been cut down to 45 minutes but it's drawn out to close to 2 crushingly slow hours we feel morally obliged to care about the topic but the director's self indulgent meandering uninspired delivery of his journey makes you grow numb after a while
<START> you know this is one of those emperor's new clothes films it's like so off the wall and strange that you're supposed to like it if you're really into film well i think that's a bunch of bologna films like this which hide under the cloak of dada or surrealism make me nuts some person has this bad dream perhaps brought on by eating the aforementioned bologna right before going to bed remembers most of it unfortunately and then puts it on film and we're all supposed to marvel at their creative genius i have bizarre dreams too sometimes that make absolutely no sense but i don't feel the need to put them on film expose everybody else to them and call it art weirdness does not in of itself mean something is interesting true dada or surrealistic expression has some intent and intellectual thought behind it if other people don't get it that doesn't make it profound it just makes it incomprehensible bizarreness for bizarreness sake for me is not good let alone great art and comparing to is like comparing the godfather i ii to the godfather iii same genre not in the same league
<START> the first of the italian rip offs of the french soft porn blockbuster though it might be interesting to note that the boot shaped country actually got their first with cesare 1968 emmanuelle starring erika blanc is a very different kettle of fish than the sleazy sequels provided by the late questionably great joe d'amato it is much closer in spirit to the now very dated just film from 1973 taking a look at male female relationships questioning such then hot topics as fidelity and jealousy all in luxurious exotic surroundings unlike d'amato director albert thomas aka albertini who also made the hard to find yellow emanuelle actually a sexed up version of madame butterfly does not present us with predatory drug lords snuff movie makers or rampaging cannibals making for an admittedly less sensational yet far more erotic viewing experience br br photo journalist mae jordan aka lovely born laura gemser in her first lead role following bit parts as a thai masseuse in emmanuelle 2 and an in just portion of the rarely seen collections flies down to where she's to shoot the stills accompanying an article by noted british writer anne played by the very teutonic karin schubert with a butch haircut that takes some getting used to anne shares an 'open remember when this was made with her italian husband gianni angelo meaning that both pretty much jump anything with a pulse contrary to her subsequent reputation emanuelle appears positively reticent compared to her heavy breathing hosts smoldering seductively at gianni by way of foreplay until the exquisitely tantalizing pay off okay so she does make up for this lack of at the end when she does an entire male hockey team on the train i kid you not br br production on this sexploitation classic is quite impressive especially the superb cinematography and nico fidenco's musical theme is a solid favorite of anyone with more than a passing interest in the genre a hilarious eurotrash pop ditty try to make out those totally nonsensical lyrics and have a full evening's worth of fun with the family that turns up throughout the entire film in every conceivable type of rendition from slow 'n' sexy to hip gyrating disco br br this is entirely laura gemser's show though billed simply as as was another actress on the same director's elusive emanuelle 2 she lights up the screen from start to finish not yet submitted to endless rape scenarios as she would be once d'amato took over she seems much more relaxed than in later films even smiling from time to time a rare occasion as anyone who has seen some of the lady's work surely knows a flawless eurasian rather than as the title suggests black beauty she hails from dutch india now indonesia and is actually quite close in physical appearance to the supposed author of the novel emmanuelle she projects a slightly passive even submissive sensuality which somehow her from the her morally corrupted cohorts indulge in unlike the french film moralizing is kept to a bare minimum almost thrown in as an afterthought near film's end when emanuelle tells gianni that he hasn't lost her as he never possessed her to begin with i swear you could hear audiences of the just version groan whenever alain supremely irritating mario showed up on screen as it meant we were in for too many minutes of libertine philosophizing as an alibi for getting the divine sylvia kristel now living in the belgian capital of brussels by the way to disrobe the real reasons theaters were packed for years on end gemser's later husband gabriele now deceased she has remarried appears on the sidelines as the constantly drunk huh writer who forces himself briefly on emanuelle amid the african ruins at some point but no real sex scene though
<START> 'a tale of two sisters' or is a true masterpiece brilliant psychological thriller heart wrenching drama and gripping horror all wrapped up in one beautifully orchestrated package from the intricate plot to the beautiful cinematography to the absolutely perfect casting every aspect of this film is extraordinary br br for fear of revealing too much concerning the plot i will just say it is very satisfying while it may appear to be a little difficult to understand at first it does a good job of explaining things in the end and whether you prefer psychological thriller drama or horror i promise you will not be disappointed br br from a technical standpoint its nearly flawless the set the cinematography lighting and especially the soundtrack all are captivating the waltz seemed an odd choice at first but proved to be an ingenious choice br br as for the casting we're talking absolute perfection i'm su jeong is totally convincing as the defiant yet troubled su mi is equally convincing as her emotionally traumatized sister su yeon these two girls were magical on the screen i will certainly be looking into their other films jeong ah is cheerful and hauntingly evil as the stepmother finally su kim gives an excellent performance as the weary broken father br br i truly love this film if you have yet to see 'a tale of two sisters' i strongly recommend locating a copy it is a real gem worthy of anyone's collection br br 10 10
<START> as powerful as the true story of is this book this film is based on came out before she herself was released from prison and had the chance to tell it br br it is allegedly based on her diaries but she is illiterate how does that work br br that said some areas of he film are accurate and the acting isn't bad with some sensitivity being shown br br really though this story needs to be old in a tv series far to much happens to cram into a couple of hours br br read her autobiography highly recommended it is a fantastic story
<START> this is my favorite movie that portrays african americans in whole different light because it shows a different side of african americans that it is not shown in the movies its not the gang bang urban ghetto setting or having to deal with deep racial issues it captivates the whole essence of being young and trying to be successful and having problems with letting your guard down and letting someone into your life and the whole bohemian atmosphere gives that great touch that makes all that great its a great script great dialoge that captivates you and you just get involved with the character perfect casting with a lot of chemistry and very good acting and i still haven't seen any other movie with black characters that are portrayed in this format the only one that get close is sprung but since its a comedy it looses it very quickly i give this movie 9 out of 10 and i wish they would keep making movies with this type of attitude about african americans
<START> well its a great work by and some where people like this makes us believe that there is a lot more concepts till now which has to be expressed and the film is a great media to do that well all great actors together hence nothing to say about acting or directing but the film gave us a great message through out it has nicely predicted the conditioning of human minds with that of the patient we all believe that what we believe is true with our own point of view and we want to solve all the problem accordingly hence from the professor to the maid servant all tried their own ways so when was discussing with her wife he says that 'she is looking for a thing which she will never and the wife replies 'are not we all ' so that was a great comment which after the film left me with a great question 'are we all sick '
