<START> the ator series is a shining example of what b movies should be they fail in every aspect but in such a hilarious way that they are funny rather than sad ator 2 aka the blade master aka cave dwellers shows us europe's favorite conan clone ator where we left him in the first movie after showing us a lengthy recap of all the events of the first film this time the world must be saved from the a kind of bomb represented on screen as a bright light i guess they couldn't afford a prop this one features invisible attackers and samurai as with the first film lots of stock footage is used including one rather obvious bit from star wars thoroughly laughable and unforgettably bad this is an exception b movie
<START> i didn't really hate mirrormask i just really wanted more from a movie than pretty visuals the movie begins with a young girl named who works in a circus but while other children supposedly want to run away to the circus she only wants to run away from the circus during a heated argument with her mother wishes she would drop dead bad move the mother gets ill with something presumably cancer and needs surgery on the night before surgery she dreams she travels to a wonderful world composed of her her dreams and nightmares where she finds herself personally the movie got crap for me as soon as she started dreaming the early scenes show the weird and wonderful world of the circus and then contrast it with the bleakness of the hospital and the filth of an apartment block but a soon as she dreams the whole films shifts to cgi land where nearly everything is a computer image the problem is that this dream world has none of the mystery and wonder it should have while films like the wizard of oz seemed enticing to explore mirrormask shoves images in our faces and then snatches them away to give us another image there's little rhyme or reason to the design in this film and even though some things are very pretty the librarian is a masterpiece they just disappear so quickly that they're soon forgotten and her sidekick valentine are annoying at best and unbearable at worst overall mirrormask is like a pretty stake that you bite and find out is actually ash stick to the real world kids
<START> i saw this movie when i was a lot younger but it captured me i loved orry and george's relationship so much i was so enraptured in orry and love story i am a hopeless romantic so it really got to me i especially liked it when he first met her i just wish he had more time with her and their baby so you know in book three i was so hurt that he died i didn't really understand that because they had little time together i just loved patrick in this movie i just bought all three books together and i can't stop watching them my 12 year old son is stuck on it he likes the fighting in the war i cry every time i wish i could meet patrick and madeline in person it was a wonderful movie and cast
<START> in 2004 i wrote the following statements on an imdb message board when a user wondered if the best years of our lives was a forgotten movie br br to me watching this movie is like opening up a time capsule i think in many ways the best years of our lives is probably one of the more fascinating character studies and it holds up extremely well as a look at life in the us in the mid 1940s after wwii i believe coming home and the deer hunter both released in 1978 were the most recent films that were closest in capturing the numerous issues of military men returning from war that were brought up in the best years of our lives br br what really impressed me was watching the movie in its entirety when i was in college around 1980 81 and many if not all of the college students applauded at the end of the movie br br this movie still packs a wallop and i'm very happy to read in other posts other users feeling of a movie that will definitely stand the test of time br br i'm very happy to see the movie ranked near the top 100 movies on imdb and afi also though it was in competition with what eventually became a christmas classic it's a wonderful life arguably the best years of our lives' oscar wins including best picture were very well deserved br br i've just seen the film again in 2005 and after almost 60 years the best years of our lives is still a powerful beautifully acted and well crafted motion picture
<START> this movie was awesome if you want a movie with non stop puns and laughter then this is right for you this movie was great because it took the serious robin hood and made it something the whole family can enjoy and get a good laugh at i first viewed this movie when i was around 10 and got most of it this movie is also great because it makes fun of everything involved by order of the kings financial secretary h and r blockhead br br everyone needs a little cary elwes robin hood in life whether or not its liar liar with the claw or saw br br this movie is worth watching
<START> the only good thing about this film is they managed to tie it with part one but other than that it was one of the worst films ever the only time you see the ghoulies is in a flashback and the flashback is just clips from part one a must not see on a one to ten ghoulies 4 gets a one
<START> the final installment sees sho and riki looking cooler than ever in his overcoat pitched against each other for one last battle this time in the future the plot owes a lot to blade runner but done in takashi miike's low budget frenetic comic style i did feel that it was the weakest of the three doa films and although the ending was still outrageous it lacked the shock value of the previous two compared to the likes of ichi the killer and visitor q doa final is nowhere near as extreme but is faithful to the other two films in the trilogy that said fans of the first two and fans of miike will get a lot from this as it ties all three films together and gives a final explanation of the relationship between the two protagonists
<START> police officer dirk jamie bartlett files an amnesty application alex br br a member of the south african parliament who cant remember the torture he once endured as a captive political activist br br south african born attorney sarah hilary swank meanwhile returns to her homeland to represent br br as well as steve friend who was arrested along with him and never heard from again br br this film is one of the best films to come out about the south african regime of aparthied in the past br br everybody should watch it
<START> i am not kidding there's a scene in this movie where a hobo hits his head on a tunnel keystone and explodes with no fireball though into a million pieces it made some kid in front of me scream in terror in a g rated film br br this film might serve to convince children that santa clause is evil his helpers are ugly misanthropic over the top and mean when santa here an anagram of satan appears all 200 000 elves begin singing santa clause is coming to town as though it were a druid war chant then in the reflection of this movie's rosebud object a jingle bell that whispers hints of why you can't hear it ringing doubt doubt old saint nick appears looking like a stoic donald sutherland his face glowing like moses' from when we hear him speak his thundering voice sounds less like a jolly old elf and more like james earl jones' voice slowed down about 20 frightening br br the syrupy music is out of place boring and repetitive it doesn't follow any emotional threads as in titanic's very effective score it just seems thrown in at certain points in order to generate feelings of warmth and magic it fails to stir partly because it doesn't match the imagery of the film there are some musical train wrecks no pun intended where out of nowhere the eerie symphonic score slams abruptly into happy child voiced polka about the title locomotive it just makes the whole movie sound like it was rushed into production br br finally i agree with some other reviewers about how well dead everyone looks it does seem a little macabre at times the motion capture technique is good for allowing the kings island like roller coaster train sequences to look convincing from a distance but up close real actors should have been used overall nice eye candy for killing time in front of the tv but not much else here
<START> the name lucio fulci up images of graphic death and mutilation in the minds of may fans thanks to movies like zombi 2 city of the living dead the beyond and the new york ripper fulci has a reputation for being one of the goriest directors in history and although many of his later movies certainly justify his reputation until the release of zombi 2 in 1979 fulci's films did not contain anywhere near the amount of blood and guts he's know for in fact they were for the most part gore free instead relying on more traditional shocks and disturbing imagery to work don't torture a duckling hardly contains any gore yet ranks as his best br br don't torture a duckling is set in a small sicilian town where superstition rules instead of logic the townsfolk are very distrustful of outsiders as well as anyone different often shunning them after a series of child murders though many people descend upon the town including andrea thomas milan who tries to uncover the truth about the murders while they continue to happen br br this is a remarkable film it's very well made with an excellent cast filled with many favorites of italian exploitation cinema it also contains a solid score as well as many creative camera movement courtesy or lucio fulci but the real draw of don't torture a duckling is the disturbing nature of the movie little kids around twelve years old are shown mocking retarded people visiting prostitutes and being propositioned sex by an older woman it also contains some very biting commentary on the middle class and the catholic church it is for reasons like this that don't torture a duckling was blacklisted throughout europe when it was first released and never was shown in the united states still don't torture a duckling stands as a monumental achievement in giallo cinema as well as lucio fulci's best work i really can't recommend this one enough check it out
<START> every time i hear karen carpenter's voice there is that old familiar feeling of 70's blues what an overwhelmingly beautiful and mature voice she had cynthia cast in the title role does a good job however i thought karen allen would have been a better choice this is a tearjerker movie that does a fine job of presenting the professional careers of karen and richard but also the personal struggles that karen dealt with and her disease the recording sessions in albert's studio are very nicely done however karen carpenter turned out there was a time when she was very special and brought a great deal joy to her fans and music lovers even if you weren't a carpenter's fan this is a nice story that depicts how a great talent can fall victim to the pressures of society
<START> have just seen this film in australia on satellite as i have been avoiding the news more so than usual over the last week coming from the us of a regarding gunmen well to be absolutely blunt this film is a prescient gem a big bravo to all involved i had only a small idea of what the film entailed as is most often the case for good effect and this certainly came up with cinematic goods the setting of the scene is effective in the truest sense of the word with all the hairy confronting subjects of today's world in relation to one's own faltering family albeit suburb the first forty minutes sets such a professional theater i was not ready for the out loud laughs when they came although the cathartic moment built via comedy and character as the family and neighbors came together in an extraordinary way br br all in all a foreseeing of who and what we are a most meaningful film and a must see br br please note the date of this review
<START> this is one of those movies that showcases a great actor's talent and also conveys a great story it is one of stewart's greatest movies barring a few historic errors it also does an excellent job of telling the story of the spirit of st louis
<START> having grown up in the typing pool era and dealing with office politics and men who were apt to make a banquet of beauties into a delightful meal day to day this movie hits the mark good afternoon fare i understand that louis jordan wanted to work in this movie to play opposite the quintessential gorgeous suzy parker everyone wanted to be in and i believe it has done well and held up over time best on screen kiss between hope lange and the late stephen boyd br br it may not appear that anything of this is plausible but actually it was and probably still is even given the scare of sexual harassment i thought the movie was well cast except the awful acting of evans what a grease ball but he found his niche someplace else other than that all stepped up to the plate
<START> this movie was great it had everything a true action fan could want plenty of people getting shot and or maimed minimal romance involving sex a hero that can be identified with violence at many intervals instead of pointless plot storing up just one scene at the end and villains that are just asking for it bronson appears to be at his lowest level of in this film and it shows ed lauter makes a great cop and was seamlessly worked into bronson's plot without stealing his spotlight the movie doesn't involve a plot so boring or over consuming that you watch this film once and never again rather you want to see in action and the storyline just juices it up this is great stuff
