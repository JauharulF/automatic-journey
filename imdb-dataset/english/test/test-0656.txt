<START> some would argue this is better mainly because of the acting but it is indeed far worse for reasons that outweigh the improvement br br the source from which all the problems stem the story aside from one of them people being shot point blank with a shotgun in the chest and surviving for hours without medical attention there is a bigger problem nic the gangsta with the golden heart is willing to do anything for the friend he just met that day and that includes asking an evil spirit for help ce ce who comes out of nowhere with a past in voodoo is willing to summon killjoy so long as nic can hook her up the acting while improved is still horrid these people couldn't convey emotion out of a paper bag the script doesn't help them either stupid lines and i can only assume no direction from the director this script was read like shakespeare in high school with a teacher whipping them as they went br br while this movie if you can call it that at its 80 min run time thankfully is perhaps even funnier than the first because of all these things it is definitely more painful to watch 1 10
<START> first and foremost this movie has the stupidest plot of any movie i have ever seen and unfortunately i had to see this one i was flipping through channels one day and stumbled upon this lousy excuse for a movie and it confirmed what i have been saying for a long time carrot top is not an actor and is not funny in the slightest sense he acts like he's a great comedian and thinks he commands the audiences attention frankly he has the acting ability of a 10 year old class clown scratch that less than a 10 year old's ability to compare them to carrot top would be a grave insult upon their good name this movie tries to be funny using dull one liners which all seem to have been lifted from 50's cartoons by the end i would have done anything to erase my memory of this movie but sadly the memories stay with me the only thing i can do is to warn others to never to watch this movie however it proves the rumors true carrot top can't act worth a damn
<START> if you tried to make a bad film you could not make one worst that this one i can't imagine anyone paying good money to see trash like this in a theater the thing that really gets you is being mesmerized in looking at the entire thing just for the amazement of seeing how lousy it could get the redeeming facet of this film was seeing the words the end
<START> i first heard of this film when patton talked about it on his werewolves and lollipops cd he said it was a lost classic that is completely ridiculous being a lover of terrible cinema i knew i was in for a treat br br this film is hands down one of the weirdest i've ever seen certainly one of the weirdest shlock films basically a demon took human form years ago for a woman the woman died or something the demon cried blood the blood fell on the bed the bed is now possessed and it now eats along with fruit flowers and chicken it also has a taste for people the people can range between horny teens gangsters servants or professional orgy throwers there's also a sick guy who the bed ate but put his soul behind a picture in the room br br most movies let you figure out the plot through exciting action death bed takes another path it basically tells you through narration exactly what's happening while slow dull murder scenes take place also i must say everyone who's eaten by the bed are surprisingly quiet i would think if a bed is eating you through the ways of a 5th grade science fair experiment it would sting a little i guess nerve endings weren't invented until 1981 or so br br the story is wacky the direction is slow and pretty awful the sets are sparse the acting it fairly painful and the brother is one of the unintentionally ugliest actors i've ever seen probably would make a great party film if alcohol and smart asses are involved certainly one you shouldn't miss
<START> i saw this movie yesterday and thought it was awful it was pointless and just plain stupid the supposed plot concerned a prospective bridegroom too caught up in the problems of the world to relate to his bride and the other people in his life he disappears on his wedding day in a tux no less and hooks up with an assortment of weirdos br br we saw it with a bus load of people on the way down to atlantic city and everyone agreed that it was a terrible movie it was trying to be profound but it wasn't it was stupid and offensive if i wasn't on a bus i would have walked out on the movie anyone considering seeing the movie or renting or buying the video you have been forewarned
<START> i was amazed at the quality of this film particularly after seeing pictures of the barely adult director all 140 lbs of him truly a boy directing a movie about a boy i look forward to seeing more luke films br br i did think this one was a bit too long there was too much time spent showing connor being unsuccessful and unwilling to make a move on owen caleb didn't try hard enough owen being so young could have easily become closer to caleb and later decided it wasn't his preference and owen would still have learned the valuable lesson about corruption and politics instead he didn't give himself a fair chance to learn about his sexuality and what about poor caleb owen could have been a good influence br br though the film intends to show owen as a hero who overcomes perverted corruption i felt sad for owen he was offered the opportunity to have some boy boy fun with caleb who was extraordinarily beautiful owen didn't have to go along with the political perversion as offered but he could have tried to have some fun with caleb and still walked away when he wanted it was clear that owen was in charge no one forced him to do anything he didn't want to do but he could have had more fun and with a very hot boyfriend at that br br i hope luke makes more movies where appealing young characters have more fun
<START> now throw momma from the train was not a great comedy but it is a load of fun and makes you laugh the title may seem a little strange but the entire movie isn't literally about that although it is about something just as sinister br br danny de vito basically wants to kill his overbearing mother and fast forward a little bit some random and funny events take place the premise is quite funny and the things that billy crystal and danny de vito get into were great some of the scenes seemed to not fit in for me but this didn't make it a bad movie br br for what it is a wacky comedy it pulls it off well and should be seen once just to say you saw it
<START> the photography is good the costumes are good but the editing is bad the various scenes are cut or stopped at the wrong times and the conversations are s l o w and tedious this slowness continues the entire show it is a very tedious show to watch i believe that more scenes should have been added but that would make it a longer show it is very slow moving the writers should have made it just a 1 night show and not prolong our agony night after night there is nothing else on otherwise i'd change the channel the first night i feel bad for the indians of the time and am angry at the white men for what they did to the indians but thats our history
<START> if you're a sucker for corny movies and are looking to see something you don't need to pay close attention to this might be worth watching the story itself is very unrealistic the dialogue is also not very believable it is doubtful you will find yourself relating to any of these characters because none of them are very likable the acting could've been a lot worse victoria pratt is noticeably out of place with the rest of the cast as she seems to have a lot of potential and talent as an actress while it's not saying much this is one of the best acting performances i've seen from tori spelling she appears to be getting better with age overall this extremely melodramatic movie is mediocre at best
<START> this show is actually pretty good like all shows on tv it has its good episodes and its bad ones br br i have read where people compare this show to married with children and i suppose it is a similar show for the new generation however because of what was expected and allowed on tv in the days of married with children that show was taken to great extremes to show that it was in fact a television show and not meant to be take seriously br br the war at home has the luxury of being a bit more realistic the parents talk to each other like real life parents often do telling their children one thing when they will turn around and do the opposite br br sure some of the content can be considered controversial but i find this show really tries to maintain a sense of honesty like it or not there are a lot of families out there just like this one br br every episode does teach a its just that sometimes the lesson is that you will not find a perfect solution for every problem that a family may encounter and sometimes the solution is to pick the lesser of two evils we all know that in some cases as a parent the only goal you can have is to keep your kids out of really big trouble and hope that they learn right from wrong br br i respect the writers for attempting to keep the show true to life instead of having some magical ending like the cleaver family always had
<START> now i've seen it all just when i thought it couldn't get any more pathetic and cheesy than woodchipper massacre just when i thought dialogue and acting couldn't get worse than nail gun massacre just when i thought don't go in the woods would retain its title as lousiest slasher film ever along comes the last slumber party somehow this cheap wretched manure manages to avoid lewdness but it remains terrible i couldn't believe my eyes for once i can't complain about excessive or in this case any nudity in a slasher film but it still managed to make me crimson with embarrassment for renting it never before have i seen such horrible acting dialect direction writing i could go on forever with this list here's a quick run down br br a mental patient somehow escapes from the loony bin dresses up like a surgeon somehow finds out where his doctor lives and breaks in while the doctor's daughter is having friends over for the night then begins the most stupid killing spree ripped off from other movies such as slumber party massacre and halloween this side of the universe the characters have negative iqs which suggests they are not human then again i guess they are not since they have the tendency to bleed kool aid when they get cut as the slasher likes to show use when he holds up his to the camera in way too many scenes it is only 80 minutes how many times must we look at that like that before it consumes the whole movie which i suppose wouldn't be all that bad of an idea in this case there is one moment where i thought maybe just maybe the director would make it interesting a second killer was added but alas it was not to be and then to insult even further there is a stupid super cop out sub ending and an even stupider final conclusion that probably doesn't make a whole lot of sense but i would hate to give away the dumbest few scenes in movie history to those two or three fools like me dumb enough to rent this sewage br br i sure hope that by writing this i have saved 80 minutes of someone's life i get on my hands and knees to beg anyone still thinking about renting this please please please don't this is a fan of the slasher genre talking i know what is good for you the only real victims in this asinine nonsense are the poor morons that have sat through the whole toilet tank score since there is no negative point scale i have to give it a 1 but a below average 1 at that avoid it at all costs please
<START> for all the cast and crew who worked on this excuse for a movie another payday in l a for any audience hoping for a fair return for the price of admission a huge waste of time and money the saddest aspect of this ugly exercise to me is that we are watching an extremely talented actor pacino seemingly playing a parody of himself that's what remained with me as a total mystery i can fully understand the need for movie industry people to work and thus make a living what i fail to comprehend is an artist of al pacino's talent prostituting and embarrassing himself with this level of mindless junk hopefully he'll choose projects of better value in the future and for value save your time and hard earned money skip this let's send hollywood and al a message
<START> there must be an error this movie belongs with plan 9 and a lot others as a quite entertaining silly diversion you'll never accept you like it yet you will watch it whenever it comes out on tv it's as simple as that
<START> shirley knight plays sara ravenna a long island housewife who runs away from her marriage when she discovers she is pregnant she plans to drive into america's heartland and start anew along the way she picks up a friendly hitchhiker james caan who calls himself 'killer ' soon she discovers that the good natured 'killer' is actually brain damaged and by picking him up she has unknowingly taken on a huge responsibility the two of them drive all the way to nebraska where sara gets killer a job helping out at a roadside reptile farm it is here that sara meets gordon a local cop and soon things go horribly wrong for everyone br br this is a powerful drama about people disconnected from society alienated by the choices they make or by the limits imposed on them by others even with such a low budget and a very freewheeling attitude the film is able to capture everything that needs to be said through these clearly defined characters shirley knight has a complex role and there are moments of some awe inspiring acting by her one of my favorites is when she is on the telephone calling her home to her worried husband the first time it is such a tense scene on both ends and in every small gesture and inflection of a word so much about her is spoken with so little then comes in the character of 'killer' played by james caan this character is unlike any i've ever seen him play and he performs wonderfully it's one of his best performances as he is very restrained and moving br br the way coppola develops the characters by using short dream like flashbacks is very clever adding a fragmented kind of view onto it all the quick flashbacks that are graphic and self contained contrast well with the longer shots in some crucial scenes also because this film was shot on location all over the eastern u s it offers an interesting authentic look at america in the late 1960's br br i haven't seen many other films starring ms knight i'm only familiar with her more recent work on television usually playing a nagging mother in law or a dotty old woman it was great seeing her so young beautiful and so wonderfully subtle in this movie it's also kind of a shame that james caan went on to be typecast as the 'tough guy' for the rest of his career because this film evidenced that he is capable of so much more than that
<START> by in this drama ja rule who stars as reggie struggles with the loss of his father his old friend j bone who is a cold blooded thug recently released from prison helps reggie find who murdered his father a week after his dad died a preacher reverend came up dead reggie was suppose to be the one to kill him but did he did reggie kill reverend or was it some type of a setup back in the day also has a couple of romantic scenes see reggie falls in love with the preacher's daughter and j bone doesn't approve of his love fiend as j bone tries to destroy what they have reggie learns that love is about forgiveness but what j bone is doing does it work do reggie and his girlfriend break up or does it bring them closer together i like this movie because it leaves you wondering what's going to happen next and did this or that happen i like movies with suspense it kind of makes you want to be in the movie so that you could detect things i also like this movie because everything falls in place if you really pay attention to it
