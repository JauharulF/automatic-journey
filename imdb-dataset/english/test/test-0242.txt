<START> this is a really silly job of miscasting about as bad as hepburn playing a chinese woman in dragon seed the lead part hepburn plays is a combination of granny from the beverly hillbillies and a faith healer this film is even worse than bogart's swing your lady because at least bogart didn't play a hillbilly he was just surrounded by them and the dialog sounds as if it comes right from a li'l abner strip the problems don't really end with the outrageous casting though as the plot is completely muddled and the love story might make your head hurt for no reason whatsoever married robert young falls for this ozark bobcat was it her lovely personality that won his heart i doubt it as she as the fiery spitfire the movie was named after and she really seemed to like fightin' and and hollerin' was it her feminine charms with no makeup and fashions that looked like they were designed by ma kettle i doubt if this was the case as well to top this off in the end somehow ralph bellamy also fell for her though once again it really doesn't seem to make any sense br br so here we have two city fallin' for a scrappy she beast played by ms hepburn now that's a recipe for a good film
<START> everyone told me to see cactus flower and i finally did what a wonderful movie the perfect pick me up for a sunday night dreading monday morning matthau and hawn were good but ingrid bergman really made this movie after all it was really about her the truly great actors can do anything and miss bergman proves it she shows us in the course of one film a range few people display in their entire career the scene in the dance club was as hysterical as it was touching even as the film drew to its obvious conclusion i found myself cheering for miss dickinson as if she were the boston red sox thankfully she made out no pun intended much better
<START> for a tv movie this was definately worth seeing all the acting was very well done and the story itself had a touching universal theme i have not read seen the original and as a rule i can't stand shakespeare but i enjoyed this movie the civil war setting was very well done as well dont expect to see an epic however you should find it moving enough to enjoy by the way on a side note don't compare this or any other movie for that matter to the original work movies aren't supposed to transfer a book to the screen but rather take the general idea of it a then adapt a story from it when people say the book was so much better they're usually wrong anyway what they are really trying to say is the book was so different
<START> just as ted kramer dustin hoffman is about to get a break in his professional life his frustrated wife joanna meryl streep finally gets up the courage to leave him leaving ted to care for their five year old son justin henry being a single parent proves to be quite the chore for ted and he suffers professionally but also learns there's much more to life than a career as he continues to bond with and really get to know his own son but then joanna returns and intends to get her son back which leads to a cruel custody trial br br kramer vs kramer is a superbly well written and magnificently acted human drama that will only leave the most cold hearted a viewer untouched hoffman's growing relationship with his son is so well portrayed and the film never takes an easy way out it always feels very real and thanks to the film's low key approach it makes even more of an impact and can easily work upon multiple viewings the film's dramatic impact does not lessen br br easily recommended 10 out of 10
<START> it's less visceral than the only other tsai film i've seen vive l'amour but the idea of doorways holes into others' emotions and existences is vividly portrayed here as tsai sets up long shot after long shot usually with long takes suggesting a sense of alienation in taipei the musical interludes inspired by grace chang are perplexing but welcome mile markers that add new dimensions to the slowly evolving relationship between the young man upstairs and the woman downstairs it's not necessarily an easy film to watch although it's not heavy handed by any means so i'd warn any casual viewers who are looking for some indie entertainment like tarantino or guy ritchie but if you'd like to know something about isolation among city dwellers in taiwan and something more universal about city alienation and romantic yearning then watch this film immediately
<START> lois weber's film hypocrites was and still kind of is a very bold and daring film i enjoyed it and was very impressed by the filming and story of it the priest sees the hypocrisy of the people in his church and tries to show them the naked truth the people are appalled when he reveals the naked statue portraying truth after failing to lead them to it and the few that did help along the way the people do not want to face the truth that they are doing anything wrong but it shows them putting things before god going to beach parties acting inappropriate their materialistic ways and other things in which the people of our world do that tend to not be morally right in the end failing to gain any followers he must enter into the gates of heaven alone this film seems to me to be very bold in the fact that a naked woman is shown throughout it especially considering the time period in which this film was made the imagery and symbolism portrayed in this movie i found incredible the way they made the naked woman translucent and using a naked woman to symbolize the naked truth shows a lot of creativity and art showing the different sins of the people as they walked down the road and refused to follow along the path each with different excuses setbacks and or higher priorities was a great way of representing the people of today this film does a very good job of getting the moral message across to its audience lois weber has a tremendous way of capturing her spectators' attention with her creativity symbolism visuals and through auditory even the music of the piano throughout this film is very beautiful and fitting with the whole theme
<START> i don't usually like tv movies i reckon that if the thing was any good it would make it to hollywood this one though is better than average pretty high production values a few interesting story twists and some nice shots of nyc along with toronto hold the interest
<START> lackawanna blues is a drama through and through it details the life of a strong woman by the name of rachel crosby s rachel is referred to as nanny by all who know her but she could have just as easily been called wonder woman she epitomized strength will power confidence and resolve she owned a home that she used to house just about every type of person that society would reject her tenants consisted of a lesbian a psychotic war veteran an amputee and a host of other vagrants that made the home miles away from ordinary each successive event rachel took in stride and handled flawlessly she wasn't a dictator devoid of compassion but in fact she was quite the opposite she displayed compassion almost to a fault by giving shelter and refuge to so many that she seemed to over extend herself br br did a good job but i believe this role was right up her alley anyway the movie had an even keel never straying from rachel there were of course dramatic moments but they were to be expected nothing was ever to shocking or profound other than rachel herself
<START> every sunday is an eleven minute short subject featuring the talents of two of its young juvenile contract players a pair who would develop into players of note in the future it's interesting and entertaining to see the contrasting styles of judy garland and deanna durbin as they perform at a sunday concert for deanna's uncle br br of course no one knew how big both of these young ladies would get to be i've always wondered why mayer kept garland and let durbin go to universal l b always had pretensions to culture and this was the guy who had jeanette macdonald at his studio and later on hired such lovely soprano voices as jane powell ann blyth morrow etc br br judy certainly had her glorious career at mgm but she paid a heavy price for it deanna along with abbott costello and several gothic horror monsters preserved universal pictures she was smart enough to get out at the top and make it stick br br so in their salad days deanna durbin and judy garland
<START> despite having an absolutely horrid script more about that later this film is still vaguely watchable just because it stars two excellent actors barbara stanwyck and henry fonda aside from one or two real stinkers i'd probably watch just about anything with them in the film as i am a huge fan of hollywood's golden age of the 1930s and 40s however no matter how much i love their films i just can't recommend this film br br the movie begins with fonda and stanwyck on vacation at some ski resort the two haven't yet met but the film begins loudly and obnoxiously with a scene in which fonda horribly while skiing it was done so unsubtly and made my teeth grind but i stuck it out especially when fonda fell into a snow bank and this stopped the in hindsight perhaps i should have just turned it off then fonda is knocked out in the fall and barbara goes for help back at the ski lodge he seems okay but fortunately she is also a doctor and has him x rayed and nurses him back to health he in turn becomes infatuated with her and proposes to her despite hardly knowing each other they marry and so far the film seems like a sweet but very slight romantic comedy br br once home however all isn't rosy as she jumps right back into her job as a family doctor and he begins exhibiting signs that he is a controlling and potentially dangerous man due to his jealousy the film plays it all for laughs but frankly fonda's behaviors were really creepy spying on her and her male patients attacking or threatening any man she treats tripping a patient who already has a back injury and stomping into a surprise party and insisting that everyone there men and women are out to steal away his wife he comes off as a combination of a sociopath and paranoid schizophrenic but it's all supposed to be for laughs considering that he seems like a dangerous nut you would think that stanwyck would file for an along with a restraining order but oddly she gets mad but just can't stay mad at fonda because he's so i can't think of the right word is all that comes to mind later out of the blue multi millionaire fonda gets a job working the counter at a department store then through magical thinking he and babs seem to assume his hostility and violent jealousy is all a thing of the past so a job apparently cures anger and suspicions when this job falls through the film ends with fonda buying his own hospital giving barbara a job there and they live happily ever after they don't go any further with the story but i assume based on fonda's character that he then spent most of his time as hospital administrator beating up all the male patients br br the first portion at the ski lodge and the next did not fit well together nor did the final horatio alger inspired section where the rich boy made good in the business world they were like three separate plots but despite this the most serious problem with the film was its seeming to excuse away domestic violence and delusional jealousy what a creepy little film thank goodness neither fonda nor stanwyck are known for this film but for all their other lovely films
<START> this movie reminds me old b movies but not in a good way br br when i saw the first scene i thought it was going to be a spoof of one of those early sf films the terrible acting the plastic props and the noticeable visual effects gave me that impression br br but no the movie is really that bad the story is a complete nonsense the effects are below the level of a tv production even the editing is a mess br br the only thing that kept me in the theater was that i wanted to know the end of the story although i was pretty sure it was going to be silly and it was br br there are better ways to spend your time and money
<START> thirty pieces of silver and a kiss for luck this one was another totally unexpected gem usually i'm not even a suspense thriller fan this satisfying 100 minutes has more twists than a boardwalk pretzel it has titillating erotic romance reminiscent of body heat in more ways than one it has cops and crime political intrigue and just a dash of daytime soap it has just the right touch of gritty violence that any professional by the numbers crime job must employ emma thompson fbi delivers her role with grace and humor and gets my vote for best fake southern accent by a limey alan rickman local cop who always seems to steal the show is excellent but not overbearing they work well as a pair lots of plot misdirection that never gets out of control and gets coherently at film's end and who is this awesome woman carla i want her to bear my children carla if you're out there let's do lunch
<START> this tale of the upper classes getting their come uppance and wallowing in their high class misery is like a contemporary mid version of an old joan crawford movie in which she suffered in mink here people behave in a frightfully civilized manner in the face of adversity a well heeled london solicitor tom wilkinson discovers that not only is his wife having an affair with the local gentry but that she has also killed their housekeeper's husband in a hit and run accident he throws up but otherwise his stiff upper lip hardly br br written and directed by julian fellowes who won an oscar for writing gosford park this is his directorial debut from a novel by nigel it's quite comical although i am not sure how much of the comedy is intended it's like a throw back to british films of the forties where characters all behaved like characters in books or plays rather than like people might in real life however it's not all bad wilkinson is terrific even if you never believe in him as a person while emily watson the adulterous wife and rupert everett the highly amoral high class totty are both very good at covering the cracks in the material tony pierce roberts' cinematography ensures that no matter how hard it is on the ear it's always good on the eye
<START> jim brown stars and produces a tale set in the philippines just after the japanese invasion the story has the japanese taking several navy men prisoner including some divers who they use to retrieve the gold that macarthur had dumped into the manila bay br br it's a messy movie aiming to make a statement about war and racism the film uses edwin war in a not so subtle montage the performances are just adequate at best jim brown is okay but he doesn't really show any sort of range in a performance that just has him standing there looking annoyed the sets are serviceable but seem rather cheap the film suffers from the outset due to a great deal of stock footage including many of the best known shots from the japanese attack in tora tora tora the use of such big budget sequence effectively makes the rest of the film look positively anemic it also reminds one that there are better films out there one could be watching for me the film seems to have half a real plot the retrieval of the silver and half a plot that is there just to fill time none of it is particularly exciting even with the explosive finale br br given the choice i'd take a pass
<START> macbeth is one of the most frequently told stories in cinema and has been translated many times in numerous theater and celluloid settings originally written by william shakespeare in the early 1600's macbeth tells the story of betrayal among royalty and one man's quest for power director geoffrey wright romper tries his hand at updating macbeth by setting it in the contemporary melbourne underworld a film where the characters substitute swords for guns ala baz romeo and juliet and royal for gangsters macbeth is a gritty violent but critically flawed film br br macbeth sam works for king duncan gary sweet after being elevated to the of by the king as was prophesied to macbeth by three witches macbeth starts setting his eyes on the throne one night the king comes to stay at macbeth's house and lady macbeth victoria hill talks him into killing the king to assume power macbeth kills his master and then assumes his crown but success has it's downside as macbeth soon finds out when he has to go to hideous lengths to protect his murderous secret br br ok first things first the film's major fault is sam his portrayal of macbeth is in a word boring i honestly didn't care about macbeth while watching the film i had more sympathy for victoria hill's lady macbeth because she bothered to act at least sits sullen and wood faced throughout the entire film i felt like he was doing his best impression of johnny george jung character from blow but without the charisma i have never seen in a film before so i'm not sure if it was his or the director's fault but either way the glue that should have tied everything together into one cohesive unit is weak br br the dialog is good but when matched up to the geoffrey wright's australian gangster motif seems a bit out of place paced action sequences mixed with long musings creates pacing conflict within the film i understand that this is macbeth and that the director wanted to use the original dialog intact but hard fast action scenes following a three minute soliloquy tends to get annoying if not a bit pretentious br br the camera work is highly stylized and for the most part it works well one thing that i found annoying was how the camera would slowly jostle back and forth almost constantly i don't mind shots like that it's just overdone it's passes beyond the realm of being cool and stylish and instead becomes irritating other than that the art direction and cinematography is fairly well done br br for all of the good qualities macbeth possesses stylish direction shakespearian dialog a strong soundtrack supernatural nude witches the weird sisters and good helpings of brutal bloody violence all of these strengths are forgotten when one considers sam uninspired portrayal of macbeth the role of macbeth was essential for tying everything together and in this respect geoffrey wright and sam failed miserably making macbeth a forgettable foray into shakespeare
