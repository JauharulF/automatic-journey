<START> i was laying in bed flicking through the channels and boy do i have channels 500 of them with over 70 movie channels i probably watch a movie on cable once or twice a month dvd has me br br anyway i'm flicking through and i come to this movie and because i see portman i take interest 110 minutes later i am still interested how could this be when i first saw the previews to this movie in the theater i remember making fun of it i never thought i'd watch it nevermind like it br br the story is based on a book and you can tell the movie is very episodic not like the movie has a great plot it just sucks you in may be its that performances that do it i'm pretty sure in must have been br br this movie was good for no reason br br peter's movie rating out of 10 7
<START> not having seen the film in its commercial debut we just caught with it via dvd expecting the worst hitch proved to be a pleasant experience because of the three principals in it thanks to andy tenant's direction the film has an easy pace and while predictable the comedy has some winning moments br br hitch is a sort of date coordinator for losers like albert who is not exactly what one would consider a hunk yet albert is a genuine guy who without some professional help would go unnoticed by the same women he would like to take out enter hitch to prepare him to overcome the obstacles that he can't overcome and even though albert stays overweight and never gets to master social graces he conquers us because he is a real in sharp contrast with all the phonies making the rounds in manhattan br br the basic mistake most production designers make when preparing locales for hollywood films is how out of touch with reality they are the apartments in which they these characters are so rare to find that only by the magic of the movies can these people live in places likes these evidently most of the movie people are dealing with fantasy since most city dwellers would kill for spaces so fabulous as the ones they show in the movies let alone these same people depicted in the film would not be able to afford them br br will smith is a charismatic actor he has a disarming way to charm without doing much the surprise of the movie though is kevin james who as the overweight albert not only win us over but he proves he can hold his own in his scenes with mr smith eva mendez is fine as the main interest of hitch in minor roles we see adam arkin amber michael rappaport and phillip among others br br hitch is a fun film to watch thanks to the inspired direction by andy tenant
<START> this is a better than average entry in the saint series it holds your interest and as mysteries should keeps you guessing until the end and has several suspects to choose from br br many films from the golden age are not for all tastes especially younger viewers they date themselves by clothing cars settings etc who nowadays asks for a or wears a suit and tie everywhere and the legal process was so much simpler must have been a dearth of lawyers back then frankly much of value is missing from those days br br in any case go with it and enjoy it's good in an old fashioned sense
<START> minor spoilers will follow br br this movie is even more odd and unconventional than songs from the second floor there is no main character we follow around there is no plot in the conventional way there is no emphasis on an happy end there is no in other words roy is back with a vengeance instead of falling back on convention and fixed formula roy concentrates his film around an idea i will not go into what that idea is but even if you don't get it i promise that you will see the greatest visual depth ever put to film the majestic scenes from songs pale in comparison here a work of visual splendor br br so be kind to your fellow man because after all we are the living and only you and i have the power to change our lives that is at least what i thought when i saw the final scene in the movie with the inhumane bomber planes sweeping in over the city in the film to take our lives away br br and of course don't forget to see this movie when it gets a limited release near you this is one of those movies that actually have the power to make you a better person like de sica's bicycle thieves a very warm and humanistic film
<START> i am ashamed to say it but i have to admit the first time i saw this film was only about a year ago after seeing it i immediately rushed out and bought the dvd collectors' edition and have watched it many times since br br the film is terrific on many levels it works as your straight monster or action type film as a horror sci fi and also as a very intriguing look into the human psyche the incredible sense of paranoia mistrust and fear lent not only by carpenter's direction which is stunning but also by the incredible acting of the cast in general kurt russell obviously is spectacularly understated in the lead role of macready and as a direct result he feels like a real person rather than a hollywood all american hero the other cast members all carry off their roles with style and the net result is an intensely believable atmosphere and a truly fantastic film
<START> i saw this movie as a child and i am longing to see it again has it survived i discount the 1980 version entirely as being fluff i am sure that there are many that don't feel it is necessary to preserve these films it is so unfortunate to discover a lost gem after it is gone young people today don't realize the hallucinatory quality and the impact on one's life a film seen in early youth can have in later life this film the blue lagoon had that effect on me how many of us have wished to find ourselves in a place removed of the fears and chaos of the modern world this was an idyllic story of a boy and girl castaway on a tropical island there are troubles to be sure but in the end they fall in love and the have a baby life should be so simple and beautiful
<START> this was a riveting film one that really drew me in i'm a big fan of william h macy and he puts in a wonderful performance his great likeability coupled with the way his character breaks the fourth wall really gave me a sense of complicity in his actions i found myself waiting tensely for the whole house of cards to come collapsing down around him and by extension myself as his confidante and silent witness it took several minutes for me to relax once the film had ended i was so wrapped up in it br br good performances all around too not just with macy arkin was quite good as was cromwell he was surprisingly fierce in short i highly recommend this film to any fans of macy and or the murder mystery but you may want to prepare to feel a little guilty
<START> three young movie theater employees are given the task of re opening a long closed old time theater at which many years before a shocking series of grisly murders took place it seems many more murders have occurred since then but all of this remains unknown to these three young upstart employees hoping to finally make it big on their own as they approach the grand re opening night things keep getting stranger and more unsettling with items suddenly starting to move around by themselves without any seen aid and a terrifying old man seemingly haunting the premises br br oh this is truly horrible in fact if it wasn't for mary woronov's secretary character being such a fiercely independent outspoken empowered young woman who steals practically every scene in which she appears and the incredibly hot chick who played the unbelievably sleazy yet totally sexy selina this would be a total loss the only other good thing i have to say about this film is some of the movie theater murders are done in truly inventive albeit not overly gory a preference for me but not necessarily for others fashion the rest just wallows in constant sleaze so extreme the rare few may actually find humor in it and runs through the predictable slasher kills annoying characters off one after the other routine
<START> i have only seen this movie once when i was about 14 years old but i was thrilled that they made a movie about the division being from oklahoma and especially now that both of my sons are members of the i would like to see it released on a dvd i may sound a little bias but the division sometimes does not get the recognition it deserves today the history channel always talks about the other infantry divisions when it talks about ww2 and korea but you rarely hear it mention the one of the scene that really stood out for me was when the had the indian code at work and the puzzled look on the german soldiers faces when they could not understand this language i am glad that all of the native american code are getting the recognition they deserve
<START> we saw this in a bargain basket at the local asda Â£1 50 for the dvd reading all the hype plastered all over the cover saying how hillarious it is and it also had a really good established cast we thought this must a great film br br so we bought took it home shoved it in the dvd player sat back and waited for the to begin and waited and waited and waited a bit more br br some 90 minutes later although it felt more like 3 hours the credits rolled and that was the end of that br br what a letdown even paying Â£1 50 seemed a con god knows what caine richardson and were thinking when they said 'yes' to this tosh and as for moran well much as i enjoyed black books shaun of the dead and his comedy tours i felt he was out of his depth in this film he tried too hard playing for laughs probably thinking that if retaining the characteristics from his black books character would work here br br sadly it back fired the gags fell flat after awhile and then he became just an irritation which is a shame because i believe given the right part he could be a very good film character actor br br anyway to sum up the actors in the actors failed to act br br
<START> for three quarters of an hour the story gradually develops towards a pivotal point of some sort although it is overburdened with scenes that just seem to be intended to dull the viewer and lure him away from the actual plot there is something happening it is not much and it certainly is not obvious the combination of palace impressions and story driving scenes do not add any depth or insight to the whole cast of characters in fact they keep them sterile as there is no character development at all everybody just remains spinning and centered around their own clichÃ© and role the cute kinda headstrong girl the fighting the snobby aristocrat the male lead does not seem to have any distinction at all he is a shallow presence which actually doesn't even matter as he is only there because the storyboard required him to it seemed like he was on vacation and got caught up when the point comes of turning the corner in terms of what happening the movie first snaps completely blank for a couple of minutes and then becomes ridiculous it solves or better dissolves itself with a by the book deus ex machina more clichÃ©s and some of the most crude plot devices and choices i have ever seen it's history alright first the movie's a drama though it's supposed to be comedic and then it turns into a farce the protagonists do what they are expected to do and there are no surprises the first set of somewhat serious antagonists however gets replaced by a couple that literally was just bored maybe that was some kind of nod towards the audience br br this movie does not get any bonus from me for underlying philosophical meaning since there is none nor for its technical realization the animation and editing is fair and so's the sound mixing but it is by no means outstanding or even above the average japanese productions of the late 1980's in fact the visual treats seem static un inspired and un original br br worst of all it totally fails to entertain even if you don't bother with characters and all that stuff there's too little going on here and the rest is corny at best get a real ghibli instead have a feast with it and keep your fingers off this one
<START> like in les amants du pont two outsiders lives a love story without concessions the film consists out of a lot of interesting conversation and a lot of sweet moments the best one comes in a listening booth they listen to a record together and once in a while they look at each other they talk they like each other she suggests a change in their lives but he is out of hope the realistic over the realistic but emotive dialogs a really screenwriter's work for this film spanish novel director jesus creates one of the most perfect gallery from the latest year of spanish cinema
<START> i like full house and step by step the same i don't have a favorite episode i just like certain scenes but some scenes i don't like but i haft to say the reason i started watching this show is because it had suzanne summers in it and my most favorite character was dana and karen could be a snob sometimes but she was good character also i just like to watch family shows instead of trash that has a lot of drugs and violence this show is a lot like other family shows where one of the parents are always strict about and dates other than step by step my other favorite shows are full house sabrina the teenage witch gomer pyle usmc the andy griffith show and dukes of hazzard
<START> i rented this type of soft core before but i can honestly say i wasn't expecting this to be in the same type as rod steele you only live until you die which was both sexy and funny it had a good script a sincere leading man and a sense of purpose it also has gabriella hall who is hot the reason why i didn't expect this movie was because the box was missing the must be 18 to rent sticker i was looking for more cheese and less cheesecake br br first of all i think movies shouldn't be allowed to start with actors rehearsing for a part at a talent agency or wherever actors rehearse in this movies seeing the actors rehearsing highlights the lack of preparation that went into acting out the real characters in the movie br br okay having found out that this was a soft core movie i didn't necessarily turn it off and demand my money back but the dizzying way the extended video erotic scenes are added to what was probably a late night pay cable release are very annoying and easy to fast forward through without the sustained quality of say rod steele you know they must've had some money because i think some of it is filmed overseas br br i will have to say the main actor trying not to spill the invisibility potion on himself is one of the most baffling acting jobs i've ever seen and i've seen from manos it may actually have been worth the dollar rental fee that and gabriella hall still there are better corny movies to rent with your friends
<START> this film is on my list of worst movies ever made the story is disconnected and it is difficult to understand what is going on or the reason for the characters' actions all films need to have an inner logic and this film just doesn't have it the story doesn't make any sense br br to see faye dunaway christopher plummer and diana quick wasting their talents in this movie is a crime faye dunaway is the lucky one because she plays the victim and gets killed early in the film on the other hand donald sutherland must be an amazing actor because he manages to look good in spite of bad directing and bad writing his performance is believable and he manages to stay in character in spite of everything br br if dame agatha christie were alive she would die laughing the movie is that bad
