<START> i must be honest i like romantic comedies but this was not what i had hoped for i thought ellen degeneres was having the biggest part which should have been because i didn't like the two struggling bed partners it was awful poor tom selleck he had to act with someone who was that much in the picture while it should have been him and ellen to be in most of the film they were the only believable ones and the only really funny parts starred them not kate capshaw and that everett guy cool that mummy is coming out of the closet i thought that was a nice surprise br br i'm just glad i saw it on the cable and i didn't pay any money renting it
<START> okay so this was made way back in 1993 directed loosely by robert and written loosely by john it's supposed to be based on a true story hard to believe anyone could be so stupid and blind to the truth for certainly it was obvious from the beginning that this dame was after all she could get br br tim matheson looking somewhat older than i remember him played the empty headed man who was looking for romance in his somewhat dull and empty life well it came to him in the likes of tracy pollan a somewhat vacant looking girl with kinky sex as her means of conquering her guys br br come on phone sex even in the 90s was old hat can't believe someone would fall for that old line but mr matheson seemed to buy it and it cost him plenty br br the hardest scene to take was when he finally threw the dame out of his apartment putting all her junk in the hallway in front of his apartment and then had the stupidity not to change the locks that's when i had enough of this trite movie it made me want to wish the dame had tried it on me so i could have the satisfaction of telling her to take a hike br br i give this chestnut a 1 out of 100 that's how bad i thought it was i guess you can't blame the actors but they were awful did they actually try to play this with a straight face
<START> as i read the script on line i thought capote needed a trim having just seen it on ppv i can tell you it wasn't trimmed it was butchered like that poor family example in the script truman dubs shawn adorable one here he is mr shawn br br bad enough the amateurs behind this movie de flame capote and bash his circle are we to really believe they thought so little of they mangled her little opus like an obnoxious in joke they turn perry smith into this oh so sensitive victim even as he's shown dispatching the clutters it's one thing to fudge the facts it's another to drop the ball the executions were carried out between 12 45 1 19 am april 14 truman is shown at the prison 22 hours later br br i was totally underwhelmed by the acting keener doesn't even try to sound like an alabama native the way cooper kept shouting alvin i was waiting for the to show up hoffman gives us not the charming gadfly but a pathetic suck up who sees an horrific act as his ticket to the big time when hoffman whines about being tortured by the endless appeals i wanted to give him a shotgun so he could do us both a favor and blow his brains out
<START> i could not believe what i saw once brilliant actors appearing in this dire effort that should never of been made the plots are dreadful and the dialogue at first i thought it was a spoof and the acting abysmal everything about it is bad from the cheap sets to the phony backdrops a bunch of paintings enlarged respectable filmakers struggle to get their vision realised yet this blasphemous pathetic attempt at a mini series makes it to our television's with 3 oscar winners making appearances i can only guess everyone involved somehow hurt the writer and director and were forced maybe at gunpoint to star in this worthless t v trash
<START> what a clunker br br it must have been made for tv or cable br br look forget the screenplay forget the bunch of forgettable actors excuse me continuity the nsa whatever or whoever he is an agent takes off in an f16 is shown in an chucking his guts up and later the aircraft shown is an phantom oooh wish that i could be so cavalier br br apart from the male actors the women are wasps blue eyed and long legged and eventually get to cry about the heroes who save them even when a solid weld could save most of the cosmo astro the blond drops the welding tool duh br br as an sf movie one out of ten as a movie per se 1 2 that's a half point they should have ditched the space station and headed for mars br br major raspberries
<START> it starts off pretty well with the accident and the decision not to return to la but everything falls into place too quickly there is a decent plot twist towards the end but so many scenes that don't make sense randy played by brian austin green comes home angry and ready to confront people and he takes the time to put on the club when he parks his car in front of his house in the middle of nowhere i don't want to spoil it for anyone who does decide to see it but the last 45 minutes are ridiculous even the acting which wasn't bad early on turns bad towards the end don't bother unless you want to see how bad it is
<START> okay i admit i like brigitte neilsen in an unhealthy way i just have a thing for tall women with swords there i said it br br what's wrong with the movie just about every mistake you can make was made you take a successful movie series conan and you drag it through the mud with a bad script bad casting bad effects and the worst thing of all you put a cute kid in there for comic relief this kind of thing almost killed the indiana jones series ya know cute kids are for disney movies not real movies neilsen at least took the movie seriously even though it seems nobody else did the plot had schwarzenegger repeatedly pulling red sonja's fat out of the fire and that undercut her character considerably a warrior woman doesn't need a dude to get her out of a mess thats her job to not re use the conan character in this movie was a crime sheesh the movie never set the proper mood and its pacing was rather disjointed and sloppy unlike conan the barbarian which had multiple story lines that flowed gracefully when it comes to fantasy movies its okay to have cheesy costumes its okay to have harryhausen style animation its okay to have silly exorbitant sets that make no sense but to have a horrible script is unforgivable br br this movie could have been a classic but the script felt like it was written by a 12 year old
<START> my god the things that passed for entertainment in this country br br this is not the tom and jerry you may have enjoyed on saturday mornings featuring a hapless cat and a clever mouse this is a much earlier animation series featuring a pair of mutt and jeff clones who get themselves into various scrapes that result in any of the then typical dancing skeleton type gags that made up so much of early animation br br this particularly vile outing apparently originally intended as a vehicle for a pair of actual black stage comedians of the time has the pair crashing in the ocean while flying to africa necessitating black face make up exaggerated negro dialect and don't fail me now situations br br it only shows that in the 70 years between emancipation and this film the american view of africans hadn't progressed much then again at least one of them apparently had a pilot's license
<START> with all the dreck out there this is a gentle movie about young love yes it's true that young love often makes more out of something than it deserves but why aren't people down on romeo and juliet paul and michelle are models of good behave compared to them br br yes they run away and set up an ideal life but this is a movie not real life paul is more sexually interested than michelle who has been come onto in a bad way eventually they have sex but no one is forced into it the movie does let kids know that sex can cause babies br br one thing there is nudity in the movies the camera does not focus on it but it is there br br the ending of the movie has paul in good chance of being found out in paul and michelle they separate for a time if you don't like the ending of a movie think one up yourself alternative endings are not just for dvds
<START> after two brief scenes that at first seem unrelated to the rest of the film we see a dark haired obviously rich beauty in the back of a limousine her driver stops at an odd location on mulholland drive which is a twisting thickly wooded two lane road full of mansions overlooking los angeles just as her driver and another man in the passenger seat turn around to kill her two drag racing cars from the opposite direction come crashing into the limo only the dark haired woman survives she works her way down the ridge to sunset boulevard and hides in a vacationing woman's apartment shortly after betty naomi watts the vacationing woman's niece shows up at the apartment and runs into the dark haired woman who now has amnesia the bulk of the first part of the film is betty and the dark haired woman trying to figure out who she is why people were trying to kill her and why she had thousands of dollars and a strange key in her purse this is interspersed with oddly surreal threads about hollywood producers and directors with occasional forays into a land of hoodlums and prostitutes br br the above may sound a bit complicated and disjointed but that's not the half of it the film is constructed so that the meaning will always be open to interpretation it's basically guaranteed that you will not understand this film and you will not have very much confidence arriving at your own interpretation the first time around even if you have a lot of experience with like minded films such as memento 2000 donnie darko 2001 the i inside 2003 and the butterfly effect 2004 you may not understand it on a second viewing either the studio was aware of this to the extent that they had director david lynch write 10 clues to unlocking this thriller and they put it on the back of the chapter listing insert in the dvd lynch being of a particular disposition these clues are almost as cryptic as the film itself it doesn't help when trying to figure it out in the early stages that the structure is extremely complex it takes a very long time to figure out what parts are supposed to be real and there is a complex nesting of flashbacks in some sections with only contextual clues that they're flashbacks br br but is the film worth watching or worth trying to figure out that depends on your tastes obviously on a surface level the film is certainly attractive if you are a fan of surrealism although it will tend to seem a bit slow and overly disjointed to some viewers but those qualities and many other surrealist aspects of the film are typical of lynch a prime lynchian moment is the old couple in the beginning bizarrely smiling almost as if they're alien pod people trying to put on a front if you're familiar with that style and like it you'll find much to love here although in many ways mulholland drive is fairly understated for lynch it's also worth noting for viewers who'll primarily be interested in it or who enjoy it just as much as other aspects that mulholland drive has a quite steamy lesbian scene it's not gratuitous although i have no problems with but is instead an important hinge in the film br br like all of lynch's films it's easy to become enraptured in his unique approach to every aspect of filmic art and his attention to detail any serious student of film including armchair students cinephiles should study mulholland drive many will love it lynch doesn't let anything pass unmanipulated he includes brilliant color schemes such as the plethora of reds and pinks with important symbolism he makes unusual use of sound such as the ringing telephone carrying over into the section of score that follows it when betty first arrives at the airport he directs his actors to deliver their lines in a plethora of bizarre ways such as his characteristic odd pauses he lets his odd and surprising sense of humor poke through such as the name and the hot dogs made for pinks sign that provides a clue to some of the color symbolism br br lynch's attention to detail in production design provides important subtle clues throughout the film to help one unlock the meaning it's interesting to note that lynch even apparently demands that the dvd programming be unusual there are no chapters on the disc you must either watch the film in real time or fast forward or rewind to get back to particular points br br if the surrealism and veiled meaning of the film are attractive to you or if you're just fond of puzzles then mulholland drive is well worth watching for that aspect there is a fairly accepted interpretation of the film at least on a broad generalized level i won't recount the standard interpretation here it is worth researching but only after you've seen the film a couple times and have reached your own conclusions many articles and have been written on the film and interpretations there are even websites dedicated to it br br for my money however although i generally love lynch and find many things about mulholland drive attractive it is not quite a 10 for me at least not yet i have a feeling that my score could still rise on subsequent viewings to me though the twist aspect of the film is done much better in other works such as the i inside and the butterfly effect mulholland drive is more attractive to me for its surface surrealistic touches but the plot doesn't carry them as well as some of lynch's other films br br still mulholland drive is certainly recommended for the right crowd if you're serious about film and do not mind having to think about what you watch as if those two would not necessarily coincide you shouldn't miss this one
<START> radio flyer is one of my most loved american movies br br the really great job of two boys joe and elija wood in spite of terrible performance of t hanks at the beginning and ending with marvellous script of d m evans and powerful and emotional directing of r donner plus absolutely incredibly peerless music score of h zimmer allowed the radio flyer to win one of the first places in my family's rating of movies br br it's so pity that that very good movie was by some movie critics br br i just can't help waiting to see it on dvd
<START> i've seen just after i've seen all roger moore films and i must say that it felt so good to see connery again he proves for all times that he is the one and only bond br br the film itself isn't really a masterpiece but it is really worth watching the jokes sit much better here the effects are funny and interesting connery is connery and brandauer is really a good villain but von sydow is just wasted and the score is not often good and there are a few scenes that seem pretty unnecessary br br 7 10 2 5 4 3 1 6
<START> when a friend and i saw this in the recent releases we decided to get it despite the fact that neither of us had heard of it before we both like costas mandylor and it had james coburn so we figured it couldn't be that bad we were wrong it was it was really that bad no actor or actress could have made this film worth seeing it was like taking titanic the poseidon adventure and some nuclear bomb film and trying to cut and paste it all together br br i must admit that there were a couple of chuckles i did laugh when the head cabin boy is asking alan costas mandylor if he's some pussy marine the other laughs this film got though had nothing to do with the writing i would dearly love to know how the people making this movie thought that you could have a cruise liner knocked upside down and have it remain steady it isn't tipped or anything br br if you are looking for something to watch for costas mandylor james coburn or any of the rest of this cast move on find something good that they did
<START> i found this movie to be preachy and unrealistic it tries to be a movie showing kids fighting against the system but it doesn't even present a positive solution i guess i didn't feel really for the kids i totally can understand what their gripes were and i know how poor the state of schools are but i found their solution and the way the outside dealt with it to be a big bunch of if this comes on tv don't waste your time watch short circuit again for the time
<START> william h macy always gives a good performance he never looks lazy and never seems like he'd rather be somewhere else in short he's what more actors should be like a slight case of murder is directed by steven who went on to do two more great films with macy door to door the wool cap br br television movies have long been a dump of overdone acting poor cinematography and sub par scripting that's why it's so refreshing to see a tv movie that does exactly what it's sort of film was created for to tell a small story not a simplistic story that does not require viewing on the big screen br br a slight case of murder is light entertaining fare and an great watch br br 7 6 out of 10
