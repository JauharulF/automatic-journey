<START> i like hack think the lone ranger reincarnated as a 2000s cab driver a decent but flawed guy in philadelphia doing his best while seeking to work out issues from a troubled past and you've got the synopsis david morse is nearly perfect as he helps people but instead of riding silver in the old west he drives a cab through the mean streets of contemporary philly without handing out silver bullets the supporting cast is first class and well above average at times the witty dialog almost reaches the level of that 70s classic series the rockford files this show deserves a return hopefully in a better time slot than 9pm friday eastern
<START> it was awful plain and simple what was their message where was the movie going with this it has all the ingredients of a sub b grade movie from plotless storyline the bad acting to the cheesey slow mo cinematography i'd sooner watch a movie i've already seen like goodfellas a bronx tale even grease there are no likeable characters in the end you just want everyone to die already save 2 hours of your life and skip this one
<START> nemesis game is a mind bending film filled with riddles death mystery and philosophy in it's simplest sense the film is about seeking answers and what happens when you've finally found them all the search for answers leads sarah novak down a path that gets darker as it gets more compelling the final answer seems more dangerous than it is worth yet sarah is so close to understanding it all what would you do if you were offered the ability to finally make sense of the chaos of life br br the movie was written and directed by jesse warn while this was first feature length film the movie doesn't reflect that at all but instead shows polish and an artistic approach to telling the story carly pope was powerful in the lead role and showed a depth of complexity that was fascinating to watch i would definitely love to see more of her work br br being based on riddles this is a very cerebral movie it's that's your thing as it is mine then i totally recommend seeing nemesis game rating 4 5 5
<START> i thought the movie was good but i like to read the real story behind the based on a true story movies does anyone know the names and locations of the real characters the movie is based on i have done a complete internet search and cannot find any information on this case all i get is the movie information and the fact that it is based on a true story i find it hard to believe that a judge would change his sentence rendered immediately in the courtroom even after such a heartfelt speech by the brother gorgeous john corbett but overall the story was very gripping anyway if anyone knows the real real story i would appreciate you sharing it
<START> went with some friends and one of my friends mom thinking it would be a good way to start off the spring break but the movie turned out awful we all agree it shouldn't have been pg 13 more like r material lots of sexual dialog cussing and referring to boy and girl parts below the waist not worth the time or money strongly urge you not to go or rent it when it comes out if you do end up going don't take smaller children not the type of movie to see with the family if curious about the content check out the content advisory section on the superhero movie page on imdb most of the content that was meant to be funny was extremely crude especially when they make fun of steven hawking
<START> as far as christian film goes it's typical lacking of a mega budget they try their best some times falling short sometimes hitting the mark this one almost hit great acting can only carry a movie so far a combining of h p lovecraft and frank peretti was a good idea all's it needed was better back story and better character development to make it great movie the visuals are not that bad also smart holding off the demons till the last few minutes helped keep the suspense at a good pace could of used a better ending though not a bad premise having terrorists experiments go wrong much better than typical hollywood treatment about the demonic realm maybe someone will finally do this present darkness as a movie
<START> forgettable pilot that never really explains why nostradamus is really important to the plot of this movie but rob estes plays a a hunky cop who happens to be nostradamus for some reason and who battles time travelling medieval monks that run around with guns and set people on fire to start the apocalypse oh yeah there's also a sexy fbi agent who happens to be a and is trying to get rob to believe everything before it's too late too bad they couldn't predict a better plot yawn br br
<START> my young auntie is unique in a lot of ways first this is hui ya hung's kara hui first action film second she was actually doing the fight scenes after having a surgery done to her a few days before filming third this movie is off the chain br br the movie starts out with wang lung wei trying to take the inheritance from his brother his brother then has kara to marry him so wang can't take the treasure the story is pretty good leading everything to it's rightful place br br in comes the action what can i say that hasn't already been said for movies like this or disciples of the 36th chambers the victim or even the magnificent butcher the fight scenes are what sales movie and this one won't have any problem doing so liu chia liang and wang lung wei engaged in a fight that you have to see to believe why have these two men not fought each other more is beyond me br br i don't want to spoil anything really but you have to see my young auntie to get the full blast of excitement my only gripe is that yuen tak was not used as broad as he was used in 3 evil masters or even invincible pole fighter 8 diagram pole fighter to excellent must see movies 9 2 10
<START> i am disgusted and appalled by the positive reviews this movie is receiving not only is it hokey manipulative and melodramatic it's also shamelessly offensive the character of radio gooding jr ' is paraded around as a cute little stuff animal like a puppy that's so cute you just want to take him home ' this mentality is shameless radio is never treated as a human being but as a manipulative device to draw sympathies from its audience even more atrocious are the film's numerous moments in which radio gets hit in the head trips falls over etc these moments of slapstick comedy had the audience howling with laughter merely purely because it's funny because radio is this is shameless now i do not feel that the word is an appropriate word at all to describe the mentally disabled but this seems to be the stance the film is taking radio is retarded but that's okay because he's cute and we like him ' gooding's portrayal seems better suited for a john water's film than an inspiring family drama to add insult to injury the film is incompetent on every level debra winger is uninspired in the role as the stereotypical housewives' that the very reminder of her heinous monologues insights laughter in all who see the film the score by john horner is pure sap always its tear some score over the tired cinematography ed harris is decent in a role he could have slept through but manages to retain much of the audience's attention throughout the film in conclusion if you consider yourself a decent human being ignore this travesty of a film read the book but otherwise skip this dire film on an interesting character from american history
<START> this film predates the australian films road warrior and priscilla of the desert and its influence on them is obvious in the dialogue locations photography direction and political philosophy the photography is notably confident the direction is stylish and for the most part well done if you liked the early australian films by bruce beresford peter weir and george miller then you'll love oz the direction also reminds this reviewer of edgar wright's contemporary work that similarity suggests that oz was far ahead of its time the critics of 1967 hated it and the public stayed away 1960s australia like 1940s usa was in some ways the sort of place where conformity was important whereas this film is very different to what those viewers would have expected especially after reading the promotional posters this film will most likely have more appeal to contemporary audiences it's still quirkily awkward and self conscious but in a contemporary european way rather than a 1960s australian way joy dunstan who later appeared in the australian tv series plays her role with less raw passion than her contemporary weaver might have done instead character in this film conveys some of the rather whimsical strength of australian women most famously represented by kylie minogue playing charlene mitchell in the australian tv series neighbours and further developed in later roles in her career men will also enjoy this film which presents various masculine issues in a different way than most other mid sixties films from the usa or even australia in particular bruce spence who later went on to play in 'star wars iii' the in the 'matrix' films and the chopper pilot in the 'road and films plays a central and sustained role which solidly supports the rest of the cast this film is worth seeing for bruce performance alone 7 10 for some minor continuity problems
<START> as always joan is wonderful as jane m subtle sharp and aware i do not wish to dwell on her acting skills as they are praised enough on this site i would like to criticize some of the smaller parts as the rest of the cast seemed to be hand picked by director david tucker br br liz fraser's performance as mrs bent the mother of the missing girl nora is a joy to watch subtle and deeply moving as the alcohol depending grieving mother who loves and misses her daughter desperately a good long shot of her monologue thanks tucker so she can be enjoyed to the fullest i was moved when i saw her the first time when it was broadcast and i am moved again now i have it on dvd brava br br joanna hole as madge the tour guide i find highly amusing she is on the edge of over acting but her role can have it she is so funny as the over organized guide who wants to do good with everyone on that bus i find her hilarious her reaction after she boarded every one on the bus is great as always to perform comedy one has to take it very seriously and that's what ms hole does br br i do hope those two ladies have good careers as i live in holland i do not know if they have not all theater productions can be googled their performances on the screen deserve it br br
<START> i had the pleasure of seeing this short film at the miami film festival this past saturday and let me just say i was astounded it was the only film out of the whole program that i loved it is beautifully shot composed edited acted and written after the screening i saw the director at a party and asked him what he was doing next he said that he was working on finding financing for the feature version of the short he described some scenes to me it sounded like the kind of first film that launches the greats into the industry if you ever get a chance to see this short i highly recommend taking it hats off to star crossed
<START> this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen thank god i saw it for free i would have hated to waste my money on it br br first off there isn't a character in the movie that is in any way likable michael caine comes close but even he is pretty flawed the rest of the commandos are made up of disgusting ex cons there are the two gay arabs and three guys who try to rape a red cross nurse and the leader who has no trouble sending his men off to get killed so he can escape br br the mission is anything from suspenseful they are to blow up a fuel dump sounds exciting right well the footage follows them through endless and fixing flat tires yes you read that right the suspense is whether they will run out of spare tires we actually watch them change something like 12 flats on the way that's how incredibly exciting this movie is br br they get to the fuel dump to find that it is a decoy so nothing to blow up and at this time for some very convoluted reason the british army decides that they don't need these guys anymore and radios their whereabouts to the germans to kill them br br so now at least we'll have an exciting race to freedom nope instead they decide to blow up a different fuel dump to create a diversion but when they get into the place they set off a trip wire and the germans come to get them calling out their names over a loudspeaker br br really weird if the germans knew where they were and where they were going why did they let them get all the way into the dump before springing the trap instead they wait until they get into the fuel depot and set all of their charges yeah right that would happen br br so they blow the dump the leader sells out all of his men except for michael caine since he's been offered 2000 to bring him back alive br br ok so the men are all betrayed and killed and michael caine and nigel davenport survive the british troops come in with tanks and they decide to go get rescued since they are wearing german uniforms they wore them to blow up the dump they tie a white flag around a stick and walk out into the road br br some british guy walks up them and machine guns them to death credits roll br br yep the two heroes of the movie die due to a random act of violence br br it's almost like the movie suddenly ran out of budget and decided that's a wrap kill them off and we'll go home i wasted 2 hours of my life watching this tired unimaginative and totally unrealistic movie that ended with a of a bomb
<START> and so it started with a send up of horror films then we had scary movie a genuinely good attempt at a new kind of genre the illustrious send up however now we have scary movie scary movie 2 scary movie 3 scary movie 4 date movie meet the spartans not another team movie plus many more genuinely funny movies marked with br br and super hero movie it seems the people that make these movies cannot yet grasp what makes the send ups funny using the rip offs from other movies in a funny way is all well and good if done properly but not many producers seem to know how to do that scary movie 1 did it well the following sequels were then horrendous as the tried to over play the franchise but it was redeemed by scary movie 4 not another teen movie was good because it used the spoofs well and to its credit i am sick of teen movies however this movie plays like a bad version of all of these it relies on slap stick the would make even the 3 stooges cringe violating the image of stephen hawking and then when people begin to get bored and the producers knew when this would be we are treated to pamela anderson in a skin tight suit to conclude spoofs should be about making a homage like mock up of an original movie with an original storyline not random take offs of legitimate film onto the storyline of a real film br br i shudder at the thought of sci fi movie and get my seppuku knife ready
