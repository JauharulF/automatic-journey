<START> amazing astounding brilliant superb those are the four adjectives that prop up in my head when i start describing the kite runner book adaptation had already captured many minds in fact it is rumored that he himself broke down in to tears after watching the premier i must say before i even start that i had read the book before i saw the advanced screening of the kite runner so my judgment and views may be slightly biased br br firstly let me say it that even though in my opinion the book was better than the final product of the movie it is by no means a bad adaptation i mean for a two hour movie it's got the deserved response things do appear a tad fast in the final twenty odd minutes but apart from that it has succeeded what the book did it has captured the minds and imagination of millions all across the globe the magic woven by to give us a sense of remorse of joy of sadness of pain of loyalty is astute in this adaptation especially in the very first scene when young hassan says if you tell me to eat dirt i will but i know you won't ask me to such a touching line is bound to capture the hearts of many the two young actors were brilliant absolutely superb especially the boy who played the innocent but loyal hassan a boy who refuses to give up a kite he caught because he promised his best friend that he would bring it to him only to be abused by large bullies who beat him up and use him sexually and then to be rebuked by his best friend as a coward the entire act is so touching that it cannot but wet your eyes br br the entire movie is well placed save the last bit the point when amir learns of his true relationship with hassan and reads hassan's first and last not to him when he breaks down in tears feeling helpless lonely and remorseful that appeared a bit rushed and felt that amir was behind a facade in the book had dedicated some 10 12 pages to describe state of mind in that position but that his made up for in the penultimate segment of the movie when amir stands up for hassan's boy his nephew in front of his commanding father in law the ending was well deserved and i am sure will be well appreciated it felt witnessing the torch pass down from one generation to another br br coming over to the technical aspects first of all the acting just one word superb from start to finish young hassan and amir their father his friend khan everyone has been superb especially young hassan second the direction was amazing coupled with some brilliant camera work the background score was also impressive right from the start credit track to the end credit and i especially loved the one when amir is in the mosque in pakistan the western and islamic fusion made that extra special br br all in all this is definitely one of the better movies and it's a welcome break from all those iran inspired movies that we have floating all over this year 9 10
<START> this ladies and gentlemen is truly a modern b movie the dialog is stilted and delivered with wooden rigidity the premise is predictable there are a few decent twists and characters remain 2d for most of it and yet there is a certain charm wwe wrestler kane brings to life the sick twisted monster of a man with a lot of pathos though it is somewhat like his character that he's been playing around ten years and so i'll find it quite amusing when people say it's not much of a reach for him but glen jacobs is apparently quite the nice guy so actually it is in any event he's cast perfectly as the hulking brute and the deaths are suitably over the top jason would be proud but i heard at least four applause breaks for four different kills scenes frankly go into this movie thinking that you'll have some fun and a gorefest oh it is quite the gorefest the r rating is richly deserved and i actually got a little nauseous during some of the more graphic times in any event a very very fun but fairly bad movie
<START> woeful and unnecessary sequel to a bonafide classic an american werewolf in london was indisputably a gem of a movie humorous demented with just a dash of romance and so very very british it made me want to stand up and sing god save the queen every time the movie ended then came this abomination you know you are in real trouble when the leads are so utterly unlikeable you are glad when they are slaughtered and actually start cheering for the tell you the truth folks i only got about half way through this cgied travesty before losing the will to live and turning it off absolutely pitiful and a putrid waste of anyone's time
<START> four lovely young nurses in their last year of nursing school experience all kinds of turmoil and excitement in their lives sweet susan winsome brunette elaine tries to comfort the bitter terminally ill greg a moving performance by darrell larson eager but neurotic lovely blonde karen carlson romances handsome jim caspar affable lawrence casey free spirited hippie priscilla the stunningly gorgeous barbara leigh gets impregnated by laid back drug dealer les the solid richard rust and compassionate lynn nicely played by farrell helps out angry mexican revolutionary victor charlie the excellent reni santoni despite the fact that this film was made for roger corman's legendary exploitation outfit new world pictures it's anything but your standard mindless piece of leering soft core schlock instead it's a very pleasant charming and even often thoughtful time capsule of the social and political upheavals of the groovy early 70's the subplot involving lynn and the revolutionaries is especially potent and provocative special kudos are in order for director stephanie who brings a welcome and refreshing intelligence and sensitivity to the material moreover the four attractive and appealing female leads all turn in sound and praiseworthy work scottie macgregor likewise impresses as wise supervisor ms boswell and ubiquitous 70's trailer voice guy ronald gans supplies the off screen voice of a psychiatrist larner's polished cinematography the fantastic rock soundtrack and the flavorsome score by clancy b grass iii are all up to speed a real sleeper
<START> a show about an incredibly dumb man child and his shrewish hot wife 99 of the plots revolves around doug doing something unbelievably stupid and then comes a variable a either he hides it from his wife or b tell his wife she him and then it's up to the father in law arthur the typecast character from seinfeld to aggravate the situation br br and the writers dare to say it was influenced by the honeymooners an absolute classic and that the plots are drawn from real life situations unless you live in a cave you know that's not true br br anyway let's just put it this way if kevin james had been thin the show would have got canceled the pilot if you're 12 or you're fond of fat jokes be my guest watch this show or any of kevin james movies for that matter br br i've noticed some posters compare this travesty to much superior shows like friends seinfeld and everybody loves raymond i'm still wondering how could anyone do that
<START> after viewing still life a short film directed by jon i was genuinely excited for his feature film debut jack brooks monster slayer still life had perfectly captured the essence and feel of an episode of the twilight zone and i was eager to see what could do when taking on the horror comedy genre the campy nature of the name and promotional materials suggested something along the lines of evil dead or army of darkness a fun gory 80's style horror flick with lots of monsters while that was what was going for he utterly fails at capturing any of the fun or entertainment value these movies had br br the problem with jack brooks monster slayer is that it completely lacks an understanding of what made these horror comedies that it tries to evoke so great in the first place two thirds of the running time is primarily devoted to the film's hero jack brooks a plumber and college student as he goes to class and attempts to deal with his uncontrollable bursts of anger there's nary a monster in sight for the greater part of the film barely even a drop of blood or the slightest attempt at anything horror related even if evil dead or dead alive had subsequent amounts of the gore cut out they'd still be entertaining jack brooks isn't it's plain boring which is the worst thing a film of this nature can be jack brooks himself is not all that interesting at least not enough to warrant the amount of screen time he's given all one needs to know about him is revealed in the films first ten minutes and from that point on whenever he's not beating the pulp out of a monster and he rarely does he's not worth watching the movie goes nowhere following him around on psychiatric sessions and scuffles with classmates br br eventually things do pick up jack brooks battles a few monsters some heads are crushed a few humans are slaughtered and then it's over just like that all within the span of about fifteen minutes it is a good fifteen minutes the monsters are all fairly inventive and done entirely in camera and there's some great gore gags the best being a zombies head crushed in but after sitting through seventy five minutes of pure tedium fifteen minutes just isn't going to cut it br br that's really all there is to it i could ramble on about the acting which is fairly well done especially horror icon robert englund in a non traditional role and how the creature prosthetics are a nice throwback to the days when films didn't use cgi but it really doesn't matter jack brooks monster slayer is utterly boring and while jon obviously does have the talent to create a good film once again the last fifteen minutes are killer and still life was amazing Â check it out jack brooks completely misses the mark it has its successes acting make up but those don't change the fact that it's not very entertaining at all the screening i caught this at had the director and cast in attendance one piece of information i picked up was that a sequel was in development and that this time it would focus more on fighting monsters as opposed to the creation of a hero my advice skip this one and wait for the sequel
<START> when i read the synopsis 3 people lost in the wild battling against a huge crocodile i wasn't exactly drawn in it sounded like the typical yawn movie horror formula of a bunch of people stalked by a monster except in this case there are only three of them so we wouldn't even get the macabre of watching them get picked off one by one br br however i watched it couldn't sleep nothing else to do and it turned out to be much better than expected the acting is great the atmosphere tense and you really get that rare sense of a low budget winner br br horror as it should be done first rate film making it's not perfect but it's well worth seeing i give it a 7
<START> sweeping and still impressive early talkie western of pioneering days other contemporary films in the same vein include the covered wagon 1923 the iron horse 1924 and cimarron 1931 Â none of which i've watched though i do have the latter on vhs it was simultaneously filmed in the standard fullscreen ratio and in an experimental widescreen process called grandeur but only the former has been released on the bare bones fox dvd one can only surmise how it would look in a wider ratio but the careful framing Â not to mention the splendid cinematography Â is evident enough even in the standard version br br young john wayne is surprisingly commanding in the lead a role which however didn't lead to the expected stardom Â as he'd languish in 'b' westerns for the best part of the next decade before john ford came to his rescue with stagecoach 1939 anyway he and marguerite churchill from dracula's daughter 1936 make a nice couple Â despite her somewhat tedious character supporting characters include a variety of stock types veteran westerner comic relief sidekick with a penchant for making noises with his mouth burly and uncouth villain played by tyrone power sr his two slimy cohorts a mexican and a southerner the latter also filling in as wayne's rival for churchill's hand etc also among the members of the wagon party is a timid swede full of optimism for the promised land but who's continually put down by his irascible mother in law and later wayne regular ward bond br br the episodic narrative resolves itself into a number of alternately cornball lyrical and action packed vignettes Â as we see the prospective settlers combating the elements the indians and themselves the film however has a completely authentic feel to it which smooths over its essentially dated and static quality also the editing is somewhat choppy particularly during the second half Â little wonder since the dvd edition of the film is only 108 minutes long against the complete 158 minute grandeur version
<START> this movie was terrible the acting was awful the script was awful what was even worse were the camera shots and sound half the time the voices did not match up with the actors lips and different camera angles in the same scene would be completely different hues the worst part had to be when one of the actors was at the top of a huge cross shaped building the building had to have been 50 stories high and probably 100 feet wide however when the actor was on top of it in another shot they had recreated the top of the building the building's width had been reduced to about eight feet wide how could a building hundreds of feet high be eight feet wide i know the film was low budget but it is inexcusable the movie itself just pushed ideas about a rapture then actually having a storyline or point this reduced the script to mere rubbish the characters seemed to be selling ideas in their lines rather than conveying emotions and moving the movie along in a direction it was a complete waste of time watching the movie gives christians a bad name if it is one of the current best christian films out there
<START> if i had never seen the first road house then i guess this movie might get one more star but even then that makes it a 3 star movie for that matter i was really surprised as to the relatively high rating it currently has br br in reality i was not able to finish this movie as it was painful where it went wrong at least the most obvious way is that it pretty much parallels the original exactly even though the original plot is still referenced this doesn't really make sense and doesn't work also the acting is weak i never felt like i was into the movie yet i felt like i was watching people act even good actors like busey don't work out probably due to the screenplay or maybe the awkward editing the strangest thing is that the movie feels like a mid 90's b movie yet is made in 06 i am not sure as to why but then again this often seems to happen with sequels for some reason the music the look and the whole overall feel reminds me of movies you saw 10 years ago on cinemax late at night the strangest thing of all is that i am also expecting ja rule to come in at some point often it reminds me of more current movies with rappers as actors br br the most irritating thing is love interest girl who's character seems like a total rip off of the lois lane character on smallville which is also quite annoying and lets not forget the fakest sounding southern accents i have heard since walk the line i realize this is common place in movies but no accent at all would work better than attempting to sound like you are from that universal hick place on tv where anyone from any southern state or ky and wv sound exactly the same sure people in desert towns in az sound just like people in southeastern states 2000 miles away that was wearing thin 10 years ago in the b movies where technique came from why do writers directors make such decisions br br bottom line i would truly not recommend this if you are a fan of road house or if you like good movies also if you have not seen it yet don't spoil it by seeing this version first the original road house was one of those accidental classics that people love and watch over and over it was an unexpected success like american graffiti dazed and confused and more recently office space fast and furious only the first one and napolean dynamite why did they spoil it br br they should have never made a sequel to road house other than a high budget version with the right actors director sure you can never top the original ex bad news bears the longest yard etc but at least if you can do it right it will be presentable as is the case with the examples i mentioned but to make a low budget off network self production of road house is criminal
<START> i had never seen the original death wish in the book either death wish i film however death wish 3 was the very interested film the well known vigilante paul tried to visit his friend charlie but he only visited him for a couple of minutes before he died because of charlie didn't pay the protection to the huge and infamous underground gang leaded by manny franker after some altercation during his time in jail learned that franker who he fought with in jail had his own agenda to make the new york city in the hellfire and also his influence by sending his henchmen to set the crime every time everywhere and everyday due to the chance given by insp richard who know his profile well and like him very much decided to set the war with franker and his gang br br i accepted that death wish iii was one of the most and extreme violence action film which i had seen from the past this movie used the very way to tell the story no ponderous story telling and less unnecessary scenes which was the one merit of the movie on the next issue violence was used pervasively in the film i believed that many of viewers could like the action scene of death wish iii because it showed the crude extreme and blast of action for every minutes of the movie especially the climax scene of the movie and the death of manny franker which i thought that it was the maximum action scene br br for about the cast i think everyone was good and get through their role charles bronson made everybody believe that he still be great as paul he didn't look like the big old cat but the great vigilante o'herlihy also did his job very good his main villain role in the movie made him look nasty and look like the big bad guy however the role of kathryn davis in this movie was pathetic she didn't look like the main character i thought that she was appeared only two or three scene before she was killed by franker and his follower to make a heat on paul she could have more role to appear br br for my comment the style and extreme violence made this movie great for extreme action film fans fast paced with back and forth style made this movie very interested to watch nevertheless this movie had some silly scene and some plot hole first the scene when insp faced paul for the first time it was very corny because you attacked your favor guy before you want him to help it similar to how you punch some guy before you try to borrow him some money haha that's like a joke although i liked the plot twist when insp was shown later that he helped because at first looked like the villain very much due to his act to but when the movie went to the climax everything was cleared that he had no hidden agenda with br br in another case the ending scene of the movie set back me it stumble on everyone's feeling because it ended too easy gang members looked unbelievable after they found that franker was dead before his girlfriend and other followers decided to escape finally insp allowed paul to fly out from his town before the police caught him i thought that this style of ending scene could be found in many cannon film's movie but i dislike it br br for the summary i am ok with death wish 3 due to my explanation i typed first the cast and the action was very good and so extreme even it had some scene i don't like and extreme of violence could be the best short description of this movie
<START> the whole shorthand for supposedly being more aware in this weird time is that you are blue the blue state mentality this is supposed to get us off the hook for what is was happening during the last few years in our country the usa it doesn't get anyone off the hook but it makes us feel better as though we aren't benefiting in any way from living here and getting all the good stuff that a us citizen gets just by being a us citizen br br but i'm so sick of bitching about this it doesn't do any good i haven't taken much action lately and i wonder how many people have maybe i'm just down because my job was outsourced last month and now i'm looking for work in the shrinking tech support field where most of the jobs are quickly going to india and other places overseas i'm thinking that soon it's not going to pay off to be a citizen here with the screwed up infrastructure and the shrinking job market and the obsession with war these days it seems like anyone who speaks out gets jumped and questioned about there patriotism anyway back to this review usa the movie is an obscure dvd that makes me realize that some people have taken action whether it's through politics protesting or arts or media the filmmaker is obviously passionate knowledgeable willing to go outside the norm frustrated unique astute etc br br i looked through the whole site that's linked to the dvd and got lost in all the articles essays etc that are there the dvd does that too has references to different times views and historical points sometimes someone does something out there
<START> i have to tell you i've been a fan of star trek tng since i was a kid br br well sometime ago i gave a friend of mine some ds9 episodes and i asked him br br hey man what are you watching lately because i'm done watching all tng episodes he said well i got these episodes of farscape i said ok let me try it i was pretty sure at that time that i wont like it because i was just watching tng and found it great br br i had 3 episodes viewed those but the show didn't impressed me very much i found it childish initially and i thought its just another tv show nice adventures but regular music was a little bit different neat special effects though and i had the vague impression that the actors didn't fully get into the characters skin br br i watched another 3 episodes thinking that 3 eps were not enough to decide i like or not since then the show started to get me i got a good grasp of the action and wanted to see what happened next to the poor crichton the rest is history br br i think i mostly like the freedom of the characters in the context of the action unlike star trek where everybody slept when they were supposed to do and way too much high tech bullshit br br the show got better with each episode very interesting story line what can i say this movie its like poetry br br i highly recommend it
<START> i remember seeing this a long while ago and i knew most of the concept but no detail so i'm glad i watched it again from director frank oz the muppets take manhattan bowfinger basically new star cameron drake matt dillon has just won the academy award for his latest where he plays a gay soldier and he does the usual thank yous he even mentions his past school english teacher howard brackett golden globe nominated kevin kline and he outs him as gay howard is determined to clear his name and get out of the media spotlight as a denying gay man especially as his marriage to emily montgomery oscar and golden globe nominated joan cusack is on the way so it comes to the wedding day and when it comes to howard saying yes or no that is when he outs himself and admits to himself and everyone that he is gay this of course gets him fired as a teacher but everyone stands at the graduation day to out themselves in support and cameron even shows up to clear things up so that everyone especially school head tom halliwell bob newhart knows it's okay to be gay also starring tom selleck as peter malloy debbie reynolds as brackett wilford brimley as frank brackett gregory as walter brackett glenn close whoopi goldberg and jay leno the highlight of the film has to be when kline can't help dancing to diana ross's version of i will survive that must have been what convinced him of his sexuality kline is always good cusack is a surprise oscar nominee and all supporting cast members do their bit too in this very funny comedy very good
<START> midnight clear has a great premise a group of over educated overly bright gi's are sent out by incompetent leaders on a vague mission to patrol around an isolated farm house on the eve of the battle of the bulge the gi's encounter a group of battle weary german regulars and it becomes clear that they don't want to fight anymore br br therein lies the problem it's really pretty simple if the germans want to surrender they do so and that's the end of the movie if the germans want to fight they do so and that's also the end of the movie so instead of doing either the gi's and germans play games with each other even throwing snowballs at one point interesting for one or two scenes but it soon becomes very annoying after all these are germans the enemy nothing in this film makes me think they should not be either taken prisoner or shot the film does noting to make them more human in fact much of what the german characters did made me want to shoot them including one scene where the german officer refuses to deal with a jew or to surrender to a mere enlisted man why should i care about such characters just shoot them and let's move on to the battle of the bulge it's much more interesting anyway br br one good scene the gi's are returning from a recon of the german position where they had the germans in their sights but did not fire while walking across a clearing they realize a group of germans have their leveled at them the germans are about 100 yards away the gis then do something i've never seen any gi's do in any movie they throw down their rifles and throw up their hands unusual as this may be in films it is an entirely sensible reaction to having a rifle aimed at you from that distance though it seems far in reality it's point blank range for those rifles i'll lay odds that someone working on this film was a
