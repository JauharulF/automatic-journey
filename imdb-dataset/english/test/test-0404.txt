<START> spoilers ahead br br 2001 a space odyssey is without a doubt the most challenging and successful film by the late stanley kubrick this is not a film that you watch in order to be entertained or amused instead it provides you with a banquet of food for thought images that linger in the mind's eye long after the movie itself is over it is a film that you could meditate on br br the film intentionally offers us more questions then it can answer it is made to puzzle and but leaves the viewer nevertheless with a sense of awe and reverence that is allowing that he has engaged himself in the process of viewing it enjoyment of this film requires some effort on the viewers part the questions that it does pose are large and ominous concerning the genesis and destiny of the human race it's ultimate place in the cosmic design and the existence or lack of some creative intelligence behind the structure of the universe itself br br the first of the films four gives us a distinct view of the species past we see our distant ancestors half ape half human in a state of near starvation the climate has destroyed most of the plant life and the vegetarian beasts are near starvation an extra object a perfectly smooth and angular black monolith appears and the animals are simultaneously inspired by it's presence to tool making and violence they are transformed overnight into and when two tribes encounter each other near a water source the tribe that has developed tool making capacity as well as soundly destroys the neighboring tribe the new chief of the winning tribe empowered by the first vestiges of technology triumphantly throws the bone that he used as a weapon in the air we see the bone transformed into a floating satellite which contains nuclear weapons we soon learn that the world is torn apart by nuclear paranoia the characteristics inspired by the appearance that once helped us to survive now threaten our very existence br br once again humanity is in crisis once again the unearthly presence represented by the black monolith will step in to aid humanity in the next step in it's development on an exploration of the moon a monolith identical to the earlier one we have seen is discovered the governments of the world normally mortal enemies have come together in secret to discuss the implications a mission is arranged the monument has been engaged in some kind of radio communication with jupiter a few men will travel to the destination of the transmission most of them will for most of the time be kept in a state of suspended animation the pilot of the spacecraft will be hal a super computer who has been programmed to imitate all of the traits of human beings br br the film has many outstanding sequences as usual for kubrick the use of classical music is outstanding most memorable are blue danube and also spake particularly appropriate given the film's theme of transcending ordinary consciousness the cinematography is particularly excellent as well after a single viewing the film's final 30 minutes will haunt you for the rest of your life br br the character of hal is the most important from the view of the film's central thesis in imitating all the characteristics of human beings he comes to have their negative traits as well the paranoia he develops which almost leads to the s ruin is an exact mirror of the paranoia that has allowed the political situation back on earth to reach a point of desperate crisis the film suggests that these are the traits that we must leave behind if we are to proceed to the next phase in our evolution br br the architecture of the film is also meaningful the designs of many of the spacecraft are intended to suggest reproductive organs and the process of birth and rebirth the central motif of the movie the ending of 2001 is the most spectacular and triumphant ever filmed br br this movie takes a view of life similar to that presented in the poetry of william butler yeats and james joyce's novel wake it posits a pattern to history and human evolution that is yet progressive repeating the same events at large intervals yet with the human race as developing according to the will of a being with a larger purpose in mind though we never learn what this purpose is the film assures us that the human race is not meant for failure it's destiny is grand beyond it's capacity to imagine it continues to amaze me that in spite of this film many people continue to regard kubrick as a misanthrope br br this is a religious film not in the conventional sense of adhering to any specific creed but because of it's of wonder at the vast panorama of existence and it's involvement with the deepest and most vital questions of purpose and truth br br in the hands of any other director this would all be perhaps a little too much hollywood's view of life is too puny usually to encompass the grandeur and intensity of a vision such as this one but kubrick was a visionary he directs with utter confidence not only that he can handle material of this kind but that he is the only one to do it the process of making this film used all of his creative resources the writing partnership with arthur c clarke is the most fruitful in cinematic history kubrick had to invent some of the special effects that were used in the movie's astounding climax the resources to bring his vision to life did not exist at the time so he brought them into existence br br 2001 is a absolutely unique movie experience those who miss out on it do so at the detriment of their own intellectual and imaginative capacities
<START> who wrote the script for this movie the staff at disney studios this is the most adaptation of any story ever i wanted to laugh at a few scenes and cry at others and that was only because of how pitiful it was i'll have to hand it credit it did have a few funny scenes but i could've spent better time with my evening very seldom do i turn off a movie after only a quarter of the way through
<START> why did they have to make such a dreadful adaptation the whole complete jane austin series as a part of masterpiece classics looks like a huge disappointment characters are totally miscast and there's no chemistry on the screen the whole thing feels rather rushed the 1999 movie release based on the same novel seems like a masterpiece compared to this i really want to forget it i'm really happy though that pride and prejudice won't be re made as part of this project and we will see the iconic and magnificent colin firth and jennifer elle as protagonists if you skipped this mansfield park production consider yourself lucky
<START> i was a junior in high school when flesh hit the big screens but had the good fortune to see it at midnight movie houses in nyc just two years later br br flesh is the first part of a so called trilogy of films featuring joe as an object of desire it bears the warhol name but is more the work of paul morissey essentially the story concerns itself with the exploits surrounding one day in the life of a street wise male hustler played by joe joe is young beautiful and a bit naive but he manages to bring home the bacon to his wife for reasons which should not be explained to appreciate the film fully br br of special note to film buffs is that this film along with the remaining two of the trilogy had no script per se warhol's superstars were given simply a premise and the words and actions which the viewer sees are quite natural even at times ridiculous or non sensical but all in all it works rolling stone noted in its review that the film was better than midnight cowboy a film of the same year more polished by hollywood an academy award winner for best film with big name talent i equally admire the film but flesh being improvised was somehow more gut wrenching and realistic without the need for complex sub plots and any cause de celebre or for that matter any cause at all br br the film grossed more than 3 million dollars and was an absolute sensation particularly in the german market which ironically thought they were given a censored version of the film because of the post editing see note below br br curiously the film is very much cut and paste with pops clicks flashes and dialogue literally cut off mid sentence it is almost as if warhol morissey are stating a simple truth that it is a day in the life of a superstar snippets for your voyeuristic tendencies far better than earlier warhol works of 8 hours of sleeping and the statue of liberty as a 20 hour movie br br flesh in my opinion is the first of the warhol films that actually is digestible given a wide pallette and warhol's the factory's first legitimate response to the hollywood phenomenon of stardom br br as the first of a trilogy it portrays a young desirable male icon naive sought after responding to invitations to please his family subsequent films would show the same character with a differing set of values see trash and heat
<START> look this is a low budget horror film that suffers from all of the problems that go with low budget movies but you must see this just to watch lisa erickson as julie she is smokin' hot and a great little actress to boot these types of horror movies often unearth a rare gem and the power gave us lisa erickson nothing i enjoy more than sitting down in my studio apartment with a coke and putting in this film my friends bob bill and dennis agree lisa is not only brilliant she is a hottie the movie itself often plods along and the rest of the actors are not very helpful in that regard but as soon as lisa hits the screen things really start hopping the others are clearly not in her league this is not the exorcist but as i said if you want to see a fun little movie with a hot little actress this is the one to see
<START> a female ex cop who was drummed out of the force for recklessness and who could probably beat chuck norris in a fight hires herself out as a private bodyguard her first client is a worthless playboy type it takes half the movie for her to get kicked off the force in the first place lots of great fight choreography but the plot is strictly by the numbers and the acting is as wooden as the dialogue give this one a miss
<START> after watching oldboy i was a little disappointed by the rest of park's work some of it is good but it never approaches the level of humour and originality that oldboy had this one does it is nothing like oldboy in plot or style but the same level of quality is there br br the acting is good with kang ho song ok bin kim and ha kyun shin delivering excellent performances kim in particular manages to swap from the creepy horror scenes to the surreal comedy without the slightest misstep br br the plot is strange with lots of twists and turns and takes a big swipe at the vampire clichÃ©s br br the directing is spot on with tons of pace and humour throughout and some of the most memorable scenes i have ever seen it does boast what is probably the weirdest love scene you will ever see br br this is just a great film
<START> the movie is more of a mockumentary of corruption in the whole american system the of those who vote who do not matter is so proved in the machines that end of voting a comedian to the oval office politicians are such a joke that we almost need a comic to represent us as we have been laughed at for years around the world have become a way of life for americans and will be the only thing left after he leaves office none to soon oddly the only person of honesty is someone not even elected to the position and tells the truth in the end the story is very subtle and if you go to it for laughs it ain't happening leaves a lot for thought overall i enjoyed it
<START> i have to admit i picked this movie just for the cast and while sutherland scacchi and prochnow were as usual great performers the rest of the movie was such a let down it feels like it was put together by a team of adolescents with low level scripts that is scripts lacking any depth awful photography and editing and hilariously lousy score i can't believe i was able to watch this seemingly long movie until the end the sad thing is this could have actually been a great political thriller given the interesting plot all the potential was there to make it a hit that is two main ingredients are there a great story of national conspiracies and a great core cast even though many other actors are pretty much soap opera quality but maybe i'm missing something until then it's still not worth more than a 3 in my opinion
<START> a young girl becomes a war time marine's pen pal and when he visits at war's end expecting someone a bit more available comic complications ensue all ultimately works out well naturally but not before everyone involved has thoroughly chewed the scenery errol flynn's dead on impression of humphrey bogart from casablanca is a highlight as are various send ups of his own swashbuckling image the jumping scene in the kitchen with forrest tucker is a riot it is tucker though who the movie under his arm lowers his head and barrels over the goal line he demonstrates the comic flair more fully developed twenty years later in f troop and imparts a liveliness and energy that flynn repeatedly plays off to raise his own performance eleanor parker does a fine job as the woman being pursued and little patti brady charms as tucker's actual pen pal friend a fine lightweight coming home comedy in a genteel setting that children and romantics of all ages should find entertaining
<START> sorry after watching the credits i thought this would at least be a decent homage to retiring sf actors br br boy was i wrong br br the direction and story telling in this pos are terrible i have never been so insulted by a production br br i have great respect and love for many of the actors in this film but have to say they were conned br br if you haven't seen this debacle yet do yourself a favor and stay away these are not only two hours you won't get back but they will also ruin your respect for some actors you may once have enjoyed
<START> if you watch the documentary extra you'll note that the director is totally inexperienced and was actually a co worker bud of quentin in a video store put two and two together and you realise quentin is doing a favour for his old bud despite the bud being rather talentless was that harsh well see this film and you'll realise it isn't too slow in the beginning too nonsensical in the middle and too slow to end that about sums it up eric stolz delpy were the only two showing some charisma and actually put in an ok performance but the rest was real bad one instance of plot stupidity was when lead robber accidentally leaves his mask off during the raid so what happens well the other robbers decide they may as well remove theirs too what great thinking the violence was relentless and insane but not in a cool way rather in a farcical way i wondered if this was meant to be a comedy more fool tarantino for having his good name connected to this garbage more fool me for watching it
<START> i went to this film full of hope with so many capable and humorous actors headed up by sir ben i thought this is going to be a little treat br br oh how i felt like gouging my eyes out as the credits rolled that i had wasted of my life this film that was clearly doa there are some real problems with this film and it will probably be easier to list them 1 no jokes i am not particularly hard to please comedically high or low brow but there really is not one laugh in this film br br 2 sir ben mumbles through every single line whether he is supposed to be drunk or not 3 there is no effort to to begin let alone develop the relationship between the love interests in this 2 people bumping into each other randomly in the street would instantly have more rapport br br 4 all the acting talent that is assembled is completely wasted don't be fooled into watching this because of the names br br 5 for a cold ass hit man he rubbed out more people in gandhi than this flaccid waste of time a by the way dyed beards look really creepy i was hoping that this was a slow burner but in the end the only thing that could inject any life and justice into this is frank pulling out his 9 and offing the whole cast starting with tea and ending with himself sorry it was that bad
<START> now this is a bad movie if i've ever seen one in one of film's greatest years 1999 detroit rock city contends with runaway bride and wild wild west for the bottom spot in a barrel of junkies the plot is masterful four scrawny high school youngsters finally have their chance at seeing the hard rock theatrics of kiss third year in a row so when their tickets are by an ultra religious chain smoking mom the pals scramble themselves in getting to detroit and i'm sure you can figure out the rest br br well not exactly the movie does go to extreme measures in explaining how the four band members no not gene paul ace and peter go about getting these tickets losing your virginity in a confessional saving a smoked out bimbo and your mom's volvo from the soprano's steve schirripa nonetheless preventing a robbery in the midst of botching one for a 12 year old's debt and of course stripping down to your bare essentials for mc ron jeremy after shuttling a full blender with bourbon leftovers sounds funny doesn't it perhaps detroit rock city does have a point with all this tomfoolery in how extreme sometimes these fans can go and we do understand this movie is a comedy it is supposed to be filled with slapstick but does detroit rock city aim to the proper audience it is rated r meaning the only way prepubescent adolescents the audience as i see it to which many will eventually hail this one a classic will voyeur is through illegal terms br br detroit rock city also fails at giving itself the late 1970's touch the camera's texture quality is way too clear and way too bright missing the necessary flair from films like this is spinal tap and sid nancy this would've allowed audiences to feel more at home' with the times simply costuming kids into pre 90's grunge wear and settling others into disco does not do the trick environment does mean something you know i doubt detroit looked this glamorous in '78 if there's anything positive coming from this movie it's the kick ass soundtrack of hard late 70 to early 80's rock van halen ac dc you name it it's all here of course we can't forget kiss the band aptly subjected throughout br br what the film noticeably fails to manage are questions concerning why the knights of service it's really just kiss were so frowned upon by moms around the nation sure the loud rock and devilish makeup might be a part of that for youth to explore themselves and have a good time might be fair reasons as well but what is kiss saying in the music we hear throughout the film towards this highly rebellious group what separates these anthems of rock ing and roll ing all night and partying from the rest of the music most likely these questions will remain in a music communication class and not in the films that should answer them simply because it is kiss and they rock and we must do everything in our god forgiven power to see them br br 1 5 5 stars
<START> most predicable movie i've ever seen extremely boring i feel like i've seen a hundred movies with the same storyline as this one acting is ok at best there's no action really and there is definitely no thrills capable actors with terrible script i think it could have been written better by a 10th grader felt like more of a chore to watch because i was hoping that there would be something in this movie that was going to set it apart from all the other garbage but this fit right in on the heap the whole movie i was waiting for something good to happen but it never came i never rate movies and i never review movies but this movie was so bad that i had to log in here and post a review to try and save a few poor souls from wasting their time and or money with this movie i pirated it and wish i never even wasted the hard drive space if i spent 10 bucks to see this in theaters i would kill myself
