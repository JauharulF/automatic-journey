<START> i just saw the movie through netflix i was intrigued by the way the movie was described but in the end it was better i was moved in many different directions while watching this movie i was filled with hurt hate angry bitterness pain and finally relief to look at the young man accused would break your heart and convince you that they had the wrong person the smugness of the police makes you because just as the rodney king beating brought to light the brutality of the police this movie brings forth the total lack of moral fiber in these police and the fact that they beat this boy and got away with it only infuriates you more br br but i have to tell you i fell in love with the attorney mc guinness one of my favorite lines when he was telling us what an a hole on of the cops was the cop told him to go on keep sucking on that cancer stick mc guinness told the cop 'i always have a cigarette before sex ' i was letting him know i was going to screw him br br i have a new respect for some of the law in this country
<START> hardware wars is a hilarious 12 minute short film parody of the original star wars movie which was released just a few months after star wars in 1977 this film uses household appliances as space ships and star wars look a like actors to send you rolling around on the floor in uncontrollable fits of laughter this film has won many awards at film festivals and was the film which inspired mel brooks to write his star wars parody movie called spaceballs br br this is my favorite parody film and i recommend it to anyone who is familiar with star wars and has a good sense of humor br br
<START> gene roddenberry never let his fans down his death ended sci fi legacy that will never be matched earth the final conflict was proof his pilot film and the first 2 seasons were well written and meticulously produced but somewhere along the way the roddenberry touch was lost the loss of lead kevin kilner william boone definitely hurt the series as he was a vital part of what made it work the story involves the human race being visited by the an extra terrestrial race who dub themselves 'the after 3 years they have given earth new technologies helpful information about the universe and more many question their intentions here on earth the main liaison on earth between the races is leni parker and he is to many the most trustworthy questions arise just why are they here what are their goals is aware of any suspected plots against the humans there is an underground group led by millionaire industrialist jonathan doors david who utilizes his millions to investigate the by the end of the first season things are going well seems trustworthy boone assists doors in his investigation while working with and the as a liaison in the middle of the 2nd season things start unraveling and the once terrific and fascinating series spirals downward mostly because roddenberry had died and was not around to guide the producers of whom his wife majel barrett roddenberry was co producer still the first season remains intriguing and fun to watch
<START> a group of with a sad history take an author on a adventure through an uncharted cave in kazakhstan in these times of remakes and sequels and film companies trying to cash in on any winning combination of cinematic components the cavern has only one relatively different twist on the previous eight cave movies over the last few years and that twist seems to be taken from an x file i like to give every film the benefit of the doubt but there were just too many little annoyances for me here the camera work can give you a headache as they seem to constantly confuse which way is up not being a it doesn't really matter to me whether the filming was realistic there is entirely too much unnecessary from supposedly experienced by the last half you're saying out loud one of two things Â oh just shut up and concentrate on saving yourselves or i hope you all die by the end it must have been very tiring for these decent actors to make this film a moderate amount of gore and nothing special in the dialog or characters while you're pretty confident you know what's going on by the end the last five minutes explain all the details but i would have had a better opinion of the movie if they would have left the last minute on the cutting room floor it just wasn't necessary i suggest you hit eject immediately after your suspicions are confirmed and save yourself the setup for the sequel i've long thought that the film industry should share a modified restaurant industry's checkout scheme you pay for the materials to make the film before you go in but any profits for the film come from the tips you give when you leave the cinema i can't blame what i don't like about this film on its low budget
<START> i wanted to dog this movie but somehow i can't find it in myself to do that br br exhibiting a duality of fighting styles it's li vs li in a somewhat decent battle for supremacy br br this is one of those movies where the story carries the performances li's acting is extremely amateurish hesitant and stiff for most of this movie right up to the very end at first i tricked myself into believing he was just doing that for one of his two characters you know to show a difference in personalities but it appeared to be inexperience or a lack of talent it did get a bit better more relaxed toward the end but that wasn't enough to save his performance jet li's acting does improve as his career moves forward i don't hate his acting i just hated him in this br br i also have to say that the effects were very b class effects what effects there are br br the story itself had great potential it was uniquely creative daring and fresh unfortunately either the budget was not ample enough to accommodate better lighting effects film quality and some acting lessons or the director just did not care enough to bother with these little details he also did not bother with the science in the science fiction a fact which was a great detractor to this film br br the fight sequences were a bit one sided as he seemed to give more to one character and little to the other but all in all the story line made for a very enjoyable attempt br br as enjoyable as this was i couldn't help but think all the way through that this was just one of those movies that you can't help but watch it for what it should've been rather than what it is br br it rates a 6 0 10 on the b scale br br that's a 4 2 10 on the a scale for having a good plot from br br the fiend
<START> supreme sanction is a movie about a female assassin who works for the u s government she has to kill a known tv reporter but spares his life when she sees that he has a little daughter because she hasn't killed him she becomes the next target of her employers br br the script isn't good although i've seen worse b movies a hit man with remorse the government killing innocent people in the name of fighting terror what's next aliens rescuing the victim no supreme sanction will never win any award because of the script and the acting isn't any better i'm afraid a few better known actors michael madsen and kristy swanson who clearly had a lot of bills to pay and therefor accepted to play in this movie together with some other actors who probably don't even know what a camera really looks like don't do any good to the movie either br br so why should you watch this movie well if you haven't got anything better to do but to watch some action flick and you are tired of the 10 rerun of mc or the a team than this might be the movie you want to see otherwise you better leave it alone i give it a 3 10
<START> very glad to see that this excellent film gets such high marks from the users of imdb the best years of their lives remains the finest cinematic statement about veterans returning from war that i have come across easily the finest performance by the often overlooked frederick march in fact the entire cast shines including music legend carmichael who treats us all with a subtle version of his classic lazy river i would recommend this excellent film to anyone who loves movies
<START> story involves ancient demon being released upon a small town on halloween night in all my life i have never seen such a cheesy film but it is so d m entertaining you can forgive its bad acting effects direction and script this is the best movie created for the halloween season since the original halloween and when they introduce linnea quigley's character for the first time she is butt naked in the shower for like 5 mins goodness they just don't get any better than this rush and buy this tape right away 5 10
<START> director john madden of shakespeare in love fame gives us another pretty bad film in ethan the plot centers around a new reverend coming into the town of where he learns the story of the local crippled man ethan sick wife and one time romantic tryst with the maid adapted by richard nelson from pulitzer prize winning author edith novel this film isn't interesting in the least thanks to an abysmally weak script and poor direction that turns scenes that are supposed to be poignant into laughable schmaltz still there are other aspects apart of the film that work the cinematography is well done rachel portman contributes a lovely score and while no one is at their best liam neeson joan allen patricia arquette and tate donovan work well in their roles but overall ethan is only marginally worthwhile and is easily forgotten
<START> this must be one of the funniest danish movies ever made ulrich thomsen and thomas bo larsen are hilarious as they drive across sweden i don't know how ulrich thomsen does it but somehow he can manage to play insane in a very sane way but if you don't understand danish i am not referring to your pastry here don't waste your time on this Â i don't think it would work with subtitles
<START> lives on br br ray dir taylor cast jamie foxx kerry washington regina king clifton powell curtis armstrong and sharon warren written by taylor and james l white rating br br hit the road jack and don't come more no more no more no more who would've thought that this immortal line that has almost become a remedial mantra for broken relationships in popular culture was conceived over a lovers' brawl ray charles was a genius and if there was one thing that he knew breathed and lived for it was music so in a lifetime that comprised acute poverty a desperate struggle with darkness guilt drugs and painful affairs ray still found moments when inspiration hit him out of nowhere and words and notes took their own shape to form an instant eternal classic br br there are some lives that deserve to be transformed on the silver screen ray charles's life was one of them it almost comes as a shock to learn that this project had no studio backing until it was completed and that backing probably came after the initial screenings where jamie foxx's performance was lauded and predicted as a surefire oscar winner in hushed voices jamie foxx as ray almost convinces us that it is indeed ray charles performing on screen and not an actor impersonating from the crooked all knowing smile to the bent gait of not so much a handicapped but a man dancing through his demons foxx captures every essence of the actual ray charles ray was a complicated man he never demanded sympathy and very rarely showed it himself an astute businessman he ensured his success at any cost sometimes at the price of losing his loved ones he never apologized for his philandering ways and always maintained that he loved his family which we are convinced he did he liked sex it was as simple as that but beneath all there also existed a ray that was afraid of darkness imagine the horrors of a blind man afraid of darkness his fear was because of his guilt ray was convinced that he was the reason for his brother's death and his whole life was spent trying to redeem himself ray was a maverick who fused gospel with jazz an unheard blasphemous practice in the 50's but his intentions weren't to instigate he was simply practicing the only way he knew of getting close to god br br it is hard to capture such an eventful life as that of ray and that is perhaps where the movie fails we are never really allowed to get close to ray as a person we know him only as much as we see him his relationships especially with margie regina king aren't explored in detail and the script barely passes over della bea kerry washington ray's wife who everyone knows was a rock by his side and the biggest blunder of all is the rushed almost abrupt climax it's as if the director suddenly realized he was out of stock and called for a pack up nonetheless is definitely recommended for a flawless performance from jamie foxx and an able stellar ensemble the songs and age create a sense of nostalgia and we get a genuine feeling that the film is made with sincerity br br abhishek bandekar br br note is nominated in six categories at this year's academy awards including best picture best director and best actor jamie foxx br br rating br br poor average good very good excellent br br 19th february 2005
<START> larry bishop is 60 years old dirty and not good looking yet in this movie he's like a drug towards the women in their br br a lot of movies have been claimed to be sexist but if any movie deserves that title it's this one br br i can't even count how many boobs there were shown in this movie probably more then hours larry bishop spend writing the script br br the script is ridiculous bishop and his gang argue bike party have sex kill people and the next day they argue bike party have sex kill people and the third day well you get the idea br br i like eric balfour and considering what he had to work with he did pretty good as comanche br br unfortunately this movie is about larry bishop's character who is so one dimensional it's not even funny br br he's also a horrible actor and apparently he never intended to do the lead himself but everybody he asked said no so what was he to do once he realized he was gonna do the lead himself he probably did a re write of the script so that he could touch up more ladies br br although visually it's kind of good looking at least the biker scenes and eric balfour isn't half bad this movie is just a big mess br br i hope to never see larry bishop in front of the camera again
<START> so lame it isn't even funny a zombie infection overtakes a small college campus and a government squad of secret operatives back up a couple of scientists sent to find the origin of the outbreak collecting zombie dna damn sure is not easy once bitten you're one of them the entire university has been completely infected by the run amok undead br br this sequel does not even redeem the awful original house of the dead 2003 senseless entertainment is accomplished though a few glimpses of female nakedness added to a gaggle of gore and exploding heads should keep any zombie freak happy credited cast members emmanuelle vaugier victoria pratt ed quinn sid haig and nadine velazquez the f word holds together an unimaginative script
<START> this movie is a window on the world of britain in 1973 a world of holiday camps fags and birds i was actually at while this was being filmed so it's fascinating to see where i as a kid and what a world we have left behind the 'plot' such as it is concerns stan and jack's attempts to turn a job at a holiday camp 25 quid a week into an opportunity for chasing young women and winding up blakey they are joined by the rest of stan's family and some laughs are to be had from arthur michael robbins and anna karen persistent as well as the sheer oddness of blakey but the idea that young women would see anything desirable in stan reg varney or lecherous jack bob grant is just risible harmless enough in its time now it's just a curio from a bygone age
<START> ashes of time was an audacious project but ended up being a pretentious movie this film is a good example of how to tell a simple story in a complex manner the plot of ashes of time is fairly simple and comes down to two words love triangle because of those love triangles crossing stories jealousy hate and love are the main dynamics displayed by the characters the narrative part is seen through yang eyes leslie cheung yang feng lives in the desert where he acts as to various swordsmen and becomes the tool of destiny through which vengeance is achieved unfortunately ashes of time fails in telling these simple stories of love and hate wong kar wai lost himself driven by a desire to make each frame of the film a painting and an aesthetic experience in fact beside the casting of beautiful actors men and women everything else is a failure in this movie dialogs are and not original at all picture's quality is very much the editing is one of the worst ever seen at least by me in the swordplay genre and finally the filming of the rare sword fight is very confusing and unappealing even the attempt of building artistic scenes is not always achieved the so call erotic women on a horse scene is ridiculous not erotic and useless wong kar wai wanted to deliver 100 minutes of pure aesthetic experience and forgot that a film is first about how a plot is told by forgetting that he delivers an awkward movie that doesn't even fulfill its artistic objective
