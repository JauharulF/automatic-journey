<START> slow odd film that drags and plods i mean really plods along to its disappointing climax you may expect some sort of punchline at the end but there is none both milland and give awkward performances in fact the film's weirdness may actually be the only thing it has going for it the generally atmospheric score has some absurd parts like the music that plays during the first appearance of a monkey and there is a truly awful fantasy scene involving a gorilla
<START> talk about creepy if you really want to sit down and watch this episode where the girl who was in firefly later on gets kidnapped there's entertainment for you but only if you like this sort of thing i don't so i thought to be frank this episode was appalling thankfully it's one of a few duff episodes in season 3 and the only charles grant craig episode so you don't get much of this sort of thing in season 3 so overall verdict just read the summary at the top this is a strong contender hell money says hi for worst episode of season 3 to be honest though i hadn't really expected much i wish i could this episode altogether that's one thing they got right the title
<START> when i saw this movie i expected it to be a cheesy american movie done on the cheap with appalling actors i was really surprised to find that i was totally wrong the movie centres around or b who has been rejected from all of his colleges the actor who play b is very natural and makes his character seem real and decides to create a pretend school so his parents stop harassing him however loads of people see his fake website and join feeling their sorrows b can't turn them away much to the chagrin of his best mate the college is the ideal place with you learning what you want or doing nothing the school faces opposition from the proper college which ends up closing it down the film ends on a high and i recommend you watching it its does have it flaws but it is a feel good cheerful film with a few unpredictable twists
<START> let me start by saying how much i love the tv series the nature of class war was always going to be a subject worthy of poking fun at but this tv series exploits it better than most the chemistry between yootha joyce and brian murphy was always electrifying and the writers wrote almost entirely flawless episodes every time in my opinion it is the best british sitcom of the mid to late 1970s surpassing the likes of rising damp robin's nest are you being served and so on with the on the buses series having finished a few years earlier george and mildred became the next pride and joy of itv or itv 1 as it's now known enjoying a four year run on the channel br br the movie however is absolutely terrible in almost every respect the general essence of the tv series has almost entirely been stripped by the writers of this abysmal movie who anyone will immediately notice are not the same ones who worked on the series as one commenter has already pointed out mildred lacks the sharpness she had on the tv series and does not come across as anywhere near as overbearing br br the plot instead of focusing on the class war with the that was the very foundation of the tv series actually writes out the almost entirely after the first half hour the plot if you can call it that consists of george and mildred going on holiday to some hotel and getting mixed up with gangsters first rate talent in the form of johns kenneth cope david barry and sue bond are all wasted here most of these are well past their heyday and all of them look very embarrassed as if they very well know that the only thing worth hanging around for is a paycheck which probably won't be much br br the jokes and gags in the movie if you can call them that rely heavily upon traditional british farce including mistaken identities embarrassing situations poorly timed slapstick characters losing control of what is happening to them and general confusion and it all fails miserably as another commenter has pointed out it seems as though the writers of this movie have never seen an episode of the tv series and instead crafted out a something resembling a carry on romp the scene where george is stripped down by sue bond's character is particularly out of context br br a mystery surrounding this movie is the bbfc certification provided 15 just why is it rated 15 when all there is to see is harmless non vulgar entertainment br br not surprisingly the era of sitcom spin of came to an end not long after this movie was released shortly after the sad death of yootha joyce and the company behind this movie hammer well known for producing first rate horror movies back in the 1950s to mid 1970s soon disappeared into total obscurity br br all in all the movie is a near total washout my advice skip this and stick to the tv series you won't be missing anything i assure you
<START> somewhere on imdb there is a discussion about the greatest director of all times spielberg copolla and others are named there the greatest argument was around spielberg and whether he is or isn't a great director the problem with spielberg is that while he is a master technician most of his films lack depth saving ryan is really outstanding from a technical point of view but its message is dull and while its very entertaining it doesn't make you think about anything an is the best movie i ever saw because it combines great shooting with a deep philosophical perspective on so many things starting from war in general the clash of civilizations the condition of soldier in is a soldier a hero or an assassin brando says he is neither the french lady says he is both and many others the problem with some people is that they try to argue about whether these points are true or false but a great movie and a great piece of art in general is supposed to spark arguments not to solve them maybe coppola is right or maybe he isn't nobody holds the truth anyway you can watch this movie for its outer beauty amazing scenes great acting and memorable quotes and you will be entirely satisfied but what really make this movie a masterpiece is its inner quality you can't help but make a comparison with the recent fahrenheit documentary both copolla and moore tackle similar issues but while copolla presents matters from an outside objective point of view moore takes a very partisan position that really compromises the whole point of a documentary it is really a shame that a film like fahrenheit 9 11 won a prestigious award like cannes but anyway if you want to start to understand a little of the vietnam war the iraq war the second world war and any war in general you should definitely see this movie and not the other one
<START> this video has audio that is meant for someone to hear during their sleep and the same can be said for the video br br morgan and his wife pretending to rough it at minimum wage jobs with a camera rolling and his little poo complaining give me a break they are both rich they are sitting in their fake 350 month apartment filming this with their 1 000 month each video crew of 12 br br i used to respect morgan but now his 30 days experience is nothing more than trying to fool any volunteer viewers who are willing to be fooled br br c'mon morgan you are being filmed doing a 6 00 an hour job and you are being paid by naive employers who don't see those big cameras filming the whole thing and we aren't to think they aren't paying you under the table
<START> the chasers war on everything 5 words that i love to watch the chasers war on everything is an excellent australian comedy as the name suggests they wage war on everything they seem to love hitting the most of all br br the chaser is one of the best comedies i have seen and is the top of the line in australia it is on the australian broadcasting abc which is where some of the best comedies are br br it has won the australian film industry afi awards but did not win the best comedy at the br br last year 2006 the chaser was aired on abc on friday nights when everyone was out so no one could watch it well they have been moved to wednesday nights at 9pm a heaps better timeslot and the best thing is if i miss an episode or even just want to see it again i can download it from www abc net au chaser
<START> and it's a good one too in fact this may be one of the best studies of sexual repression ever made it's extremely well acted and has some downright chilling moments an often overlooked film in clint eastwood's filmography and atypical of him to be sure but if you're willing to accept him in such an ambiguous role it's certainly very gripping
<START> i really liked this movie but the ads i saw implied and one published review actually said that this movie benefits from a light touch that to me is very misleading br br there is indeed plenty of humor eccentric un subtle sometimes somewhat twisted humor the kind of humor i generally find very appealing indeed but most of the humor is the kind that appears conscious at all times of things deeply serious deeply sensitive even deeply painful the movie weaves together themes of past and present perception and truth memory and activity life and death the entire movie is suffused by the history of european anti in general and of the holocaust in particular br br how can humor and horror be combined in the same movie the review i saw suggested that the humor is absurdist i don't think this is the case at all at least not in the common sense instead i think this movie stands in the tradition of much jewish yiddish literature and theatre i don't claim to be any kind of expert in this area but from what i've seen humor is used in this cultural context both as a coping tool for the horribly tragic experiences of this people and also humor is used as a means of recovering the divine for men and women who choose a path of faith rather than a path of either despair or absurdism see fiddler on the roof for humor used in both ways in this rich tradition br br elijah wood jonathon wood wears horn rimmed glasses that really make him look well strange compare sin city when he wore the same kinds of glasses with chilling effect in this movie it's easy to see how the glasses become a metaphor for both his search and for his struggle between perception and truth eugene young alex and boris old alex are both really just wonderful jonathon and young alex are from the same generation yet seem so very very different and then find that they are not so different after all and the way in which the apparent narrative voice changes gradually from that of jonathon to that of young alex as a journey of intended discovery for jonathon becomes one of discovery for both young alex and old alex is to me so very moving br br there are some wonderful scenes and panoramas from i'm told prague and environs standing in for the ukraine of the story line all feels very authentic and seems to give a wonderful sense of place although i've never been myself to the ukraine and can hardly testify to this from first hand experience br br all in all if you're looking for light comedy i would not recommend this movie at all on the other hand if you are interested in a wonderful delightful and deeply moving film please check out this wonderful movie
<START> this film holds 7 0 rating on imdb so even i sensed something rotten in it's synopsis i decided to try it out what a waste of 100 minutes first of all the 80's were not a good decade for crime and thriller genre most of these in those days were badly done with silly plot if they had any so there are very few that can stand out and even if they were good they are still not very good the hit however suffers from everything that made silly crime pictures silly it has poor character development improbable plot and wasn't written or directed in a decent manner and when you have such shortcomings the acting doesn't help stephen frears often tried to emulate french new wave in english style film making and the two don't match br br first of all terence stamp is 10 years in hiding because he testified against some of his former partners in crime he hides in spain of all places he is finally caught up with and than first kidnapped by a group of silly looking spanish thugs just do be driven away some distance to the two hit man that are supposed to deal with him these two are john hurt who is supposed to be hard boiled stone cold killer and tim roth in his first role as the devil's apprentice they don't kill stamp right away they first dispose of the three amigos they shouldn't have hired in the first place and then they are driving stamp to paris because one of the buddies he testified against wants to confront him ok that's possible but even with stamp being such a dangerous figure that they had to hire four guys to overpower him they don't tie him down don't incapacitate him in any way and drive around with him like he's one of the buddies stamp doesn't object and is happily going to paris to be shot not using any of a half a dozen chances these professionals offer for him to escape than it appears that tim roth is just a school boy bully making the idea of big crime boss teaming him up with a hard core hit man like john hurt even more improbable especially on an important job like that but than john hurt is not so hard core himself he spends twenty minutes of the movie killing or not killing the totally surplus australian played by bill hunter whose only purpose in this film is to introduce the lovely laura del sol his mistress who he says is 15 but she looks more like 25 and whose role in the story and acting capabilities suggest that she was offered the role solely on the basis of being the director's or producer's mistress at the time after much deliberation hurt kills the australian but takes along his mistress for no apparent reason than he wants to kill her but roth with his subtle ways convince him not to so even she kicks him bites him and scratches him through the entire movie he stays true to that deeply buried human side of him br br than you have plain idiotic scenes like when hurt and roth lock the car from the outside trying to prevent the people inside from getting out anyway the movie drags on tim roth falls asleep guarding terence stamp with his gun on his chest and stamp just waits there watching the waterfall than the whole shamble of a plot comes to the point where everything we've seen in the last hour and 20 minutes just goes out through the window let's recapitulate the whole point in not killing stamp right away except for having a movie is to take him to paris so his former partner is to have a last word with him and the whole point in him not running away is that he is prepared to die saying it's just a moment we're here then we're not here we're somewhere else maybe and it's as natural as breathing why should we be scared but my friends here is where the plot twists hurt kills the man while still in spain and we ask why bother and drive around for days he could have done it in the first 15 minutes and than contrary to his philosophy stamp is very afraid of being killed so we ask again why didn't he run and he had plenty chance roth gets killed too but he shouldn't be in the movie at all and del sol well she's promised a role in this film purely for romantic read sexual reasons so she stays alive again even she attacked hurt for the 15th time in the movie he killed all the others but not her she must have maximum screen appearance the movie was made on a shoe string budget and it shows but when you have no story and card board characterizations it shows even more and yes fernando ray appears and goes through the movie as the guest star having a single audible line of dialog awful
<START> i'm really not too sure why people are being so complimentary about this odd movie having said that i did actually sit through the entire 2 hours and can't say it wasn't entirely un entertaining br br i think the key problem is that frank marshall is not a true director and this is clear in the film he is an experienced producer so will have seen a movie made many a time and will understand what goes into the process but i think this is quite different to being able to truly direct a movie the direction was competent but somehow flat and direction less marshall has more experience as a unit or second director and this came through i feel in the finished product it appeared to be a group of sets that failed to really have any continuity in its feel or its character br br fun watchable but good no
<START> one hilarious thing i'll say off the top is i'm not the biggest suzuki fan i've actually seen a fair number of his works thanks to a retrospective the film festival had and i found his films just a wee too yakuza driven for my tastes so i went into princess raccoon wary of what i was going to see boy was i knocked out is suzuki's attempt at a musical using the elements of japanese opera mixed in with many modern elements both and visual raccoon is a treat from start to finish the lead actor joe proves that he's one of the hottest actors in japan these days in this role i have to admire that the younger japanese actors still take roles that take place in feudal times japan dressing up in samurai gear to full effect the story itself does get a bit confusing if you don't follow it really closely but even if you don't prepare yourself for the treasures that princess raccoon has
<START> very strange screenplay by cameron crowe following on the heels of his fast times at ridgemont high has little inspiration and away at dumb gags at least fast times had a fair share of satire and sensitivity behind its slapstick courtesy of a good director amy heckerling and crowe's undeniable penchant for capturing letter perfect teen speak here chris penn sean's brother natch is the goof off who makes life hell for straight arrow eric stoltz and the filmmakers seem to think he's hilarious jenny wright has some good moments as a mall worker but mitchell smith is lost in a head scratching subplot about a teen who seems to be infatuated with a shell shocked ex soldier queasy confused nonsense given a shiny sheen and a soundtrack full of pop rock tunes but characters one would hope to avoid supporting players lea thompson rick moranis lee ving and fenn are wasted in stupid roles from
<START> i found this on the shelf and swooned with joy i danced up to the counter slapped down my money and ran home you know what i fell asleep less then half way thru tried again the next day yawn what the heck i could not watch it i love all the other stuff he's done i didn't see the one with the monster in it yet what gives is it me or him so sad boo hoo p s i did like the camera work
<START> i was surprised by how emotionally invested i became in this film peter boyle is a tour de force as the working class socially conservative bigot joe i actually sympathized with some of his complaints of course he doesn't mention the underlying historical socio economic reasons for many of his prejudices the film also provides interesting insight into the rapid change american society was undergoing at this time recreational drugs casual sex and the challenging of parental authority became in vogue and replaced the more time honored traditions of respect for god country and seniority susan sarandon fans will be delighted joe is her film debut she also provides viewers with a visual treat near the beginning of the film recommended 8 10
