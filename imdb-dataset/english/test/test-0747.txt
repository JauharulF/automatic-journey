<START> i can't believe i sat through this garbage palm trees in d c already mentioned a dummy as dead body bit so obviously artificial that i thought it was supposed to be a dummy until it left a stilted dialogue ridiculous plot i think it's a shame that jill ireland's final film before her death was this stinker don't waste your time i wish i hadn't the only saving grace is that it was on cable so i didn't waste my money on top of everything
<START> when you're watching distant you know you're not watching a french movie there's little sex and it's mostly elliptical and people don't talk that much here there are a few lines scattered here and there and a couple of important conversations just to let you make sense of what's going on it doesn't look american either there aren't any car chases or shoot outs or violence unless you consider the killing of a mouse an act of blood or the daily tension of getting by a subdued catastrophe at times the relatively long held medium distance shots may remind you of asian cinema but just reminds you the director doesn't push things to the radical minimalism of some taiwanese filmmakers but then again this is not a taiwanese movie it's a turkish movie i don't know what that means i don't even know if that's supposed to mean something br br the movie doesn't have a plot proper and yet those few lines those somewhat long held shots and that often mitigated tension gradually build a sense of something happening a sense of 'plot' for lack of a better word that grows on you by the end of the movie you may get the feeling you're going to miss those two cousins who have many things in common but are worlds apart
<START> during the 13 years of schooling i had from kindergarten through high school there was only one day that my class took a field trip when i went to school you went to school from 8 30 until 3 30 and filed trips were not taken but for some reason i could not recall at this advanced age we went to see a movie national velvet i do not recall the movie so on the eve of my year i decided to revisit it br br it is a movie about a time that no longer exists a time when people trusted others and didn't lock their houses a time when people were given the benefit of the doubt it was a time when family was the most important thing this film shows all of that and more it shows love and trust and caring and the goodness of people br br it would not be a bad thing for every family to view this film once in a while and discuss its message br br it was a treat to see the young elizabeth taylor mickey rooney at his best the academy award winning performance of anne revere angela lansbury before murder she wrote and donald crisp who performed for almost sixty years br br what a movie
<START> billy hughes is a mute young lady working for make up on a cheap horror picture being filmed in moscow by an american director one night billy gets locked in the movie studio later that night she hears that someone might be in the building and goes to check it out that's when she stumbles across a woman being brutally murdered while being filmed after escaping the clutches of the murderers billy informs the authorities only to be red faced when the men show it was an act billy knows what she saw and soon her life is in turmoil again from underground figures that believe she has something of importance br br i don't know how this heart pounding sleeper passed me by but i thought it was a much older flick there's one thing though it's got to be one of the most jarringly and intense thrillers i've seen in quite a while it's just a great suspense builder and mostly everything clicks into place the first half of the feature is surprisingly gripping with taut sequences that have your heart in your throat and clouds us with an atmospherically foreboding environment of alienation underling this is a humorously wicked black streak faults do pop up in the story as it does lose that furious grip it held so early and goofy humour or better putter comic relief between fay ripley and evan richard's characters is a hit and miss affair by being too forceful in the long run it probably could have done without despite some cringe moments this aspect didn't hinder my enjoyment of it for me the soft ending they decided to go with just didn't feel right br br the interestingly mysterious premise was eerie to the bone and packed some unsettling goods so multi facet was the context and its thrills there was something fresh to how this all plays out and the nervy jolts and unbearable tension are weaved into a range of sudden plot turns and twists really they made superb use of the novel idea of this disability and to handicap the situation by staging it in a foreign place where not too many spoke english and so we are caught up in the confusion too the delicate marina gives a harrowing portrayal of the american mute girl billy the way she able to display the erratic emotions through her eyes and actions gave it some gruff and believability director anthony waller shoots the flick in a rather stylish well timed and skillful manner without loosing that grimy look that eventuates from its rigid surroundings and a powerfully airy music score persistently nags at you the only real name to make an appearance was small cameo part by alec guinness the performances by the cast were all fine especially the nail biting turns by oleg and igor as the russian murderers br br this riveting feature that's mostly made up of unknowns is way better than your average dark thriller highly recommended
<START> wow just caught this movie from blockbuster and i love finding gems like this while it was definitely shot on a budget and misses a little bit in clumsy editing i e accident hospital scenes second to last end scenes for a first directorial effort i give this 10 stars i absolutely loved the thought provoking concepts brought forth and if you're a free thinker and open to ideas outside the box i highly highly recommend this movie i think the director and writer jay floyd should be given some attention and more opportunities in the film industry based on his credits he may be another quentin tarantino
<START> i'm a fan of good plausible action movies and i'm a huge fan of the elite military units such as the navy seals finally i'm a huge fan of michael biehn sadly none of those allowed me to really enjoy this movie at the time i gave it another chance more recently when i bought the dvd here's the problems with this movie in a quick list 1 it's a poor mans top gun for example including a virtual music video of the seal team playing golf with a soundtrack of the boys are back in town which concludes with charlie sheen doing an inane chase to get his car back br br 2 this is quite simply a charlie sheen movie when sheen was trying to be famous before he started doing stuff like hot shots reports i've heard indicate that sheen was a baby on the set and it affected the roles and direction the rest of the actors in the movie got br br 3 biehn is the head of the seal team yet sheen seldom obeys him any seal showing the lack of discipline that sheen's character does or who endangered the team as he does wouldn't even have made it through buds training let alone gotten on a team br br 4 seals are cross trained on weapons yet in one part of the movie a seal has to figure out how to use a u s stinger missile br br there are a few good scenes in the movie the assault entry at the beginning bill paxton as god and some of the footage in what was supposed to be beirut at the time overall though this movie is a loser
<START> i watched as a second choice after affliction was sold out i have never seen so many people walk out of a movie sean penn kevin spacey and chazz palminteri can do nothing to save this coke snorting endlessly pedantic bad mamet wannabe
<START> it was on a day in when scottish inventor william k l dickson surprised his boss thomas edison with his remarkable work in the development of motion pictures after many experiments dickson was now able to capture scenes of real life with his camera and reproduce them through his invention the kinetoscope as if a fragment of time were preserved in celluloid soon kinetoscope would become an enormous success as a new way of entertainment with many people eager to pay the nickel that was charged to be able to watch people dancing or performing stunts through the of the kinetoscope however the invention wasn't complete in order for it to capture on film the real life as we know it sound was needed on the movies so dickson kept experimenting and this short experiment first film was the result br br in this experiment codenamed simply as dickson experimental sound film director william k l dickson stands in front of a recording cone for a wax cylinder earliest method of recording sound with his violin on hands playing a song named song of the cabin boy the idea was to record the song into the cylinder at the same time that the camera was recording his movements in order to show that this was a motion picture two of edison's black maria laboratory decided to do a little dance in front of the camera unlike what author vito russo claimed in his book the celluloid closet this little dance had nothing to do with homosexuality as it obviously is a reference to the environment of loneliness of the lab akin to the lonely sailors to whom the song of the cabin boy was dedicated to the title russo suggests the gay brothers is actually anachronistic as gay had no homosexual connotation in the late 1890s br br sadly dickson was unable to achieve the desired effect and the never could really produce the synchronized audio with images while he had the cylinder with the sound and the celluloid with the images the synchronization of the two elements was not exactly effective and the sudden appearance of auguste and louis cinÃ©matographe prompted edison's team to focus on projecting systems and eventually dickson left the company fortunately in 1998 cylinder with the movie's sound was rebuilt and film editor walter made a restoration of the experiment as it was intended finally dickson experimental sound film could be heard with synchronized sound just as its creative inventor had intended while it was not a successful attempt this outstanding film is a testament of the enormous genius of the father of kinetoscope 8 10
<START> scarecrow gone wild he's the death of the party need i say more scarecrow gone wild got four out of ten stars from me for one simple reason aside from the terrible acting plot holes cheap special effects and anti climactic whistling it was cinematic gold i think that this movie could have actually been really good had the scarecrow turned out to be the baseball coach as portrayed by the ever so brilliant ken shamrock but then again they would have had to cut those awesome return of the jedi electricity special effects br br while watching this movie my friends and i were convinced that it was in fact written by one of our friends a stereotypical teen aged boy this movie has topless women miserably fake gore and dialog that could not have talked its way out of a paper bag or in this case a cornfield br br if i could ask the filmmaker one thing it would be this how much did you have to pay the teenager that wrote this for you
<START> very poor script and acting i was very surprised that the director was able to convince his cast with his empty story that tells us nothing new all is in the clichÃ© of the mentor and the talented immature pupil the characters even interesting nor sympathetic artistically it is as empty and insignificant the colours are very impersonal and light only the poster may be appealing al pacino tries very hard to give depth to his character with no success too bad because the sport betting can be a really interesting subject to which many could relate but i can't have a complete comment on this movie any way as i got out from the theatre 20 minutes before ending everything was so predictable that it was a waist of time
<START> this year's eurovision was to me a big disappointment i've watched the eurovision song contest every year since 1986 well at least that's the earliest one i can remember and i was only 2 at the time as any other year this one contained both good bad and horrible songs nothing new there however this year's show was the worst one i can remember only very few good probably more like it songs and a lot of absolutely terrible songs br br winner song every way that i can sounded to me like a rip off of turkish singer hit just sounding a lot worse it didn't deserve to win from my point of view song coming in second was a no language song wonder what's next animals singing nevertheless the music for the song was quite catchy giving the song a kind of dreamy feeling to which the lyrics seemed appropriate one of the better songs but that's not saying much br br after one of the closest races in eurovision history russian duo t a t u ended in third place just three points behind turkey and behind belgium with ne ne don't trust don't be afraid to me t a t u was one of the very few highlights of the show surprising just about everyone by being some of the most covered up girls of all the female contestants they let their song do the talking and if we ignore the fact that they failed to pitch a few times in the first chorus they let the song speak very well indeed br br the biggest surprise when looking at the was austria the here in denmark had the biggest odds on that song a song that indeed was beyond horrible but ended up in 8th place could it be that bum of his being shaken to the rhythm of the song that performance was the one that made me and my family laugh the most not because it looked good but because it looked so stupid that it was actually fun br br sweden did what they do the best abba in 1999 they won with take me to your heaven by sounding like abba in 2001 they made the top 10 with listen to your heartbeat again sounding like abba and once again this year they did it abba style again ending in the top 10 br br england was finally punished for making those absolutely horrible non catching songs that they've been the past years br br ireland ripped off the winner from 2000 fly on the wings of love and i could go on and on about how bad the songs were br br i feel a bit sorry for the aussies who this year finally got the chance to see the eurovision song contest they deserved better than this br br i wasn't surprised by the show though the eurovision from 2000 to me stands out as one of the best in recent years 2001 was quite good but not as good 2002 was okay but certainly no more this year was quite simply disappointing br br let's hope it'll get better next year if not for us then at least for the aussies br br 4 10 one for t a t u one for the close race one for the butt shaking and one for all the rest
<START> i saw this movie in blockbuster and thought it might be a good sunday evening movie when there is nothing else to do so i bought it used 3 dvds for 25 although it was cheap my money would have been better spent on a nail to drive through my foot br br the film started out nicely kinda dark and mysterious i was always enthralled with vampire and samurai movies as a kid i thought the combo would be really cool the first fight scene was pretty cool i was excited for the rest of the movie then the movie took a serious nose dive br br i understand that this was a big hit in the east i guess because of the twins i don't see it though this movie aside from the first 10 minutes was absolutely horrible so many movies in this genre have the potential to be great and blow it terribly this is just another casualty br br chan's role in this film doesn't make any sense at all complete silliness he probably made a few bucks off it though br br the only cool thing in this movie are the swords they use nice idea br br i wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone
<START> this movie is great best acting i have ever seen in my life e is the best icelandic actor and of course hilmir snÃ¦r and great music and sound cold hard reality about a struggle of a man that has a lot of problems and the people in his life black humor mixed with great acting and this european art movies style it works it comes together in a the best icelandic movie ever made i say to you see this film you will not regret it i gave it 9 stars if you see one icelandic film in your life see this one
<START> one hundred and seventy five million dollars is a hell of a lot of money to spend on even the biggest summer blockbuster not even michael bay had a budget that big for transformers so exactly how universal pictures spent that much cash making evan almighty is a mystery they certainly didn't spend it on the script for one thing as the film is not so much a classic comedy as it is christian flag waving and bar one or two quiet chuckles you're most likely to spend the duration wondering where the budget went or why steve carrell felt the need to slum it in a decidedly average movie at the exact moment when his star profile has begun to rise br br a sequel to the jim carrey comedy bruce almighty this film sees former supporting character evan baxter carrell moving up the ladder into the main player slot the story opens with him leaving the news desk to become a public official and moving to washington with his wife and three generic sons slightly weird primary school moppet spirited middle schooler and sulky teenager evan's bid to change the world through politics however gets a spanner in the works when god morgan freeman appears and asks him to build an ark br br in other words it's an updating of the old genesis story with evan fighting off cynicism and naysayers to build the immense boat unfortunately while the premise is reasonably promising it sadly does not provide many laughs there's a bit of fun to be had in the early going where evan's straight laced mp tries to juggle the demands of public service with the unwelcome packs of animals that follow him around and a beard that resists all attempts to shave it but as soon as he accepts his divine mission the film takes a nosedive br br from this point on it turns into a message movie evan begins preaching with alarming regularity and morgan freeman keeps turning up to offer kind wisdom while gently prodding his chosen in the right direction without evan's resistance though the only trace of comedy left comes in the form of a few rubbish animal feces jokes and john michael role as evan's exasperated right hand man higgins may show the same rich comic potential that he did previously in arrested development but his enthusiasm cannot save the sinking vessel especially seeing as carrell has all but placed his formidable improv skills on the back burner br br in some respects it's slightly similar to the passion of the christ but unlike mel gibson's movie which encouraged everyone to believe in god through blood letting and guilt tripping evan almighty tries a more gentle approach the movie simply tells us that we should have faith in god because he has faith in us unfortunately this movie is just as likely to make you laugh as the passion is carrell is on autopilot the jokes don't exist and wanda sykes makes a bid to become the most annoying person on the planet it might be sweet but somebody just tossed 175 000 000 overboard
<START> just see it it's a smart movie but too hard to understand the first time see it more than once everything that is seen or heard on the screen is intentionally crafted to evoke a feeling sensation or tone the clarity of certain visuals and the of certain sounds are deliberately contrasted with blurred images or pops crackles hisses and barely audible sounds the structure is non linear and cyclical motifs recur as time runs both and expectations regarding plot and character are broken signaling a non traditional use of film to tell a story that is both contemporary and as old as humanity this is a part of a review usa the movie is emotionally intense intellectually intriguing and profoundly disturbing in surprising and unconventional ways dion dennis phd
