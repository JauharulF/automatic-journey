<START> tom fontana's unforgettable oz is hands down one of the greatest television series ever created brilliantly written acted and directed it is as close to perfection in any art form film television literature music as it gets haunting in it's extreme brutality it creates a prison world filled with diverse characters that range from compassionate to flat out terrifying it is a show that no matter how brutal it is get through one cannot take its eyes off of the combination of professional trained theater actors with film and television actors allows for a range of diverse and all original performances br br and while the show is universally praised and has had a loyal fan base one cannot feel that it was under appreciated during it's television run because of other hbo dramas such as the sopranos sex and the city and six feet under and while all those shows are fine and borderline masterpieces in their right many people forget that it was oz that was hbo's first entry into one hour television drama series it was a brave risky first entry and with it hbo hit a grand slam with it this is as good as it gets
<START> an aging roger moore is back yet again as bond this time trying to find out why agent was killed and why he had a forgery of a egg with him and where it came from he ends up in new delhi india then in east germany after finding out about a russian general trying to detonate a nuclear bomb at a circus hoping nato will push for complete disarmament so he can take control of western europe then the rest of the world br br despite the way it sounds this is really more of a romance i think between bond and octopussy than an action movie and longish but still somewhat fun but there are way too many attempts at humour in this one at times it seems like it was intended to be a comedy also timothy dalton would have been better than roger moore in this so there wouldn't have been so much of an age difference between bond and octopussy br br useless trivia the small plane used by bond in the pre credits sequence is now hanging up in a steak and lube restaurant in largo area florida usa br br 1 2 out of
<START> when madame decides to let her cats inherit her it spells trouble the snobbish butler edgar who is next in line to inherit decides to get rid of the cats thereby the story can begin and the cats can go on an adventure that would otherwise have been impossible an adventure that lets them meet the charming but not altogether trustworthy cat he helps them through many dangerous and funny situations until the inevitable happy end br br the force of this movie is in its humor and music edgar is simply hilarious as the insulted butler who is out to settle the score and of course he himself takes some serious beatings one of the best scene contains him being chased by the two dogs lafayette and napoleon the score is great and like in the jungle book you have scenes that is almost musical in the sense that the story doesn't progress and the focus is to let the protagonists express themselves via dance and of course we like that the score is quite jazzy br br and of course it's not only me but also my children who love this one br br regards simon
<START> a real hoot unintentionally sidney character is so sweet and lovable you want to smack him nothing about this movie rings true and it's boring to boot
<START> i absolutely loved this film so much emotion in such a small amount of time i loved the beginning and how it completely throws you off guard i love the story and the deer being brought in i know that when i think of deer i think of innocence and prosperity also in psalm 42 2 in the bible it says as the deer pants for the water brooks so pants my soul for you o god which could even connect the last moment when the woman says it will be okay as if she knows she's going with god perhaps i am thinking way to much into it but sometimes it is interesting to see what goes on through peoples' minds thank you for sharing this masterpiece with viewers everywhere i live in texas and i had it playing on cable i immediately got onto the computer to find out more about this film and this amazing director i really liked the music that was used in the background music can sometimes make or break a film it definitely set the mood perfectly very nice choice br br thanks again br br laetitia
<START> this is surely british humour at its best it tends to grow on you the first time i watched it i couldn't quite figure out what it was all about but now i can watch the episodes over and over again and enjoy them every time
<START> i watched the beginning twice could not make sense of it and it bothered me for the whole movie br br so work this out with me wayne the good guy jumps on the stagecoach disarms the drivers steals the money and takes off br br disarmed one driver is then killed and the other wounded by the bad guys thanks to wayne who disarmed them and then watched it happen br br then wayne drops the money in the dirt rescues the girl rides into town chuckles it up with yak too bad about the dead guy i guess and then later says he found the money back at the scene and everyone's okay with that br br and he's the good guy and i'm pretty sure there weren't small hand held flashlights at the time and bell did his first phone demo in 1876 were they in houses then am i thinking too hard about this one normally i'm happy to suspend judgment to enjoy a movie but this one bothered me and that's a sign the move didn't really work for me
<START> nothing short of magnificent photography cinematography in this film the fact that you keep seeking and hoping for more flying sequences tells you that they have just enough the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid br br a must rent view or see br br don't be afraid of subtitles br br its worth a little aversion therapy br br 10 10 br br
<START> one of the best war films i have ever seen if not the best it is very hard to talk about such films as it is very difficult to point at any film mistake made the problem is as it looks too real and by that drags you in to the ruins of stalingrad and make you suffer for both sides this is for the reason that this film unlike the most of hollywood films doesn't glorify the war or the heroism of the main characters instead of that the film makes them heroes only for being human and by that is anti war as much as the reason can offer extremely convincing war scenes and so impressive acting most of the scenes look like isolated theater pieces also german army is played by germans which is so convincing as well the film is produced and realized by germans where you can see their love for details to perfection this is the reason why stalingrad is one of the films i can watch million times and never feel dull i watched the film with my father who fought in wwii and the first thing he said was this is like real this is how the war against germans looked like this is the place you can see how did it look to be a soldier in the worst nightmare of warfare in human history and turning point of wwii stalingrad
<START> sherri for an evening of pleasure and terror '' cheap special effects cheesy lines yep its the original 1978 movie starting geoffrey land as peter desmond and jill jacobson as sherri martin and directed by al adamson br br the movie is about an evil ancient spirit that possesses a nurse at a hospital then she starts killing doctors one by one the acting was okay but some of the acting was robotic the storyline was good but the sex scenes were just thrown in there probably to get more views the directing was bad and the special effects looked like a drawing the effects didn't fool anybody the death scenes were pretty good but the director mixed too many things in there that didn't make any sense like the sex scenes the nudity the football player and many more br br overall its a good movie but not the best br br 7 out of 10
<START> the film opens with the director talking to the camera and saying he is going to show a story about street kids whose families live in poverty and must steal and kill to survive in fact the main character pixote was played by an actual street kid only 11 years old what follows was one of the most brutal depressing and horrifying film i've even seen i saw it about 17 years ago on a double bill with black orpheus and have never forgotten it i don't think i ever want to see it again it was just too much br br spoiler ahead the scene which will not leave me is when pixote meets a prostitute who has to abort her own fetus you don't see her do it but you get a quick glance at what she got out it's almost 20 years later and just recalling that scene upsets me spoiler end br br the movie gets more brutal as it goes along and ends the only way it can what's all the more harrowing is stories like this really did happen in brazil in 1981 and are still happening today br br a harrowing brutal film but it should be seen if you can handle it i'm surprised this got an r rating i've seen x rated film that are less graphic a 10
<START> this film would be considered controversial today but is still very funny the racial stereotyping is done from the view of humor not hate this film strips off shows how corrupt politicians already were in the early 1930's this film proves it started before the 1970's beyond when it has accelerated in the united states lloyd is still in his typical genre here even though his character was raised in china br br the meaning of a cat's paw in this instance is a person who is running for political office but is being used by the established political machine to advance their agenda in other words they think this guy lloyd is harmless when he runs for office then when he gets elected he surprises them br br this same theme is used later in james stewarts film mr smith goes to washington stewarts is more famous has a stronger message this film is more clever subtle which are harold trademarks br br there is still the heart of romantic comedy hidden with the facade of the movie but today's mainstream audiences would still appreciate the political humor the ending is absolutely priceless i wish someone could beat today's political system in this way i was surprised how much i enjoyed this film find myself wishing harold had done more like it during the 1930's br br at least we have this one i think the person who is quoted most in the movie is fictional ling po i always thought was the wise one but this one makes me believe the wisdom of china was not limited to him is a vast field of comedy lloyd mined in this movie
<START> peter o'toole gives a brilliant performance in this movie i have seen the original version with robert and i much prefer peter o'toole's performance and the movie in general even though it is a musical i've really never seen anything that mr o'toole is in that i don't like he is a brilliant actor multi talented giving performances full of passion and depth clark also gave a surprisingly good performance and was perfect for the part it is an all around heartwarming movie full of tenderness and bittersweet fun i will always remember in para phrase the line where mr chips regrets he has never given her children and she replies of course you have hundreds of them all boys thank you for the opportunity to vote for this movie and to voice my opinion
<START> to start out with the script is immitative and inane the characters are shallow and formulaic the plot has arbitrary reversals and non baldwin's direction is terrible these actors could do better on their own the jokes and wisecracks fall flat the shoot out scenes are clumsy and incredible baldwin directs himself as the wise courageous hero but spends most of his time in power struggles with women particularly with the caricatured in their tunnel team who is always asking for and denying reassurance the conductor suffer from absurd incompetence being unable to effectively employ a pistol he has come by anomalies a hooded man with guns stalks through a railroad car startling people the next time we see them they are going about their business sitting in their seats talking eating reading knitting in the new york subways folks sometimes come on the train to do some musical or dramatic number maybe that's what they thought the happening was
<START> this movie makes you wish imdb would let you vote a zero one of the two movies i've ever walked out of it's very hard to think of a worse movie with such big name actors well armageddon almost takes it but not quite
