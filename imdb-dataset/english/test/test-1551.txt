<START> life is crazy you're crazy i'm crazy we're all crazy we're all a little bit minnie and a little bit moskowitz sometimes it does seem best to be sensible but then what might you be missing out on br br you gotta be you you don't have to park cars and semi randomly yell at people but you can't hide yourself behind a veil or dark sunglasses and pretend and act like everything is okay and sometimes you really do have to throw caution to the wind because why else are you alive br br i'm not going to this love compared to cassavetes' other movies because they are all absolutely 100 unique works and each their own individual act of expression and exploration of our lives in that sense they are all great and comparisons are odious for sure this movie has that one crazy sometimes maddening but ultimately wonderful and freeing quality that all his movies have you never know what's going to happen next and you never know what the characters are going to think do or feel next neither do the characters themselves and do we really want to live our lives any other way unlike moskowitz you can have a great job and sock away money into your ira but still live the life of an adventurer inside in your feelings your spirit and your very experience of life yeah we can have it both ways that's what cassavetes shows us thank god somebody did
<START> what in the world this piece of gambling cinema would have been suitable for the lifetime network michael is a good actor but i think his portrayal as stu fell short the montages were unbearable and too many the supporting cast where are you whoever did the casting should be partially at fault the cinematography was useless a gambling story with an after school feel to it stories of this sort should be left for the oliver stone's of the world it would still suck ass but at least it would be fun to watch it was an attempt that lost it's wheels before the race ever begun mario andretti in the 1982 indy 500 came to mind
<START> i've lost count of the times i have seen this movie but i love it and find it very funny each time i see it the facial expressions slapstick humor and the timing on the jokes makes it great the characters especially nitro sonar and are hilarious i thought kelsey grammar rip torn and bruce dern did a great job in fact i think this movie was perfectly cast i think it does need to be released in dvd before i wear my vhs version out
<START> by randolph scott standards of the 1950s this is a disappointing and heavy handed star western two or three of the characters could be dispensed with while two or three other characters could be given more prominence the humour needs to be completely rewritten de toth handles the action well as always but his grasp of the overall narrative is weak
<START> i know these types of films sell tickets and make a profit for the film makers but it just won't do as a film about vietnam viet nam was filled with horrors for the men who lived it day in and day out br br this film stars gene hackman who is korean war vet assigned to train a group of rag tag viet nam vets for a return trip to that country to rescue a group of american pow's held at a camp there these men include a former tunnel rat a crazy acid dropping sailor a blond tanned surfer from california and some inexperienced kid patrick swayze who just so happens had a dad that was killed in nam they train first at some camp in texas and once in nam they are found out and lose all their weapons they are able to find replacement weapons and continue on their way to free the captured men most of the men are found and saved but the rag tag group is mostly wiped out br br this movie played like a video game in which you could figure out what was going to happen next and who would pop out of behind what bush and who was going to die and who was going to live viet nam i'm guessing was not like a video game
<START> i didn't expect much from the movie so am not all that disappointed carrie looked ugly mr big had his eyebrows colored with crayons and samantha didn't say f br br charlotte's kid was annoying to watch as she was in too many scenes the title could easily have been parents' night out camera angles just weren't that good especially regarding carrie's face br br there was a token black woman thrown in whose character doesn't have a proper exit and too few appearances by the gay men friends who seemed thrown in with no purpose anyway samantha's going back and forth from la choked the story flow especially when she comes in for fashion week and nothing happens br br the movie seems to have been made in rush because it could have been good but scenes were just thrown in to show different outfits or to offer viewers a chance to jump back in the show without adding much to the story of the movie
<START> i'm not much for cop movies but this one is supposedly a classic when i found it cheap i bought it and stuck it on a shelf only to finally get around to watching it yesterday and i liked it now you can have new york city but as a setting for a film like this in the winter months it's perfect roy scheider is a member of an elite police task group called the seven ups which are 5 guys that fight crime undercover in an opening scene they recover a shoebox full of money from an antique store by distracting the crooks with a bull in a china shop routine but that's only the beginning seems that there are two guys posing as cops that are kidnapping mob types and holding them for ransom richard lynch happens to be one of these sleaze bags and he's as creepy as ever when one of the seven ups who is posing as a limo driver at a funeral gets his cover blown he's beaten and stuffed into the trunk of a car which then leads to perhaps one of the most exciting car chases i've seen amazing though how light traffic in nyc is for chase scenes but still this is rather amazing as scheider follows the two kidnappers through what i'm guessing is the bronx and then onto a and then eventually scheider's car comes to a screeching halt in one of the most heart stopping finales to a chase scene that i've ever witnessed anyway since the cop ends up dying scheider and his men are under suspicion because the police commissioner knows so little about their activities he wonders if they're on the make by kidnapping mobsters so of course this kind of thinking needs to be nipped in the bud scheider is relentless getting to the bottom of things overall a decent cop action drama not really my thing but i liked this one look for joe spinell maniac in a small role 7 out of 10
<START> i totally agree this is pitch black underground and a well worn plot the best scenes i thought were the divers exploring the caves going through impossible subterranean passageways some of them were heart pounding the scenery was great had they dispensed with the staple alien toothy cgi entirely the movie would have been much better all they would have had to do is never show any monsters at all but have everyone wondering and follow jack's descent into madness and this might have been a top rate hitchcock style thriller maybe award material the acting isn't bad but those rubber bats just reduce it to standard fare
<START> jealous husband holds car dealership hostage while williams burdens the viewer with his worn out mork shtick at every turn yawn br br pay channel grist an uncommonly bad script coupled with a less than convincing robin williams as a slick talking philandering queens car salesman caught up in a hostage workplace crisis the laughs aren't there the message s or morals are just all wrong and the film cant ever decide on whether its a comedy or drama pretty good cast all acting pretty badly when a movie ages so badly so quickly you got yourself a stinker not much else to be said other than maybe avoid at all costs textbook mediocre movies like this are actually more tedious and less enjoyable than the over the top bombs
<START> the best thing i can say about quintet is that it's not quite as bad as i remembered it being on my first viewing br br but that doesn't mean it's good br br this weird sci fi thriller is not quite like any other movie i've ever seen which i guess at least gives it the stamp of novelty but it's a borderline disaster of a movie and one of the worst robert altman ever made on the dvd special feature about the making of quintet it's clear that even altman didn't know what the hell the movie was supposed to be br br it's set in some distant future when the world is in the grip of another ice age the film was shot at the abandoned site of the montreal expo '67 and i do have to admit that this gives the movie some interesting production design elements even if much of it looks like it's being filmed in an iced over shopping mall paul newman looking zonked out and absolutely disinterested in anything going on around him and brigitte fossey play drifters who wander into this futuristic city looking for newman's brother soon newman is caught up in a deadly game of quintet which all of the bored inhabitants play for lack of anything better to do and the rules of which are never made clear to the audience all we know is that the object of the game it to kill everyone else you're playing with and remain the only person alive this gives these nihilistic inhabitants their only thrill because as one of them says at one point in a soliloquy only by being near to death can one appreciate being alive br br the movie is slow ugly and actually uncomfortable to watch due to its unrelenting it's almost as if altman was purposely setting out to make a movie no one would want to sit through there aren't characters oh sure actors walk around speaking lines but none of the lines really means much and the impressive list of international actors altman assembled for this register not a whit only bibi gives the closest thing to a memorable performance as could possibly be found in a movie like this but nevertheless it does succeed in establishing an atmosphere even if that atmosphere is one of pure awfulness and it is oddly fascinating in the way that watching a man slowly starve himself to death would be fascinating br br altman really hit a dry spell after nearly a decade of superb films quintet followed close on the heels of the atrocious a wedding and was followed in short order by the not bad but mostly forgettable a perfect couple the by all accounts terrible health which i've never seen because it's not available anywhere to see and the disastrous popeye thank god he rebounded br br grade d
<START> this movie was lacking in a lot of areas it's about this elvis type guy who races cars and is approached by these bikers from satans angels one of them is named banjo and they beat up college kids for fun they want the elvis guy to be their driver at times i wanted the folks from to be quiet because the movie was actually kind of good sure there was violence and a lot of cheesy lines such as what kind of beer do you want a cold one that was cheesy the dude who plays banjo is a great boxer and i was glad to see him do a few fight scenes also the biker named fats had a nazi swastika on his jacket that was pretty bold if i must say so myself
<START> jennifer grey seems the of romantic leads and that's probably the reason why this beloved film is such a sure fire hit it's all very well doing a version of and capulets with like dancing and baiting jewish society family tropes thrown in but there usually has to be an x factor br br swayze probably makes this film safe with his rugged post travolta moves and temperament but its being won over by this curly mopped penelope teen that brings the dream in reach of the impressionable market the super dated perhaps soundtrack helps and of course the cunning conceit of setting the film in a resort away from day to day life altogether the fantasy 7 10
<START> film starts off great in with a violent bloody fight between dracula christopher lee and van helsing peter cushing dracula is impaled and dissolves to dust van helsing also dies somebody gathers dracula's ashes and buries them in the grounds of a church cut to 1972 here's where the film falls apart br br we are instantly hit over the head with loud bad 70s music horrible fashions and silly dialogue when this was made hammer was losing money and decided to try anything to get a hit putting dracula in the 1970s was not a good idea the fashions music and dialogue date the movie horribly we're introduced to a bunch of annoying kids in their 20s who decide to have a black mass for a giggle naturally they have it at the church now abandoned and naturally revive dracula it's a good thing a descendant of van helsing is around but dracula goes after his niece stephanie beacham in revenge br br lee and cushing are great as always in their roles and whenever they're on screen the movie gets a much needed shot of energy the opening and ending battles are the highlights of the film although the ending is spoiled a lot by playing lousy 70s music also the main ringleader of the kids is named johnny alucard christopher a truly stupid name that dates back to the 1940s the film also has scream queen caroline munro looking absolutely great the film is well directed and pretty well acted but the plot is stupid the constant barrage of 70s fashion dialogue and music gets annoying real quick and i was basically bored silly br br most hammer fans agree this was one of the worst dracula movies it's followup rites of dracula was the worst and the last hammer dracula film this gets a 2 just for cushing and lee
<START> i saw the trailer for this film before watching titanic and i must admit that it whetted my appetite volcano seemed to be quite spectacular and full of promise but what a damp squib corny is not the word for the script and the characterizations are often ludicrous the stupid daughter is just beyond belief she is supposed to be 13 not 4 but then the scientists firemen and peripheral characters don't offer any more this movie ranks just in front of cruise ii and twister but only because those 2 films are completely appalling this does have some reasonable effects but overall its a 1 out of 10 don't waste your time
<START> i'm not going to bother mentioning any of the plot this is strictly a b movie on its way to obscurity the shock to me though is seeing what has become of some of the actors in this film erika eleniak never anything you'd call a thespian anyway seems to have morphed into anna nicole smith in her big period daniel bernhardt i almost shed a tear he's always been a favorite of mine because of his martial arts prowess as seen in the bloodsport series also b movies but if you like martial arts eminently watchable here he is a shell of his former self sure he's older but doing the mercenary thing and not even looking interested i just don't get it don't these people invest william forsythe is another heavy that i've always liked but his last several roles are what you would call mailing it in i'm not going to even mention mr reynolds his gig here amounts to a throwaway nothing more the only winner is andrew divoff as usual a creepy evil villain with a sandpaper voice that can milk the best kind this is a movie you watch for laughs there's nothing else to it
