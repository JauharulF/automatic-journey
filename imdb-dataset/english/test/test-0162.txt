<START> the film is set in newcastle on tyne in north east england the town where i was born and grew up the film is also fundamentally dishonest the way it presents the town the kids but above all the men of the town in this film they are all stupid violent thieving thugs br br i suppose i could comment on the plot predictable the performances competently unattractive the direction lazy and unimaginative but to me that is all irrelevant compared to the director's insult to the town and its people br br thus the invitation in my summary to the director and writer mark herman to leave the north east
<START> i truly was disappointed by this film which i had high hopes for it seems to have been rushed out to take advantage of the success of screwball comedies at the time including mgm's own lady which featured two of the same stars and the success of william powell and myrna loy three years into their pairing they were still attractive to watch and filled with fire in their scenes together but a weak screenplay and rushed premise destroys any chance of it being a great followup to the previous year's lady and the two thin man movies they had done prior to this double wedding tells the story of a clothing store manufacturer myrna loy who is intent on dominating the life of her sister florence rice future brother in law john beal and her own servants which include sidney toler and mary gordon when the independent spirited william powell comes into her life having distracted rice and beal from loy's constant control loy meets her match sounds good so far right yeah an interesting premise falls short sad to say because loy's character is so one dimensional it is hard to even like her let alone see powell fall in love with her which we know will soon happen it's another attempt to put a career minded woman in her place by changing her views on her what kind of life she has been leading something hollywood did often during its golden age when loy says she doesn't have time to both run her business and have a man in her life its a groaner br br fortunately other than powell there is free spirited jessie ralph on board a salty wealthy older woman who helped loy start her business she has an acquaintance with powell and can see immediately through loy's cool claims that she loathes him rice and beal are a boring couple and the whole premise of powell getting between them is senseless then an ex wife of powell's shows up which really isn't necessary at that late point in the story and the final wedding scene where a crowd of people try to get into powell's tiny trailer is a weak attempt to bring some farce it is funny though that powell keeps getting hit by items meant by loy to hit edgar kennedy with those chuckles are most welcome since there are so few others powell and loy would do better in two later screwball comedies i love you again and love crazy which are sophisticated witty and fun this film attempts to be all three but ends up a sophisticated bore

<START> the beatles had just done mystery tour ' there was the general feel that performance peace and drugs went together naturally in la there was a film subculture that knew something was up nicholson was in several of these gangs br br before he decided to seriously become an actor before rider ' before 'pink flamingos ' before for night ' there were several experiments with what to do about this an important one is manuscript ' this is another br br jack writes he plays with circular narrative self reference film reference performance self loathing the pain of creation all on the outskirts of safe you must see this if only to know something about jack br br certain actors act by digging into themselves it is a common technique some dig deep but after a while they become boring because they are incredibly shallow people there isn't just enough stuff in there to sustain a career think of deniro and hackman br br others are pretty interesting people who seem to become more interesting over time when they dig into the barrel they put stuff back in because of the pain of the digging think sean penn and jack at the bottom of jack's barrel at the end of the thread he spins as the base of every character is this experimental risky writer filmmaker br br who cares if it is a bad movie it is bad because it took risks watch when a tear is wiped from annette's cheek by the director it is a loving goof on the whole brando thing something that i heard marlon laughed about that is one of the richest moments in hollywood film history br br there's another reason to watch this music in film is has a strong root in dance revolution in film often relies on music whole cultures are thus swept along br br an unsung in inventing how billions now dance is toni basil she was as influential in pop choreography as the beatles were in music she was already well into her career when called upon to work on this but this is one of her earliest screen appearances you can see her work throughout and she herself in the pretty cool girl' segment over one of better songs followed by the frank zappa cameo mccartney would reference this scene in his teevee special years later br br a third reason to watch is early about 6 1 2 minutes in the film a character named 'lady kisses each monkey in a long continuous shot and then dismissively departs she is credited as i j jefferson but is really mimi manchu nicholson's lover at the time and lsd partner red hair psychedelic demeanor lovely that scene says it all for me about how jack feels about the boys br br ted's evaluation 3 of 3 worth watching
<START> take the secret agent james bond craze of the sixties mix in some concepts from sax rohmer's female fu manchu femme fatale and stir in some twisted revisionism by director franco you have the man hating lesbian or the 7 secrets of better known as the girl from rio in the usa recalling that man from rio which has nothing to do with this yes this does take place in brazil we must give it that or sumitra as she's also referred to is like an evil version of modesty blaise played here by actress eaton with that familiar coy smile which most of us first became acquainted with in goldfinger there are numerous close up shots of her staring off camera slowly opening her mouth probably while watching something unpleasant however she is doubled in her key lesbian scene she controls an entire army of female warriors colorfully costumed and rules a city called or something just outside rio de janeiro these concepts which previously appeared in the million eyes of sound terrific but despite some intriguing set design visuals it follows the same campy atmosphere of for example the very dated some girls do which came out around the same time and which also featured a female army at first glance the sight of all these armed females usually lined up in a row catches one's interest but after 15 minutes or so you realize there's nothing else there beyond just setting up the visual br br the plot follows what seems like a secret agent a male arriving in brazil with 10 million dollars he catches the attention of the local crime lord sanders hamming it up as an elderly bond type villain who sends dark suited thugs in bowler hats to accost him this sets everything up for a 3 way conflict between the agent the crime lord and the mysterious the crime lord wants secrets also keeps various prisoners in glass cages maybe that's one of the secrets this sounds exciting but there are problems which go beyond just a slow pace there are many shots which could have used a lot of tightening one shot of an arriving airplane for example stays on the craft as it settles to a near stop as if this had never been captured on film before there's a similar approach to a typical sunset as if there's something unusual about it the fight scenes are very substandard as if the filmmakers had to use the first takes to add some production value there's a scene of the real rio carnival about midway through i'm guessing there were various budget problems especially evident in the climactic battle where fake sound effects and smoke cover up a lot of bogus action such as the lack of even real looking guns it calls to mind those times when kids use plastic guns and pretend bullets are being fired falling over unconvincingly there are touches of sadism such as torturing a character to get answers and female nudity an early depiction of such after some restrictions were lifted but mostly you'll be rolling your eyes hero 3 villains 5 femme fatales 5 henchmen 4 fights 3 stunts chases 3 gadgets 4 auto 4 locations 6 pace 3 overall 4

<START> being a harrison ford fan i am probably being kind it was predictable sappy my husband made a lot of gagging sounds while we were watching it what a disappointing movie our local newspaper san jose mercury news actually gave this 4 stars out of 4 stars hard to believe that the reviewer saw the same movie we did
<START> five fingers of death although previous shaw martial arts epics had shown the influence of the american cowboy genre none had paid such open tribute to it as this one especially in the saloon fight scene and though shaw bros films had borrowed from the japanese chambara swordfight genre before none had done so with such success as this one i suppose some of this had to do with the fact that the director originated from korea and thus brought a non chinese perspective to such borrowings which certainly raises some interesting questions about culture but in any event this film presented real innovations in technology and technique in hong kong action films for the first time in hong kong the camera was given access to the whole of any given set which meant shots from many different angles such as the low angle interior shot showing the ceiling of a room the original american innovation of which usually credited to john ford or the high angle long shot that allowed visualization of a large ground area or the frontal tracking shot br br it is true that this was not the first hand to hand combat film of real cinematic substance that remains wang yu's 'chinese but on a commercial level shaw bros were right to choose 'five as their first major release to the west because one might say it was the of their action films that is the least dependent on purely chinese theater traditions although this made no impression on the american critics at the time who universally trashed the picture it wasn't lost on american audiences especially among african americans whose culture had always been by necessity an eclectic patchwork of borrowed elements and innovation in 'five they were given the opportunity to discover the core of the story in the earnest young man forced to make the extra effort to overcome social barriers and betrayal in order to have his merit recognized this seems to be an issue universal to modernity but each culture has its own way of expressing and resolving it 'five presented it in a way many americans could relate to as well as chinese br br so is the film now only of historical value certainly not for one thing this issue hasn't gone away secondly some of the innovations leave much of the film looking as fresh today as it did on first release also the action is well staged and the performances though a little too earnest are crisp the film is a might over long but the story does cover a lot of ground and there are marvelous set pieces through out such as the saloon confrontation the fight on the road to the contest the odd double finale br br definitely looks better on a theater screen but still impressive for home viewing recommended
<START> if you're a fan of the original series do not see this movie br br i should have been skeptical from the previews when aeon expresses her motives for murder in the series aeon had no family and no motive for her adventures save selfish interests obviously the chimp writer in charge felt the movie needed to cater to the bad demographic by making the character deadly but have a good reason to kill people br br you wouldn't have thought it possible but the movie is more two dimensional than the cartoon the characters are all portrayed as inherently good with some conflict of interest that eventually gets resolved all dogs go to heaven and same for every character that dies in this movie br br the selfish twisted perverted dominating personas of aeon and trevor are nowhere to be seen in the end they literally develop into a cutesy couple ala annie hall the only character who remained true to the show was the the floating machine in the sky i suppose if you ever thought gee i like aeon flux but i wish it were more like every other faceless good v evil sci fi hollywood slop out there then you are in for a treat br br they didn't even get the look right i suppose a black metal bikini was too much to ask for but the whole setting is wrong 400 years into the future sure looks like 30 years into the past instead of a distinctly urban post apocalyptic world the viewer's eyes are offended with a 70's mod squad of egg shaped furniture wood paneled walls earth tones and lots of plants was a dystopia not a utopia br br speaking of that's the only city on earth according to the movie the show is clear that there are two cities and monica which used to be one in the movie the are just hollywood storybook freedom fighters they also have as much technology as the which is not the case from the show br br the only possible conclusion is that the real writer for this movie was a high school kid and that he wrote it the day before it was due to the studio execs and he's never seen an entire aeon flux all the way through the overwhelming amount of inconsistency with the cartoon is baffling beyond using certain names like aeon flux trevor and the movie is nothing like the show br br the actual bulk of the movie seems to try to blend the colorful plots of soy lent green blade runner logan's run and tomb raider which came out a dull brown mess
<START> i've seen this movie twice on international film festival tiff the movie is in competition and i really hope that esteban will get one of the awards at least the best image award br br as a silent cinema fan i'm interested in contemporary movies that quote or recreate the language of the yester year cinema the previous reviewer emphasized the quotes from fritz lang and fr w murnau as i see it the movie references directly lang's metropolis and the allegorical character of his plots but i didn't see murnau in it there's a more obvious melies homage though the moon with a here cigar smoking human face and the paper made painted mountains and city landscapes i enjoyed the film mostly for its visuals and in the meantime i found very interesting the story on and the creative means of communication used by the inhabitants of the voiceless city from this perspective this movie is an unique reflexion on the of the silent cinema because in the films of the silent period one can hardly find stories with mute characters in this case can be questioned whether the story on the stolen voices was the motivation for the silent film form or there's an intention to play upon the of the silent films another example of this kind of reflexion i found in guy maddin's careful where the inhabitants of a mountain village have restrictions in using their voices i intend to write a paper on it if you know movies related to this topic please let me know br br i highly recommend esteban film to every moviegoer one of the critics called it the jewel of the festival br br ps winners were announced and the film won the award for best cinematography
<START> an eko centric episode the explores the aftermath of the tragic events that rocked the castaways in the previous one as the main characters john locke sawyer kate and hurley come to terms with the incident in the hatch locke and eko set out to find out where henry took off to as it turns out eko is on a mission of his own trying to figure out the symbol which locke had drawn on his sketch we see flashes of life in sydney as a priest who comes in contact with his brother through a stranger we also witness the tragedy that struck the hatch boil down to a room temperature as michael continues to remain a mystery br br an excellent lost episode with many interesting turns
<START> i haven't seen this fine movie in 50 years but i'm entering a comment on it anyway br br while jack webb's movie was no doubt intended purely as an entertainment showing marine basic training at parris island in realistic terms as a tough character building exercise it was said the military was afraid the movie would discourage it did not work out that way the movie showed that entering the marines was a greater challenge than most young people ever realized and guess what being offered a king sized challenge was exactly what many guys wanted i personally knew lots of guys that joined the marines shortly after seeing the di lines at recruitment centers were suddenly so long the marines had more recruits than they could handle br br so it goes america will always have youth seeking to make themselves into the best while the slackers and born losers limp along to nowhere br br what we don't have in 2007 is any films that inspire patriotism devotion to duty of any kind positive values et cetera what we do have is films that inspire the airhead ed to be airheads the beer drinkers to beer other negative values exhibit 1 is that the airhead teen travesty and beer guzzling epic superbad is now 81 in the all time great films list values mean values
<START> as i sit here i find myself laughing at certain moments in this film go and see this film br br if you've ever been clubbing go and see this film br br if you've ever wanted to go clubbing go and see this film br br my bet is that the film was borne from an idea whilst out clubbing and this is the product of that one in a million chance that someone remembered it in the morning and had the application to follow it through br br in summary then go and see this film br br
<START> movies like this give independent films a bad name this simply a boring compilation of with no structure whatsoever i wouldn't be surprised if the screenwriter was completely stoned if you want to see a good stoner comedy watch half baked it's no award winner but at least it made me laugh the film was obviously made on a micro budget every scene either takes place in someone's house someone's apartment or some outdoor location if the writing was good and the dialogue was interesting i would've ignored the film's budget like in the case of edward burns' films but obviously that's not the case this time around br br i quote robert deniro from a bronx tale when i say there's nothing in the world worse than wasted talent everybody in the cast is talented luke wilson alicia witt brittany murphy jeremy sisto all talented performers and they all have been in much better movies the actors give it their all but they couldn't go too far with such a lame script the only scene i found interesting was jack black's cameo where he sings a song about being in the woods and of course there was the brief strip club scene at the beginning which i also found appealing br br the characters are uninteresting and the story barely exists many movies are awful but at least you understand their intentions what was intention the world will never know br br my score 2 out of 10
<START> when dirty dancing was on tv in the middle of last year i was out so i didn't get to see it my mum swore that i had seen it and that she had it on tape somewhere anyway getting to the point she couldn't find her video so for christmas i bought her the dvd well she hasn't had a look in it sat around for a while then one night i decided to take it upstairs to watch and i fell in love with it this is a great film with lots of lovely scenes i love the plot and enjoyed every moment of it it's definitely not for everyone but if you love a love story then you will want to watch dirty dancing again and again dirty dancing the way love is meant to be
