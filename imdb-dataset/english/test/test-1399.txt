<START> sure there's stuff here that the and elmore leonard have done before but so what if you want entertaining lusty and smart judas kiss is near perfect offended by tongue in cheek porn don't get it talk about getting your sex and violence out of the way straight up keeps your investors happy that's independent filmmaking 101 as for the brits making a bundle i highly doubt it this flick is clearly a labor of love and the budget probably not half of mr tarantino's salary maybe guys don't like it as much as women i thought it rocked go coco
<START> the people at abc forgot to do their biographical research so many scenes were just plain wrong the actor playing was very rigid there was no personality there it is very very obvious that this movie was on the bottom of the programming totem poll the move is so low budget the script is terrible conversations like you must follow the rules no the people are starving lame plus the movie was jumping like crazy from event to event in order to fit it into the two hours terrible a better use of your time would be to watch a pbs documentary on also cbs put out a miniseries on that is better than abc by far was a wonderful man and it bothers me to think that my grandkids might get a hold of this abc movie and think that that is what he was really like
<START> charlie george norm wendt and rhonda just say julie brown are a pair of cheerful murderous aliens who become stranded on earth and stumble upon a tiny western town they become deputy sheriffs and dish out a deadly form of justice to speeders murderers and others while getting on the bad side of some of locals led by wayne grace meanwhile their sexy alien daughter anastasia arrives in a skimpy shiny outfit with her black human husband christopher m brown to find them and tv reporters and government agents turn up to fill up time br br from what i can tell this is a deliberate attempt to cover every possible genre comedy sci fi horror western in one movie and what a stupid unfunny mess it is despite energetic acting from the two stars the script is downright atrocious
<START> this showed up on a dvd a buddy of mine bought for me they had it listed as the savage guns which was an entirely different movie obviously the folks who packaged the dvd never bothered to look at what they were burning on the disk br br anyway this movie is about as bad as they come the sound track is a combination tv batman early james bond spaghetti western lots of galloping around to this music it appears that the guy has to gallop between scenes to burn up some time and give the sound track folks something to do br br english is dubbed over the italian and it really shows i wish it had been just a little bit worse and then it would have had some of the campy feel of the ed wood films as it is it is just plain awful
<START> being a long time steve martin fan it hurt to see him in a movie with such a cliched script the screenwriter must have just rented some videos and taken a piece here and a piece there it certainly is about the least imaginative movie i've seen in a long time i knew exactly what was going to happen in each scene as soon as it began the african american stereotypes and slave references are pretty offensive as well but the thing that was the worst for me was to see martin in a movie without a trace of wit he probably is one of the most intelligent actors and here he totally sold out to a totally dumbed down script he must be behind in his alimony to be in such a lame effort
<START> i like the most of the full moon pictures so i ordered this movie from the usa because in germany you can't get it anywhere i thought it would be so nice and amusing like the subspecies or puppetmaster series because they were full of atmosphere br br i was glad when the movie finally arrived br br but after watching this cheesy movie i was very disappointed the actors i think you can't even say actors are boring and untalented the story was a poor performance and even the set and the monster were very cheap and lousy br br i hope no one ever make a sequel or remake of this terrible movie
<START> hands of the ripper br br aspect ratio 1 85 1 br br sound format mono br br an edwardian doctor eric porter uses freudian analysis on a young girl angharad rees who turns out to be the daughter of jack the ripper and just as deadly br br unlikely hammer horror in which a respectable society figure takes charge of a beautiful young waif without attracting so much as a whiff of scandal even when she takes to murdering all and sundry with a variety of lethal implements broken mirrors hat pins etc l w davidson's screenplay wanders aimlessly from one murder to another sacrificing the material's inherent subtext porter's obvious attraction to rees in favor of commercial melodrama and the tone remains subdued throughout some of the gore scenes are surprisingly vivid even for hammer and these were clipped from the original us release despite an r rating from the mpaa though the complete version is now available on home video porter and rees give excellent performances and the climax in st paul's cathedral is a definite highlight but the rest of the film is strangely hollow and unaffecting directed by peter
<START> laughable would be a good term to describe this movie but since this movie deserves nothing good said of it i'll use the term god awful instead br br centering around the adventures of a bunch of eco warriors investigating the nefarious doings of the military on a semi tropical island the lack of a budget rapidly becomes apparent michael pare a real actor but only in the sense that pinocchio was a real boy leads the bunch of fools through a series of monster chase and gobble hapless victim scenes there is some vague attempt at pseudo science to explain the presence of the giant reptiles but it convinces the viewer about as well as the acting does br br as if this doesn't insult the viewer enough the movie also features what i'll call guns of never ending ammunition i never saw mickey parrot or his female side kick change clips once during the entire film yet i can positively report they cap off at least 40 rounds each in any scene where they are required to fire their weapon forty rounds may not seem like that many but we are talking standard handguns here i figure 15 round clip tops and remember they never change clips nor even appear to carry any extra ammo br br it's dumb assery like this which movies to the eternal fires of celluloid hell and rightly so the third rate cgi does little to help matters and the acting is best laughed at else you'll start crying why scifi channel repeatedly churns out this mush is anyone's guess br br my advice give this one a wide berth a very wide berth
<START> in my analysis of trois blanc i wrote that its tone is much lighter than the tone of trois bleu i think it's the same with this film this time it's not because of a tragic comedy element but much more because of the main character valentine although her boyfriend is living abroad and is ridiculously jealous she manages her life with lightness and optimism it seems to me that she might be kieslowski's image for a carefree youth the opposite seems to be the judge who is very pessimistic a grumpy old man who experiences big loneliness in my view valentine and the judge are pretty similar to each other the judge is just much older and has experienced many more disappointments they share a different kind of naivety and they both discover that they can learn much from the other one finally i would like to stress irÃ¨ne jacob's performance she rounds off the run of amazing female contributions to the three colours trilogy
<START> not much to say other than plenty of wire fu and supposed monks ego tripping about kung fu and caricature japanese plotting to take over china all of this would not be so bad if not for the utterly fake japanese sword fighting if you watched a samurai movie or two you can tell that the japanese fighting in the movie is simply the same kung fu really circus stunt men doing the same things except with a japanese sword however there are a couple of fun moments such as when a japanese woman ninja tears off her clothes in mid flight to disarm a monk and captures him with a fishing net storywise there seems to be a bit of schizophrenia as far as whether the japanese should be shown as completely despicable or if there could be exceptions the japanese protagonist is shown as largely honourable but not beyond unwarranted cruelty such as when he murders a sedated monk so that he may have his duel quite disappointing with a very silly ending does not for a moment evoke even the semblance of the idea of an epic battle
<START> this program was shown in an early morning time slot on space a cable sci fi station i am amazed that anyone would pay for this or broadcast it it is incredibly amateurish br br the entire show is a sequence of short monologues or scenes performed on a set that looks like a closet with a bunch of circuit boards taped to the wall there is very little continuity between scenes and no plot a typical scene revolves around some lame joke or special effect and is only a minute or so long the dialog makes little sense and the special effects look like photoshop filters the actors are all adults but i have literally seen high school plays with better writing and sets this program is an embarrassment br br perhaps each scene would work as an a filler between shows instead of commercials stringing all the scenes together makes the limitations of the material extremely obvious
<START> i loved it it was really gruesome and disgusting i thought that the tearing of the human flesh was thoroughly the way that it was depicting the human crucifix about jesus christ was really interesting the tearing about limbs and jaws was awesome brutally gruesome don't watch this if you have a weak heart you wouldn't be able to stand it
<START> the acting made you feel like you were watching a kindergarten play the story is full of holes and gaps and skips around so you have no idea as to what just happened half the scenes are pointless there is not an inkling of character development the score soundtrack consists of about three songs one in particular is played in about 70 of the scenes i'm glad i only rented the movie yet i still feel cheated avoid this movie at all costs unless you want to see some decent actors give horrible performances it seems like the bulk of the budget was spent on putting a few name brand actors in this less than bad film this movie is equivalent to visiting a strip club it tries to get you excited and interested but just as you think something is going to happen your thrown into some unrelated scene and left trying to figure out how you arrived there
<START> this version did not move me as deeply as the later hollywood version starring anthony hopkins and debra winger while it was beautifully filmed and superbly acted the bbc version was more packed with dialog that imparted information which i found fascinating it gave me a detailed glimpse of the intellectual theological and moral considerations that motivated c s lewis it was therefore more interesting and stimulating than the hollywood version but not nearly as visually stunning or viscerally affecting still while i did not leave a heaping mound of sodden kleenex in the theater i did use one and at frequent intervals i enjoyed this film every bit as much as the hollywood version and was grateful for the increased understanding i gained
<START> over the years some of them most enjoyable films have been about dysfunctional families br br bonjour monsieur is such a film br br this is an isreali film about a moroccan jewish family br br this could be about any family in any culture we all know or would want to know people like those in this comic gem br br this 2003 delight was written directed by let us hope he a long career br br the movie is seen through the eyes of the 16 year old son who seems to be concerned with everyone in the family brilliantly played by cohen he was 18 when he made the movie br br he has been in a few since i know i will hunt them up hopefully this young man will become an international star br br the entire cast is magnificent i do hope i see them again br br i loved every person in the cast to some degree i think all who see this will agree br br it has been nominated for many international awards has won 8 it deserved every one br br now being a film in a language besides english it had a very limited run in the usa which i feel is regrettable br br rent this film you will be glad you did br br ratings 1 2 out of 4 95 points out of 100 imdb 9 out of 10 br br note since the story is not new this is as high a rating it can get
