<START> let's not kid ourselves this atrocity is not plan nine or cat women it is bad period the performances vary from drama school theatrics marla english to a care less' walk through tom conway the photography even in a good print is so murky it is occasionally hard to see what is happening the real problem however is the aimless pointless nearly plot less story and the leaden direction at a brisk 77 minutes it still feels endless br br the screenplay is especially inept there are two story lines that only intersect at the very end of the picture tom conway is trying to create a super race using voodoo and modern science although there is little science in evidence which he can control telepathically he is keeping his wife prisoner for no discernible reason meanwhile a couple of petty crooks and a white hunter type guide are trying to find the village in which he is working in the expectation of gold and jewels when they finally arrive tom conway decides that one of them the woman is the perfect subject for his experiments she is turned into a monster kills conway natch and then reverts to normal she sees a gold statue half drowned in a boiling pool tries to retrieve it and falls in the water and apparently drowns the white hunter rescues the wife in the final shot we see the supposedly drowned woman emerge as the monster again threatening a sequel now that really is a scary thought br br the aip producer samuel z arkoff in a lecture included on the dvd prides himself on spotting the teenage niche market and satisfying it with ingenious low budget movies however it is difficult to see how anyone could think this rancid concoction would satisfy any sort of audience what appeal do they think it could possibly have the monster appears so rarely that it could hardly be called a horror film the jungle action is tepid and tedious there are no teenagers in it and no characters that teenagers could be expected to identify with br br the producers exposed 77 minutes of film but they didn't make a movie this is a con trick and arkoff should be ashamed of his association with it
<START> you have to start worrying when you see that michael madsen is leading the cast of any movie i wont go through the list of shame that is his movie career br br i watched 45 minutes and still was not sure what really was going on the movie consisted of a love hate relationship between madsen and argento which basically was madsen insulting her threatening violence and generally treating her like dirt she on the other hand loves him then shes doesn't then she does the she desires him then she loves him again whats wrong with you woman br br the script is awful lousy soundtrack and pointless aggressive and crude sexuality which i believe was added to entice some viewers as the movie has little else to offer i would have given the movie a 1 but it just about managed a 2 with a little excitement in the last 20 minutes it did actually answer one question in the final few minutes but i am not going to share that i will make you suffer for the full movie like i did
<START> when my mum went down to the video store to rent a film for the night my sister and i learned a lesson to always company my mum to the video store in fact the only reason why she chose it was because colin firth was in it and she cough thinks he's a good actor br br it starts off with some beautiful of africa and then goes down and down and down and down after this film i was very surprised that colin firth got as far as he did since this pointless film could destroy any actors career br br the story is about a divorced women who's son is trying to her to a man called matthew fields who he met whilst impressing his friends because of his large house br br the divorce does not like matthew at all and is going out with the local vicar who does not like her son john and the same with him br br i am sorry if you disagree with me and i hope i haven't offended you but to all the people who haven't seen this film i leave you with one word of warning don't watch this film
<START> a group of bandits rob a train of the gold shipment it is carrying in their escape the bandits split up the one thief who knows where the gold is hidden is killed before he is able to talk three men have a different part of the clue that will lead to the gold can the banker the bandit and the bounty hunter work together to locate the missing loot or will they kill each other first the plot is an obvious take off of leone's the good the bad and the ugly various scenes in the movie are also lifted from other films by leone corbucci and more but to me it's done in a way that doesn't show disrespect to the original work instead any gun can play lovingly parodies some of the biggest films in spaghetti western history the opening scene of three men riding into town and the final face off between the three main stars are a wonderful homage to the sws that came before br br castellari adds a lot of nice touches of his own the reflection in the spilled wine the stranger's entrance with the vivid red background and the playful way the gold is discovered in the end although highly unbelievable many of the fight scenes are well staged and directed two fight scenes in particular the market fight and the bath house fight are very nicely done he is also unafraid to try different things with his camera tight close ups overhead shots and shots around corners are all common in any gun can play br br another plus is the cast that castellari had to work with george hilton is always good in these movies gilbert roland is literally playing gilbert roland and sw newcomer edd byrnes holds his own with the two sw veterans the supporting cast features among others sw regular gerard br br any gun can play should not be taken too seriously nice touches of humor can be found throughout the movie if this is possible with an sw it's more of a feel good movie very reminiscent of some of the terence hill bud spencer films
<START> this film is an embarrassment nothing works on any level the direction screenplay acting and editing work together to repel your eyes from the screen everything is inappropriate and incoherent at first you can sit there with and groan wince and laugh at it but very shortly the whole effort of watching just becomes too ponderous
<START> the plot of this film is not complicated a very attractive young girl goes to europe in search of the reasons for her older sister's suicide ten years earlier there she meets up with her sister's former boyfriend and together they travel to all the places her sister went and gradually the reasons become clear br br but what makes this film so special and soar above the limited plot are the beautiful portrayals of the characters although the older sister's boyfriend is a drop out hippie he has noble ideals moral standards and incredible strengths and although the older sister who we see in flashbacks shares these ideals she doesn't have a sense of limitation or balance of how much is too much and although the younger girl is fiercely loyal to her sister's memory she gradually finds the strength to face the fact that her sister was only a normal girl after all br br the most special moment in the film is when the young girl and the sister's boyfriend finally stop fighting their attraction to each other i can't recall ever seeing more beautiful touching romantic tenderness in lovemaking in a film br br in all these ways this is a truly beautiful film a film to be treasured and to be seen again and again 9 out of 10
<START> all ambiguity about michael myers has withered away thanks to this series' chronic habit of about with its continuity and pulling relatives out of nowhere this entry introduces the potty angle that he's not just a psycho killer but is actually controlled by which appear as a star constellation every halloween and a cult is using him to erm well this film is far from coherent and i lost track of the plot after a while the movie credibility so profusely it doesn't have a drop left by the end why does michael put one victim's clothes in a washing machine why does an otherwise empty corridor have a deadly spike sticking out of the wall does getting electrocuted really make your head explode and so on it's left to donald pleasence in his penultimate film role to produce some wonderful little moments from the pile of dreadful dialogue he's given
<START> i could not believe it this film was a total wast of time out of my life the title is appropriate love didn't beat the hell out of me this film did i kept watching and watching and waiting and waiting and hoping for something anything to happen and nothing ever happened nothing terrence howard couldn't even save this lame piece of work called a film it was dark and confused and i didn't get who killed the girlfriend in the end the tone and pacing of the film was supposed to be building to a dramatic climactic ending this only served to confuse the audience because the movie just plodded along going no where if you want pure torture watch this film
<START> quite good don't expect anything high culture the acting is bad the storyline fails but it is still a fairly nice movie to watch why because it's dark a little bit stupid like unpredictable and just entertaining and fun to watch do not expect anything like i said just see it for yourself and you know what i mean br br it is a movie without a plot or memorable acting but there are enough scenes that will make you laugh cry or at least make you feel compelled to watch it to the end br br this is all i wanted to say br br 7 10
<START> i just spent about 1 5 hours waiting for the movie to begin it didn't the story is vague and uninteresting the speed in the movie is absent and the voiceover irritating i can't understand why movies like this one are even distributed
<START> while the twilight zone was a wonderful show it was also very uneven with some great episodes some lousy ones and many in between don't believe the die hard fans there were some stinkers and this was definitely one of them br br in a plot that is obviously meant to be an attack on fidel castro a near lookalike peter falk in lots of makeup and a beard obtains a magic mirror that allows him to realize who all his enemies are so he can them while i do believe that castro is a thug and dictator and tens of thousands of refugees and political prisoners will attest to this it's amazing how this sort of preachy episode actually makes audiences laugh at the american efforts to marginalize the creep and actually makes castro seem okay think about it serling and company wanted to hurt castro but instead only seemed to be obvious preachy and silly in the process br br it's indeed bad almost laughably bad when seen today
<START> i have seen so many bad reviews on de los that i felt compelled to stand for it or at least i'll try first of all of course that it looks dated it was made in the seventies with very low budget but that's part of it's charm i like contemporary films but also dig the old ones for what they worth i'm not the one to feel the urge to only see or like movies with modern treatments and effects besides almost every movie buff likes old fashioned motion pictures who doesn't like films from el santo or plan 9 from outer space no matter it's overall quality in the aspect of pace is just a tool for covering again it's low cost and i think the constant dialogs are in order of a better character and situations development sure alive has better fx but i won't despise the old one just because of that and i don't feel quite attracted to english speakers in an event involving people from uruguay and for me that gives a plus to de los it's like even if from the seventies and based on a true event too would have a better remake now due to the advance of technology but i think i would stick to that one based on the emotions that offers regardless it's production date br br all of this is based in the impact that had on me because the first time i saw it was on tv and nowadays i don't think it has lost some of it's primal force of course it's been a long time and i've seen tons of better movies in every aspect of cinema but that doesn't diminish it's true value it's not a bad film and i place it above alive without hesitation just give it a break
<START> i honestly thought this movie was going to be cheesy even though i've liked alvin and the chipmunks for a long time i was was very wrong it was great it has been the best movie i have seen since october in my opinion it's the movie everyone should see this holiday season enchanted i thought anyway was awful the golden compass was alright but the ending was pretty crappy to his dark materials fans and i am legend well i haven't seen that yet or national treasures 2 but it looks alright br br i'm not about to give anything away but this movie is great for anyone especially kids
<START> this production was quite well done for a television original providing a very appropriate original slant on swift's work to make the frame story work well the film begins with gulliver arriving home everyone who has read the book knows that will happen anyway the frame story of the book has gulliver's crazed confusion in sections for example he is horrified that he will trample little people in england because he has just returned from a land of giants but the film has all the book sections within one long voyage when gulliver narrates his travels the editing cuts from england to the travel are very effective i confess i found them intrusive and irritating at first then they became natural by the end moreover they have become a welcome addition to the story as he tells his adventures to a larger and larger audience more and more people listen to his compelling fantasy even though they doubt its truth for example his hatred of filthy yahoos and admiration of pure logic from the fourth section comes across well when he is defending his own sanity the intercuts between events in england and similar events or scenes in the tale is very effective for example ripping the cloth from the table to suggest the motion of towing a group of ships is inspired filming the addition of gulliver's family threatened by the lecherous doctor works well swift only hints at this by having the long suffering wife protest against further voyages it becomes a natural part of this story the casting and acting were competent throughout some roles were exemplary omar mad magician is superb o'toole's little emperor is doddering delightfully toward senility many specific complaints made by other writers here strike me as simple personal preference which after all is what we are about here i read the abridged version several times a year from fourth grade on i may have escaped the complete version until a college class but have read it a few times since and i had to start it again as i began reading about this film while the danson version is superior to any previous film it does not replace the book however i think it will bring many readers to the book if you have not read the book enjoy this movie then go to the source if you appreciate the satire in it find swift's a modest proposal and his letters both are satires attacking the wretched treatment of ireland and the irish during swift's time the protests cheap inflated copper coins being dumped on ireland these were wood's light weight not good for face value in paying taxes and official debts the outcry from swift's satire caused the coins to be sent to another mistreated british territory the american colonies the universal satire in swift's book and this movie just poke fun they cannot change human nature give torturous experiences a chance i think you will find them thought provoking and entertaining
<START> carole lombard stars in this transition period film this film is a typical example of a very early talkie first practical sound film was the jazz singer 1927 overall the acting in this film tends to be extremely broad and very melodramatic br br the viewer may easily note that the actors are still acting for a silent film and this combined with the overly pronounced overly earnest dialog it seems most likely a diction elocution drama coach was employed extensively to teach the silent actors to speak lines creates some rather comical scenes which were not at all intended to be comical br br carole lombard's later great acting ability is all but unrecognizable underneath all the broad gestures melodrama and eager earnestness br br mainly interesting as an historical curiosity of the period and for it's completely unintended comedy camp value
