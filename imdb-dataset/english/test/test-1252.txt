<START> for the first fifteen minutes the story of naked fame is interesting two late thirties male porn stars in a seemingly healthy relationship decide to leave the porn industry and try for the world of singing and acting the two very buff and preening men are colton ford and blake harper with the aid of kevin and marc berkely colton makes a dance track that is then marketed in new york with the hopes that colton ford will become an instant star a unique disco singer touting his background as a porn star for pr br br the remainder of the film is grumbling and in fighting and commentary by porn producer chichi larue and the film slowly sinks into repetition and doldrums not a bad idea for a film if there were a bit more depth revealed in each character's drive to move away form a successful career though one greatly influenced by the youth both characters have lost into an alternative one it is just that a one note song wears thin quickly grady harp november 05
<START> after the return of horror movies come on scream isn't scary i didn't have very high hopes for this low budget three story horror movie but i was positively surprised man this is scary the first 2 stories are simply brilliant the first one about a new wed couple driving in a dark forest with their rv when they bump into a fierce watch the movie the second story is about a disgusting man who is obsessed with a little girl who is home alone for one night i know it doesn't sound any special but it is scary i promise you the last story isn't scary but atleast not bad it's about a biker and a ghosthouse in fact the stories are based on real urban legends i guess kevin williamson can steal ideas too rent this movie it is good i'd say i'ts the scariest three short story horror movie ever made
<START> this version of the lost horizon is actually not a bad film at all i think the problem is people like to pick on musicals especially those made in the 70s i saw the film upon its original release in 1973 i was ten and really enjoyed it the music especially burt bacharach has always been a favorite the story is fun the acting is good and technically it's excellent sure there are one or two rather silly dance numbers but hey you can't win 'em all i have this film on video and watch it every so often and i enjoy it each and every time
<START> this movie is such a piece of unbelievable crap first let me talk about the pros sandra bullock in a black bathing suit br br now the rest of the story which is all pretty much bad we have said computer programmer angela bennett who's online profile is angel how witty i bet the directors cheered over that one for an hour who basically checks other company's software for errors glitches etc so we start with her ordering pizza on the internet and then putting on a fireplace on her monitor extreme computer skills shown thus far this is after she finds some virus on a macintosh program which crashes the whole system after hitting the escape key this is apparently a huge problem yet the virus created to do such could be done in about 1 minute with a simple batch file br br any event we move on she gets this call from some other bloke that works at the same company and this fool says to go click this symbol which apparently opens up some secret internet gateway to a bunch of unprotected 'top secret' data woohoo angela saves this crap on a disc and now the people that created this loophole are out to get her this of course is only after she hooks up with one of the bad guys only before he tries to kill her before she jumps in the ocean off his boat before she winds up in a random hospital br br problem 1 you can't create a loophole on the internet to gain access to a bunch of top secret fbi data where the hell did this come from since when can a group of hackers control the basic flow of the internet even in 95 problem 2 angela would need proper identification before a hospital or clinic would release her she could not just pack her things and go br br then these or whatever change angela's id so she can't get help from anyone and conveniently enough all her id is gone so she returns home and a cat and mouse chase goes on and on and on br br apparently all police and fbi people are stupid and don't believe her so then she has to utilize a bunch of tactics to enter into the building where she works where the person who is now filling in for her is and get back to her old computer she starts talking to some other random bloke and finds out who is behind everything through some bs ip address that the director knows the audience is too stupid enough to believe br br then she runs to some center to mail all this information to the fbi she apparently has to use a mainframe to email stuff to the fbi but then the same fool that tried to kill her before throwing her in the water catches her and easily hacks into the fbi again wtf but remember that cool virus well somehow she luckily gets that and even though the virus only worked on software it now works on the entire system too it brings down the whole mainframe which has all the fake information because the mainframe was just sitting in the middle of some convention what the hell is this crap anyway the now uber virus works and angela the real one now runs away and later kills the evil dude with a fire extinguisher he of course has a gun runs up to her so he's like 2 feet away and then decides to aim classic hollywood br br all in all this movie is so full of bs and crap anyone who doesn't know a lot about computers will be wildly fooled into thinking this crap is possible but not one thing is accurate concerning computers or the net and i honestly doubt i'd see a virus for mac and a mainframe computer cough lmao
<START> a slick production which holds the interest from the very first scene where max is choosing a ring in a shop much of what follows reminds us of shakespeare's a mid summer night's dream in which and fall in love with each other's girl friends here max and lucien both prone to love at first sight get mixed up with lisa and alice and alice complicates things when she calls herself lisa on top of the merry mix up max is inclined to get involved in incidents which bring back memories of two years ago and because max has a lot of these dreamy episodes we are subjected to one flashback after another too many in my opinion because at first viewing of the film i wasn't quite sure if i was in the present or the past there is much running down corridors through doorways into elevators etc i accept all that in a fast paced film but do we have to have so many people colliding with each other after four collisions it ceases to have any impact if you'll excuse the pun high marks for art design the apartment itself is really beautiful with its tasteful decor but i do ask myself how a couple of young women can afford such luxury in paris saving a person intent on suicide from jumping out of a window is always exciting and it is in this film too when max almost exits at the same time however a kiss or two soon makes him feel better if you can manage to find your way through all the flashbacks you'll finally find yourself at the airport where max's devoted sister gives him a most affectionate kiss it can be said it is she who resolves the complications of love like puck in a mid summer night's dream
<START> geoffrey wright the director of romper transplants shakespeare's macbeth in the contemporary criminal underworld of melbourne australia the result is a semi awful piece of cinema sam is macbeth and walks around looking very self conscious and bored victoria hill who wrote the script with wright is lady macbeth and she's neither awful nor good lachy hulme who plays is the only actor in the cast who exudes any kind of authority the rest including gary sweet are wasted and misdirected shot on hd by the late will gibson the movie's visuals lack character everything is too clean and too deliberately lit wright's direction is uninspired in the extreme and the action sequences are confusing and inept marketed erroneously as the most violent australia movie ever the film is violent at times and reasonably bloody but it fails to deliver a single impactful moment slow moving and terribly pretentious this umpteenth silver screen version of the classic play is the personification of wrong headed
<START> ok so this is about 30 minutes of gore with no story whatsoever there is no spoken dialogue no subtitles not even any real characters you see three people in the entire movie that are alive and two are just there for very little reason the main guy has no emotion and just mutilates corpses for no apparent reason that is the entire movie i love to see very gory movies especially since in america real gore just isn't very common in modern movies so yeah the gore effects were pretty cool but it just isn't really disturbing why does everyone think it's so disturbing there are no characters at all there are just 3 living people and 3 corpses no one has any personality or back story you see three corpses being hacked apart and you can't really identify with it unless you just identify with death itself and how this could very well happen despite the guy losing his job and going to jail very shortly after to be disturbing the viewer has to care and to care they have to identify with the victim for example in a good horror movie you should really care about the main character here it's just a guy and a corpse it's as deep as a puddle made from only a single rain drop they never give you any reason to care about anyone in the movie all it is a guy hacking up a few bodies then he has sex with a body now with the sex scene here is an odd thing about it he makes sure to wear gloves but doesn't use a condom so he couldn't care less about catching some weird std from having sex with a corpse but as long as his hands don't get messy there is no problem now that is really logical i don't really dislike the movie i liked that it was very gory but when it ends there is no reason to watch it again no reason to even care and it just isn't a very compelling movie i say if you can find it for under 10 dollars then you might as well get it but if it's more than that it just isn't worth it
<START> in this approximately 34 second thomas edison produced short we see annabelle moore performing the fuller choreographed serpentine dance in two different fantastical flowing robes br br moore was one of the bigger stars of the late victorian era she was featured in a number of edison company shorts including this one which was among the first kinetoscope films shown in london in 1894 br br fuller had actually patented the serpentine dance which moore performs here in robes as well as entire frames that are frequently hand tinted in the film presaging one of the more common symbolic devices of the silent era supposedly the moore films were popular enough to have to be frequently redone including the version available to us now may be a later version remake moore became even more popular when it was rumored that she would appear naked at a private party at a restaurant in new york city she later went on to star as the gibson bathing girl in the ziegfeld follies in 1907 she appeared there until 1912 br br the short is notable for its framing of motion which especially during the second half becomes almost abstract it somewhat resembles a morris louis painting even though this is almost 60 years before louis' relevant work br br you should be able to find this short on dvd on a number of different anthologies of early films
<START> as stated by others this is a ludicrously horrible movie not a film it is not bad in a funny way just painful to try to endure don't waste your time br br erika eleniak is pretty hot but there is one scene where she is in a bathtub and you can see the wrap covering her breasts under the bubbles also she's getting fat br br the fight scenes are so bad as to be unwatchable if you know or care anything about martial arts or even decent choreography and the editing effects are abysmal br br there is no payoff it goes nowhere and sucks getting there
<START> has aged really well still thrilling and suspenseful today certainly one of hitch's best movies beautifully shot with a great premise for suspense sex appeal provided by beautiful ruth roman because of the great premise you feel like you have to watch it to the end if you find yourself losing faith in hitch and doubting his title as the master of suspense i recommend this nice little movie as an antidote 5 out of 5
<START> 2 is harmless aimless and plot less i would add brainless to that list but the movie within a movie gimmick although not done very well helps it to narrowly escape that label the scenery has changed from the california beaches to the greek islands and the only returning cast members from the first film are pickard the bearded guy and roberta collins who at one point falls into a mud pit bringing back memories of her classic catfight with pam grier in the big doll house all the other actors are new but apparently brad is supposed to be playing the same character scotty as grant cramer did in this sequel lacks the energy and appeal of the first movie and doesn't come close to matching it in the hotness department either of course brenda bakke and are both very pretty but the teal roberts cindy silver kristi somers team is unbeatable 2 is not the worst of its kind by any means but if you only want to see one of these movies the original is the one to get 1 2
<START> i had no expectations never saw previews for and enjoyed the characters contemporary music and sharp dancing in this light hearted movie even though 98 of the dialog is english great thing for me i wish the dvd had subtitles to help with some of the quick moments when the character's accent can be difficult to understand i wouldn't judge this movie against bollywood films but just on it's own merits as fun entertainment a musical people movie br br i'm hooked on ali as an actress and her interviews in the bonus material indicate she is a nice person i have since watched this movie several times gets better each time
<START> like most sports movies it's not surprising that people who know something about the sport can find flaws in it as a soccer referee i have yet to see a movie or tv show get it right when depicting a match forever has good actors but i found sean astin to be a bit young to be an administrator in a juvenile jail i was very thankful that the plot did not involve the lead character turning his fellow inmates into rugby players and taking on flagstaff as well as highland which gets to credulity a police squad car just happens to pull up at precisely the time the flagstaff baddies are hazing rick penning even though rugby is not a sanctioned high school sport nationally the team is a school based club sport much like rodeo that said i find it hard to believe that high school officials would allow students to play with open wounds that just isn't done in this day of aids and hepatitis i don't care what the tradition and macho image is despite that it was a cool movie in that teens were expected to act like adults and sometimes actually did sadly far too many coaches are like or worse
<START> when i watch this movie i too get excited when seen bed scenes of miss world she has beautiful and charming body when cute lady do bed scenes and show her fully nude body i think male have hard to resist i think its time for cute girls like hrishita bhatt also do nude scenes at least no one wants to c nude body of ugly women like seema biswas to c in bandit queen i concur with what b has said the movie is portrayed in a way which appears to be a kind of vilification on the original content emotions aren't conveyed properly i guess a couple of not so good performances also contributed to its mediocrity in my view tabu would have been a much better choice for such a role instead of aishwarya rai in some of her scenes she looks a bit lusty which is not ultimately what the movie should have portrayed i also noticed a bit of over acting in some of her scenes i'm a bitter critic of aishwarya rai can't help it sorry for that was a good movie by and i saw choker bali after seeing raincoat i was not at all impressed
<START> i watched a long time ago i lied if i'd tell that i remember it in detail what i remember most vividly is the irritation it provoked me and the feeling of a total waste of precious money and time not only my time and money invested in watching the movie but also the director's br br supposedly is a critic of presenting us i'm an argentinian too as little people who take credit for and even boast about petty ridiculous victories and think we're the best thing that god who is also an argentinian created i'm not going to argue that it's probably a true statement about a quite big part of the population the part i despise by the way and even if this weren't true that's not my point the worst sin committed was to express such a statement about its own director br br the continuous impression i received was that the director was too busy trying to impress us for sneaking a camera inside the islands to worry about making a good even a mediocre movie many of the takes made with a hidden camera are pointless the director chooses to show off with a silly edition of old war takes and his own ones and there's no plot at all br br moreover this movie proudly presents a dogme certificate before the opening titles only to disrespect its principles afterwards for example by including the director in the credits another sign of his pride br br i found the movie offensive not as an argentinian but as a watcher i felt underestimated is simply one of the worst movies i've ever seen
