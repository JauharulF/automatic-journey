<START> i remember watching this mini series the first time in 1984 with a growing sense of anger and indignation having read the comments on this title i must agree with those from the people in greece this was produced to coincide with the 1984 los angeles olympic games and to me it seemed like nothing more than an exercise in jingoistic flag waving american nationalism in which the american athletes are glorified at everyone else's expense some other nationalities would have every right to feel deeply insulted at the way they were portrayed in this series it may however help to explain the way in which many american spectators behaved at the 1984 los angeles olympics and the tv coverage which seemed only interested in events that americans were likely to win
<START> my wife and i find this movie to be a wonderful pick me up when we need to have a good laugh the conflict between some characters and the between others make this a sure fire comedy relief i am so looking forward to this movie coming on dvd so i can replace my well watched vhs
<START> i have to start out by saying that the actresses and actor did a fine job for what they worked with the problem in dark reality is you had a poor director who tried so hard to be innovative and evocative he ended up trashing up the film from start to finish you can tell the film reel quality itself is low but the poor lightning and shaky camera only hurt it further by obscuring what is going on the sound is muffled and often times not understandable i'm sure huston the director would argue this was to induce a state of panic in the audience but he had more than ample material in which to do it having to result to camera and lighting the way he did was a sign of over the top syndrome br br the story is good a basic sadistic female kidnapper story that avoids clichÃ© by keeping the girl's in a state of despair the whole time for good reason billy bob from silence of the lambs treated his victims better than the biggest problem with the story is that dead people constantly harass the lead character in her mind and by the second time they showed up i was fast forwarding as this was attempting to destroy the only decent part of the film br br in the end the way the director pieced it together showing random blurry things and constant barely viewable scenes not because of horror because of the lighting angles and camera ultimately destroyed this film huston was obviously trying too hard and if anything it resembled a bad film school project if you want to see a decent story then it's all right but be warned the film quality is enough for most to turn it off
<START> this is an excellent b film horror movie that borders between horror and comedy it is about a genetically mutilated scorpion in outer space can it get more unreal it is a hybrid between alien and chain saw massacre the movie was shot in stockholm with a mixed cast of americans and swedes that interact beautifully director martin does a great job finding the comical highlights in this script and gets a few good laughs out of the audience the movie was shot with little or no money and it is inspiring to see what can be done with limited resources stinger has all qualities of a b film horror movie it is comical and scary at the same time and the cast and crew are dedicated to their cause it is great to see that movies like this can still be made i would recommend seeing it if you like this type of films
<START> i can name only a few movies that i have seen which were this bad this movie has terrible everything the dialog is corny and clichÃ©' the acting is poor for the most part with a few exceptions the cinematography is nothing to cheer about and the plot is silly a fat woman stalks a suburban family because her daughter didn't make the soccer team this is so bad it's funny to watch if you can catch this on lifetime i'd recommend it highly as a comedy as for being a serious movie i'm afraid i'll have to rate this a 2 br br don't watch this film if you are a serious movie fan and looking for an interesting and challenging storyline or good acting there is none to be found br br edit hmmm i think a group of people who work for lifetime must have written some phony reviews and voted all the negative ones down don't believe them this is a really crappy movie
<START> the creative team that brought us police squad and the naked gun derived from it said in interview that they were told by their network contact that the show would be canceled after their delivery of the first episode basically the show was never given any chance typical hollywood the contact apparently told the team that the problem with the show was that for the show to be funny the viewer would actually need to watch it most shows are presented on tv with the understanding that the viewer needed to get up and miss a few minutes while getting food or going to the toilet etc br br the humor of the show is extremely dry it uses no laugh track and the universe the characters inhabit is one in which anything can happen regardless of logic as long as it was totally unbelievable so for instance in one episode a surgeon has to bribe an informant on the street in order to get a tip on heart surgery br br those familiar with the naked gun films should be warned that there are a number of interesting between the show and the films in the films nielsen developed a particular take approach that is eyes widened when confronted with the unexpected this doesn't happen in the show where nielsen's is the center around which the rest of the universe revolves nothing is unexpected to him also there are no romances in the show and no parodies of mtv finally the show takes certain risks that the films avoid in the first episode to re enact the crime has a squad of homicide detectives shoot each other from a number of different angles the hard way this is actually a risky bit of humor since we need to accept that it's perfectly normal for policemen to kill each other while investigating a crime for no other reason than experimentation this sort of thing rarely happens in the films br br taken individually each of the episodes is actually funnier than any one of the naked gun films since they are both more compact more happens in a shorter time frame yet more leisurely paced there's not the rush for a punch line as sometimes happens in the films there are some inconsistencies that happen in the films primarily 2 and 3 that never occur in the show's shorter time frame br br of course there's no doubt that naked gun the first film is one of the great comedies of theatrical cinema and if you watch the tv show episode after episode in one sitting the dry quality of the humor might wear away one's tolerance br br none the less it would be useful to have a dvd of this and watch an episode a day for a few weeks if laughter has as some claim medicinal value watching this show is good for one's health
<START> the dresser is a small but absolutely wonderful film brilliantly acted by albert finney and tom how in the world this tiny film attracted enough attention to garner five major academy award nominations back in 1983 is a mystery to me but it's nice to know the academy can be guilty of a display of good taste every once in a while of course they gave the award that year to terms of endearment after all they don't want to be accused of showing too much taste br br albert finney is a drunken shakespearean actor in a production of king lear tom is the man who works double time behind the scenes to keep this actor in front of the it's both hilarious and piteous to see character showering finney's with attention and affection only to see his efforts utterly unappreciated and dismissed even up to the very bitter end finney and work wonders together and though finney gets the showiest moments he does get to recite shakespeare after all is the heart and soul of the film br br grade a
<START> was it really necessary to include embarrassing footage of non participants in a documentary and why all the silly dog scenes and then repetition of all the same silly dog scenes this film starts with a great promise to expose the international politics and the business of wine it got off to a great start and included all the right characters but the production is a mess points started and developed most of the way then never finished or left with dangling ends very poor and disorienting camera work and editing they should have used subtitles for the british mumbler from christie's br br too much fluff and not enough fact for a documentary br br probably honored at cannes because of the us bashing although in my opinion there was too little of it br br we left at the 2 00 hour mark i have no idea how much longer it ran on
<START> blade is probably one of the best vampire action movies ever made it has it all action horror blood this movie is for action fans it's either you like it a lot either you hate it and if you hate it it means you don't like action or vampires movies wesley snipes takes his role seriously and he his the perfect guy for blade
<START> i was thrilled by the fresh pun intended synopsis of this film and looking forward to watch it the first few shots introduce some of the characters as well as the main location where the stories take place the gardening the movie looks fantastic colorful yet simple magical yet genuine unfortunately it only takes a few minutes to figure out where the movie will go we quickly figure out this will be a manipulative sappy tale illustrating a bunch of jaded people set in their ways confronted by nice victimized refugees and that it will have a happy ending where the jaded people realize the error of their ways and accept these people br br the characters particularly the prejudiced ones are very comic in nature the story focuses mainly on two refugee families one of them is headed by a single mom played atrociously by henry i am saddened to say that any emotion that might have been felt toward her struggles were defused by what was memorably bad acting br br the other story is much more interesting and focuses on a father and his two children all are scarred by their journey to this country by way of containers where the wife and mother died but it is the husband who suffers the most benedict wong gives a mind blowing performance here at first his emotions are very subdued but as the story develops he subtly makes us aware of the inner struggles of his character br br unfortunately the rest of the movie is just extremely boring there were so many possibilities with this movie there are several characters to keep track of many of which might have potential but none of it is realized even worse despite this movie being very much not hollywoodian some of the main plot threads are solved cheaply in a hollywood b grade way example br br character a likes character b character b rejects his advances no problem let's have character c declare her love for character a so we can all have a happy ending yawn br br i liked very much the plot thread of the asian family that was well done unfortunately the whole business the communal aspect of it the dynamic involving a large cast are all under exploited br br what you're left with is a movie that has very little worth
<START> probably this is the best film of clint eastwood here action is minimal but with plenty of good acting a yankee soldier eastwood is wounded and taken by the female pupils and teachers of a school in the south where he is hidden and taken care shortly after his recovery all ladies wanted to have fun with him and some of them succeeded including the director of the school geraldine page erotic scenes are coming until the ladies discovered that their macho was shared by several of them so they became angry and poisoned him in a farewell dinner geraldine page although somewhat old was able to play a very suggestive role as the director of the school a woman with more failures than happiness in her life
<START> i remembered this awful movie i bought at camelot music store in the summer of 1989 when i was visiting my grandparents it was a time when i had just discovered movies like re animator from beyond the return of the living dead and dawn of the dead i was ready for all the horror gore genre had to offer or so i thought i was only about 12 years old at the time so i really don't remember it all that well i remember a psycho running around with a corkscrew killing people and a couple of cops i think who were riding in a car that wasn't actually moving but being rocked side to side to look like it was true cinemagic i also remember it being the worst film i had ever seen up to that point and i promptly threw it in the garbage br br something tonight made me think of that movie i can't believe i actually remembered the name so i jumped on imdb to see if it was listed to my surprise it was and a full other 5 people have seen it amazing even though i remember hating the film at the time i sort of wish i had kept it hidden away somewhere because i'd love to check it out again for a laugh it would probably make a good drinking game movie anyway i'm glad i'm part of the elite few that's seen this little treasure i would love to pick it up somewhere for a couple of bucks but beware this is not a recommendation it is awful it's just for nostalgia
<START> the knowledge is a typical british comedy for the period to someone who is not familiar of the process of becoming a london cabby the film is bound to seem very average with a few laughs from a few old faces br br the knowledge however comes into its own for knowledge boys like myself or their wife's who know what these poor individuals are going through and find yourself comparing incidents of your own to that of the characters
<START> as a film buff i obviously had read all the excruciating reviews and funny sarcastic comments about this film my favourite being woody allen's quip if i had my life to live over again i wouldn't change anything except for seeing the musical remake of lost horizon therefore i've never been able to watch it without smirking at the choreography set songs etc just recently i came across a widescreen dvd and watched it for the first time in years along with a friend who had never heard of the film's reputation he really enjoyed it and after trying to block out all the negative prejudices i obviously had about the film so did i there is nothing especially bad about lost horizon and it is far more enjoyable and watchable than many other early 1970's movies it isn't even especially camp the lyrics to some of the songs are rather repetitive and simplistic but this isn't really apparent when hearing them for the first time or having the flaws pointed out in advance so you are ready to scoff at them as for all the reviewers who claimed the cast cannot sing in tune this criticism falls apart since liv olivia hussey and peter finch were dubbed brilliantly too as the vocals match their speaking voices perfectly and sally kellerman has a really lovely and totally unique singing style vocally duet with olivia hussey on the things i will not miss is excellent special mention should be made of the legendary hollywood star charles boyer's brilliant performance as the high lama and his comments about mankind destroying itself are chillingly apt to today's fractured world i wouldn't claim for a second that lost horizon is a masterpiece the things i wouldn't miss about it are the uninspired choreography and bobby van's question me an answer number which could easily have been cut but if you haven't even seen lost horizon or haven't seen it for some time try watching without that oh boy let's have a laugh at this pile of junk attitude and you will be surprised at how enjoyable it actually is
<START> anyone who enjoys the lynchian weirdness of twin peaks or any fan of hp lovecraft who knows that the most frightening things are the familiar things will really enjoy this film don't watch it as a horror film in the traditional western sense but more like a grimm's fairy tale it is gory and definitely for 16 but once you start watching it you too will find yourself drawn into the vortex definitely one of those movies that hangs with you for a few days after watching i'll never look at my snails the same way again
