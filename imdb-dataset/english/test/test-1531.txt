<START> this isn't the video nasty night of the demon as there are more than one actually there is only one but it multiplies br br after it inhabits suzanne scream queen linnea quigley she passes it on to goth girl angela amelia kinkade through a nice long kiss br br next we see linnea showing us her in the bathroom she shows a lot more as jay lance fenton thinks he is in for some fun br br soon everything literally goes to hell as bodies drop one by one and are possessed judy cathy and max philip are the last two trying to escape max isn't much help leaving it to judy to figure a way out br br the makeup was absolutely fantastic and the only thing that kept this from being even better was the extremely long build up to the action br br the old man harold who appears in the beginning will be back and get his just desserts br br linnea quigley may be the scream queen but cathy definitely showed the greatest lungs in this film
<START> danny is beyond sorry br br he keeps making the same mistakes and is no longer interesting to watch at first i could feel for him as an addict myself my heart went out to him at the beginning and somewhere along the line he went over the line it is almost as if he is continuing this behavior to keep the show going and at the same time is seriously risking his life and the welfare of his family especially his children it is difficult even to have pity for the poor boy i think he needs to watch this show maybe then he might have a chance a saving this marriage i can't understand how gretchen stays with him and i keep wondering how much is just for show and how much is love danny get a life a new one that is and don't get me started on dr gary what is with him and his face his skin looks like it's stretched to the max besides that looks don't mean a thing yet he seems not to be particularly impartial i think he too is keeping this going for his own monetary gain and often not in the best interests of either gretchen or danny these people are few confused and each remind me of a dog chasing its tail sad very sad c'mon pull yourselves together
<START> it's exactly what i expected from it relaxing humorous and entertaining the acting couple was awesome as well as the scene selection i personally recommend this it's kind of the movie that can be seen by whole family at the same time without anyone feeling uncomfortable or getting bored this cute movie will make you smile and laugh too and the action scenes are tasty classics of modern american comedy and very well done
<START> while the writing was terrible the acting was atrocious the only thing that saved this turd was the breast count but that wasn't enough to make me watch this again all said and done i'm actually dumber from watching this movie this was a new low for troma lloyd kaufman starting the movie wearing a garbage bag and making fart noises should have made me realize what i was getting into this was by far one of the worst ever put out by the troma team the best place to show this movie would be to invalids sense they can't get up to change the channel to conclude this is not a swift recommendation to watch this movie just for the breasts
<START> inglorious basterds is a dark and violent comic fantasy gloriously so built on the framework of the dirty dozen inglorious basterds ditches the elongated training sequences of the dirty dozen to plunge into the action right away in the process tarantino fixes one of the dirty major flaws by giving the bad guys screen time to remind us just how bad the nazis were the nazis with the most screen time end up becoming the most completely human characters in the film which ironically makes them even worse monsters br br bu ditching the training sequences tarantino is also able to give us a picture of the entire war showing us not only british american and german soldiers but also giving us glimpses into the world of french and german civilians both collaborators and resistance br br it goes without saying that any tarantino film is going to have fantastic dialogue but when tarantino made the decision to have the french characters speak french and the germans speak german beyond adding a level of authenticity tarantino also somehow ensured that his dialogue in french was as sharp and funny and clever as his english dialogue br br case in point during the opening sequence the nazi jew hunter ss colonel hans landa christian waltz is interrogating french dairy farmer perrier denis landa suspects that is hiding a family of jews while subtly pressuring landa asks for a glass of milk after gulping it down landa compliments on his daughters and his cows Ã  famille et Ã  je dis bravo the thing of it is in french means cow but it is also a vulgar name for the vagina if reprimanded for this vulgar pun landa could quite convincingly claim not to understand french well enough to have meant it that way but landa does mean it that way and he means it as a threat and understands his meaning all too well br br that is a really subtle piece of acting and word play that many audiences would never catch or at least they might understand the subtext without knowing the exact nature of the threat the film is rich with that kind of detail all of the french and english dialogue is chosen with that same attention to detail and while i can't swear to the german i would suspect that it shows a similar level of craft br br inglorious basterds opens with the phrase once upon a time in nazi occupied france personally this reminds me of the opening of every asterix book and movie another comic fantasy in a war torn occupied france like asterix inglorious basterds is howlingly funny in places although the film also turns darkly serious br br in its more serious moments inglorious basterds reminds us that the first casualties of war are compassion and the ability to relax as in almost every elongated sequence of the film tarantino finds a new way to build cruel tension to almost unbearable levels br br tarantino also reminds us that film is dangerous even and that its power deserves respect br br if you can see this film as i did in a packed theatre filled with knowledgeable fans who get every joke that you will see this masterful film the way that it was meant to be seen if you are not that lucky all that you will see is a great great film that delivers a darkly funny punch
<START> this is just my all time favorite movie nothing special it's just so incredibly detailed makes me cry just thinking about it geronimo bill is the nicest guy i can imagine money is not important bamboo spears are important you don't need money to get what you need if you need something it will just come to you if people would realize that the world would be a much better place whatever you do don't do it for the money
<START> the film is really good it doesn't use violence or sex etc to sell itself like other films but instead just uses a really decent plot based on the original by michael caine and some great actors to make a fun action packed film which i thoroughly enjoyed one thing which made me enjoy this film even more was that it had some actors which i really like such as edward norton who i last saw in 26th hour which i enjoyed also jason statham transporter enjoyed that also and seth green who i think is great his role as shawn fanning's roommate dubbed the is hilarious and his hacking skills play a great part in the main heist which centres around a large traffic jam in la the car chases are really decent and the high tech equipment used by the thieves is interesting and very impressive i haven't seen the original so i can't really compare the too but i liked this a lot and would highly recommend this film to everyone it isn't a film where you need to like that specific genre it will suit everyone i felt good after this movie it had a really good ending and was overall really fun to watch i give it 8 10 go watch it
<START> the frustrating thing about a movie like this with a true potential for greatness is that it almost enjoys being heavy handed we speak of allegory of metaphor but the truth is there's no getting around the fact that there is absolutely no plot or real character br br at a certain point we most know who the people are even if we never understand where they are going the sheer pretentiousness wore me down every time i tried to grasp a truth in this film br br call it beautiful great and awesome i just call it cheating all style and no substance sure it's a matter of taste but i would never take a confusing modernist pastiche of symbols and splashes over the spiritual clarity of jean cocteau or renoir but if it works for you i'm all for it art is a personal thing i guess
<START> there is nothing wrong with showing an old man falling in love with a young girl lolita did it american beauty did it br br but they did it subtly they did not make it so apparent from the start that the director is gearing them up to make them fall in love with each other not as naturally as two people would age no bar but forcing them to be around each other as if they were supposed to fall in love br br all in all there should have been chemistry it would have solved the biggest problem people with reservations against the subject would also have been engrossed and perhaps convinced it would have become the perfect love story no matter the br br i found it difficult to believe character at times what i found more difficult to understand is why vijay a photographer and an artist who seems serious would have had an interest in a girl so frivolous unless he himself has some hidden in himself which did not come out at all br br there is a lot of use of dutch angles or angles in which the frame is tilted it is generally used to show something unnatural or something that might lead to something that is not right so rgv is himself calling the relationship unnatural br br the camera angles background score editing and even the juxtaposition of shots and emphasises and their relationship is the indian audience so dumb that we need to be told something in 10 different ways for us to understand especially when the two of them were dancing together it was apparent what was happening what was the need of slowing the scene down with dramatic background music i feel the subject was very well chosen but verma should not have made the film with the fact in mind constantly that this is a controversial subject if it is then handle it delicately why don't you
<START> in black snake moan writer director craig brewer is so obsessed with heavy symbolism that part of me felt like dismissing the entire film as pretentious a sweltering southern parable with some oh so risky subject matter the movie also contains a heavy spiritual subtext where religion is being hauled into the picture again this is integrated without subtlety after the darker opening scenes the film increasingly its edge until the entire production comes off with the artificial quality of a stage play and i'll admit the last 15 minutes go way too far into happy ending territory for my liking and that's not to mention the archival footage of musician son house ruminating on love and death and heavily foreshadowing things to come of course yet in a strange way these are also qualities of black snake moan the tale of aging lazarus samuel l jackson recently dumped by his wife for his brother no less who comes across near death nympho rae christina ricci easily giving the hottest portrayal of trailer trash on celluloid ever nursing the girl back to health he chains her to his radiator to overcome her demons and hopefully redeem his own fallen self while there is a definite prurient appeal in watching ricci fall out of her skimpy outfits her performance is risky and mature not a trace of wednesday addams to be found and she easily holds her own with jackson who personifies the blues in his portrait of a flawed god fearing man while heavy handed the scene where lazarus sings rae a song in the midst of a lightning storm blackout is compelling as is a scene inside a jumping blues club that makes you wish you were there the setting is strong and a case can be made for the literal symbolism the chain the radiator the strange blurry man who haunts libido being a deliberate outgrowth of superstition and spirituality and it is the conviction with which this spirituality is played that lends black snake moan much of its strength the committed performances of jackson and ricci make this a film that goes from wrenching to uplifting with well seamless grace while justin timberlake's jealous lover is a plot contrivance i could have done without neither he nor the sledgehammer subtlety can keep this from being a fascinatingly meditative film
<START> great actors good filming a potentially interesting plot and what should have been good dialog nothing else is good about this movie perhaps the writer or director thought they could make a thought provoking film out of annoying characters who are as deep as a cup of coffee br br within 10 minutes i disliked the portrayal of kim by feeney so much that it became a distraction while kim is supposed to be an unsympathetic character i am not sure i was supposed to want to commit acts of physical violence upon her the first of many bizarre things that happen is that wes david strathairn goes from i am missing 50 00 to she stole 50 in about 3 seconds it was quite implausible since she kim never had access to his wallet nor was she a master pickpocket there simply was no rational reason to suspect her most people have lost misplaced money and assume just that we lost it same goes for kim later all very unrealistic behavior in what is supposed to be i think a look at real people the character of kim was at minimum suffering from a bipolar disorder wes had huge inadequacy issues nancy was just boring and matt was delusional particularly about music i actually turned this off about 2 3 of the way through however to write a valid comment i forced myself to turn it back on hoping that something would come together in this movie no sorry it was still bad make it a point to miss this one
<START> as a person who knows the filmed ship and some other ships too i cannot see the movie as a movie only as a movie is has some great wonderful shots of the ship most of them done on an existing vessel apart of the ones in the disaster scenes of course and a certain room under deck but regarding the story and dialogs i only can call it big crap nothing of that would happen like this on a real sailing vessel no wonder the film had bad impact on the existing ship if i didn't know better i wasn't tempted to do a sailing voyage for sure definitely for europeans i recommend to switch off once the ship ran after that the over emotional very american part begins which i couldn't bear the pics are really really great no wonder in a ridley scott film but if you can avoid listening to the text it will become much better
<START> i think that mario van peebles movie posse is a very important film it is an excellent entry point film to a side of history many are not aware of this is a story of early black settlers cow boys and infantrymen returning from the spanish american war with a cache of gold the main character peebles is haunted by memories of his murdered father the racism applied to the new black settlers and infantryman is explored in this film with excellent casting including melvin van peebles father billy zane stephen baldwin and a wonderful performance by big daddy kane br br one senses that peeples strived to use as many notable black and some not so notable smile actors as possible perhaps too many some notable persons issac hayes pamela grier are only scene in cameo others briefly such as tone loc the sentiment and efforts of peebles efforts to expose these actors will be understood by some the large cast a feat for any director work well and do a good job of telling the story in the classic revenge and fight vs justice western br br most noteworthy was the wonderful narrative role of veteran actor woody strode from once upon a time in the west who's own life was a barrier breaker within the context of a previous era not yet completed faded from memory no other actor could have done this role better read the mini bio on woody strode here as a primer http imdb com name bio br br the film does a good job of balancing action with a bit of sardonic humour the dialog was excellent if a bit contemporary and as others have mentioned the profanity was not accurate to that period the sex scene was a bit much not really needed there are some historical inaccuracies such as the seeming electronic branding of the cattle etc but posse is a good effort to hopefully open the door for more historical and creative works reflective of other untold stories and events the actual photos of real cowboys at the end credits was very nice touch
<START> as is the case with many films of this ilk my non catholicism got in the way of my understanding it the church has this mass of rules which have been put together over centuries we have a short time to learn them and have to accept them at face value then throw in some bad guys getting revenge for a long distant act against them working under these rules and attempting to circumvent them and you have this book and movie i found myself thinking that's pretty cool why did they do that there's this casual thing in the robert langdon character where no matter what the issue he seems to always make the right first move i suppose it's like watching csi where they solve incredibly complex cases in a matter of days they know the lay of the land in this film there is so much land and so little time to really understand everything that is going on but if you create robert langdon you need to set him to work that's ok because heroic nerds like him have been saving the day forever i thought the film was fun i thought the da vinci code was fun too interesting and not as bad as people seemed to think this is a marvel to look at and never stops for a second
<START> once in a while it is good to see a really bad film like this just so you know how decent an actor keanu reeves is by comparison the premise of this story is good teenagers go out on a boat meteor lands in water aliens kill teenagers what's not to love about that if you're into scream thrillers but i should have known something was up when i read it was only 75 minutes long i thought i hate judging movies by how long they are who says a movie has to be 90 minutes but once i took the dvd home from i was shocked at the awful production quality acting directing of this completely amateurish piece of garbage the only reason i watched it to the end was because i don't have cable tv and i already paid four bucks for it however there was one ray of light the actor who played chris is actually decent and far outclasses this dreck first of all the special effects were cheap and unconvincing then the aliens the costumes seemed interesting rubber suits but since most of the film takes place in the dark you don't really get to see them and hardly any of the actors were convincing enough to suspend disbelief finally i must say that the dvd jacket was made with much higher production standards than the film itself which felt like a rip off so beware of that when you rent other dvds save your 4 and buy a pint of beer
