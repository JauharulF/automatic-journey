<START> this film is replete with sentimentality unprofessional flying that makes a pilot like me cringe and irrelevant material why introduce rachel for instance she has absolutely nothing to do with the film except to permit her follow me truck to run wild and crash into fence that has got to be one of the stupider sequences among many in the film another is at the end when the aircraft was it a b 26 or an a 26 both are used in the film is left with props whirling and no in place that serves the plot of course but to reveal it would be to commit a dreaded spoiler as it is the aircraft would have begun to taxi sans control the ending again avoiding spoilers involves much too much talk as at the beginning of sound films in the 30s with all those final speeches here dreyfuss just babbles on and on the ending also incorporates other radical violations of aircraft protocol and a couple of improbabilities impossibilities that i won't describe what a dull and disjointed effort
<START> the play macbeth was written by william shakespeare between the years of and ever since then many other versions of the play have been produced including remakes completed in 1948 1971 and 2006 akira kurosawa even directed a japanese version of macbeth in 1957 entitled the play starts out with king duncan hearing about the success of two of his generals macbeth and banquo in a recent battle with the irish and the norwegians after a quick promotion from duncan macbeth instantly gets an uncanny feeling for lust greed and power and does everything in his power to gain access to the crown even if it includes murder br br geoffrey wright tried creating his own version of the famous play in 2006 by setting it in the modern melbourne underworld just imagine a lowly macbeth slaying hundreds of soldiers with an ak 47 and rapping his own rendition of low at the same time just kidding about the latter but one thing he does do is utter the traditional shakespeare and he keeps it going throughout the whole movie that's right shakespeare meets ghetto it's all you could ever hope for notÂ the newest macbeth is rough and violent enough to match up with any other modern day action film but it lacks decent acting the right lingo and a good technique of camera work br br the modernized movie starts out with macbeth sam who works as a hit man drug dealer for duncan gary sweet a drug lord from melbourne australia after being promoted to the of by duncan as the three witches had predicted aspiration starts to take over macbeth as he sets his eyes on the throne after promoting macbeth duncan invites himself over to macbeth's house for a night of drugs and alcohol before the festivities begin lady macbeth victoria hall talks macbeth into killing duncan to take power over the throne after the bodyguards are drunk and everyone's asleep macbeth sneaks into duncan's room and stabs him to death after his murder macbeth takes all of duncan's belongings including hid title and crown just as soon as he thinks he's got what he wanted he finds out that it will take more than bribery and running away to solve his problems br br one major flaw of the movie was the acting a once seemingly flamboyant and empowered macbeth suddenly turns into a sissy and he looks like a sad puppy dog throughout the entire film i don't really know if this was or wright's fault but either way one of the two should have realized macbeth was a king not a knot on a log that took everything his wife had to say literally like i said earlier macbeth should have been rude arrogant and spiteful but when his character changes over to a drug lord he changes personalities as well i suppose on the other hand lady macbeth really knew how to nip it in the bud when it came to recognizing and personifying her character she didn't seem quite as spiteful as she was in the play or the 1971 version but she reminds macbeth that compared to murder anything else he could possibly do wouldn't quite match up br br another thing i found distasteful was all the nudity this fluke had to be wright's fault the witches didn't do a bit of acting unless you call parading around in your birthday suit acting at one point in the film i started to wonder if i was watching macbeth or unique positions vol 2 br br don't get me wrong when i say i find the shakespearean dialogue out of place it's spoken flawlessly but when it's spoken by an australian gangster it's just really weird when macbeth starts to kill people off he first lets them know by talking to them in ye olde english macbeth contains plenty of action blood gore and nudity to last anyone a lifetime you forget all the positive facts though when you start to think to yourself okay what in the heck did he just say in that last sentence at some points in the movie i don't even think the actors themselves knew what they were saying the new age ness of the movie could have easily been pulled off it weren't for the and the br br the camera work was just simply fair for me one thing i could not stand was the constant pacing back and forth between characters the camera technique used gave off that blair witch sort of vibe and made me throw up a little in my mouth matt reeves tried to attempt the same concept of camera work in clover field but it just doesn't work it makes me want to get out of my chair and look around for the little barf bags they have conveniently planted on every seat in the airplanes br br looking back on it all the macbeth holds one positive plenty of action other than that the movie contains nothing more than uninspired acting correct english usage and stomach turning camera work the soundtrack holds one or two of the same songs but each song is edited or remixed differently for every scene there is never a variation of interesting or captivating media used from now on out directors should leave the dangerous drug underworld to al pacino and robert deniro future renditions of macbeth should be created just as shakespeare intended the play to be 400 years ago i would recommend using medieval clothing ye olde english swords and shields and a soundtrack prepared by enya but either way the modern macbeth makes you yearn for some good folk music a camp fire and a
<START> without a doubt the biggest waste of film of the year this movie is poorly structured sadistic cruel and filled with unlikable characters on top of that and maybe the worst crime it's uninteresting and vastly predictable as soon as bill pullman's character on the photo changing the word from evidence to violence i had the entire plot figured out there are no surprises and there is no compelling reason to watch this trash the only redeeming feature for me is that i saw this thing for free on my hdnet cable and didn't waste any money i would truly be angry if i had paid to see it in a theatre br br anyone that labels this thing a thriller really needs to get out more an awful awful film in every way that matters
<START> this movie has become an iconic stand in for what is great about america br br fame is famous for its music and performances there are several standout actors singers and dancers including irene cara paul anne meara and the superb gene anthony ray br br the plot is not the movie it follows an interesting format but it all really ends in a kind of mush br br where parker succeeds is in pushing this movie into periodic overdrive with the extremely poignant sometimes beautiful and outright campy music score performances br br the film's climax is a song dance fest of musicians dancers score by christopher gore a wonderment to behold br br an interesting note about the magnificent and superbly talented anne meara sometimes talent must reside in the genes ms meara is married to one jerry stiller and is the mother of ben stiller
<START> this is clearly a french film it is about young group of idealist revolutionary anarchistic people it moves very slowly long takes long closeups a minute or more devoted to an attempt to light a pipe full of hash opium a long take on how a group a car and burns it it is a black and white film the subtitles were white so about a third of the time they were unreadable why do they do this i walked out after about an hour and three quarters when it became clear that this picture was going nowhere slow i was not the first to walk out it was the first time i walked out of a picture in my long lifetime well maybe the second

<START> this would probably be a good film to see provided you've already seen every other film in existence and thoroughly explored the of yourself and those around you god this movie was unbelievably insipid with some of the worst or is it nonexistent writing ever captured on film there is no saving grace to this film even the animatronics are kind of lame and it's just a complete waste of time and money br br run fast it's beyond horrible br br
<START> maybe it's just a personal affection for this screen version of the novel or a fondness for things egyptian i grew up loving to visit the mummies in boston's museum of fine arts but i think maltin is a tad tough on this rather good film the production values are great regarding color and cinematography and it appears some effort went into historical authenticity much of it from the novel i'm sure purdom is admittedly a bit stiff in the lead role but one can accept this as part of character victor mature is well victor mature peter ustinov is a delight to watch in this type of role which he always did so well and so wittily bella performance as is classically camp and i find even michael rather dry portrayal of to have its own appeal br br the historical oddity of monotheism a brief detour in ancient theological history is interesting as is himself and well worth reading about the religious wars portrayed here have a basis in fact br br an interesting footnote regarding whose birth name was she was a polish who producer darryl zanuck and his wife violet took under their wing i believe they may even have adopted her her screen name is formed from and his wife's first names she continued her acting career in france but never achieved great success and after a rather unhappy life died at her own hand in 1971 br br altogether this is an interesting film and enjoyable to watch for the visual values alone american movie classics shows this occasionally in letterbox which is essential to capturing the scope and sweep of the story
<START> just finished with zombie bloodbath part one on the amazing zombie bloodbath trilogy dvd from camp motion pictures zombie bloodbath 2 rage of the undead is next now this one left me a bit puzzled due to a few plot holes and some confusing twists here and there but it is a better film on many levels director todd sheets truly shows a major leap in style and talent between the two films again this is not for people who want gloss and hollywood style horror films this is for people who like their zombies bloody raw and grainy the story as far as i could tell was basically about two robbers who in 1945 try and steal from an elderly couple only to find that the couple are members of a cult one guy is simply killed and the other the one in charge is basically turned into a scarecrow and crucified and they stand him in the nearby field still alive but dying cut to present day and a van full of college kids break down near a farmhouse at the same time a group of convicts escape from a nearby jail both groups end up at the same house the house was the one the elderly coupled used to live in and when one of the convicts knocks down the scarecrow and takes it's jacket it causes the scarecrow to wake up and he in turn brings the cult members back from the dead wow and this is all in the first half hour there is another plot also going on in town where a couple of serial killer types have taken some workers at a deli hostage this actually works though as the people trapped in the house finally escape and end up in the same deli most of the twists work out pretty good but it is obvious that the film was just too complex in some spots for it's own good it all ends in a huge showdown with the remaining heroes finding a delivery truck or something full of flesh eating bacteria vials of course they throw it at the undead and cause some major melting and a few heads to explode and then we get an odd thought provoking ending first let me say that while it was not always easy to follow i still had a major good time with this movie it was fun and the acting was pretty darn good for a low budget effort it was obvious that todd sheets was truly trying to bring more to the table than a typical zombie film and in that regard he has succeeded it had better special effects than the first film great pacing and some cool music and visuals plus there is a true show stopper of a shot from inside a mouth as a knife is jammed through it care was taken here and it shows the weakness lies in the scripting and in a few of the performances again i recommend listening to the commentary track it was even better than the first one and i learned a lot like finding out that some of the scenes were shot on super 8 film for effect and that the film came back ruined from the lab and they could nit use it and they had already been editing the film by the time they got the film back so some of the confusion is from a few scenes not being in the film also i learned that todd sheets truly has a passion and love for making horror movies it shows the film is a good example of no budget cinema that could have used one more rewrite but still shines with more style than most dv films i see not quite as fun as the first film though a better movie technically i really admire sheets as one of the true and trailblazers in the area of dv cinema and this one is a great addition to the cheapo zombie genre
<START> on march 17 1974 a man is found dead in the toilets at manhattan's penn station although well known he cannot be identified because he scratched out the personal information in his passport and his body lays unclaimed at the city's morgue for three days it turned out to be the body of what many consider one of the greatest american architects of the twentieth century louis i kahn he died at the age of 73 on his way from india where one of his greatest projects the institute for management in was nearing completion br br one of the most influential post war american architects louis kahn's architectural legacy includes the house of parliament in bangladesh the art museum in forth worth the yale art gallery the salk institute in california and a kind of mobile music boat designed to give concerts in harbours in various cities around the world br br while celebrated as an architect very little was known about his private life in addition to his wife esther and their daughter sue ann kahn was survived by two mistresses harriet and anne and their two children all three families lived within miles of each other in suburban philadelphia but their paths never crossed until the funeral his son nathaniel the director of this film was only 11 years old at the time and had only a few memories of his father's weekly visits at harriet patterson mother in philadelphia twenty five years later he sets out on a journey to confront his father by visiting kahn's buildings talking to relatives and colleagues and visiting the places that played a role in louis kahn's life br br one of the most moving confrontations is when nathaniel asks his mother a landscape architect and mistress of louis kahn why she kept up with playing second fiddle to his wife and never confronted him with this tears shed her eyes but she has no regrets it was worth it it's such an intensely sad moment she's obviously shattered treated as an outcast at his funeral which she was forbidden to attend it's almost as if she led a substitute life it all feels strangely unreal another interview with edward bacon kahn's architectural nemesis who was in charge of the rebuilding of his native philadelpia in the fifties and sixties almost suffers a stroke on the spot when he is reminded of kahn's unsavoury ideas about architecture his son nathaniel listens uncomfortably when a very senior bacon literally screams with anger whenever kahn's name comes up the final scene is reserved for kahn's grandest creation the capitol in bangladesh it took 23 years to complete a vast and extraordinary building of which the are extremely proud it's one of the very few national symbols with stature in this impoverished nation some of the interviews with the locals brought tears in my eyes especially when they find out they are talking to god forbid the own son br br the film is as much a personal journey as it is an account of kahn's grand architectural legacy and is above all about the fruition of the film itself and film making in general perhaps louis i kahn faltered as a father but these shortcomings in his personal life make for an all the more interesting portrait in this extraordinary film br br camera obscura 9 10
<START> this film is a joy to watch and should do well on dvd and video i suppose you really have to be irish to appreciate the some of the subtlties such as accent colloquialisms and the dress sense of some of the characters but let me assure you that when dylan moran impersonates the impersonation is quite familiar to most people from dublin because we have many characters in our fine city that look act and talk like that the sheer simple comedy employed and michael genius acting alone are worth the money but on top of this the plot is great the script is fantastic and the dialogue fast moving and catchy a perfect light entertainment movie without the madcap humour of jim carrey
<START> i am one of those people that respect every film maker as having achieved each film i watch i usually respect although i admit i select carefully and for what it is not any more this is truly one of the worst scripts i have seen produced as a film so much so i felt compelled to warn others off it the dialogue was truly unbelievable the main was about the last person i would be interested in finding out more about a scene were an old school friend it like it is' made me laugh only because it was a pathetic attempt to reveal the subtext of an already concluded plot the direction is glib at best and at worst film making by numbers to compare this film to the atmospheric majesty of a film like five easy pieces is a travesty
<START> the movie was excellent save for some of the scenes with esposito i enjoyed how it brought together every detective on the series and wrapped up some plotlines that were never resolved during the series thanks to nbc it was great to see pembleton and bayliss together at their most human and most basic persons braugher and secor did a great job but as usual will get overlooked it hurt to see that this was the end of homicide memories tapes and reruns on courttv just aren't the same as watching it come on every friday but the movie did its job and did it very well presenting a great depiction of life after al retired and the family relationship that existed between the unit i enjoyed this a lot
<START> business vs personal conviction profit vs art br br as with any documentary that pits the capitalist large corporations against the small producer the viewer will invariably have to take the side of one or the other based on their own believes this is as much a documentary of the new standardized way of doing things that globalization is bringing us against the old traditional ways where character and the art of making things matters almost more than getting the product sold br br if you have to remember one thing from this movie it is that the masses can no longer decide by themselves they just follow the taste of one or a couple of critics that tend to and standardize taste in the same way as used to do for the fast bite something parker himself admits to in the film against a backdrop of a burger king sign it is all about image against content as another interviewee says that is the easy way the standardized way easier than taking the time for a nice wine to mature easier than to forge your own taste by trying and trying yet over again controlled branded taste is easier br br there is a glitter of hope when even some of our cousins across the ocean agree that a few people are levelling the taste of to maximize the profits and ensure a maximum of it gets sold to the grey masses individuality and difference is sacrificed for the extra buck it is nice to see that not everything or everyone is giving in to standardization even across the ocean br br as in many other areas of today's world dominance of a few and reduced freedom of choice impacts us all let everyone make up their mind and decide what to go for too much standardization kills the mind and taste difference brings innovation and healthy competition and will allow for choice and not just vacuum packed more of the same standardization sells easily and a lot and brings everyone to the same level the lower one br br on this i am going to open up a nice bottle and wish you a
<START> i truly enjoyed this film it's rare to find a star who can pull off the physical aspects of any sports dance themed film convincingly and do a first rate acting job as well in this film you find two stars who rise to the occasion both women deliver warm touching and at times humorous performances the film also touched on a number of topics from racial issues to sexual identity and yet the approach wasn't heavy handed the production values were also top notch for a small budget film i saw this at the philadelphia gay lesbian film festival and went back to see it a second time it was a real crowd pleaser everyone i spoke to seemed to enjoy this film
