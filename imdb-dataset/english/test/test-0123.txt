<START> so let's begin br br the movie itself is as original as cronenberg's movies would usually appear br br my intention to see it was certainly being one of my favourite actresses she is as lovely as usual this cutie br br i would not say it was my favourite movie of hers still it's quite interesting and entertaining to follow br br the rest of the cast is not extremely impressive but it is not some kind of a miscast star array br br recommend with confidence
<START> with the war not going well for the soviet union stalin accepted volunteers from the prisons and used the prisoners as shock troops this is the story of one such battalion there are petty crooks political prisoners soldiers kicked out of other units gray haired veterans of the white army plus some dangerous criminals br br they are thrown into battle ill equipped untrained and face the threat of the nkvd if they show signs of cowardice or failure br br the special effects are rudimentary and many of the minor characters are one dimensional but the overall story is very human and riveting br br i have not seen a version with subtitles or dubbing viewing the show required liberal use of the pause button and explanations from a native speaker of russian
<START> this may just be the worst movie ever produced worst plot worst acting worst special effects be prepared if you want to watch this the only way to get enjoyment out of it is to light a match and burn the tape of it knowing it will never fall into the hands of any sane person again
<START> the lament and almost unbearable melancholy of music goes to a place in the soul that only music can stir in her voice and magical presence lies the exquisite agony of the an art form of which i was unaware until seeing this film br br for me the success of this beautifully and lovingly crafted documentary lies in the fact that the filmmaker resists the temptation to and simply allows us to share in the magnetism and elegant passion of this icon there seems to be an inevitable between the portuguese and american blues br br documentary filmmaking at its best transports us to a previously unknown reality and having been allowed this glimpse we are transformed br br sr de almeida
<START> this is an emperor's new clothes situation someone needs to say that's not a funny and original etc etc film that is an inferior film don't waste your money on it the film is trashy and the people in it are embarrassingly inferior trailer trash they are all too realistically only themselves they have no lines they don't act the american dream is not to create shoddy no quality films or anything else shoddy and of no quality it is to achieve something of quality and thereby success only people who are desperate to praise any film not made in hollywood it can't have been made in hollywood can it would try to any kind of quality to this film it's worse than ed woods another film about a film maker without standards these films shouldn't have been made and you shouldn't go see american movie
<START> i saw this one on the late late late late show back when mst3k was just a twinkle in joel eye i had the privilege of seeing it without knowing exactly how bad it would be i didn't know that a woman with an arrow in her chest could run to the ends of the earth in about an hour and a half thank god her father gave such specific directions and then take days to make it back to the castle with help i didn't know that a sword wielding barbarian type could run into the forest and create a and flash powder bombs in under 30 seconds i had no idea how disjointed a movie could be br br it's a bad thing children a very bad thing if you enjoy bad movies go for it
<START> an absolutely atrocious adaptation of the wonderful children's book crude and inappropriate humor some scary parts and a sickening side story about the mom's boyfriend wanting to send the boy away to military school to get him out of the way makes this totally inappropriate for the kids who will most likely want to see it because of the book 3 8 yr olds don't waste your money your time or your good judgement
<START> i'm sitting around going through movie listings and not really seeing anything i want to see my appetite keeps saying something like broadcast news that's what i want something smart and funny with adult ideas and great acting and writing and a directorial style that doesn't call attention to itself this may well be hurt's best performance is this or the big chill to my mind however eccentric hurt is smart and to play an unintelligent person without making sure wink wink the audience knows wink wink hey i'm not stupid well that's fine acting right there hunter is note perfect and albert brooks is a revelation and he can read and sing at the same time great great work br br
<START> this movie which i just discovered at the video store has apparently sit around for a couple of years without a distributor it's easy to see why the story of two friends living in new york searching for their pal from high school who is now living homeless under the boardwalk at coney island has flashes of being a very good film but ultimately is weighted down by the story focusing on stan and daniel rather than on their homeless friend richie cryer is as usual very good and the film has a nice stark look to it with the ghostly images of coney island however writer cryer and director richard are too busy dealing with the fairly uninteresting lives of stan and daniel rather than focusing on richie one flashback in a music store where richie has a crush on an employee stands out and really shows the viewer where this film could have gone but in the end not much two many drawn out scenes of annoyance such as inside the building rating 4 out of 10
<START> except for the appearance of talented austin powers impersonator richard this pic was your run of the mill movie spoof dated movie references will not help audiences that may come across this endeavor in future watch for groovy austin powers in the hot tub it's a hoot and a half br br poor special effects are overcome by the appearance of numerous starlets in skimpy outfits so at least that should keep one entertained if that's what thrills you br br for my money i would rent the dvd of classic spoofs such as airplane or lobster man from mars
<START> flawless writing and brilliant acting make this unusually delightful and witty plot twister one of the best american films i have seen this year neil labute's terrific casting and cynical direction keeps this film from becoming too sentimental while renÃ©e zellweger and morgan freeman's authentic performances give it a soul violent provocative and humorous at the same time with a truly wonderful ending chris rock greg kinnear aaron crispin glover and allison all give uproarious tongue in cheek performances the greatest spoof of soap operas since the movie soap but better and smarter 9 out of 10
<START> this is definitely one of the better mel brooks movies along with spaceballs although i will openly admit to not having watched many others at least yet it's very silly and thoroughly funny there are hardly more than a few minutes throughout the entire two hour run time where you aren't entertained almost all of the gags have a great comical effect few of them fall flat i saw this movie right after seeing and reviewing spy hard and comparing these two spoof movies i realize exactly of how high quality this movie really is it's funny from start to finish none of the comedy is overdone or boring the music is marvelous as is the choreography of both dancing and fighting the acting is pretty much what you would normally expect from this type of movie elwes is a great comedian and makes a good robin the plot is typical robin hood more or less everything from the legend is fit into this movie and spoofed majorly if you like mel brooks or you're just a fan of silly humor or you're just dying to watch a good parody of the legend of robin hood this is definitely the film for you the hbo first look special on the film is also worth watching and in that you may want to keep watching throughout the credits too i'd recommend it to any fan of mel brooks movies and to people who enjoy silly humor 7 10
<START> when i first watched this movie i thought it was a very strange movie but i know that the director almost always has a purpose when he makes a movie so i decided to watch it one more time the second time i watched it i realised that albert puyn is a very talented and a very original film maker in the beginning the viewer was told that the movie took place a decade after the fall of the communism in the eastern europe but they had clothes and cars with a design typical for the 1950's they had plutonium which i think is a symbol for the futuristic trade i think that it means that the movie's real time is not specified the music in the movie is creating a long music video which tells some parts of the actual story in the lyrics specially for the intro and the br br albert puyn is using red and blue back color when he's showing the symbols for communism red and the capitalism and western world blue one can notice that ice t has the name mao communism and that when he's in focus the back color is red the american cop starring burt reynolds is always filmed with blue back color the club where mao and his gang hang out is also with red back color crazy six is between the red and the blue color br br the white little dog that mao had in the beginning symbolize i think the controlling force mao had the dog in the beginning but the cop took it in the end that symbolize i guess the fall of communism and the replacement of the capitalistic way of thinking from the western world in eastern europe br br i think crazy six is a very well made movie albert puyn creates an sci fi action movie with a depth it's a different but a very special movie about the communism fall in the eastern europe br br i'm looking forward to watch another spectacular movie of albert puyn
<START> this may contain spoilers br br where to start on this particular empty wasteland well it would have been nice if they actually had a plot acting talent decent dialog suspense humor hey even gratuitous sex would have helped this flick unfortunately there was only a lot of gore even that wasn't done well shooting automatic weapons and missing br br there seemed to be no reason to attach the basic premise a native american cursed to protect the bodies of the tribe he murdered with his being tracked down by a federal special ops team who dressed in civvies most of the time involved violating one of the basic rules of conduct in a horror movie separating from the group so you can be picked off one by one you'd think this team would know better especially because they are actually the third team sent to investigate the other two teams disappearing without a trace when they finally realize they're being picked off they make one of several stands and fire their weapons only to hit the trees a whole lot tree shot scene repeats endlessly in this movie to save money br br when they're not shooting trees they're tracking this spirit who leaves no trail who knows how they're tracking it and spouting a lot of macho bs by the way did i mention that most of this team are women interesting listening to them talk tough not very entertaining but interesting br br all in all you can find better movies in the bargain bin at kmart
<START> haha what a great little movie wayne crawford strikes again or rather this was his first big strike a deliriously entertaining little ball of manic kitsch energy masquerading as a psycho killer movie it's actually a brilliant satire on post hippie american culture in country though the movie was actually filmed independently in miami it defies any kind of studio oriented convention or plot device that i can think of sometimes aunt martha does dreadful things may not be a very technically adept movie but it is a wonderful little slice of americana made on the cheap by people who were honest ambitious imaginative and had balls made out of steel it took guts nerve and guile to make this movie which amazingly appears to have stood the test of time this movie is fresh vital alive unforgettable and charmingly weird enough to recommend to just about anyone with a sense of humor br br i dug up last year during a period of time when i was fascinated by star wayne crawford here billed under his pseudonym scott lawrence a maestro of what can only be called regional film making usually of the b grade variety he's a writer producer director and actor all in one probably best known for the 80s teen apocalyptic favorite night of the comet here he plays stanley the pants wearing half of a couple of truly marvelous characters apparently homosexual spree killers on the lam after knocking off some old lady in baltimore for her jewelry unsung screen legend abe zwick is completely convincing as paul who poses as stanley's aunt martha the cross dressing brains of the outfit who has conned stanley into thinking he's committed murder to ensure his loyalty martha looks about as feminine as the sailors from south supporting choir in their coconut bikini tops yet somehow nobody seems to notice or care that she is a he has no visible means of income seems to spend all day fretting about where stanley is and scurries around the neighborhood in her carrying a butcher's knife only in america br br as the film opens the two of them have just arrived in florida and set up residence in what looks like ward old house a garishly lit designed television home that is so clichÃ© as to be surreal during one memorable scene martha and an unwelcome house guest sit on the couch talk problems and drink cans of budweiser in what is one of the most mesmerizing ordinary sequences i've ever seen outside of a john waters movie then there's stanley always getting into trouble as he is a mop topped hippie with an patch on his vest who drives a psychedelic painted van that's about as subtle as the batmobile drinks his milk straight from the carton snorts drugs with blond bombshell bimbos and hoards donuts in an old cigar box for a quick snack opposites attract i guess br br but stanley also has a thing about not liking it when the young ladies he gets stoned with try to remove his pants and it always seems to be up to aunt martha to get him out of the trouble that inevitably results the bodies pile up a nosy junkie blackmails them into using their house as a flop stanley's birthday cake gets squashed and everybody meets down at the local pizza shop before heading to the wood shed on the back property for a hash party where the girls dance in their underwear things get out of hand when one of the neighbors tries to get a bit too chummy with martha who naturally prefers to keep people at an arm's length when they rudely invite themselves over for a nice chat and this is a woman who carries not just a butcher knife but a loaded 38 in her slip eventually the strange duo find themselves stuck with a body a baby and no place to go and end up taking refuge at an abandoned movie studio where no doubt the technical crew borrowed the equipment used to make the film i just hope they politely asked for permission first and cleaned up after themselves br br a word of course must be said about stanley and martha paul's relationship since to dance around the fact that the two are at least suggested to be a homosexual couple would be to miss the primary gist of the plot we never see the two of them get intimate and indeed even though stanley mockingly refers to being balled in one scene their relationship is more symbiotic than sexual it certainly isn't a gay movie with abundant female nudity and an air of 70s misogyny that cannot be denied either stanley paul never their implied sexuality on screen even though the movie certainly would have had the guts to do so if it were important it isn't the story isn't about their sex it's about the bond they share and how weird it is not their being gay but their being the distinct individuals they are who are two of the strangest movie creations ever to inhabit my tv set br br the film is unique it was made for only a few thousand dollars on what look like borrowed studio sets the occasional location work and an couple of public locations they managed to sneak a camera crew into when nobody was looking the dialog is completely bizarre mundane and delightfully esoteric it's a movie that will take you by surprise not everyone will like it but for those with a taste for low budget american horror thrillers like the night god screamed help me i'm possessed blood lace and children shouldn't play with dead things you've got yourself a winner here br br 8 10 usually i'd say something like deserves a dvd restoration but somehow i think doing so would ruin the movie's tacky ambiance and wayne crawford you sir rule
