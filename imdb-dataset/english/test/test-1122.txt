<START> ok what was this story about again i am afraid that i never read the book and frankly this was one of the most confusing movies that i have ever tried to watch in a long time i get a bit confused on the number of flashbacks between the nurse the patient and the man with no thumbs the film didn't even really explain what they were looking for in the desert until they found it or even how in the world they all knew each other to come together br br after recently seeing the pride and prejudice movie with colin firth i have been trying to do a study on his film career by watching other movies of his and bluntly other than what a girl wants i am not finding much where he played in that was any good i am definitely not saying that he wasn't good he is really one of the best actors i have seen in the modern day film but the content and quality of the films he plays in have a lot to be desired br br the english patient is another perfect example of where the director writer and crew are just too close to their subject matter to see that the viewer is not getting the picture Â literally the entire movie seemed to be to showcase ralph fiennes as a dramatic actor with long periods of emoting that was a bore nothing is really explained and every one of the subjects from the beginning seems to need a psychoanalyst evaluation br br kristin scott thomas' character seems to enjoy describing erotic stories standing in front of a totally male audience and titillating other men other than her husband colin firth who plays her husband does not necessarily have all his marbles in place and is supposed to be a secret agent Â i guess and ralph fiennes walks around like a roman mr darcy sorry colin who thinks he knows it all the rest of the cast is cast pun intended to the four winds as the plot wanders on br br the subplot of the mental stability of the nurse juliette binoche and her motives and involvement with andrews is another confusing element that leaves the viewer with an unsavory taste but of course the viewer is still reeling how in the world the first two characters thomas and fiennes ended up having sex the first time anyway what was the attraction there was no chemistry and no build up just a slap bam thank you br br and isn't it romantic that fiennes ended up a traitor helping the germans by giving them maps to the desert sarcasm br br to describe this movie i would have to simply say how to impress your with your and cheat on your sweet adorable husband who loves you br br the final unbelievable section of this plot is to fathom how anyone would choose ralph fiennes over colin firth firth had very little opportunity to demonstrate any of his acting talents Â in fact when watching the movie i thought it must have been one of his first the scene where he had been waiting for his wife all night was perhaps the only two second clip that is worth seeing in the movie at that i have no interest in watching it again br br the best scene i liked was the plane crash where firth is trying to take them all out too bad he missed it would have saved an extra twenty minutes of even more fruitless film aerial desert scenes were pretty neat though
<START> pink flamingos is a movie no word can explain it was just as good i thought it expands films starting with a multiple beginning and ending with a shocking but clever ending pink flamingos is one of the best films of the year don't miss this opportunity to see a great film rent it on video or see it at a late midnight showing like i did but just see it
<START> a very suspenseful giallo from the director of 1974 this one begins with a brilliantly handled sequence involving a priest a little girl and a broken doll however the main story is about maniac david warbeck marrying a traumatized cripple to kill her for her money the plot whilst not original is really suspenseful the acting is good and there are several skillful and gory murders the score by francesco de is quite effective some of which can also be heard in lucio fulci's the new york ripper 1982 highly recommended for fans of italian cinema
<START> if you think hannah montana or the suite life are at the bottom of tween sitcoms then you've obviously never watched is without a doubt the worst show i've ever seen from the lifeless acting to the low budget sets the show reeks of cheapness like last week's chinese takeout left to simmer in your overheated car br br the show revolves around a pretty perky and supposed to be funny girl named carly as she and her friends make a live web show called carly lives alone with her older brother who seriously needs some counseling or something because he's a few cells short of a brain br br the plots of the shows are highly ludicrous and unbearably annoying but having to watch carly and her friend sam do their little show within in a show is even worse they basically show weird pictures and stick things up their nose as the laugh track plays over and over i mean seriously every two seconds the laugh track seems to come on for no reason br br so what's the point of this review you may ask just to ridicule well yeah but i'm also warning you to beware of this show because seriously if i had to choose between watching and barney no questions about it i'd choose barney
<START> it's all there two classic anti hero buddies a headlong chase through beautiful swedish scenery guns violence sex and a butch cassidy sundance kid style finale br br add a touch of surrealism and some distinctly danish humour and you've got this excellent road movie
<START> a mean spirited repulsive horror film about 3 murderous children susan strasberg is totally wasted in a 5 minute cameo even though she receives star billing if your a julie brown fan you'll want to check it out since she's naked in a couple of shots all others avoid
<START> boring ridicules and stupid submerged is a waste of time the shootouts were a joke real people do not just stand out in the open with out any cover hoping to get shot first so many things wrong or bad not worth the effort to list except one major flaw at 500 mph for 20 minutes about 166 miles west of l a and the water is deep even at that none of the people would have survived the decompression from being subjected to of water pressure for more then 20 hours when they were brought up just a awful
<START> i didn't hate this movie as much as some on my all time black list but i consider it a total wast of film jeremy irons iron jeremy ron jeremy think about it scene one is very good all the rest are crap
<START> beginning where it left off doctor who rose her alternative dad mickey his alternative counterpart ricky and small gang of rebels find themselves at the mercy of this realities version of the this second part of the 2 episode arc feels more like a doctor who episode as opposed to the previous part which honestly felt like more of an episode of the defunct show sliders which granted was a great show in it's own right the arc as a whole was enjoyable enough as i'm one to subscribe to the maxim that any who is good who but at the same time it's inevitable that this will be compared to the dalek episode of the previous series and said comparisons would only make this seem like a lesser work as it is i just feel that this story could've been done in one episode remember in the first part of the review i said that these type of stories dealing with alternative realities usually have no lasting repercussions well that's not the case here but what changes overall feels tagged on and not really in keeping with the character br br my grade c
<START> this is by far the best stand up routine i have ever seen john leguizamo's one man show tells the supposed story of his life in a barrage of lines and situations by far better than any other comedy out there
<START> peter is top notch he is acting and looking great feels like watching a live play great camera works and i was sad it was over can not wait until it is on the big screen super cast this could be a big hit i like the way the kids interact as sister and two brothers really made me think of my own brothers going through a situation like what peter the happy father who thinks he will end his life after a big party the colors and sets were delightful to the eyes helps so much to draw you into the film play i was so happy to see peter not be colombo this guy could always act and now this is a movie that gives him that range i recommend you take your family to this movie perhaps the teenagers will not get much from this no guns fast cars dumb lines stupid fart jokes but your adult kids will love it good show for a night with them br br jason
<START> though it's a christmas movie christmas in connecticut could have been done any time of year as it's the story of a soldier who spends what is to be an idyllic time with a martha stewart type that's what he thinks in reality the lady in question portrayed by barbara stanwyck has a popular magazine column about life on a farm with her husband and baby she has no farm no husband and no baby nor are the many recipes she hers they belong to the restaurant owner nearby when her no nonsense editor sydney greenstreet insists that she entertain soldier dennis morgan she enlists the aid of her boyfriend to use his farm and she transports herself and the restaurateur there there's even a baby well actually there's more than one chaos ensues and the charade becomes increasingly difficult to play out especially when stanwyck falls in love with morgan br br this is such a wonderful movie and even if you're gravely depressed christmas in connecticut can lift you right out of it barbara stanwyck is wonderful as the career woman turned homemaker despite not being as flashy as crawford or davis she was nevertheless able to do what any role called for she could be cheap elegant warm nasty cold and or sexy and she makes it look easy on top of that she is always attractive and alluring dennis morgan is a handsome and charming solider as an added bonus he gets to use his irish tenor fiancÃ© reginald gardner is all business and you can tell he's not quite right for stanwyck s z as the fake uncle real chef is hilarious especially as he prays stanwyck can flip a pancake before an audience br br i can imagine the impact this delightful film had at the tail end of world war ii it must have been a real beacon for the better times to come
<START> i don't know maybe i just wasn't in the mood for this kind of movie but it was full of trite melodrama it was too long and seemed at least mildly disjointed granted i didn't pay full attention for a more entertaining depiction of the battle of stalingrad see enemy at the gates true some pretentious folks will scoff because it's a hollywood film and doesn't show the gritty reality of war like this wonderful foreign film does but it has better flow and is all around just more fun to watch besides there are already enough gritty war movies and this one just seemed done but hey you might like it so go right ahead it just wasn't for me
<START> i would most definitely have to say that this is the most terrible movie i have ever seen it's not just the actors that are bad but also the fact that the camera person taped the wall and the clocks for about 5 minutes at a time anyone that likes this must be crazy this movie is a waste of time
<START> led an extraordinary life and his story is told rather well in all american we follow incredible journey from young norwegian boy to iconic american football legend produced in 1940 the film may at times seem a touch dated and at times downright hokey and the filmmakers do lay it on a bit thick at times as is and lovingly portrayed you may come away thinking should have been nominated for sainthood when in fact he was after all just a football coach but it is undeniable that he had a great impact on the game of football as well as having a tremendous impact on the lives of so many of the young men he coached this film shows the great impact he had and gives you an insight into why he is so revered to this day br br playing pat o'brien gives an impressive performance it's unquestionably o'brien's movie to carry and he makes the film and the character his own the real life was renowned as a great inspirational figure and o'brien's performance will make you understand why the only quibble comes early in the film when o'brien in his early forties is playing the college student in his early twenties all the makeup in the world wasn't going to make that believable and the effect is rather jarring but as the character ages and begins his legendary coaching career o'brien fits the part perfectly br br as for the rest of the cast one name jumps out and that is of course ronald reagan playing the young charismatic but ultimately doomed football star george in the grand scheme of the film it's not really a large part with reagan appearing for no more than 10 15 minutes but the performance has become legendary thanks to reagan's famous win one for the deathbed speech it's a brilliantly played scene chock full of emotion reagan may not have been on the screen for very long in this film but he certainly made a tremendously positive impact in a winning performance br br the rest of the film strikes a balance between football and life in general with having great lessons for his young men in both areas for football fans and history buffs there is a rare treat as actual archival footage from notre dame games of the era is interspersed throughout the film it's a rare opportunity to see just how much the game has evolved in the last six plus decades and an opportunity to see legendary strategic innovations put into practice if you're a notre dame fan you'll probably enjoy the fact that the notre dame victory march provides a seemingly constant soundtrack for the film if you're a notre dame hater well then you're probably not watching this movie anyway all american is an inspiring uplifting emotional film perhaps a tad overly sentimental but that's not such a bad thing it's a very enjoyable film one well worth taking the time to see
