<START> and believe me that's a pretty stunning accomplishment take jolly roger massacre at cutter's cove change the killer from a pirate to a prospector change his obsession from buried treasure to old gold and his color from puke green to deep blue you now have miner's massacre the problem is at least jolly roger was entertaining enough albeit in a so bad it's good way to keep you watching it for the whole two hours there's no strip joint murder scene or any bizarre killings i can't tell you how many times i lost interest in miner's massacre and started doing dishes or cleaning around the condo and the ending is absolutely silly the dude just randomly re appears out of nowhere to kill the local sheriff while the lead actor and actress are sitting in the sheriff's cruiser screaming a truly horrible movie
<START> in the original french version the jokes of great funny voice are very funny br br but in translated versions i saw the german english version it's not half good than the original br br but goof special effects almost the full comic with differences like the figure of german name is placed in an other comic book br br sure the asterix comic book are cult but when you watch the animated comic movies from 1968 to 1998 you will see much better jokes better story and the old and flair of the cult stories br br for french speaking people i suggest to watch it in it's original version with or without subtitles where available in different languages
<START> i'm sorry but for a movie that has been so stamped as a semi classic and a scary movie but seriously i think when the director has me laughing unintentionally that's not a good thing the characters in this film were just so over the top and unbelievable i just couldn't stop laughing at voice it was just like a high pitched whiny girl's british voice not to mention over dramatic stick up his butt character br br children of the corn is about a town where all the children have killed off the adults and worship a god that commands them to sacrifice any 20 aged people when a couple has a bad car accident they come to the town for help but of course they get caught in the kid's trap and are getting sacrificed but has other intentions when he is sick of following orders br br children of the corn could've been something great but turned into a bad over the top movie that you could easily make fun of as much as i love stephen king i'm sure this is not what he intended and it was a pretty lame story or at least the actors destroyed it like i said for a good laugh watch it but i'm warning you it's pretty pathetic br br 3 10
<START> once a wise man from india once said first they will laugh at us then they will hate us then they will fear us know that yes this film's budget was a bit off but even then with its story still takes our interest many yrs later regardless of how it may have looked but know soon in due time thrust will arise to the big screen once again then he and the new redesigned t rex will more then shock you it will scare many for centuries to come this film is in current pre production and will be nothing like anything you have ever seen before br br this will be beyond thx format right into 4 dx format br br be afraid be very afraid
<START> since jason and his ilk took over horror films circa 1980 most every horror film has involved a group of hormonally charged teenagers being chopped to bits with the focus on the chopping and not the suspense br br this little film is different made in the early 80's it does what every good horror film should do bring your worst fears to life while you sit around just knowing that these horrors are just around the corner then you make those horrors simmer just don't turn it into a lesson on the biology of butchering br br the story features meg tilly right before she had a short lived turn with fame starting with the big chill and then slipped back into obscurity in the early 90's meg plays an outcast teenager who is just dying to get into the good graces of some classic mean girls they tell her she can be part of their little group if she spends the night in a crypt the mean girls intend to scare her and cause her to leave the crypt thus giving them a double reward further tormenting the outcast girl and having an excuse to reject her br br meanwhile famed occultist karl has died a bizarre death shortly after having claimed to have discovered a way to return from the grave and upon his return command great magical powers his daughter doesn't believe this at first but she listens to a tape about her father's experiments which included his successful animation of small dead animals and of his plans to emerge from the grave with the power to animate bigger game and draw further power from these animations she also learns that she may have inherited her father's power and may be the only person who can stop him should he actually rise from the dead i think you know where this story is headed so i'll stop here did i mention the magician was entombed in the same crypt in which meg tilly's character is spending the night br br i will mention that the commercial dvd containing this film does look somewhat degraded compared to what you would expect from a film that was made so recently i saw it on tv in the mid 1980's and i remember it looking better than this the problem is that the original negative of the film was never located so the dvd had to be created from a print this means it comes complete with dirt and scratches br br this is worth checking out for any horror fan it was an independently made film and an example of the kind of unusual stuff that you could commonly find on late night tv until the infomercial turned that time slot into a vast wasteland circa 1986 only tcm underground airs this kind of film anymore
<START> i bought this movie just to see bam because i was really loving him but after seeing this i don't like him much i mean his acting was good and everything i guess but whenever it showed the totally unnecessary skate scenes i was just saying to myself alright we know you're a professional skateboarder now can we get back to ryan dunn dunn rake and brandon really made the movie in my perspective br br i noticed that obviously and missy were both in haggard but who bam was dating at the time anyways i actually enjoyed haggard and i think it's really like no other movie i've ever seen it's sort of in it's own category
<START> this is no walk in the park i saw this when it came out and haven't had the guts to watch it again you will never see a more horrifyingly devastating or depressing movie i felt like i'd been severely beaten what kind of world are we living in when we have children who are treated worse than garbage this is our world what we have created what we have allowed to happen and i would hesitate to say that i me we are not responsible for this made this film to wake us up to shake us to our very core and he succeeded how can we be cruel or self indulgent or neglectful of our children when we see the graphic results of such behavior he is pointing a finger of accusation at us all for doing this to the lowliest and least powerful of our society and if you aren't doing something each day to prevent it then you are part of the problem i am not a religious fanatic but this movie made me think about the state of my soul
<START> the academy award winning vs follows a snazzy businessman ted kramer dustin hoffman and his divorce with his bored wife meryl streep one day ted's wife leaves him and their child in search for a better life forcing ted to become closer to his son justin henry the two bond and become very close but only after some friction and just as everything is going perfect ted's wife comes back to town and wants sole custody of their son ted then goes on a mission not to let his son get taken away from him and fights his wife in court dustin hoffman gives a tremendous performance along with meryl streep and young justin henry is impressive it's a sad emotional roller coaster of a movie but it's a very well made and inspiring film the film took the oscar for best picture at the 1979 academy awards along with best actor for hoffman and best supporting actress for streep if you don't mind a tearjerker vs is a great film to watch grade b
<START> i was having a horrid day but this movie grabbed me and i couldn't put it down until the end and i had forgotten about my horrid day and the ending by the way where is the sequel br br the budget is obviously extremely low but look what they did with it it reminds me of a play they are basically working with a tent a a few guns uniforms camping gear and a thing that is it for props maybe this is even a good thing forcing the acting and writing to have to step up and take their rightful place in film as the centers of the work instead of as afterthoughts used to have an excuse to make cgi fights br br the cgi is fine it is not exactly but imho it still works why because there isn't too much of it and what there is is not 'taking over' with an army of effects house people trying to cram everything they can into the shot it prompts the imagination it's some relatively simple stuff with decent composition especially the heavy freighter shot there is one long shot that must be at least ten seconds that tracks the entire length of the ship it must be a record for sci fi battle sequence film making in the past 10 years to have an action sequence that lasts longer than 0 75 seconds and some relation to the story it might look old or not 'state of the art' but it doesn't look stupid and it doesn't take away from the story br br the acting is good except the characters die too fast to get to know them the captain was great but a few of his scenes could have used another take i also got confused with his character losing his cool and stomping on a corpse i like to think captains are calm cool and in control what was going on in that scene did the other crew worry about him losing it at that moment did he feel himself losing control br br now as for the plot mostly it is good why because it doesn't try to explain itself it just happens it's called 'the planet' its a mystery get it nobody knows why there is a statue and they don't find out either the mysterious cult the weird scientist with the tattoo what do you expect to find out in less than 90 minutes this isn't war and peace and thank god it's not star wars trek either no no 5 minutes of expository boring dialog that has no purpose in the story the characters are stranded and are only able to figure out a few basic things it is not a star trek episode where they find out it's leonardo davinci or a child like space wanderer it is mysterious and i liked that i don't know why maybe i can identify with these guys more since they don't know whats happening and i don't either they don't talk a lot of space gibberish or have magic boxes telling them what is happening br br in fact i would argue that one of the weakest moments is when the turns on the crew and tries to the reason for the planet the cult etc this coincidentally has some of the weakest dialog imho in the whole movie and it interrupts the flow and some of the characters look unnatural in that scene br br ok sometimes i felt it was a little too mysterious though like why did the guy get fried through his eyes with lightning that was odd just weird the 'hamlet' ending again i would have liked to have known some of these characters better and would it have been so hard to have a 30 second rescue scene at the end this is not a serial show it was a film and we like closure in films even if they can have a sequel imagine hamlet with no of angels sing thee to thy rest' br br anyways what can i say this was well worth the dollar i payed at the 'red box' machine at the supermarket it was also imho a better piece of storytelling than parts 1 2 or 3 like i said it sucked me in wanting to know what was happening and i couldn't stop watching until the end
<START> agree that this was one of the best episodes of this show i remember the series well as i was in the florida keys when the show had its debut i was looking through old vcr tapes that were keepers and came across two that had about eight episodes i ended up spending part of christmas night and the next watching these shows the singer was saw his name come up on the credits he's from and owns a beach front bar called the dune preserve he's a longtime friend of jimmy buffett and classic song still in paradise is featured on the latest buffett cd dvd combo called live in it is track 12 on cd 1 and 8 on the cd i too would like to someday see this short lived series come out on dvd keep the faith
<START> i really wanted to like this film but it barely eked out a 3 it's surprising that equal amounts of the votes were 10 the other half 1 all the characters were entertaining and even talented but as a whole the film didn't pay off sebastian hernandez is appealing charismatic and likable he even physically resembles marc anthony in a more approachable yet ultimately conscious sort of way but even he couldn't save this mess of a movie scenes dragged on far too long and points were ultimately beaten to death the banana scene on self absorption seemingly showing how much movement was in his boxers but in his defense it was his first movie as director that i'm aware of and i appreciate his labor of love it just left me empty despite what was trying to be said ultimately i think the story would have been better handled by a more experienced director from what i've seen of the there is a real story behind this and perhaps when i finish watching them i'll appreciate this attempt more
<START> it was so very long ago 1960 but i have never forgotten this series and often wished it would reappear so taken with it i corresponded with mr then president of standard oil which sponsored the presentation on pbs he sent me a photo of the tapestry actually a charcoal rendering used behind the credits br br to the opening theme music of elizabethan masque my family and i gathered around our black white tv to drink in shakespeare's words as spoken by a group of excellent but relatively unknown players at least to american audiences at the time br br we were introduced to such actors as sean connery dame judi dench tom fleming patrick garland julian glover and robert hardy i have continued to enjoy their accomplishments ever since one of the most interesting things was the way in which the actors continued to age in their respective roles as shakespeare's king plays were presented perhaps for the first time in chronological order br br i wish i could tell those actors just how much that series meant to me br br if age of kings could be revived on vhs and or dvd it would so please those of us who long to see it again and those who missed it the first time around br br good news pbs has just issued a dvd of an age of kings see their july 2009 catalog page 19 or call them toll free i just ordered mine
<START> as a true canadian i always avoid canadian movies however now and then i get trapped into watching one this one is better than most which is to say mediocre it has many of the usual flaws of canadian films self conscious acting an excess of cinematic gimmicks and above all the self effacing canadian habit of using canadian cities as stand ins for american ones i mean using the historic metropolis of montreal as a stand in for pennsylvania is just short of obscene i was in a generous mood i gave it a 4 br br
<START> battleship potemkin is a celluloid masterpiece the direction of br br eisenstein is truly a sight the film chronicles a ship of disgruntled br br sailors who are tired of being mistreated by their superior officers br br eventually the sailors finally have enough of the abuse and send the br br officers packing during this time period there was a shortage of film br br stock in the soviet union the wanted to get their message br br out to the people so they started a national film company and one of br br the members was sergei eisenstein the films were shot on miniscule br br budgets and the shortage of film stock forced to be careful br br and selective with the footage that he shot in the end eisenstein had br br to reuse footage in order to make a feature length picture br br the most famous of the action set pieces in this film is the much br br talked about massacre on the steps this scene was spoofed in bananas br br and most recently in brian de palma's the untouchables if you want to br br learn film making i strongly advise you to watch battleship potemkin br br it's one of the essentials br br a
