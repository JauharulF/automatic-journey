<START> even not being a fan of the star trek movies or universe of shows and books and such i still find some enjoyment in some of the movies featuring the old cast and in the case of first contact even the new cast a bit this one though was kind of sad to watch it seemed to want to be so much but it failed on so many levels to be one of the worst star trek movies the plot is very far fetched seeming to want to combine three or four stories into one ultimate trek adventure but it ends up an unfunny when it tries to be not tense when it wants to be and not action packed like it tries to be mess of inconsistencies the whole movie to take a phrase from spock is illogical the effects are nothing special as i have seen episodes of next generation that are just as good which is to say it is fine for a television show but not a major motion picture the plot is laughable as the gang at first tries to stop spock's brother then joins him on his quest to find god yes you read that correctly the klingons make a tacked on appearance which actually will set up the much better undiscovered country movie all in all you know it is bad when the best part of the film is kirk bones and spock singing row your boat well spock was not really singing but rather questioning the lyrics
<START> kramer vs kramer is a terrific drama about an unhappy woman who walks out on her husband and young son the husband now has to take up the responsibilities of taking care of the boy as he does they get to know each other better but then the mother and wife returns and she wants custody of the boy kramer vs kramer has lots of drama with some wonderful bits of comedy thrown in for good measure dustin hoffman won his first best actor oscar for his brilliant performance here most people say his performance in rainman which won him his second oscar is his best he was great in that film but i disagree that its his best in my opinion the best performance of hoffman's career is in this movie scene after scene shows us why hoffman is one of the best american actors working today he's also funny at times also giving a terrific performance is meryl streep who wasn't as well known when she made this film like she is today streep like hoffman also won her first oscar for best supporting actress for her work in kramer vs kramer as the wife and mother who tries to find herself after walking out on her family justin henry who was only 8 years old when the film came out is wonderful as hoffman and streep's son he won an oscar nomination for his role here and still to this day he is the youngest performer to receive an oscar nomination in a competitive category best supporting actor jane alexander is also fine as a family friend she too got an oscar nomination for supporting actress where she lost to co star streep kramer vs kramer is a great film from start to finish writer director robert benton has made a film that's absolutely unforgettable br br out of four
<START> at least for me i have been following the career of mr since the beginning and i was not crazy about this film i think penelope cruz was miscast the type of woman she is portraying does not look that good she makes the character unbelievable also the singing scene was just weird i do not get the point and the lip sync was awful br br as spaniard another thing that drove me nuts are the accents why people coming from the same place have such a different accent the difference between the two sisters is notable and makes no sense and the village are we in 2007 or 1950 i found myself trying to explain to my american husband that many of the things in the movie are old school things are not like that anymore br br i was expecting more but this time mr almodovar did not deliver at least for me i am not saying that miss cruz does a bad job i am saying that she does not belong there not portraying that character
<START> it's quite revealing to see this today and appreciate how far we've come along in what we expect from movies and at the same time appreciate how many notions were established br br here we have a full fledged narrative talking film the audio and the visuals are pushed to their period limits the framing is limited to about belt high and up no face close ups br br the compositions are remarkable there's an early over the shoulder cross cutting scene to showcase the dialogue there's a treacherous descent into a canyon with some harrowing perspective angles a sun bleached skeleton lies in the dust as the wheels and legs march in the upper portion of the frame the tension in the showdown between the hero and the bad guy is visually captured by filming above the long axis of a large tree that lies between them and on and on early visual treats abound br br today it's unsettling to see the young wayne carry a film unencumbered by ego or mannerisms br br i have to wonder if walsh recognized the self reference the subject is the journey of a disparate group of pilgrims those who appear on screen are a disparate group of stage actors vaudeville comedians shell game artists and probably carny barkers and ten in one show veterans they all journey together to blaze a trail for how movies would be made br br this is worth at least one viewing to appreciate the source of so many visual ideas borrowed in later movies
<START> as a spanish tourist in los angeles and a fanatic movie lover i committed a terrible mistake i went to see the women the remake of one of my all time favorites i've seen the original many many times in fact i own it my rushing to see the remake was based on diane english the woman responsible for murphy brown my though was how bad can it be she must know what she's doing well i don't know what to say i don't understand what happened the botoxed women is a rather depressing affair meg ryan or whoever played mary she looked a bit like a grotesque version of meg ryan another actress perhaps wearing a meg ryan mask she doesn't bring to the character nothing of what norma shearer did in 1939 the new one is a tired unconvincing prototype of what has become a farce within a farce the friends annette bening debra messing jada smith are as disconnected as anything i've ever seen and if this wasn't enough eva mendes as crystal the character created by joan crawford in one of her best and funniest performances eva casting is really the poster sign for how wrong how ill conceived this commercial attempt turned up i didn't give it a 1 out respect for candice bergen and cloris leachman
<START> soul plane supposed to be a black comedy spoof of a much well known movie airplane this movie is black comedy done at it's worst stereotypes can be funny and a lot of times they are but in this picture it's disgusting okay you have clubs sex drugs everything crude that people associate with urban culture today br br tom arnold's appearance in this movie is this movie's saving grace if it ever had any should have never accepted the script kevin hart makes a poor leading figure here his appearance in this movie will probably grow annoying to many method man and snoop's appearance were by far their worst br br i am just happy that i didn't pay to see this movie
<START> this little cheapy is notable only because it is the worst film abbott and costello ever made it is dreadful in every way crummy music horrid choreography check out the awkward lead male dancer cheesy special effects and sets wooden actors the leads are barely at the high school level in their profession and were unheard of later and a script without a single laugh better times were ahead for the comedy duo abbott and costello meet captain kidd is much preferable as is the television series which at times was inspired but skip this one
<START> i mean really really really high and this movie has a shot at entertainment i don't mean regular high i mean the high where reading the would have you in stitches otherwise save the time out of your life and go do something more constructive with it like hitting your head on a brick wall and insulting your own intelligence a complete waste of talent in some cases bernie mac john c mcginley tom kenny and the master of hams shatner and exactly the kind of crap they deserve to make the myriad of rappers who insist on making movies not without it's laughs again chemical aid is crucial and certainly not without offending the politically over sensitive which i'm always in favor of but ultimately not worth the time out of your life
<START> i love horror films but i think they work way better when they hide a dramatic impact behind the devil's backbone the exorcist for example this is that kind of film and it's not only eerie and terrifying when it has to be it is also really beautiful a tale of two sisters starts really slow so if you're in a hurry to see ghosts in the first 20 minutes you will be disappointed actually this is not a ghost story there are some it's something more complex and it's done in such a way that it beats ringu and the grudge out of the ring no sweat a is a way more clever film than those huge cultural hits because it really cares for its characters and the direction is flawless every detail in this film will leave you breathless if you're the kind of person who loves to pay attention to details while watching a movie the acting is superb specially from the stepmother and the main girl those two are worth the price of the ticket alone do yourself a favor and watch this awesome film
<START> apparently in early 2005 scifi channel threatened to release the incriminating photos they have of john rhys davies and said we need you to star in another scifi original the scary thing is he's actually pretty damn good in this movie that's really saying something since this is a silly scifi creature feature you've gotta put some feeling into it in order to be well acted unfortunately nobody else does it's your stereotypical run amok movie on a cruise ship the wants to keep the creature alive the navy seals think they have everything under control but they don't know what they're dealing with and they all end up dead a girl jumps into the movie sexpot role as rhys davies' daughter and the creature about 100 or so shipmates what this movie has going for it is it's very fast paced and lively you're never bored or waiting for another kill other than that though it does nothing to distinguish itself and it's silly that this thing crawls all over the ceilings and can't be wounded by navy seal machine guns but can be karate kicked into submission by rhys davies' daughter kinda went back and forth on giving this bad boy a 5 but for the above silliness i'm giving it a 4
<START> audio br br seriously i've never seen a movie with worse audio there are scenes where people are walking through the grass and you can hardly hear them over their footsteps they must be their feet br br you know how in some movies they forget a line so they have to dub it in on a shot of the back of someone's head here the editors were not that clever there is actually a scene where shannon character says her line without moving her lips at all br br i'm pretty sure for their background sound they played effects loops live while shooting because in a lot of scenes the sound effects will either be different or be absent whenever the camera changes angles br br i could write a lot more on how bad the audio is in this movie br br other nuggets br br in this movie they probably consider the opening credits to be special effects because they seemed so challenging to produce the main title and the first few names in the opening credits are in white text over a white sky and they wobble as if they were carefully hand painted on each frame br br the reuse of extras in this movie is incredible there are about 15 rebels in the cast and yet in any given battle thirty or more of them will be killed if only the film were high enough quality to distinguish which ones were dying over and over br br it's also interesting to note that the rebels are usually killed by explosions that are always between 30 and 200 feet away there is one scene one scene when some of the rebels are running out of their huts in the rebel base and one huts shakes as the rebel exits the door it makes you wonder if the hut will last long enough to encounter the inevitable explosion br br there is a blue helicopter that looks as menacing as a pair of running shorts but somehow is equipped with an infinite supply of missiles when they show the missiles being shot out of the missile bays the often shoot of in unpredictable directions very closely resembling large bottle rockets they still manage to hit their targets with ease which as noted above is always a very safe distance away from the rebels they kill note the recycled footage of the pilot pressing the live button to fire the missiles because it's printed vertically the first few times we saw it we read it as the evil button br br notice how the grenade launcher they use produces identical explosions to those that are created by the helicopter missiles it's also fun in many scenes how the actor in the foreground is shooting in a completely different direction than the group of enemy soldiers that he is killing and frequently characters shoot a disproportionate number of bullets to the soldiers who are killed like when a short burst fire kills a large group of enemies br br yes this movie is very very very bad the plot was thought out almost as well as a 5 year old's soccer game and the editing is the worst i've ever seen but honestly sometimes it's fun spend 90 minutes laughing at a group of adults who sincerely took part in such a terrible movie
<START> i recently saw house of wax and must say i really enjoyed it br br it's been one of the better horror thriller films in the past few years if not one of the best and most entertaining br br i've heard a lot of people bashing the so called slow start and character development which takes up the films opening 45 minutes br br yet if the film dived straight into the deaths audiences and critics would have criticised the film for not having decent characters who they couldn't care less about br br well as for the character development i think it worked amazingly well br br taking into my own response and others from reading posts off the message board a lot of people ended up wanting the characters to live one of which i've noticed many people mentioning being paige edwards paris hilton taking into consideration warner bros have been marketing her death its a surprise turn around that many audiences ended up cheering her on for survival br br speaking of the chase death scenes they were some of the most inventive and suspenseful i've witnessed in a while and enjoyed each one very much br br the acting in the film was absolutely fine i couldn't fault any of them especially paris hilton i thought she was very decent and i was hoping for her the get more than a mere 25 minutes screen time in a 120 minute film yet her chase scene made up for that and believe me when i say paris can act scared watch the scene where she's hiding in a car from vincent and he walks past her the look of terror on her face comes across as very real br br overall i give house of wax maximum stars for entertainment value and suspense and even gore only criticism is i wish that during the marketing for the film they hadn't revealed the death list and who dies and who survives as it would have been ten times better not knowing if the character being chased was going to live or die and horrible death br br can't wait for the dvd but go see it at the cinema while you can it won't be the same in your own front room yet if you do wait for the dvd watch the film in the dark with no interruptions trust me you wont be disappointed
<START> very curious that nichols and hanks would team up for this obviously they believe it strange because it should carry the title charlie wilson's war the lie br br how could the time frame leave out the real history that while ridding afganistan of the russians the cia was providing support for the taliban and today's world of terrorism in 1990 bin laden went home to saudi arabia as a hero of jihad who along with his arab legion had brought down the mighty superpower of the soviet union in afghanistan br br to avoid any connection to osama bin laden is to say again hollywood cares little for historical truth charlie wilson a patriot hardly more like a congressman gone amok
<START> i walked out of the cinema having suffered this film after 30 mins i left two friends pinned in by a great fat bloke to endure the remainder br br as soon as the opening sequence of the film unrolled i sensed something was wrong and it wasn't long before i to stop myself from hiding under my seat cringing in embarrassment i'm not one for walking out of films however bad as they usually have some redeeming feature but this one suffered from a catalogue of bad directing bad acting bar character the impeccable jean rochefort according to my friends awful editing in terms of theme and meaning terrible soundtrack and image correlation that seemed to make an art out placing the wrong peace of music over the image and scene at the wrong time the worst crime was its overall insipidness and unbelievability a result of the aforementioned atrocities why was it so awful i do not want to waste more of my time explaining i'd say go and see it for yourself but i don't want to fill the coffers of this project any more than necessary oh the screening did possess one redeeming feature my friend over the rows of seats in silhouette with his umbrella hooked over his arm as he tried to steady himself more pathos tension entertainment in those few moments than in the 125 mins of this sadly dire effort
<START> the relationship between the lone ranger and tonto was always good for a snicker but to take the joke out of the joke by building a movie around the gay appeal of the legend oh the horror the horror br br
