<START> ordinary decent criminal is sort of based on the exploits of martin cahill already the subject of john boorman's 1998 film the general cahill had a rough upbringing in a slum area and graduated from petty crime to armed robbery with honours he justified his criminal career by pointing out his poor background at every opportunity this is a common excuse for criminals that conveniently overlooks the thousands of slum dwellers who don't turn to robbing post offices and selling guns in order to make ends meet cahill made fools of the police and local authorities not to mention the ira which earned him a sort of folk hero status as well as making him many enemies however he was basically an amoral self serving thief br br my primary problem with is that the protagonist is made out to be a lovable irish rogue kevin spacey does a good job portraying michael lynch with a blend of oily charm and quiet menace but the character is too amoral and selfish to be seen as any sort of hero even an anti hero br br the film is well shot and well acted by a fine cast but what lets it down is the script writer gerard can't make up his mind is he writing an irish lock stock or a grittier treatment of martin cahill's thieving career that's the problem when a writer bases his central character on a real person br br it's also unfortunate that followed the cinema release of john boorman's the general which was a more accurate portrayal of martin cahill's story cahill was a cunning thief who knew the value of good publicity so it's not surprising that his exploits got the movie treatment br br what is surprising is that a studio was prepared to take cahill's story and give it a happy hollywood style ending kevin spacey's charismatic thief michael lynch gets to ride off into anonymity on his motorcycle in in the real world martin cahill was executed by the ira just to prove that no one makes fools of an out dated and corrupt para military organisation and gets away with it br br the real cahill would never have walked away from his notoriety because it bolstered his man of the people self image having michael lynch give up everything to avoid death in is a cop out ending to a weak and shallow movie
<START> for me the tempest and its characters by which i mean the admirable ones are like old friends ever since i first began to experience the play through acting classes i played ferdinand i found myself immediately caught up in the fantastic world that shakespeare created i can distinctly remember one student deciding not to play ferdinand after all and so i took the stage and had the honor of playing opposite an excellent miranda br br one of the virtues that a great friend has is that you can never fully know them there is always something you can discover about their character a film production of the tempest of quality is thus like a visit to an old friend dear to one's heart each visit presents one with new perspective on the memory we had of the work with prospero's books the ritual and the elegance of the play was emphasized the exuberant celebration of art within the art here we see a vision as esoteric mysticism with lovingly crafted interiors full of candles and chalk on floors more aleister crowley than naples nobleman it also made me reconsider why was it that prospero was cast out of naples his magical power is so palpable in this production that it makes one wonder whether it was just politics that doomed prospero to exile but rather the fact of his difference from his peers so in the real world he suffered was cast out powerless to change the wrong to the right all of the villains in this play whether they realize it or not act in accordance to creating a more pain filled hell of a world it is always in the interest of the to make life on earth closer to hell but prospero manages to bring these terrestrial villains into his island the realm where he has absolute dominion br br shakespeare brings his audience to the theater the realm where shakespeare dictates the events the words the outcomes shakespeare is of course prospero but what this film adaptation does that really honors the text is to make prospero so sympathetic such a figure of reason despite the fact that he is surrounded by what society calls irrational astrological texts alchemical symbols magical etc is it more rational to be a man of the cloth and murder or to be a heretic and work towards the righting of wrongs prospero is a heretic for the reason he abandons his magic is not because the books will lose their value in naples but because they are not necessary anymore the world itself has become the magic of the books br br in hamlet hamlet presents a play to his peers the play accuses his fellows of conspiring against others for their own advancement the reaction of the audience varies while ophelia is puzzled claudius reacts with stunned shock this happens within the play and then shakespeare has this play performed for the men of his time did shakespeare watch for their reactions in the tempest prospero lives the play he is constructing and we live it with him how do we react do you react with simple delight at the happy ending are you upset and shocked by the strangeness of this production which is entirely fitting given the source material do you feel sad at the fact that this little life the play is rounded with a sleep as transient as it is eternal the tragedy is that shakespeare creates a paradise of reason and hope for mankind's life on earth but man is weak and unwilling to realize it in favor of petty power struggles we have br br like a good friend this film is not without its flaws i disagree with the choice to paint some scenes entirely in blue the dance of the is rather tangential but at the heart this is truly the tempest and one of its many faces
<START> i don't know why i even watched this film i think it was because i liked the idea of the scenery and was hoping the film would be as good very boring and pointless
<START> i first seen this movie like a year and a half ago and i loved it i decided to get the dvd last year for my birthday it has the right amount of suspense action and drama this movie is about prep school called the regis school and its packed with rebellious kids in which one kid william tepper sean astin has a hard time adjusting due to prior rejections from other schools cause they couldn't control his rebellious act and now at the regis school committing more acts of a rebellion there school gets taken over by terrorists on a random day and which the real reason is because the leader luis andrew divoff father has been sent to prison and the leader will do anything including killing the students setting bombs and so forth in order to get his father back br br along side william tepper is his rebellious friends at the regis school one in particular is joey trotta wil wheaton in which this guy holds a troubled past of living in a mafia family and being sent to the regis school because of hating his father for who he is and which now he must deal with these terrorists taking over the school so william joey and there friends must band together to stop these terrorists from violent acts and hazardous tactics br br this movie was really awesome and i believe people should notice it more because when people think of a good hostage movie they would say die hard and even though i would have to agree with them they need to recognize that toy soldiers was a good thriller it sure had my heart beating because the students are my age and i would be scared to confront terrorists like these if they took over our school but overall this movie is really worth a good 112 minutes of your time and if i had a decision to rent or buy it i would buy it i recommend it with a lot of hype 8 10

<START> ah the outer limits i love that show it was creepy or down right mysterious i loved all the genres of the show from horror to thriller to mystery whatever the genre it was good i guess i must have started watching way after it got canceled when sci fi showed it as re runs or played marathons of it it was a really good show i don't know all about the seasons and everything but i do remember that every time i saw the screen freak out and the voice on the tv say there is nothing wrong with your television do not attempt to adjust the picture i would squeal with delight it was a good show and i enjoy watching it if it would come on i give it a healthy 8 out of 10
<START> a research scientist is experimenting with human dna in an attempt to create the perfect human being his work has made it to the point where he can take a human fetus and accelerate its growth to that of an adult within a few days his latest creation is a spoiler omitted but side effects from the process spoiler omitted according to the dvd sleeve's synopsis br br embryo opens by promising the film you are about to see is not all science fiction it is based upon medical technology which currently exists for fetal growth outside the womb it could be a possibility or today according to dr charles m iii right and dr joyce brothers appears later at a party with roddy mcdowall br br first we see rock hudson as dr paul light a cigarette and drive recklessly watch that speedometer during a storm unfortunately he hits a dog mr hudson takes the wounded canine home he learns it is pregnant and manages to save the life of one of the puppies due to his experimental knowledge of fetal growth what this really boils down to is that hudson uses an experimental drug to grow the embryo so that it can survive outside the mother's womb the dog number one grows to adult size rapidly and is passed off as its mother br br hudson lives with his sister in law diane ladd as martha douglas since his wife nicole also a doctor died in another car accident ms ladd seems more emotionally stable about nicole's death than hudson who survived the crash that killed his wife things begin to get creepy when hudson's dog shows an intelligence level far above any normal dog then hudson decides to use his accelerated embryo growth on a human barbara carrera as victoria spencer br br hudson and the cast try their best but the embryo storyline is wretchedly absurd nonsense if you take away her silly opening and closing scenes ms carrera's valiant characterization almost works she might have been a bigger star if offered better films than this the infantile ending suggests a sequel but happily the idea was aborted
<START> legendary cameron mitchell turkey about an actor makeup man who is burned by the head of a studio when a drink is tossed in his face as he is lighting up a cigarette reduced to a scarred mess and wearing an eye patch mitchell works at the wax museum he also kidnaps and kills people using a solution which them so he can turn them into displays genuinely bizarre bad movie that defies description watch as the various wax figures try not to move watch as the entire tobacco out put for several southern states is as things just get weirder and weirder its an awful train wreck of a movie and you won't be able to take your eyes off the screen a classic bad movie that will amaze you even as it leaves permanent scars on your psyche
<START> i agree that this is one of the very best episodes of the entire series my only detraction would be the somewhat jarring appearance of mark as the commander my reasoning is this if you were not around for the first run of this episode then you know mr as spock's father and for the 2nd generation trekkie or trekker your preference it takes you out of the scene at first yet he's an excellent commander as well as opposite for our captain and this episode is strongly written and well acted by all there are excellent points made by both sides about the cost of war vs the price of peace and certainly does remind one of some of the best of the wwii and later era movies those are not my favorite genre but i certainly would recommend a fan of such to view this episode through that filter you'll see it holds up i'll never understand why sci fi gets so little respect the best drama comes out of placing ordinary people in extraordinary circumstances
<START> the james dean story is introduced as a different kind of motion picture explaining the presence of the leading character in this film has been made possible by the use of existing motion picture material tape recordings of his voice and by means of a new technique dynamic exploration of the still photograph the only tape recordings of his voice noteworthy is one short recording mr dean make while visiting his family in indiana he wanted to record any family recollections of his great grandfather cal dean intrigued because he played a similarly named cal in east of eden dean asks if cal dean was interested in art and learns the relative was an james dean was interested in art and had warm relationship with his family obviously that's the only 100 accurate revelation in this documentary james dean was interested in art and had warm relationship with his family br br an amazing screen test outtake from east of eden appears near the film's end it's a black and white scene between dean as cal trask and co star richard davalos as trask dean is at his mesmerizing best if this scene appeared only here and no east of eden film was completed this documentary would be an essential high rated film but the scene a perfect 10 in isolation should be considered an east of eden extra dean's traffic safety film is also worth seeing br br there are the expected interviews with family and friends my favorites were the guy lew going through a box of stuff dean left with him and dean's family there wasn't enough from aunt and the letter from dean to his little cousin was very nice more reading of dean's letters would have been welcome dean's unidentified writer friend seemed to have a better thesis for the film filmmakers might have considered developing it as a main focus br br robert altman's direction of martin gabel's reading of stewart script is dreadful what were they thinking perhaps filmmakers can be forgiven due to the closeness of dean's passing don't expect the james dean story at all this movie is more about dean's effect on people both the fans and filmmakers than the man it is very clearly an early piece of the james dean myth making legend tommy sands sings let me be loved the narrative refers to dean as he with a god like air the shots of dean's family seeming to know the moment he dies are truly wretched br br the james dean story 8 13 57 robert altman james dean martin gabel richard davalos
<START> this film directed by george who made so many excellent films is well up to his excellent standard it is crisp witty with some wonderful lines and has the inimitable ronald colman in the romantic lead colman plays the irresistibly charming younger son of a wealthy english peer he is financially irresponsible spending for instance of his last Â£20 in the world on a cute little terrier whom he names george but open wildly generous contemptuous of irreverent in the possible way and hopelessly sentimental he is so dashing that all the women fall in love with him his girlfriend is a star of the music halls and hence in 1930 a denizen of the demi monde played with her typical narrow eyed by the youthful myrna loy was not a great user of closeups and gals of that day had their faces half hidden with those awful clinging hats anyway so we do not get as good glimpses of the faces of the two heroines as we would like the director seems more interested in the charming colman anyway the romantic female lead is the youthful and fresh faced loretta young who had not yet become the proto julie andrews we generally know her as but was still a blushing girl exuding all the sweetness of a rose garden and laughing merrily and heartily the whole time it is obvious that a character with her terrific sense of humour was needed to appreciate the snob busting social anarchism of the refreshing aristocratic character played by colman the plot barely matters as is so often the case with these light and amusing films this is just such fun
<START> glen or glenda was edward d wood jr's first attempt at directing a feature film for this he chose a topic near and dear to his heart transvestism the art of a man wanting to dress in women's clothes to his credit wood tried to deal with subject matter that was largely taboo in 1953 unfortunately wood had neither the budget nor the know how to make the film br br the story opens with a prologue by bela lugosi that makes little sense and then moves to the discovery of a dead transvestite glen glenda daniel davis aka ed wood inspector warren lyle talbot with the help of psychiatrist dr alton timothy farrell tries to understand why a man would want to live and die this way br br glen is engaged to barbara dolores fuller and is reluctant to tell her of his obsession and that's it we see endless stock footage shots of anything from freeway traffic to soldiers landing on the beach interspersed with shots of wood walking down the same street dressed as either glen or glenda and looking longingly at women's clothes in a store window poor old bela who was down on his luck and befriended by wood keeps popping in throughout the story i'm not 100 sure but i think bela's scenes were added for his name value after the body of the movie was completed br br to add to the confusion of lugosi's narration farrell as dr alton also provides off screen narration lugosi keeps saying take care take care as well as some gibberish about snakes and snails and puppy dog's tails br br the story also deals with a transvestite who has a successful sex change operation and tries to explain the difference between that person and wood's character s the dream sequences are laughable a wedding sequence in which someone dressed as the devil appears is a good example wood also gives us an apparent rape scene with the actors fully clothed but leaving little to the imagination risquÃ© for 1953 br br this film along with wood's other classics were so bad that they became embraced by the public as cult classics over the years for that reason they have survived to this day
<START> the credits come from the sandy frank stitching job that was made to turn this movie into cave dwellers for re release now that that's cleared up oh excruciating eye gouging pain blade master leaps shamelessly on the sword sorcery bandwagon started by the conan flicks except the bandwagon never left the garage anyway as such this italian flick is a dud trying to rip off a box office dud with predictable results however this would give too little credit to the director and writers who make no effort whatsoever to maintain a coherent plot continuity any semblance of era accurate continuity miles o'keefe is no leading man now or forever tarzan the ape man proved that if ator didn't just an unlikeable picture and a chore to watch
<START> may contain spoilers br br this historical movie was so refreshing although it may be the actual events it does show the heartless nature of emperor which he was later infamous for and there wasn't a single computer generated person in it i think it's great that china has produce such an epic film the costumes and the settings were beautiful the performances were also excellent dignity vs death is a major theme in this movie and i think it reflects the chinese history and culture i also enjoyed a little allusion to the warriors a 3d map carved of the conquest of china with individual soldiers emperor of course later as entombed with his life size warriors br br i also enjoyed the scene with the dwarf he was a very interesting character even if he only had a small scene br br 9 10 br br
<START> i just watched this movie for the first time after finishing the book last week what's the problem here folks admit that the performances are great i mean lange is stellar and that the film is good looking but it's got less than a i don't get it come on the not that bad br br having read a lot of pulitzer winning novels and having seen a lot of the films based on them i think a better than decent job was done in bringing the screenplay together i thought the paring down of all the dialogue in the novel was executed almost perfectly this story had a pretty hefty amount of dialogue in it and the story really came through on the screen despite the fact that only a portion of it was used br br book spoiler part i was however a little disappointed in the ginny tries to kill rose being omitted i thought that was one of the more emotionally jarring parts of the book but it was probably a good bet to leave it out avid movie goers more than avid readers i think tend to be less forgiving of protagonists pulling antagonistic stuff it's apt to confuse johnny and joe sixpack br br if you loved the book you will like the movie if you hated the book you will likely hate the movie br br br br
