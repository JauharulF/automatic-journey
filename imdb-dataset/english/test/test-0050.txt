<START> other reviewers seem to have held this film in high regard for something made by an eighteen year old film student i would say bravo but that is not the case if you want to watch a good movie about stick to the documentaries it is filmed with the same quality as a digital home video the two main characters are dismal actors and once again that would be okay if this were a student film the plot follows a lonely artist who skateboards around portland writing he is joined by another and they skate around together creating art then comes the unnecessary gay love scene then comes the dispute between them that is never actually discussed because this film has about as much dialogue as a charlie chaplin picture this movie does show the gravity street artists give to their form well and the music is nice but overall i wouldn't really call it a film
<START> i love this movie though i don't like how they picture egyptians being an egyptian citizen myself that's why it earns an eight out of 10 br br the relationship between augustin and the leopard is awkward and of course because of loneliness and living in that cave for quite so long he develops a kind of insanity and passion to that leopard br br a very touching scene when the leopard dies watch reaction br br all in all i find it enjoyable and i'm looking forward to reading the short story by balzac
<START> i was intrigued by the nasty boss character as i am one myself and the actual boss's daughter was attractive and it was interesting to see an even younger ashton but this movie is so puerile i had to turn it off it was a waste of time to watch it when people started peeing all over the living room it was too much to watch painful awful crap movie if they had just toned it down a little are there really people out there that find it funny and like it i was relieved to know that imdb readers rated it so low the career side to the story was intriguing as well as the young man trying to get a promotion and win the bosses favor i liked that part also the opening scene with the coworkers on the train was cool as i like his characters if you can stomach non sense movies or you are pretty young then it might be one you can stomach
<START> the director does not know what to do with a camera too many options and she always always always picks the wrong one she let travolta take charge and he controls the movie from the beginning to the end the characters are not developed maybe because we need to watch them singing no pace at all sometimes too fast sometimes too slow miscasted travolta ok johansson she is too grown up to be a 18 even if she is really 20 br br the happy ending well it looks like that there must be one so the story is sad but not too sad travolta doesn't know how to play a guitar but the director doesn't look she cares too much that he is totally out of synch br br the idea is the only thing that is great but how she developed it well it is simply full of stereotypes and lines heard too many times br br too bad another missed chance
<START> this is actually a brilliant movie the story is grotesque but the actors are brilliant especially the performance of mads as is magnificent it's a simple story about two guys with an urge to make it on their own but it unfolds to a strange and absurd story with a lot of people accidentally getting killed and served up as chicken if only more people understood danish this could be a great candidate for an english version it is also worth mentioning ole who always delivers that extra twist to the plot with his slightly mad character i can only recommend this movie to the danish audience also take a look at adams 2005 a movie by anders thomas jensen also with mads accompanied by a well playing ulrich thomsen
<START> i truly fell in love with the characters they were very down to earth but each and every one of them had a hidden dark side sort of a mystery david himself was an enigma the secret fears and just secrets in general that he had there was a whole side of him that the other characters knew nothing about and it left the audience either wondering or assuming there was always a part of this man that he would keep hidden away yet he'd share a little of himself too he was the strong male lead character and i admire that type of character billy moses himself is an incredible actor who could do just about any type of part he's an amazing talent and a good man his fans love respect and support him endlessly br br since this show he's gone onto many other projects and has stretched his acting ability quite a bit more and quite well kudos to him and all the other actors from this show for doing such an excellent job i wish them all well i wish the series would've continued on it's such a shame it didn't
<START> at least it is with this episode here we have a time traveler the professor from gilligan's island no less going back in time to 1865 what does one do why try to save lincoln of course no really interesting variations are rung on this old theme as another reviewer has stated this episode is particularly drab and with little to suggest that the professor really is back in the 1860s budget limitations are readily apparent and the direction is stolid john wilkes booth adds a spark but it remains a very flat production we too often feel we are on stage sets waiting for something clever to happen there is a minor twist at the end but i emphasize minor
<START> this was a very gritty movie about anti semitism however unlike gentlemen's agreement that also deals with anti semitism the movie has aged well and doesn't seem heavy handed in other words it deals with the topic without seeming preachy or trite by today's standards br br robert ryan plays one of the most vile characters as he beats a guy to death just because he's jewish robert mitchum plays the investigator trying to get to the bottom of this crime br br i give the movie kudos for its gritty and unflinching look at hate it is in many ways an example of film noir even though the topic isn't about the usual gangsters or robbery
<START> what an awesome mini series the original completely stole me away from anything else that was on far more engaging than the american remake the original boasts an amazing cast formed of lesser known actors to north american audiences juliette binoche being the mainly recognizable actress who plays a drug addicted teenaged daughter of a government official but it's not star power that carries this film though i enjoyed the american version i felt it was dimmed by the famous americans in the picture br br unfortunately i saw the american version before i found the original bbc mini series of course there were no picture filters lush locales and the big name stars director however the grit and grime of europe through the perfectly compliments the impending sense of danger which permeates throughout this film the problems such as getting addicts off of drugs by giving them more poor anti drug campaigning and the resistance of foreign governments to assist with destroying their drug from within all make bold immersive and horrific all at the same time br br the truly incredible portions of the movie all come from pakistan my god i never knew how bad the problem really was over in europe even all over for a real education on the problems of drugs beyond how they affect the human body you must watch both this and the american version each show one very clear and undeniable fact those countries which are leaders in the eyes of the world have a culture that has led to the death and suffering for many br br drugs are worse than war they work in the shadows the dark secrets of any successful society
<START> first off acting is so terrible except for the actor who plays spencer cosgrove does not deserve her own show she should have stick with drake and josh the only person i like besides spencer is hes super bad he kicked crews and i liked it br br the episode i hate a lot is i hate that young fan she made me almost kill myself fake is a well word to describe this please don't watch this nothing on tv is good go with classics like family matters good show ban lets all go back to doug nick version only please don't watch i hate oh also nathan is a wannabee
<START> i would think that this was one of those films whose director hadn't read the book it was based on were it not for the fact that they are just slightly similar it is certainly possible for a great film to be based very loosely on a book and this was certainly the latter but not the former br br there were a number of flaws one was that it tried to be too much like the railway children probably because adults would expect this being from the same author another is that it also sought to be too like harry potter down to the music and in the setting i have nothing against j k or the films but the book is just nothing like the harry potter ones i thought the though very well voiced by eddie izzard and in character too was almost gratuitously in a totally inappropriate environment i may have missed something here as the comments made about one of the characters' own books may have been a reference to the inaccuracy of the adaptation there was also no need for the extra characters and today's special effects could easily have been used to tell the story as it was written but they weren't br br i saw this film with my two children one of whom knows the book and the other of whom doesn't the one who does know it thought it was all right but wasn't as enthusiastic as the one who doesn't i'm not sure what this means
<START> the movie is not as funny as the director's preceding and only other movie shanghai noon showtime did have its moments but it did not satisfy me why it needed to be so foulmouthed i don't know but i give showtime
<START> there was a time when the alien series was a success with even the third installment alien 3 showing promise under the guild of a fresh and young david fincher the first predator was a box office hit mainly due to its story in peak star arnold schwarzenegger and director john die hard the films alien aliens alien 3 and predator were all highly successful and created massive followings among general film fans and science fiction fans alike arguably predator 2 and alien resurrection should have signaled the end for both franchises but studios were undeterred and saw the opportunity to pander to the rumours among fans and combine the two step in paul w s anderson alien vs predator and now the brothers strauss visual effects graduates not even directors or writers the problem was that by allowing such profound and revolutionary creations of the sci fi genre to fall into the hands of firstly a mediocre director and now directorial has led to nothing more than profanity epitomised by incompetence upon witnessing alien vs predator requiem die hard fans will feel sick to their stomachs that this series could have got any worse br br one example of the cinematic deterioration of this franchise is in the opening scene and is likely to cause nausea among fans the film begins with an alien making its way onto the predator ship spurting from the predators chest growing in to a full grown and bringing down the predator craft which now seems to have far less predators on it than it did at the end of alien vs predator and all this occurs with the ship still in earths atmosphere once the ship has crashed quickly resorts to cheap plot methods and basic narrative conventions it makes no venture at utilizing any of the twists or subversions served up in the two original films the wearisome plot progresses with tedious pace punctuated only by the near rousing conflicts of alien and predator and when that runs the risk of boring us we are treated to either an alluring blonde in a bikini or rapid gunfire is plagued by an endless array of continuity errors and plot holes with little or no narrative elucidation i e members of the public an elite military unit or the predator not adhering to laws established in previous editions this is a film that has a complete disregard for its predecessors it breaks some of the most fundamental rules of a sequel and in doing so one gets the feeling that it is trying to set itself up as a stand alone feature independently the film has no heart no conviction and no soul and with reference to the other films lacks even the most basic continuity this is exemplified by the over arching narrative of the film as it undermines the basic premise of the first alien because if the species had been encountered before then those in the first alien film would have been more proficient and not so ill prepared when encountering them br br on a cinematic note the film is close to being dire i felt urged at some points to shine a torch at the screen the lighting was so bad through utilizing such gloomy and dark effects the audience may feel as though they are being cheated out of some the action Â which is ironically its purpose and also indicates the films lack of budget as with all science fiction one scene normally surfaces as being the most memorable in this instance it is probably the hospital impregnation scene as it ever so tenuously draws on the themes of the original alien by it the directing is poor performances weak and the script rotten is the product of a conveyor belt system of film making in which ideas and techniques are assembled by ineffective people and then the finished product distributed among cinemas this is personified by the absence of gory death scenes and drawn out blood battles because the certification will not allow it Â a lower certification achieving a larger target audience was purely a business venture and nothing more
<START> i throughly enjoyed this short even as a toronto maple leafs fan br br director sheldon cohen and narrator carrier captured all of the boy's emotions perfectly from the feelings he had for his hero maurice rocket richard to the excitement anticipation and hope of getting a new montreal sweater soon to the look of horror on his face when he got his sweater from his mother a toronto maple leafs sweater was priceless and the shame of having to wear this dreadful in his eyes blue and white toronto maple leafs sweater not the rouge bleu and blanc of the montreal with richard's number nine like his old sweater and worst of all his mum made him wear this maple leafs sweater out of the house you could envision and anticipate the ridicule he would get from his friends when he hit the ice wearing that sweater before he got there br br i was laughing the whole time and this is one of the best animated shorts i've seen br br
<START> admittedly you can put a model airplane against a black background and call it sci fi and thats enough to get me interested so if you are like that black horizon will at least get you interested before you watch it the best part of the movie is when they rehash some actual footage of a shuttle launch br br the movie plays like the naked gun series spoofing cop dramas with bad clichÃ©s and bad acting unfortunately i don't think they meant to be funny the actors really are made of cardboard the dialog really does suck so well just have to laugh at them and not with them br br on a side note it is rare to see a movie that takes place half in outer space half on earth and doesn't mix in the expected extraterrestrials and supernatural events i really do ache for more realistic drama based on our space endeavors
