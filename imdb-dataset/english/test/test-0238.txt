<START> excellent special effects make this disaster move very plausible one can see that the producers went to some trouble to get the displays on the computer screens just right it all makes it very convincing the sets are also very authentic looking a good choice of music rounds off the film nicely br br acting is good and the presence of david suchet adds some weight to the cast of course compared to other movies of this genre flood is right up there with the best of them thankfully the human drama aspect has not been overdone as is often the case with this type of movie the human suffering is portrayed in perfect balance with the actual flooding scenes br br and of course the movie confirms what many of us suspect anyway weather so often do not get it right
<START> army private gene kelly who's also a talented trapeze comes under fire for doing daring stunts without a net and alienating his high wire cohorts meanwhile there's an elaborate 'camp show' to put on for army soldiers and personnel and the whole studio of m g m has shown up to join in the fun mickey rooney plays m c introducing acts like kay kyser and his orchestra bob crosby benny carter and the m g m dancing girls who appear to be dressed as vegetables red skelton does a cute bit with donna reed and margaret o'brien but the other comedic bits suffer from an apparent vacuum between the performers and the allegedly live audience they're awfully silent until the editor cuts to them for exaggerated reaction shots judy garland sings an inappropriate song about a jumpin' night at carnegie hall improbably accompanied by classical pianist josÃ© iturbi whom judy calls the production is glossy but the manic energy feels false fabricated from
<START> when i know that walter will never grace another set i was in my 30's when i first saw this sweet endearing and unabashedly romantic film i loved it from the first scene and all the way through to the end art carney was his usual daft self glenda matched walter step for step in the witticisms and richard benjamin supplied the sarcastic voice of reason that he does so well along the way there were many actors whom we all recognize doing their usual brilliance there are a couple of lines in the movie which my so and i have used throughout the years but i won't say anything about them here i'm pretty sure you will know which two i am talking about just get this movie make some popcorn grab your squeeze if he is as sappy as mine is for which i am thankful and enjoy this standout romantic comedy from the 70's you will not be disappointed however i have the feeling that i am preaching to the choir here because anyone who loves walter will already own it i'm very glad it's out on dvd now finally
<START> 'the big came into my life complete by accident and has left an indelible mark on my soul a scar of love destruction and pointlessness that will forever be a part of my life this is tale of beautiful futility we are helpless without each other we are helpless against governmental wrong doings we are helpless as to the choices we all try to make when in love deaf to the mutterings and goings on of an world outside the window blind to an inevitable apocalypse dumb of the hatred and greedy opinions of an over indulgent society this is a tale of personal commitment and triumphant love defeating the ideologies of war their petty bickering is a sublime observation of human nature and of how love comes with it's pains and darkness everyone has some irritating aspect to their personality and this is observed by the makers in the most simplistic and fantastic way we travel only a short distance with the two main characters but are left wanting to complete our own journeys with a some of their simple loving honest philosophy in tow i am so very glad that i exist in this 'our time' another 20 years either side of my birth date and i would not have seen and felt the big snit william white sheffield
<START> of the two slaughter movies this is the better and even though its hardly a schindlers list in complexity it is bloody funny all the men are the goodies or the baddies and the women are all just and emotionally needy eg slaughters girl it is also bloody funny and the pro has got to be the funniest movie pimp of all time you just can't get enough of those hats purple suits gold chains and jive patois forever the best bit is where he has the harem around him going do you bitches everything about him is larger than life and it is of morris day in purple rain jim brown also proves hes a private dick for all the chicks and again he kicks whitey ass in every direction the car scene is very unrealistic that they survive it unscathed but hey this is the movies definitely the finest flick and it surpasses shaft 1971 even the first movie is pretty good
<START> i love lucy but this movie is so wretchedly bad that i was squirming in embarrassment for all concerned within the first ten minutes and it just got worse from there lucille ball's singing is downright painful and the attempts to make her appear more youthful through the use of soft focus had me reaching for my reading glasses it's bombs like this that give bombs a bad name
<START> this is a movie from toilet pictures if the name of the production company is any indication how stinky a movie is then this would be it i think i'm not really a fan of horror movies not that i'm chicken but rather this year alone i haven't been genuinely spooked by what's on offer so far be it from the west or from asia 9 56 is no different great premise but poor execution relying on clichÃ©d techniques i think these are the only tools of the trade available to try and elicit some heart thumping moments br br se jin ko so young is a lonely career woman who one day notices that some apartments in the block of flats opposite hers undergo blackouts simultaneously at precisely 9 everyday no she's no voyeur but a series of unexplained deaths in the neighbourhood including one which she encounters herself on a subway start to draw her deeper and deeper into the mystery surrounding these deaths br br with horror movies there's always a pseudo logical explanation within the movie about how the spooks come about that's just about the most interesting thing that happens in the film the of the truth although it won't take seasoned film lovers to guess the plot halfway through which of course makes it a very unsatisfying experience watching this movie br br there's a myriad of characters like the wheelchair bound girl and the neighbours who take turns to care for her as well as a schoolgirl detective a mentally challenged boy and a spooky train commuter but following genre formula these folks are there usually as fodder for deaths or in this case pointless red herring characters whose sole aim by the filmmakers is to mislead the audience nevermind if they convolute or add little to forward the plot br br and don't get me started on the techniques employed here quick cuts sudden appearances long hair ghouls so passe who can't move properly copious amount of blood like it flows down a mountain for free and the list goes on but credit to the sound engineers for creating some ear piercing bone crunching sounds used each time the spooks move though it seems like a one trick pony br br don't waste time on this even if you're a horror fan it's a complete waste of a promising premise and in the end you feel like you've just be taken on a ride a very long and painful one to endure it's high time for some innovation in this genre otherwise one film will easily look like another with ugly long haired monsters moving funny but with the ability to make sudden appearances accompanied by loud sounds oh and can someone oil those doors while they're at it as well
<START> when voting i was going to give a 2 but when seeing that 1 meant awful it hit the nail on the head the portrayal of native americans as blood thirsty savages is deeply disturbing to me this is the third film i've seen of d w griffiths where races of men are stereotyped in ugly ways the man isn't able to tell his side of the story so i'm going to try and keep away from attacking mr griffith personally in my opinion the three films probably influenced the thinking of millions of people and their children's children films like this probably made for many of the resentments that are still with us some may say the camera work was great the action a first for it's time the positives are far outweighed by the negatives it's like someone taking 10 from you and giving a dime back to make up for it
<START> this film has to rank down there with ed wood films a terrible script and bad bad acting br br a machine gun fight in front of plate glass windows minutes go by before anyone is hit and nobody has cover not one window ever breaks you'd think after a fire fight like that the big u haul truck might be riddled not a scratch br br do cia agents and government contractors shout top secret information at a stand up cocktail party with hundreds of people around br br there isn't one actor you care about everyone is shallow and basically unlikable br br a hawaii bound 747 flies out of los angeles and crashes twenty minutes later in the pacific in 100 feet of water a short time passes when the stewardess announces to the five other passengers they only have two hours of air left on a 747 br br the next day the rescue teams show up and amazingly the six passengers are still alive br br a movie that starts out mediocre and goes from bad to worse br br
<START> wealthy businessman bill compton played by dennis patrick accidentally kills his daughter's hippie boyfriend after an argument panic stricken he retreats to a bar and meets joe played by peter boyle a loud mouth angry bigot who is bitter over how his beloved country has become unintentionally bill allows joe to find out that he just killed a hippie and this is only the beginning joe is a classic film of an unlikely friendship a bond between two men one of a white collar background the other of a blue collar background bill joe have one thing in common they are disgraced over how crazy the world has become dennis patrick peter boyle have both given very realistic portrayals of their characters director john g with this pre rocky effort directs this low budget gem with the same finesse as a movie with a 100 million budget the script is loaded with excellent character development and very snappy realistic dialog in spite of its strengths this film does have its weaknesses the script falls asleep roughly 3 4 of the way through but it wakes up just in time for the jarring climax this film also features a very early and uninspiring performance by a 24 year old susan sarandon as bill's daughter melissa along with her hippie boyfriend frank portrayed very blandly by patrick mc dermott one could only be thankful that he was killed off early in the film in spite of its few flaws this is one of those forgotten films of the 70's that should not be even though joe is very dated to today's standards the chemistry between dennis patrick peter boyle is completely relevant today and it is the glue that holds the whole film together
<START> just about everything in this movie is wrong wrong wrong take mike myers for example he's reached the point where you realize that his shtick hasn't changed since his snl days over ten years ago he's doing the same cutesy stream of consciousness jokes and the same voices his cat is painfully unfunny he tries way to hard he's some weird type a comedian not the cool cat he's supposed to be the rest of the movie is just as bad the sets are unbelievably ugly and clearly a waste of millions of dollars cardboard cut outs for the background buildings would have made more sense than constructing an entire neighborhood and main street alec balwin tries to do a funny great santini impression but he ends up looking and sounding incoherent there's even an innapropriate cheesecake moment with faux celebrity paris hilton that sticks in the mind simply because this is supposed to be a dr seuss story avoid this movie at all costs folks it's not even an interesting train wreck i hope they'll make horton hears a who with robin williams then we'll have the bad seuss movie starring spasitc comedian trilogy
<START> a child like puppeteer for a public access children's show goes over the deep end when he discovers kids he entertains at a hospital were victims of horrible abuse this movie has some of the worst indescribably monstrous parents you could ever come across not an exploitation film as much as an afterschool special on the dangers of child abuse seemingly harmless mr takes matters into his own hands when it seems the police are neutered by lack of evidence to convict loathsome parents of their terrible abuse towards their children the children are emotionless and zombie like due to the amount of abuse inflicted upon them the parents loud inconceivably harsh contemptible and belligerent the mothers in particular are so obscene you'll root for their execution they are essentially miserable people taking out their frustrations on the kids our detectives are a tired lot frustrated with the whole judicial process how police procedure is often unable to prosecute those who beat their kids into submission while the crimes themselves are heinous the film doesn't explicitly elaborate the grisly activity on screen i'd say the reason to see this is for tom performance as the unbalanced man child who slips into psychosis there's quite a weird dinner table sequence between mr and his guardian shortly after he murdered the parents responsible for the death of their child regarding how he lives in a fantasy and how what he had just done has left an indelible mark notice the changes in behavior pretty impressive work going from innocent to creepy peter is lt hayes the detective in charge of the homicides cases expressing on his face the strain that is taking it's toll on him there's an early performance by john ashton as detective matthews always raising the ire of hayes because of his inability to follow directions not to mention how opinionated he is regarding the parents abusing their kids awkward laid back bluesy score that seems improper for a film such as this controversial conclusion establishing that even kids can only tolerate so much a bit too slow moving for my tastes but there's an effective use i felt of eyes before he takes care of business waiting patiently as he prepares to strike
<START> i loved that the mood was light and airy i loved that the lead character wanted guarantees about his future and that his roommate sets him straight of all people i loved that they tackled the dynamics of how the members in the men's group dealt with each other considering this was directed by a lesbian the whole theme of masculinity was put out there ridiculed dissected and questioned what makes a man what makes one straight gay or bisexual you aren't really sure if our lead character has decided on who he really wants he's living in the moment and thrown caution to the wind these and other reasons make me love this film
<START> a professional production with quality actors that simply never touched the heart or the funny bone no matter how hard it tried the quality cast stark setting and excellent made you hope for fargo or high plains drifter but sorry the soup had no seasoning or meat for that matter a 3 of 10 for effort
<START> i m in two minds about following the film debut of christopher nolan part of me admires it for costing 6 000 dollars to make but part of me hates it for being too art house in many ways it reminds me of the cult movie pi a film i disliked and i can t get my head around the central plot of a man who wants to be writer following people around wouldn t it be more logical for someone wanting to be a writer to sit in front of a keyboard and write br br oh well i guess following gives indie film makers hope that just because they made a no budget movie costing 6 000 over two thousand imdb members will vote for it and over five hundred members will comment on it but you have to wonder if this movie would be so well regarded if it wasn t made by the director of memento
