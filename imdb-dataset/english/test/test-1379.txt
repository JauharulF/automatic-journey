<START> i saw this movie when it aired on the wb and fell in love with riley smith immediately i would recommend the movie to people of all ages who just feel like being entertained and not much more i wish they'd air it again or cast riley smith in another movie
<START> worst movie ever seen worst acting too i cannot imagine a movie worse then this nothing to see no acting at all t hey actors should look for another job i cant't understand who was stupid enough to actually put money into this movie br br i'm sorry for eric roberts must be tough i cannot imagine how huuuge his mortgage must be to justify taking the job br br the ladies in the movie perhaps they better stick to xxx br br as for the leading man what a lead he better be put on a lead and stay there i can see him being more successful at barking rather than acting br br overall rating do not rent do not buy
<START> this is absolutely awful it's everywhere nowhere doesn't have any sort of point i have never understood what is good about jeff or sarah silverman bonnie hunt is so above this drivel she must have been personal friends w people involved because there is no way she would have read any part of this so called script thought yeah i wanna do that most movies i can find at least one or two things that are redeemable or funny there is zero of that in this it's extremely dumb there really isn't any other word to describe this this is quite possibly the biggest waste of money on making of film that i have seen in a long time skip this at all cost you'll be glad you did
<START> another winner from that 50s 60s era that i love so much for the comedic value they give with each viewing these days corman never lets you down with these films they take themselves seriously and they have very low budgets a recipe for good watching for sure ed nelson a very competent actor got started with corman as well as many other favorites who show up in superman and many of the westerns of the day the costume is pretty bad and the sound of the alien speaking well the reverb was a little off but thats the beauty of it film making for the love of it not looking for perfection just digging the action of doing it it comes thru these films are a fun time even better is the mst3k version
<START> stan as a bullfighter and a good one is quite a surprise usually overshadowed by oliver hardy this silent short allows him to take the lead and the limelight br br one can only draw the conclusion that his character was a parody of the many rudolph valentino movies of this era br br be prepared to laugh yourself silly at some of the dialog and keep an eye on the special effects br br i viewed this on dvd in a vol 1 2 collection
<START> i liked this movie not because tom selleck was in it but because it was a good story about baseball and it also had a semi over dramatized view of some of the issues that a baseball player coming to the end of their time in major league sports must face i also greatly enjoyed the cultural differences in american and japanese baseball and the small facts on how the games are played differently br br overall it is a good movie to watch on cable tv or rent on a cold winter's night and watch about the dog day's of summer and know that spring training is only a few months away a good movie for a baseball fan as well as a good date movie Â trust me on that one wink
<START> it's really too bad that john candy wasted his skills on so many horrible films delirious wagons east who's harry etc this one has maybe a few chuckles but it's mostly just really bad one liners and dumb physical stuff let's honor this comedian's memory by remembering things like planes trains automobiles and uncle buck
<START> the comebacks is a spoof on inspirational sports movies and let me just tell you it is not a good one tom brady the director probably found it hilarious that referencing sports films from gridiron gang invincible and even miracle to the longest yard and dodgeball yes dodgeball and tossing in a couple of sex jokes would be the funniest thing since airplane well he was wrong they did such a slipshod job you'd thought it was written in a week i have found it that if a director loves the genre the movie will be good obviously brady does not love the genre he is spoofing this movie is a rancid piece of garbage not worth viewing so don't see it
<START> this movie was a complete disaster for me there is one thing that movies must have in order to be watchable and that is some psychological credibility of characters unfortunately here this is not the case the main characters behave irrationally most of the time and even if they have some reason for such behavior it is not revealed to us by the director sophie character is particularly irritating making pictures of everything throughout the whole movie when one could expect something more rational for example meeting with her mother in the hospital and why exactly did she marry this guy no this is not a spoiler the plot at times seems like ripped off some soap opera and while the actors' performance is not bad this does not help much all in all i just could not find a way to connect with this movie not that i tried too much after the first hour though i have never walked out of cinema during a movie but this time was the closest in my life so far
<START> i realize the line on my summary is not too polite br br this film written directed by scott caan starring giovanni ribisi don cheadle himself runs a long 88 minutes br br there is a dog in this puppy of a movie he is cute br br the movie opened in 2 u s theatres in late april 2007 for one week grossed all of 914 it quickly went to dvd in early august 2007 br br we were only able to take about 40 minutes before we turned the dvd off br br this was the type of movie that played on lower half of double bill you saw the main film figured lets see what this one is like you might have walked out before we shut it off br br the 3 actors the young ladies in the film all have done deserve better than this br br ratings out of 4 54 points out of 100 imdb 4 out of 10
<START> don't get me wrong i've got a considerable soft spot for the works of charles band both as producer and director but you've got to raise an eyebrow when the man who was willing to put his name to dollman vs the demonic toys sticks a pseudonym on anything as a bit of bad movie fun head of the family is rather lacking although it is better acted than you might expect jacqueline lovell is a definite talent who deserves better than these kinds of movies j w is also quite funny as the titular monster though for such a being he does get hoodwinked quite easily y'know i'm nitpicking because the rest of the movie is so sharp and witty of course br br and having a lead character called lance nice one guys we didn't know you americans knew that piece of slang
<START> my one line summary hints that this is not a good film but this is not true i did enjoy the movie but was probably expecting too much br br adele who is solidly portrayed by susan sarandon did not come off as a very likable character she is flighty and irresponsible to what would be an unforgivable degree were it not for the tremendous love she has for her daughter this is the one thing she knows how to do without fail daughter anna is a sad girl who is so busy making up for her mother's shortcomings that she does not seem to be only 14 17 years old this of course makes natalie portman the perfect choice to play anna since she never seems to be 14 17 years old either portman pulls this role off with such ease that you almost forget that she has not been making movies for 20 years yet even with the two solid leads wayne wang never seems to quite draw the audience in as he did with the joy luck luck and even more so with smoke though i have not read the book the film feels as if it has made necessary changes to the story to bring it to the big screen changes which may drain the emotional pungency of the story i enjoyed the film for the fun of watching two wonderful actresses do their work but i never got lost in the experience and i never related to their plight
<START> classes tous is one of the best gangsters films noirs france has ever produced perfect cast lino ventura a young jean paul belmondo who made a bout de souffle godard's thing the same year marcel and a fine supporting cast brilliant script by josÃ© giovanni who also wrote le the same year what a year for him wonderful black and white cinematography by and taut action first class directing by claude sautet who surpasses jean pierre melville whereas the latter films gangsters movie with metaphysical pretensions which sometimes lasts more than two hours claude sautet directs men of flesh and blood and the presence of the two children adds moments of extraordinary poignancy which melville has never been able to generate and sautet avoids pathos excessive sentimentality the last time ventura sees his children coming down in the metro subway is a peak of restrained emotion br br ventura portrays a gangster whose die is cast when the movie begins he thinks that he can rely on his former acquaintances but they are all cowards we are far from manly friendship dear to jacques becker pas au which melville was to continue throughout the sixties sometimes abetted by mean women the film noir misogyny par excellence living in a rotten microcosm ready to inform on we are far from jean seberg's simplistic behavior in godard's opus br br works wonders with the picture the scene on the beach in a night when the two children see their mother die after the shoot out with the customs officers is absolutely mind boggling br br there's a good use of voice over which sautet only uses when necessary thus the last lines make the ending even stronger than if we have attended the scenes br br claude sautet had found a good niche and he followed the classes tous rules quite well with his follow up Ã  gauche 1965 which featured ventura again and made a good use of a desert island and a ship had he continued in that vein france would have had a howard hawks in his subsequent works only max et les 1971 showed something of the brilliance he displayed in the first half of the sixties he had become from les choses de la vie onwards the cinema de director who used to focus on tender hearted bourgeois in such works as cesar et rosalie 1972 vincent franÃ§ois paul et les 1974 or 1976
<START> this was a sad waste of two such promising actors chris klein's character was unlikable from the start and never made an improvement what did she see in him he was rarely kind never thankful for what he does have and a coward pass this one by on the shelves you'll be glad you did
<START> this particular title is very interesting the whole movie was like watching a ninja rpg which is really cool three magical swords three clans a horrible demon a political power has it all the animation is decent but a little grainy the story is top notch and the fight scenes are real cool one thing that really looks good in this movie are the monsters they are pretty freaky if you liked blood reign and ninja scroll is the one to see
