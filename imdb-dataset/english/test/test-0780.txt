<START> i do not generally appreciate light weight attempts at creating humourous stories which means that anita no el cannot score very high for me the story is good a middle aged but still good looking woman finds a new love but the attempts at making this film as a romantic comedy only managed at times to be somewhat comical br br rosa marÃ­a sardÃ  has ably demonstrated that she can be a serious actress in such productions as amic amat qv todo sobre mi madre qv las de petra von kant qv and el de shanghai qv however the powers that be have over the years dished her out a lot of trivial stuff for the cinema and for tv something similar could be said of josÃ© perfectly able to produce serious performances marÃ­a barranco belongs safely in this grouping br br such that in the end i was left with the feeling that i would be real pleased to see a new making of this film in a serious tone which would allow the actors to really show their performing skills and the curious thing is that it should be done with exactly the same leading actors wasted talent on a rather silly film that could have been very promising indeed
<START> hard to get in depth with this kind of stuff since there is absolutely no existing shred of even partial reason for watching it let alone expressing an opinion on it i don't know anything about this watched it for a laugh and stayed for the fake breasts apparently it's an unofficial sequel to 1982's slumber party massacre which i did enjoy as a fun slasher cheerleader massacre looks like a late nite soft core cinemax porno and not surprisingly chicks like nikki fritz and samantha phillips prolific t a actresses are in this plenty of nekkid hooters and not much else a group of 20 something high school cheerleaders two random guys and the fat stupid comic relief slob become stranded in the country and find a house where they plan to stay the night the recently escaped slumber party killer is in the area and begins killing them off there's no gore or originality and i wouldn't say the nudity is a real selling point since this is just about as boring a slasher movie can be absolutely terrible
<START> the film is not for everyone some might think the acting is bad when it is actually understated and natural there are no obviously evil acts and there are no stunningly beautiful moments there is a lot of indecision an lot of conflicting feelings br br actually this film takes a very honest look at a very complex subject sex with minors it is complex because the characters are trying to deal with love and sex when her body and hormones are still developing and both of their minds and personalities are still developing complex also because society has very simplistic views of sex with minors and complex because the characters don't know if society is right or if their instincts are right br br some will not like the movie because it leaves unanswered questions questions such as who was really in charge of the relationship who was damaged did good come out of it was it art who was damaged more did some of the problems with their relationship stem from it being forbidden by society did some of the problems stem from their own immaturity and probably most important was this truly a crime br br the film is resolutely neutral on all of this and it is this neutrality that is its strength it is the reason for the understated acting the simple sets the lack of background music soft lighting and the general flat presentation the message is clear we don't really understand this kind of relationship today and quick judgments are bound to be shallow
<START> with a cast of mostly lesser stars alain delon robert wagner eddie albert lousy special effects sure it was the 70's but alien and star wars came from the same decade and a storyline that is so laughable that one might want to cry this is a flight that should have been grounded br br even academy award winners cicely tyson and george kennedy can't keep this bird airborne br br the implausibility of the third film airplane is submerged in the bermuda triangle is much more believable than this turkey br br avoid the concorde at all costs
<START> this movie sucked the problem was not with the cast i think the cast was great lots of good talent lots of great acting but the script was terrible it seemed to be mostly just a frame work in which steve carrell could do his improv and that is what he does best but it just didn't work here the script was hard to follow the story was non sensical and scenes were random and lacked direction also much of the action was extremely contrived and poorly thought out it was a good effort but as max says they missed it by that much i am shocked to see how many glowing reviews there are for this stinker here on the imdb obviously the movie producers are getting people to write lots of positive reviews on their movies and fill up the entries on the imdb if you read the positive reviews and compare them to the negative reviews it is pretty clear which ones are genuine reviews from normal users br br this movie was full of problems and jokes that just didn't work i loved steve carrell in anchor man and i like his comedy and style but i will tell you that i never once laughed while i was watching this movie yes i had a couple of light moments a couple of chuckles but no real laughs nothing that struck me at all br br spoiler alert one ridiculous scene was when max had his hands binded on the airplane and he goes to the bathroom to try to escape he uses his special swiss army knife but instead of just using the blade of the knife he tries to shoot the binding with his miniature crossbow and as the crossbow miss fires and shoots little arrows into him over and over again almost putting out his eye max doesn't give up or try the blade instead no he just keeps shooting himself with the crossbow what was he really expecting to do with that crossbow it seemed to be the worst option on the knife to try to remove the bindings it just made absolutely no sense br br that is a good example of the typical circumstances in the scenes that made up this movie they were ridiculous poorly thought out poorly motivated and made of pure nonsense and that was truly distracting br br as i said this movie was a big let down and i recommend you avoid it a note to the imdb you should do something about these phony reviews that people are leaving it degrades the authenticity of the site
<START> fame was released in the u s a year before i was born i was too young to ever remember the original version of fame and yet i heard and read numerous things about it such as the fact that it spawned a tv series and that its soundtrack was led by the irene cara moroder hit br br fame was arguably the first of its kind to portray and showcase the world of performing arts in the form of a feature length film the lives the struggles the hurdles the students and some of the teachers undergo themselves were under the eye of the viewers br br the performances were great yet one which caught my eye in particular was gene anthony ray who played the troublesome yet promising leroy angry frustrated and at first rude his character later became less angry and frustrated and more committed to his studies not just with the practical in the performing but in the theoretical too irene cara was good as coco the scene with her taking her blouse off while some pervy director was filming her was rather discomforting to watch as well as paul for his amazing portrayal of a vulnerable but closeted homosexual trying to cope with life and on a performing arts school in new york after he had been kicked out of the military when he told them he was gay ralph played by barry miller was interesting but at times his character did grate on my nerves br br the choreography was excellent there were some good dance numbers involved and the 'hot scene in the cafeteria was worth watching another scene that was great was when the song was played and all the kids started rushing out into the streets of new york and danced wildly and without a care in the world it was a street jam like no other br br the only star to ever truly benefit from this in the long run was and is debbie allen she later became a producer director and star though she mostly worked behind the scenes on shows such as everybody hates chris and the fresh prince of bel air paul later went on to star alongside peter weller in the movie where he played a villain and e r as the judgemental obnoxious doctor romano br br british director alan parker shot this really well he allowed the performers to dance act sing to their hearts content without wanting to interfere with and affect their styles br br throughout the duration of the movie we see the various stages the students encounter during their 4 years from their auditions to freshman year all the way up to graduation in new york's high school for the arts br br fame is one of those movies which caters for or is aimed at a particular audience that isn't necessarily the general mainstream movie loving community it is definitely not for everyone br br i for one enjoyed it because i have an interest in the arts not technically in terms of being a performer because i am not one but as someone who appreciates that creativity and artistic expression can be through hard work commitment and passion towards what one does with their talents therefore if you are an aspiring dancer actor or just someone who is creative you might be interested in a movie such as this though whether the events in fame are anything like what it is in a performing arts college school in real life then that is a completely different matter altogether br br the 2009 remake of this movie was released recently and frankly it virtually pales by comparison br br as for the original fame almost 30 years on though yes it is a bit dated but it is still a great movie nonetheless br br it's not an outright classic but as a 80s cult classic in line with other 80s dance hit movies such as footloose and flashdance fame hits the spot isn't it a coincidence that all those dance movies begin with the letter 'f' br br gritty moving and intriguing this one is worth a watch
<START> i loved this movie br br movies and plays fulfill their purpose when they expose social political and other problems that affect the majority this movie served that purpose br br i identify with the plot and know people to whom this has happened at the time this movie was made concepts presented in this flick were advanced for the public yet had already happened to friends of mine by way of people in powerful positions and i know what it is like when people do to you what they did to angela bennett because they have done it to me br br i greatly enjoyed sandra bullock's portrayal of angela bennett ruth marx she portrays a pretty intelligent and witty young woman who has the courage to avoid giving up to overwhelming odds fight hard to keep her sanity and restore her life and try to protect those whom she loves losing her self concept and succumbing to that age old attempt to bolster a sagging self esteem by indulging in sex with a stranger added a poignant touch of reality br br the climax of the plot reveals the only real solution to this kind problem
<START> well this latest version of mansfield park seemed to try and take the edginess of the 1999 theatrical version outright copied some of the ideas from it in fact but tone things down a bit to bring it more in line with the original story unfortunately the result is a rather lackluster and schizophrenic production and as with all the other versions of mansfield park out there the character of fanny price is no where to be found instead there is a strangely child like bleached blond woman running around who never really fully develops as a character at least in the 1999 movie the character they call fanny price is firmly established as rebellious tomboy who is too clever for her own good this fanny price is a complete enigma someday i would really like to see a dramatization of mansfield park that actually includes a depiction of the character of fanny as she was written by jane austen a sweet kind compassionate girl with a timid personality and frail constitution she is reserved in manner and painfully honest but also strong in her convictions loyal extremely intelligent and remarkably astute a bit of a late it is not until her eighteenth year that she finally begins to make the transition from awkward adolescent to self possessed young woman and she wants nothing more in life than to be of some real use to those she loves most it's a wonderfully complex character that i look forward to one day seeing faithfully portrayed
<START> this movie is one of the worse examples of hype people who read imdb comments might be tempted to view this total waste of time as i was by false tag lines like a throwback to 80's horror and what not this movie sucks from the acting to the directing to the story horrible all across the board and i really like good horror films i am not at all a snob this sucked for reference i loved the grudge 1 and 2 black sheep planet terror texas massacre the beginning the others the ring jason x slither planet terror and really hated the ring 2 texas chainsaw massacre re make wolf creek the hills have eyes re make hostel 1 and 2 and this movie gore doesn't trump fun or originality
<START> here is a film which clearly banks on being marketed as exotica to audiences unfamiliar with its subject matter br br an attempted hybrid of fiction and document clumsily falls in between the chairs as a documentary on the one hand it is neither accurate nor insightful to realize its sloppy handling of detail one needs to go no further than the opening scene where it is quite obvious that the ultra orthodox protagonist does not know even so much as how to properly put on his more generally the tedious rote style presentation of details in this case of jewish ultra orthodox ritual is the role of a manual not of a good documentary the latter should provide an organizing principle a if you will for the viewer so that she may emerge with a better understanding of the viewed this clearly does not happen here as ultra orthodox ritual is being made even more enigmatic the director seems to have done a decent job explaining it all verbally during the film's release campaign cinematically however this is a severe case of stuttering as a fiction feature on the other hand it suffers from flatness of character simplicity of plot and bluntness of message at some points i felt i was watching a cartoon e g the wedding night consummation scene without going in detail into angles positions and dimensions well technically this could not possibly be a realistic portrayal of human sex savage as it may be br br there are no subtleties in this film the clever manipulation of hints stimulating the viewer's imagination and thought into taking an active part in the cinematic text which i believe is a mark of a good feature is completely absent on the contrary watching the movie i felt at times as being force fed again and again with the same already chewed up and way too obvious content it is indeed as director gitai himself put it in an interview an architectural shifting objects in space and then coloring the scenes with the appropriate emotions when called for and advancing the plot on its appropriate and predictable track but the spark that creative like dark spark let's not forget is supposedly a tragedy that which casts on a two dimensional screen the spell which turns it into an extension of the viewers world is missing without a trace perhaps a work of a visual engineer perhaps of an unsophisticated ideologue definitely not of a true filmmaker what i saw was a passion play for animated issues rather than flesh blood and complexities real people the acting by and large failed to transcend this directorial flatness of an idea forced at times even tortured into film one notable though relatively minor exception was that of the lady and the mother both played by the excellent and seasoned lea koenig br br it takes more than strict adherence to a winning formula namely a serving of exotica plus heart wrenching yet simple melodrama plus a popular agenda preferably politically correct to my interest buds the bottom line here all being said is that for a considerable portion of the movie i was simply bored in spite of the novel perhaps even pioneering achievement of using an ultra orthodox neighborhood as a movie set for which mr gitai and his crew deserve all praise i found way too hebrew for trite
<START> along with having minor flaws to it this film is a masterpiece and most definitely the best war film i've seen not the mention it's one of the best films i've seen in all genres i might have written this for no man's land before but now i think this one's better it's very sad in the ending and i almost cried after the two shocking scenes that came within 5 minutes close to the film's final br br performance as the main character was fascinating although he's supposed to be a rookie considering his age this film makes you think a lot makes you cry or at least gets you close to it and makes you hate any kind of war and political bs the flashbacks to the prison hospital make the film even more delicious br br one tiny flaw about the film is the non british accents of supposedly british people most of the british people on screen were actually british but how about the ones who are supposed to be british and speak with a foreign accent that really didn't fit into this adorable film but it's pretty much the only flaw i've noticed effects could also be a bit better but then again we all remember many films from one particular land that have tremendous fx and absolutely nothing else br br briefly this film is a total masterpiece and every single individual should see it if you want to travel to the czechoslovakia of 40's and if you want to virtually witness a tremendous amount of emotions at once this film is for you if you don't want to do those this film will make you want to do so
<START> as with all haneke films make your own decision don't be swayed by what you read and if you are interested in someone using the medium of film for their own unique ends see it yourself isabelle huppert is stunning in this film combined with haneke these two never pull their punches haneke reels us in with the lure of golden boy benoit but this is an anti romance as much as funny games was an anti thriller you'll have to force yourself to watch much of it and the catharsis is much more in the range of sustained anxiety than any kind of emotional release but it's incredibly nervy and thought provoking haneke continues to hold up a mirror to how western civilization is or has become people may turn their noses up at this but it's only taking what solondz did in happiness a few steps further while grounded in reality much of what erika huppert does can be viewed as emotional metaphor i'm not recommending it but i wouldn't dissuade you either it definitely divides people but given it's largely about repression that's no surprise
<START> i saw at a preview showing a few days ago and found it to be a thoroughly engrossing and enjoyable film the film is about a not so successful american actress who goes to india to act in a low budget film only to find herself stranded there when she finds on arrival that the film's financing has vanished along with the producers and investors a chance encounter with an indian film shooting nearby leads her to be hired for a small dancer role in that since indian films incorporate a significant amount of singing and dancing this is a problem for who has two left feet not to mention a personality so tightly wound up and thorny that she can hardly hear the music let alone feel it as prem the choreographer of the film advices her to do br br but prem the word not the person means love and prem the person not the word seems to embody that emotion in the way he deals with all around him whether it be his production assistant friends who introduced to the shoot the narcissistic and arrogant leads of the film or the bitchy and uptight herself soon under his expert tutelage and endearing treatment finds her feet literally and figuratively br br i must say a word for those not familiar with the use of song and dance in indian films unlike american musicals the story progresses through these dance numbers as plot developments unfold and character transformations occur in parallel with the dancing it should also be pointed out that indian dance is about a lot more than mere movement an essential part of it is the enactment of the dancer's feelings and emotions while telling the story of the dance this is the main purpose of the dance and the dancer br br that reaches this stage of accomplishment is demonstrated in a stunning dance number about midway through when while performing the dance she is required to do for the film within the film also expresses her love for prem it is an amazing performance by ali especially when one considers that she is not used to dancing in her films or emoting her character's feelings via dance it shows her skill as an actress as well as how much hard work she has put into the role br br of course no romantic film can work without a credible prince charming salman khan who plays the role of prem fits the role to a t even when it turns out that he is a prince not so charming he does not lose the audience's sympathy salman has been ruling hindi cinema sometimes called bollywood for many years now and it is worth remembering that his first leading role was also as prem he is completely charming sweet adorable sexy and vulnerable for those who have never encountered him on screen before be prepared to be hit with mega doses of sheer magnetism he and ali make a lovely pair and are as well matched in their acting as in their appearance br br will they manage to work out their problems it doesn't seem possible as we hear the last song of the film a lovely blending of fact and fantasy reality and metaphor the ending certainly took some of the audience i saw it with by surprise but they were left satisfied the songs are used very cleverly they are in hindi for the film within the film sequences and in english for other occasions but their meaning is always clear from the context and choreography br br is a very satisfying romantic comedy yes there is quite a bit of humor as well in it the indian locations and costumes give it a fairy tale quality befitting a story which can be likened to a modern fairy tale br br if you are or have been curious about indian cinema but were hesitant to try it this is an excellent introduction it captures the color and vibrancy of indian films not only in the costumes and jewelry which are quite impressive but also in the lively dances and world sound music br br if you are a fan of ali you should watch it for her excellent acting in portraying a selfish demanding high woman who nevertheless has an inner attraction that inspires the love of two men if you are a girl you will enjoy admiring lovely costumes and ogling her hunk of a leading man if you are a guy you can not only admire ali in her sexy costumes but learn from salman khan what it takes to bring out the loving heart even from someone as edgy as

<START> i especially liked the ending of this movie i really felt what the characters must have felt which i think is a mark of good directing i was tickled with how the new hire at the record store turned out great character development there even though his role would probably be considered minor br br i was also impressed that the entire film while dark in its subject matter was free from gratuitous nudity profanity and violence sadness sexuality and darkness can all be communicated often better by what is left unsaid but it seems that this is often unique to really classy films and actors kudos to the film maker for that
