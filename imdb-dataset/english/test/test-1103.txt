<START> this movie is juxtaposition of various super bad tough guy biker characters loosely connected but with no real storyline some of the scenes are nicely filmed if they took the same cast and crew and made a movie called the gent who was the coolest character in the film and came up with an interesting and continuous story maybe it could be decent as it is prepare for a lame series of tough guy character intros all of whom do nothing but ride bikes around the desert all day and cause trouble while all staying never getting and keeping their hair and clothes perfect and never needing to look for a home or money etc there was a sort of background story about the characters pasts various people that were killed and a treasure that was probably supposed to be the plot
<START> although i haven't seen it yet i know that chaplin is a genius and only someone of his talent would take on this daring subject matter a comedy about hitler all great satire is based on going out on an edge also all great comedy deals with the other side pathos this film seems like it will skirt both sides like kubrick's dr strangelove the great dictator deals with history through the distorted lens of satire the only way to deal with the horrors of this world is by laughing at it and hopefully through laughter we can learn to view the world in a new light another film that does this that comes to my mind is emir kusturica's underground and fando and lis so let me watch the film first
<START> i couldn't i was bored not just because the acting was terrible and the tragic story was simply a b movie whose plot was all about the cannibalism but the fact i was watching a subtitle foreign film which doesn't bother me at all but was still dubbed br br the special effects were awful as the back of the plane splits off you can see the model is hollow as it breaks away in the phony snow most of the movie takes place on a sound stage that clearly is not real and almost looks like a play as the sounds of snow blowing all over are heard but not actually scene br br but how what will they eat they have no food one military person it's never clear what this guy does or why he's in charge says which i'm sure no one ever said in reality or even thought about food since they were concerned if the people were alive not how they'd eat it was simply a stupid line written to point out that yes they will have to eat the dead bodies to survive br br when they finally decide to eat the bodies one man finds one shirtless body who despite being in the snow for however long is not remotely frozen in fact his flesh is very flexible and fresh he cuts the fresh meat off his back that again is not frozen or even cold it appears and this scene goes on for five minutes that's where i had to stop the remake alive was a far superior film about trying to survive in a horrible situation that i'm sure the real survivors praised whereas i can't imagine any of them had anything nice to say about this version it was simply about eating dead bodies and everything else was secondary avoid
<START> of all the episodes of all series this one holds the closest to roddenberry's original tenet according to the book the making of star trek in roddenberry's writer's guide to his story writers he states that any alien creature no matter how hideously ugly impossible to believe benign or malicious must hold some semblance of humanity that the tv viewing public can empathize with and or relate to devil in the which resembles nothing more or less than a large blob of cow dung is a mother protecting her babies those ball shaped silicon the miners keep finding throughout the mine passages and destroying because they have no idea what they are this is one of my absolute favorite episodes if only for that
<START> the three names that mean the most to this film are burt reynolds mark wahlberg and julianne moore these three deliver the strongest performances but the entire cast does a wonderful job the film although about the porn industry does not let itself get out of hand with it's own sexual premise on the other hand there were many scenes that involved drug use and although important to understanding the characters lifestyle i think there was some overkill in this department paul thomas anderson has not done a great deal of directing but he may have been picked for this film based on his 1988 work the dirk diggler story one thing that was brilliantly portrayed is the family like atmosphere between the characters as they work live and party together although not a typical family they certainly seem to care for each other the wonderful soundtrack really helps give you a feel for the period during a time when disco was the rage there are many disco favorites on it and some other wonderful songs as well br br the story is about a gifted young man named eddie adams wahlberg that gets invited into the porn industry he changes his name to dirk diggler and becomes and adult film star almost overnight jack horner reynolds is the director that takes his films very seriously as he believes his work is more than just pornography but that they are true art however dirk becomes overly dependent on drugs and soon heads down a dangerous road where he stands to loose everything although a greater focus is placed on the character dirk there are subplots for the other characters and their trials in life you will find yourself wishing for and hoping their situations improve all in all a well done film
<START> the ending made my heart jump up into my throat i proceeded to leave the movie theater a little jittery after all it was nearly midnight the movie was better than i expected i don't know why it didn't last very long in the theaters or make as much money as anticipated definitely would recommend br br
<START> lord david cecil wrote an interesting book in the 1930s early victorian novelists where he looked at the works of dickens thackeray eliot mrs gaskell charlotte bronte and emily bronte he selected these writers as the popular favorites of the first half of the victorian period and he explained their strengths and weaknesses as he saw them to the reading public some of his comments are quite relevant to this day but like all criticism it gives an idea of the spirit of the times of the critic's life as well br br cecil thought highly of george eliot mary ann cross who wrote about seven or eight books including sketches and poetry but for most modern readers they are usually acquainted with her shortest book silas marner which is still read in some high school curriculum the other books felix holt the radical daniel the mill on the floss adam romola scenes of clerical life are still in print penguin for example has most of them in print but are mostly unread the one of most interest today is her last novel where she discusses the jews in english society and an incipient pre type of zionism romola is her sole attempt at a historic novel about experiment of a religiously pure republic in florence in the her meatiest novel is which is concerned with english society in the provinces in 1832 the year of the great reform bill of lord grey i had to read in college for a literature course it certainly is a thoughtful book virginia woolf called it the most grown up book in the english language but it suffers like all of eliot's novels from one defect she cannot write livable exciting prose while dickens is overly exuberant at times and thackeray can become pompous and prolix and can become as lord cecil says very ordinary in his discussion and charlotte bronte can fail to explain certain relationships well and mrs gaskell seems best dealing with female characters all of them and emily bronte in her single novel hold the reader's interest reading most of eliot's novels is like trying to chisel sentences out of blocks of marble with a toothpick br br to date i have read about fifty pages of mill of the floss i notice that one of the other reviewers never finished the novel too but i have read a synopsis of what it is about the maggie and her brother tom are the central figures they own the mill in the title although close at the start of the story maggie falls in love with the son of a neighbor whose father is involved in legal difficulties with mr sr tom takes a dim view of this relationship and the tragedy of the story is regarding the split between the siblings culminating in their demise at the conclusion maggie runs back to the mill to rescue tom during a heavy flood and they die together it must have been a success with victorian readers but it is very gloomy and depressing to modern audiences br br the movie changed the ending a little maggie geraldine fitzgerald does die at the end with her lover and tom james mason notes their deaths at the conclusion in his record book the story is totally rewritten except for a double death in the flood at the conclusion it doesn't really help matters although fitzgerald and mason do pretty well with their parts they can't really pull the film up by their work alone the end result is a fairly minor film that fortunately did not hurt the lead's careers the only other thing to note is that the boyfriend was played by frank lawton who two years earlier played david copperfield as a grown up opposite w c fields lionel barrymore and maureen o'sullivan but then lawton never really had a major film career he just happened to always be around in pictures some good some mediocre
<START> this is yet another pseudo intellectual let's make the nazis look real bad movie the nazis were pretty bad no doubt most of already know that however that does not necessarily make every movie on the theme good a discovery channel presentation of the conference would have been much more interesting br br conspiracy falls on its ass between two categories documentary and drama it doesn't cut it as a documentary the movie is too and the presentation too it doesn't cut it as a drama the characters are too shallow and conflicts too easily solved' br br another thing is the tagline one of the greatest crimes against humanity was perpetrated in just over an hour as the movie shows the conference the meeting had nothing to do with reaching a consensus on the final solution the decision on the solution had already been taken by the ss the sole purpose of the meeting was to make all significant commit themselves to an already established plan there were no decisions or plans made at the conference there was only threats and some needed less than others br br finally one thing the movie does show although in no exceptional manner is man has a tendency to turn to culture and aesthetics in an attempt to hide for himself the fact that he is committing appalling atrocities this is seen in most leaders' and politicians
<START> a letter to the guys i tried guys i really tried i tried so hard not to watch this movie i would leave the room when it was on or jump on the computer when the wife watched it this is her second favorite movie the godfather being first which i love br br i ended up catching little bits of this movie and finally after maybe a year i was actually sitting down watching it with her i can't believe i am saying this but i loved this movie dalton plays a great rhett and has his cockiness down pat whalley plays a delightful scarlett full of fire and brimstone and nothing is going to stop her br br my favorite scene is when she is overseas in ireland and the government is going to tear down a house because they are behind in the rent scarlett gets all mad at this and pays the entire debt thus making a huge name for herself around this small town br br all i'm saying guys is you might want to try this movie especially if you are a fan of gone with the wind it does take a little bit to get used to the new actors but i think you will find them refreshing
<START> br br jurassic park iii adventure br br sam nell the dish william macy happy texas fargo tz a leoni family man br br a better title would be escape from the island of really mean dinosaurs but then no one would need to see the film in this sequel a rag tag group pays a visit to the island of dinosaurs to rescue the teenage victim of a hang gliding accident br br access hollywood reports began filming without a completed script that explains why the film seems to have little or no purpose other than to demonstrate state of the art special effects sure there are a few clever scenes and some moderately funny bits but no meaningful plot line to tie them together the dinosaur puppets and animation in are very good to excellent and more numerous than ever but the overall film experience can not hold a candle to the original jurassic park or even br br is a mercifully short 90 minutes the last 10 minutes of which is credits even at that i found myself frequently checking my wristwatch the audience i saw it with left the theater in silence br br a better bet see the movie legally blonde br br dave
<START> the audience sat in silence through almost the entire film with only a few rare occasional chuckles the character of maxwell smart was so inconsistent i felt whip lashed when it is convenient for the plot smart behaves like a master spy at other times he acts like an imbecile they lift many classic lines from the television series but they don't work in this version the classic missed it by this much is funny if it is spoken with attempted braggadocio by someone who is an obvious failure but it loses all humor when spoken by someone who is qualified to a slightly lesser degree many of the other characters move at a dizzying pace from skilled to cartoonish incompetent siegfried the main villain would seem to be intelligent but he makes decisions that make no damned sense at all still none of the characters in the film is as incompetent as the writers of this mess i am utterly depressed that so many imdb users think this was good
<START> following up the 1970s classic horror film carrie with this offering is like ford following the mustang with the this film was horrendous in every detail it would have been titled beverly hill 90210 meets mystery science theater 3000 but both of those shows far exceed this tripe this film was scarcely a horror film i timed about 3 minutes of gore and 90 minutes of lame high school hazing and ritual wow what a surprise carrie's weird friend commits suicide wow carrie misconstrues her love interests affections wow the in crowd sets up carrie wow the jocks have a sexual scoring contest what this film needed was way more action and far less tired teen cliches this film is totally
<START> sex and the city has some great things going for it the problem is that it's saddled with a number of negatives that really hurt the ultimate rating and review for its' six seasons br br the good things about is that a lot of the conversations ring true to life the romance stories are interesting and the characters are fun br br the bad things is that few women act like complete whores these four women have so many partners even going lesbian in some episodes that you have no choice but to roll your eyes at the utter absurdity men on the show are for the most part depicted as shallow degenerates liars cheats and buffoons the foul language these women use is far in excess as to what a normal conversation entails why do the writers do these things clearly to be over the top and to get your attention br br another thing that bothered me without spoiling is how some of the relationships ended they simply didn't ring real to me or to others i discussed this with br br but even though i gave the show 2 stars in the end i'm glad i watched the show i've actually watched every season multiple times i do recommend the show to anyone that won't be offended by strong profanity and soft core pornography i could have done less with the offensive language and the nudity and sex acts but the romance was very good and the saga ends pretty well
<START> reading the book i felt once again drawn into castle rock needful things being the final part of the rock trilogy and the plot was a variant on the demon comes to small redneck village type story king likes to tell the characters were all described in loving detail and it made both a good psychological and gory horror the film on the other hand is awful gone are the character interactions and clever plot and replaced by a story that tries to be exciting but misses by a mile if you haven't read the book then you might enjoy this else avoid at all costs as with most films of king's books
<START> a true masterpiece of the soviet cinematography it's a shame for the soviet union that was never given an opportunity to play in the western movies but then again she would probably never find herself there in she is unforgettable this was one of the few movies where i was crying br br in addition to and who are top rate it was a brilliant work of the director and the operator which made this movie an all time classics world wide just remember the scenes of piano music and proposal under the heavy german bombardment or the death of boris with a swirling sky above his head and his last visions appeared blurred in those skies the very simple means but the great technique added to the emotional weight mind you 20 years before the star wars 41 years before titanic and with a soviet budget
